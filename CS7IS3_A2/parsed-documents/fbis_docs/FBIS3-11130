During a news conference, discussing his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general, he indicated he has the support of 22 nations, which guarantees his election. He denied St. Lucia, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador had changed their opinion, adding that these rumors only seek to dilute support for him. The official reported having the support of the Central American bloc, Caribbean community, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Chile, whereas Venezuelan Miguel Angel Burelli has the support of two nations, and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, the support of eight. During a subsequent interview with LA REPUBLICA, Niehaus said Chile backs him. He announced he will try to meet with Brazilians and Uruguayans to try to get their endorsement. The foreign minister dismissed as mere rumors the reports that an international pressure campaign -- in which the U.S. Department of State is reportedly participating -- is forcing several countries to withdraw their support for the Central American candidacy. He noted, however, that manifestations of this strategy have been the "ridiculous" ideas that the Central American isthmus and the Caribbean want to have control over the inter-American system or that Caribbean islands are disgruntled over the banana problem. Niehaus indicated that many countries that have endorsed President Gaviria already feel uncomfortable with a pledge that will have a negative outcome. Further, the official said that on 28 March, after he is elected, he will visit the authorities of the countries that did not vote for him so that together, recognizing the will of the majority, they can work to make the OAS regain a protagonist role in fighting poverty and developing the entire continent. As for other pending matters, he indicated the main factor will be national unity regarding this candidacy. [Costa Rican] President-elect Jose Maria Figures gave the best example when he set aside his partisan stance and publicly endorsed him. Along these same lines also, the rumors of another Costa Rican candidacy were dispelled when former President Oscar Arias publicly backed Niehaus at the start of the campaign for the OAS. "Any other Costa Rican or Central American candidacy would break the existing bloc. [no closing quotation mark as published]
