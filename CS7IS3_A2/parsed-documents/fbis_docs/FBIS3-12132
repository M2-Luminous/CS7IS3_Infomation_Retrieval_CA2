The demonstrators, heeding a call by the Muslim fundamentalist-dominated student union at Cairo University, waved black flags and carried coffins draped in Palestinian flags. Leaflets distributed by demonstrators called for "holy war" in support of the Palestinians, and said the "Muslim holy places in Palestine should be put under the protection of a fundamentalist state, such as Jordan." They urged Egypt, the only Arab country to have a peace treaty with Israel, to break diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. The campus was ringed by security forces to prevent any violence directed at the Israeli Embassy, only two kilometers (1.2 miles) away. The Israeli Army said a lone settler, Barukh Goldstein, carried out the slaughter at the mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron Friday.
