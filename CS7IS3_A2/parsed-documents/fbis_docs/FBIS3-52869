[Dallul] The aim seems to be to hinder the process of reconciliation and fence-mending in Lebanon. Security organs have, for some time, been following leads in this case. We have identified certain people--manipulated from outside the country--targeting certain positions, including commercial businesses in Tripoli and Sidon and Lebanese Army, and, at times, Syrian Army positions. Such incidents began to happen in rapid succession, particularly in Tripoli and Sidon, aiming at certain targets in particular. Nor did they target only stores selling alcoholic drinks. They also selected targets of a special nature and belonging to members of certain religious communities in particular. We had to pursue the matter. Having followed numerous leads, security forces busted the bulk of the subversive networks. There has not been any explosions in Tripoli or Sidon since. [Correspondent] Don't you think that these explosions must be viewed within the context of a plan to destabilize Lebanon in the run-up to the al-Asad-Clinton summit? And what do you think about reports of attempts on the lives of al-Asad and Clinton and al-Hirawi? [Dallul] Talk about attempts on the life of President al-Hirawi is nothing new; it dates to 1991. I don't know why it is being raised now. I think that raising the subject at this point in particular is calculated to create a climate of panic and fear. As to why that is, the aim is manifold: For one thing, to undermine al-Asad's position ahead of his scheduled session with President Clinton, so Lebanon becomes a liability for the Syrian leader. For another, to deflect attention from the stalled Gaza-Jericho accord, especially given the fact that Lebanon, as a democracy, affords the right and regionally unmatched climate for the media to disseminate such reports. Third, the idea is to undermine Lebanon's negotiating position, especially after King Husayn of Jordan criticized the Gaza-Jericho agreement [as published] and the PLO and the way it handled the negotiations, and adopted Syria's and Lebanon's line. For us, this is a key issue. The U.S. line has, throughout, been to support Israel's argument that it needs a breather to absorb the Gaza-Jericho accord before progress can be made on the other tracks. The Americans were a bit doubtful that the Gaza-Jericho first option could advance without parallel progress on the other tracks. Our argument, and that of the Syrians', was that, unless accompanied by progress on the other tracks, the Gaza-Jericho accord, stood no chance. Now, the Gaza-Jericho accord has proved a losing bet. There is now a consensus on the need for movement on the other tracks. [Correspondent] Is it fair to draw the conclusion that the activities of these subversive networks were to counteract opposition to the Gaza-Jericho agreement? [Dallul] I don't want to divulge secrets just yet. However, the security organs investigating the explosions will before long reveal facts to the news media if they think it necessary. The explosions did not appear out of the blue. They destroyed business premises and other property, and were calculated to advance specific objectives. The circles with a vested interest in destabilizing and undermining Lebanon and al-Asad's position as the date for his summit with Clinton draws near, will go to great lengths to promote the interests of the other side. We are not pointing accusing fingers at anyone in particular. However, there are many forces that reckon they can use the Lebanese arena to advance their strategies. [Correspondent] A person has been killed and another wounded on the Darb al-Sim [name as published] east of Sidon. Reports say they are Palestinians and they were carrying explosives. Have you got any information about them and the side to which they belong? [Dallul] It is premature to disclose this information. Investigation and arrests are still under way. The issue is related to more than one event, and secrecy will benefit both the investigation and the issue. [Correspondent] Are you optimistic about the possible results of the 12th round of negotiations? [Dallul] Certainly, because the Syrian and Lebanese tracks cannot be separated. President al-Asad stressed this personally and refused to separate the liberation of southern Lebanon from that of the Golan. Regarding pessimism or optimism, Resolution No. 425 was issued by the Security Council and not by the UN General Assembly. I believe it constitutes a confusion and a setback in the Lebanese policy but not a disaster because we have a Security Council resolution. We went to the negotiations under the Madrid formula and after receiving letters of assurance from the sponsors of the conference, the United States and Russia, which dealt with Resolution No. 425 and its implementation. Were it not for this resolution, we would not have taken part in the negotiations. Hence, the issue is related to a certain mechanism that will exist. It is certain that the upcoming summit of President al-Asad and President Clinton implies optimism and lessons to be learned. In other words, the steadfast, rather than those who are loitering at the gates of the White House and the gates of embassies, always succeed. President al-Asad is the only leader in the world who meets the U.S. President in the middle of the road. This has not happened to any president in the world. All leaders support al-Asad, and the meeting is a victory for President al-Asad because he still controls matters despite reports and allegations that Syria and Lebanon are in trouble and that the Gaza-Jericho option has stolen the limelight and will lead to peace at the expense of the Golan and southern Lebanon. This is not true at all, and the upcoming meeting in Geneva proves that the weight is still here and not there. The Syrian and Lebanese tracks should move together to achieve progress in the Gaza-Jericho track. If the Syrian and Lebanese tracks do not achieve progress, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon fail. President Clinton will not come to a meeting unless he believes he can push matters toward peace in the Middle East. Otherwise, the move would weaken his position and not that of al-Asad, who is still steadfast and adheres to a certain position. Therefore, Clinton may have become confident that he can force Israel to offer realistic concessions or persuade it of such a need--concessions which are Arab rights and which the Arabs want to regain. Without these, he cannot attend any summit because it will be a big failure for his policy, in addition to his repeated failure in Somalia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, and other states. He also has domestic and foreign problems and he cannot afford another big defeat like this. If the Geneva conference succeeds, it will cover all his defeats because the results of the conference will be much more bigger than what is taking place in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, or any other country in the world.
