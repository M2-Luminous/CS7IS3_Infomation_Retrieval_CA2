This decision was taken after an explosion on the arms depot in Novonezhino, not far from Vladivostok, on May 14, which inflicted serious damage on the neighboring villages. Dubinin also stated that the Novonezhino depot would be eliminated and that he opposed he idea of turning the Maritime Territory into an "arms graveyard" (a large part of the ammunition stored in Novonezhino was produced in the 1940s). Commenting on the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander Georgiy Gurinov following the explosion, Dubinin said that this move would hardly influence discipline on the Pacific Fleet. "The government must pay servicemen on time and as much as they need. How can one talk about discipline when servicemen do not receive their salaries for months?" he said.
