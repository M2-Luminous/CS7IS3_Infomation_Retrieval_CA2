The request was made at a mass rally held at the Mozambique Railroad-North Square this morning. The rally was the highlight of the Mozambican head of state's visit to the province. Addressing more than 15,000 people, President Chissano said he will comply with the people's wishes and take part in the upcoming elections. Chissano said long before he visited Gaza, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, people from various political parties mobilized the residents to neither welcome him nor to attend his rallies. Chissano said the same thing happened in Nampula -- namely, in Malema and Lalaua -- where scores of people were seen in those districts a few days before his arrival. Those people stirred the residents, telling them, quote, Chissano will no longer come here because he is afraid. He is afraid because he knows we are here, unquote. Despite those appeals, there were large numbers of people wherever the Mozambican head of state went. They sang and danced, something that surprised the head of state because he knew the living conditions under which they live. Joaquim Chissano said a number of parties had said about a year ago that they had already won the elections in Nampula, Sofala, and Manica, and that Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] and Chissano would only receive a few votes in southern Mozambique. In the north, they claimed, it is their country. Chissano added: Frelimo and I have been welcomed in those provinces, but we have not yet said we have won the elections. It is the people who will decide who the winner is. We are going to work to win the elections, but meanwhile we will not claim victory like they do. The Mozambican head of state said it is the people who should claim victory because they are the ones to decide who will rule the country in the future. Like in other places where he chaired mass rallies, in the city of Nampula the president of the Republic once again stressed that the task of all of us right now is to uphold peace and national reconciliation, and to work hard in line with the principle of unity among all Mozambicans from north to south. Right now the Mozambican head of state is scheduled to be in Nacaroa, Erati District, on his way to Namapa. This will mark the end of his visit to the province. Joaquim Chissano left the city of Nampula for Namapa at about 1500. During his trip he met the residents of Nacavala and Namialo in Meconta District. He is scheduled to meet the residents of Alua in Namapa District. He is scheduled to spend the night in Namapa. Tomorrow morning he will visit the local rural hospital, which has just been renovated. Also tomorrow morning, he will chair a mass rally in the capital of Namapa District. Tomorrow afternoon the head of state is scheduled to cross the Lurio River thus beginning his visit to Cabo Delgado Province.
