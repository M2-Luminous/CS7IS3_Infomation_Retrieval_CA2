Domestic stability is constantly improving, the country's status on the international stage is being heightened, thus contributing to the protection of peace and stability in Southeast Asia as well as in the world. We are happy for your achievements, and strongly trust that the Lao people and the LPA will continue to record ever greater achievements, successfully implement the resolution of the Fifth Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and build a peaceful, independent, unified, and prosperous Laos. Also on this occasion, on behalf of the Vietnam People's Army, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the LPRP, the government, the people, and the LPA, for the fine sentiments and valuable assistance they had given to the Vietnamese people and the people's army during the past revolution as well as in the present rennovation undertaking. May the special friendly solidarity and the comprehensive cooperation between the two peoples and the two armies of Vietnam and Laos be evermore solidified and developed. I wish you, comrade minister, good health and happiness in your life, and more achievements in fulfilling your noble duties. My solemn salute to you, dear comrade.
