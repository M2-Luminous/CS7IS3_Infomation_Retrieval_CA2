The present spring campaign is no exception. According to the press service of the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan, Armenian armed formations are attacking in the Tertery and Agdam axes using artillery and armor. The same source asserts that the Armenians lost 50 soldiers and one tank in the offensive. But the press service of the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] Army staff reports essentially the opposite: The Azerbaijan Army is trying to push an advance in the northeastern sector of the front, but Karabakh subunits are holding up its attack. Both sides are suffering losses. One thing is clear: The front line is hardly changing. The May burst of activity in the Karabakh front was no more than the backdrop to the next talks, which began on May 4 in Bishkek, for a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh problem. Participating in them, according to the RIA, are a Russian delegation headed by the chairman of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and Chairman of the Federation Council, Vladimir Shumeyko, and delegations from Kirghizia and the Aland Islands (Finland). Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out the impermissibility of military actions between CIS countries and called on all politicians and military of the Commonwealth, upon whom the solution to the problem depends, to join the peace initiatives. The Azerbaijan side considers the actions of Armenia on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to be military aggression and demands their immediate cessation. Speaking on May 4, the deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Afiyandin Jalilov stated that as a result of combat actions more than 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan was occupied by Armenian armed formations, more than a million people had become refugees, more than 4 thousand persons were hostages, and around 700 populated areas lay in ruins. "In the long-standing conflict that has proliferated into war, both peoples are suffering, the Azeris and the Armenians," stressed Jalilov. He stated that he expects the signing of an immediate cease-fire agreement from the Bishkek meeting. The head of the Armenian delegation, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Babken Ararktsyan stated that Armenia welcomes any peace initiatives directed toward cessation of the conflict, but is against fruitless declarations that do not take the real interests of the sides into account. Representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh decided to air their opinions behind closed doors. I believe it to be symptomatic that it was on May 4 that the President of Azerbaijan, Gaydar Aliyev, affixed his signature to the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program in Brussels. Something else is symptomatic as well. By all appearances, a noisy trial is coming to a head in Baku. The former Defense Minister of Azerbaijan Rakhim Gaziyev is accused of surrendering Sochi in May of 1992. According to the Procurator General of the Republic, Ali Omarov, Gaziyev will be charged under three articles of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan and may be imprisoned for 6 to 8 years. Remember that at one time ex-president Ayaz Mutalibov was accused of losing Khodzhala. The fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh appears to have faded into the background, while both in Baku and in Yerevan they are much more interested in the political games surrounding it.
