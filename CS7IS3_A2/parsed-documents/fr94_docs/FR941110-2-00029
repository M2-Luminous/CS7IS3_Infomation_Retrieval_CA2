FR941110-2-00029 FR941110-2-00009 Comment 29: According to Timken, the Department should exclude below-cost sales in calculating profit for CV. Timken cites section 773(e) of the Tariff Act to argue that CV includes profit earned on sales ``in the ordinary course of trade''. Since CV is merely an alternative basis for determining FMV, and the Department disregards below-cost sales when sales form the basis of FMV, Timken asserts that the Department should not include any below-cost sales in its calculation of profit for CV. Timken notes that the Department recognized the need for this balance in Timken II and in Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States, 13 CIT 25, 704 F.Supp. 1114, 1124, (1989), aff'd, 901 F.2d 1089, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 848 (1990). Timken points out that in these cases the question was whether CV is properly subject to COS adjustments pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, which provides for adjustments to home-market price for certain types of selling expenses. Timken notes that the CIT held that adjustments were proper, given the functional equivalent of CV and FMV. Timken states that in Certain Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France, 58 FR 68865 (December 29, 1993), the Department recognized that non-arm's-length sales to related parties should not be included in the profit calculation for CV. Timken concludes that the same reasoning applies to below-cost sales in the home market and that the statute's reference to sales in the ordinary course of trade does not include below-cost sales when those sales are made in substantial quantities over an extended period of time. Citing section 773(e) of the Tariff Act, NSK argues that the statute does not require that sales below cost be excluded in the calculation of profit of the class or kind of merchandise under consideration. Koyo asserts that Timken's arguments run contrary to the statute and represent unprecedented and radical departure from the Department's past administrative practice. Koyo notes that the Department has recently rejected substantially identical arguments made by Timken in the most recent TRB reviews and the two most recent AFB reviews ( 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs, 58 FR 64728; AFBs III, 58 FR 39751; AFBs II, 57 FR 28374). Koyo concludes that the Department should reject Timken's arguments and continue its longstanding practice of including all home-market sales in the calculation of profit for CV. Department's Position: As noted by Koyo, the Department has rejected Timken's arguments that below-cost sales should not be included in the calculation of profit because (a) the statute does not explicitly provide that below-cost sales should be disregarded in the calculation of profit, (b) the definition of ``ordinary course of trade'' (section 771(15) of the Tariff Act) does not exclude or even mention sales below cost, and (c) the provision requiring the Department to disregard certain sales below COP in the calculation of FMV suggests that below-cost sales are not, per se, outside the ordinary course of trade. Therefore, in these reviews we have not excluded below-cost sales in calculating profit for CV (see, e.g., AFBs III ). Comment 30: Koyo objects to the Department's initiation of a sales-below-cost investigation on the grounds that the Department has acknowledged, and the CIT has held, that Timken's below-cost allegation in 1983 for the 1974 through 1979 reviews formed an inadequate basis for a below-cost investigation. Because the 1989 allegation for the 1979/86 PORs was based on the 1983 allegation, Koyo asserts that the later allegation is also inadequate. In addition, Koyo maintains that both allegations were untimely. Koyo points to section 773(b) of the Tariff Act, which states that the Department may initiate a below-cost investigation whenever it has ``reasonable grounds'' to believe sales of subject merchandise in the home market are being made at prices which represent less than the cost of producing the merchandise. Koyo maintains that Timken's 1983 and 1989 cost allegations were not company-specific and instead relied entirely upon references to public sources and, therefore, should be rejected. Koyo cites Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States, 575 F.Supp. 1277 (CIT 1983), in support of its position that COP allegations must be company-specific. Koyo states that despite the CIT's decision that Timken's allegations were deficient with respect to the 1974/79 PORs, Timken never attempted to remedy the deficiencies in its cost allegations regarding the periods covered by the 1979/86 administrative reviews. Koyo states that prior to the promulgation of 19 CFR 353.31, which requires all below-cost allegations to be filed within 120 days of the initiation of the administrative review, the Department examined the span of time between when Timken possessed sufficient information to make the allegation and when the below-cost allegation was actually made. Koyo cites Color Television Receivers, Except for Video Monitors, from Taiwan (51 FR 46895, December 29, 1986), which stated that possessing information 4 months prior to making a COP allegation was enough time to make the allegation untimely. Koyo states that the Department relied on these parameters in dismissing two below-cost allegations, one 10 months after the release of cost-of-manufacture data, the other 12 months later, submitted by Timken against NSK in the 1974/80 reviews. In contrast to the NSK situation, Koyo notes that the Department initiated a below-cost investigation of Koyo for the 1974/79 reviews based on Timken's 1983 allegation despite the fact that it was based on information that was available to Timken nearly two years before it filed the allegation. Koyo notes that Timken's 1989 allegation for the 1979/86 reviews was filed three years after the end of the final period covered by these reviews, and nine years after the end of the first period covered by these reviews.
