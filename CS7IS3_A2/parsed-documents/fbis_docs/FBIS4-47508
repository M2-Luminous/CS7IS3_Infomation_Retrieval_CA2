Verkhivker, professor, and A.S. Pindeyev and V.V. Kapliyenko, engineers, Odessa Polytechnic Institute; UDC 621.187] [Abstract] The operating reliability of the high-pressure heaters of K-1000-60/1500 turbine systems has been demonstrated to be inadequate inasmuch as the said heaters fail about every 3-4 years. The internal erosion of the heaters' spiral tube coils, which are made of carbon steel, and the resultant increased feedwater flow rates are among the main reasons for the heaters' high failure rates. In view of these facts, the following ways of improving the high-pressure heaters' operating reliability were compared in a technical and economic analysis: bypass part of the feedwater past the high-pressure heaters; replace the entire heat exchange surface of all high-pressure heaters every 3-4 years; replace the heat exchange surface of all high-pressure heaters with one made of stainless steel after the first four years of the heaters' operation; and install three parallel groups of three high-pressure heaters in all newly constructed units. According to the calculations performed, using a bypass for part of the feedwater past the high-pressure heaters to reduce the feedwater's flow rate is nearly 1.36-1.6 times less expensive than replacing the entire carbon steel heat exchange surface every 4 years. Switching to a stainless steel heat exchange surface is nearly twice as expensive as complete replacement of a carbon steel tube surface after every 4 years of a unit's operation. In the case of units that are in the process of being constructed, it is economically feasible to replace six high-pressure heaters with nine high-pressure heaters with a carbon steel heat exchange surface.
