Naranjo had stated that the Army commander in chief [General Augusto Pinochet] should resign. A few days ago Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo stated that the protests over the Army commander's trip to Europe prove that, quote, his crimes have not been forgotten, unquote. Naranjo added that Gen. Pinochet must resign. Press reports stated that the Army was annoyed by Naranjo's comments, which it regards as seditious. When asked about the issue, Army spokesmen said the institution is annoyed by the deputy's comments because it believes he used inappropriate language against Gen. Pinochet. The Army added that all this prompted Army Deputy Commander General Jorge Lucar to call a meeting of Army generals to assess Naranjo's comments as well as the media coverage of Gen. Pinochet's tour. The Chamber of Deputies president, in turn, said it will not tolerate any interference in the legislators' activities and announced that he will submit a request to the defense minister to clarify the case. [Begin Schaulsohn recording] I believe it is completely unacceptable that Armed Forces members deliberate and voice their opinion on legislators' performance. If the aforementioned meeting really took place and the comments really were made, they are openly violating the Constitution that establishes that our Armed Forces should not be involved in politics and expressly prohibits them from deliberating. The Army should order an investigation within the force to determine who was responsible for this political deliberation. [end recording] The subject also was discussed by the Socialist and National Renewal Parties' presidents and by Deputy Naranjo himself. [Begin recording] [Naranjo] I do not think this problem only involves Deputy Naranjo because the Chamber of Deputies on 8 June, with the support of the National Renewal Party [RN], deemed it necessary to check Gen. Pinochet's trip. [Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona recording] To be quite frank, the Socialist Party is not responsible for Gen. Pinochet acting like a teenager in Europe. [RN President Andres Allamand recording] We are in favor of complete honesty. Therefore, likewise we fully support clarifying what happened in Codelco [Copper Corporation]; we also are all for the Chamber of Deputies receiving all the information regarding this trip abroad that, moreover, was authorized by the government. We always have upheld honesty. But disclosing information on this trip has nothing to do with the hideous and usually rude language with which Deputy Naranjo refers to the Army commander. [end recording] Gen. Pinochet has been in Switzerland for the past three days. His presence in Lucerne has prompted protest in political circles. Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti stated that there is deep unrest in his country due to the Chilean military officer's visit. It was leaked that Gen. Pinochet also might travel to England or Brazil, and that he is scheduled to return to Chile after 20 June.
