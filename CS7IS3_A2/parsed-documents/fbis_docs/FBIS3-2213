The sources said government departments involved in drawing up the new policies are still busy applying the finishing touches. Auto makers and would-be investors at home and overseas are nursing high expectations in the belief that the policies would bring major changes not only to the industry but to the national economy as well. Two years ago, the central government decided that the automotive industry should be developed into an economic pillar. Since then the industry and government departments have been busy drafting specific measures for rapid growth over a seven-year period. Industry officials say that the new policies will direct financing to large manufacturing plants while letting unproductive ones go bankrupt. More than 120 independently operated plants now assemble motor vehicles in China. The sources would not elaborate on the impending policies because they have not yet been completed. Different government departments have brought different ideas to the table and discussions are continuing, said an official from the Ministry of Machinery Industry, which oversees car manufacturing. The official, who did not want to be publicly identified, did not say if there is a deadline for finishing the new policies. Many people had expected the policies to be announced by the end of last year. Observers said the delay may indicate major differences of opinion. Senior government officials recently sketched out the outlines of the new policies when they reiterated the principles for developing the industry. Among the key points are that: --The government will not authorize new manufacturing projects because too many plants now assemble small numbers of low-quality vehicles. A senior official with the State Planning Commission has said that under the new policies, the government will let inefficient enterprises wither in the face of competition. -- Government support is to be concentrated on large manufacturing plants such as the No 1 Automobile Works in Changchun, Jilin Province; a joint venture in Wuhan between the Dongfeng Group and the French car maker Peugeot SA; and Shanghai Volkswagen, a joint venture. The three auto makers now make the German-designed Audi 100, Jetta and Santana models and the French-developed Citroen ZX sedan. As for other auto plants run by the aerospace and weaponry industries and other sectors that previously had focused on defence work, their development should follow a step-by-step approach, the official noted. -- The government will not approve new projects that assemble motor vehicles with imported CKD (complete knock down) components. That means State support will go to existing auto makers that develop new cars by themselves or co-operatively with foreign designers. --The State must have a dominant position in the highly lucrative automotive industry. Last year, 1.3 million motor vehicles were produced, compared with 1.08 million in 1992. Sales in 1993 were 115 billion yuan ($13.22 billion), a big rise from 1992. -- Finally, auto makers should develop and manufacture small cars that ordinary Chinese can afford. The average urban worker in China earns about 400 yuan ($46) a month while monthly income in rural areas stands at 77.5 yuan ($9). The country has 1.17 billion people but only 8.3 million motor vehicles. About 1 million of all the cars and trucks in use are sedans, of which only a small proportion are owned by ordinary people. But as the economy continues to grow and personal income continues to rise, more people will be able to afford a car. In fact, surveys indicate that a growing number of ordinary people plan to buy a car in the near future. In Beijing, the number of driving schools has increased to 200. Just a few years ago there were only 10. Surveys show that tens of thousands of people are being trained at the schools. Not surprisingly, though, as demand rises so have the fees charged by the schools.
