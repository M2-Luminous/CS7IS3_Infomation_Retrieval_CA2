According to Cray officials, the T3D must lead the company to MPP market leadership within one year. First orders include Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom. [passage omitted, describing Cray T3D features.] Performance On some tests, the 128-processor T3D system was as much as four times faster than all other MPP products with up to 128 processors, Steve Nelson, head of Cray's T3D development program said; and continued that in these tests, and in operation at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), the Cray T3D system demonstrated latency of under one microsecond. Latency -- the time it takes for a processor to begin using data it has requested -- is key to overall MPP system performance and ease-of-programming, "current leading MPP vendors are in the 100-microsecond latency range, and are targeting the tens-of-microseconds range in the next two years," Nelson said. "For this key performance indicator, the Cray T3D system is typically two orders-of-magnitude ahead of current leading MPP products." Installations PSC has installed and accepted a 32-processor T3D prototype scheduled to grow in early 1994 to a 512-processor production system. Other early customers are NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) which has signed a preliminary agreement to acquire a 256-processor system in early 1994. These three customers will collaborate under Cray's Parallel Applications Technology Program (PATP), to develop targeted software applications for the T3D system. Further European customers are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the French Atomic Energy Commission, Commissariat a L'Energie Atomique (CEA). ECMWF ordered a Cray T3D MCA64-8, a 64-processor, air-cooled system. The T3D will be closely coupled with a Cray Y-MP2E system also ordered by ECMWF. Both systems are scheduled to be installed at the Centre's Reading, England, headquarters in mid-1994. ECMWF will use the T3D to develop new forecasting models that take advantage of MPP technology, and also to run the Centre's ensemble prediction package, used to generate forecasts provided to 18 national weather services throughout Europe. In Ensemble forecasting, meteorologists run multiple versions of a forecasting model, varying the data describing the initial weather conditions with each run. This computation-intensive technique is used to improve the accuracy of forecasts by determining their sensitivity to variations in initial weather conditions. The CEA Division des Applications Militaires [Military Applications Division] ordered a Cray T3D MC128-2, a 128-processor system that will be coupled with a Cray M92 system that is already on site. The system is scheduled to be installed in the fourth quarter of 1993 at CEA's Centre d'Etudes de Limeil-Valenton [Limeil-Valenton Study Center], near Paris. The French will use the T3D for research in fundamental and laser physics, and for electrodynamic and aerodynamic studies.
