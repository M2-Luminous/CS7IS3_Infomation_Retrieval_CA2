Replying to debate on his opening address he said the past four days had been the most exciting in the country's political life. "For the first time we have put all political conflict behind us," he said. The government of national unity had created the visible and tangible guarantee that there could be no chance for oppression or radical policies. Recalling the process of negotiations started with his first contact with the senate president and former minister of justice, Mr Kobie Coetsee, he also extended credit for the change to dialogue to a previous state president, Mr P W Botha. He recalled his first meeting with him where he had been received with dignity and respect. He met him again six months ago when he was again received with the same welcome, warmth and respect. "He telephoned me two days ago, not only to congratulate me on the inauguration, but on the work that has been done since then." In his early discussions with Mr Botha in March 1989 on the issues of violence, majority rule and reconciliation, he had said that the acid test for a future government and the ANC was to assure whites that majority rule -- not black majority rule -- would not lead to black oppression of whites. Furthermore, there had to be tangible and visible structures that guaranteed it. "We now have that structured guarantee," Mr Mandela said. The government of national unity had brought together a variety of political parties, making it impossible to implement radical policies. It compelled the government to develop a culture of consultation, to learn the lesson as fellow South Africans bound together by a common loyalty that men and women should see the issues that united them rather than those that divided. "The last four days have been the most exciting, the most unforgettable in our political life." The electorate had clearly made the right choice and he was proud to work with the men and women who constituted the new government. "Whoever started the process is of little relevance," Mr Mandela said. "What has been achieved has been the product of us all." In the past few days he had met the leaders of the so-called radical left and right. "I can assure you the spirit of these discussions have been most harmonious. I would lean backwards, go on my knees, for peace in our country." Nobody should fear peace or democracy. It was the correctness of the position from which one took decisions, careful thought and the support of strong and independent men and women which in all probability warranted the taking of correct decisions.
