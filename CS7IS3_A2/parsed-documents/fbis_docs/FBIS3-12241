"I believe that the Palestinian people should be afforded international protection as a matter of urgency until we are able to achieve security, stability and prosperity," 'Arafat told Greek President Andreas Papandreou, whose country currently heads the rotating EU Presidency, in his two-page letter dated Friday. The letter was written shortly after the assassination of 52 Moslems by a Jewish settler who shot his victims as they were praying at a mosque in the town of Hebron. "The massacre took place before the eyes and with the knowledge of the Israeli Army which has checkpoints and observation posts both at the entrances to the old town of Hebron and at the entrances to the mosque itself," 'Arafat told Papandreou. He added that Jewish settlers opposed to the ongoing Israeli- Palestinian peace process must not be allowed to endanger that process "and undermine the foundations we wish to lay for a new period of rapprochement, good neighbourly relations and cooperation in Palestine and the Middle East." He said that unless the controversial issue of Jewish settlements is resolved by the international community, there is little chance for peace. "I am convinced that you will wish to make every effort to remove the source of the crisis, for the settlements are one of the most dangerous threats to the progress of the peace procedure, indeed a threat of actual failure."
