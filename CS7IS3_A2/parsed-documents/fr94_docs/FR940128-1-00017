FR940128-1-00017 FR940128-1-00006 Several hearings on the sufficiency and direction of the Federal seafood safety program have been held in both houses of Congress since in 1989. In addition, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress for the stated purpose of establishing a Federal program of mandatory inspection of seafood. Different bills passed the House and the Senate in 1990 but were not reconciled before the end of the 101st Congress. This legislative activity has tended to reinforce the view that the public is placed at some risk because no Federal mandatory program for seafood exists. While this view is inaccurate in a number of respects, it is fueled in part by the notable differences in the frequency with which regulatory agencies inspect the processors of different types of flesh foods. As stated above, beef and poultry slaughterhouses are subject to continuous visual inspection under programs operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Public concerns about seafood regulation persist despite the recent increases in Federal resources and inspections for seafood. A major U.S. newspaper recently published an article entitled ``A Sea of Uncertainties,'' which expressed anxiety about the coverage of seafood inspection. ``The odds are,'' it observed, ``that the bit of fish you cook tonight got to your table without ever being poked or prodded or even glanced at by a government inspector'' (Ref. 30). No realistic system, however, could possibly look at every piece of fish. Moreover, in the current budget climate, improvements in the system for ensuring the safety of seafood will likely have to be qualitative rather than quantitative. Estimated combined Federal, State, and local outlays for regulatory activities relating to seafood are about $100 million annually (Ref. 31), but pressures to cut back funding exist at all of these levels. IV. The HACCP Option Thus, the Government must find new approaches to food safety that enable it to become more efficient and minimize costs wherever possible. A new paradigm is needed for seafood inspection, one that provides an ongoing, scientifically established system of intensive, preventive monitoring but that does not require undue resources. When faced with similar pressures, Canadian health authorities responsible for seafood safety came to the following conclusion: One of the key challenges will be to endure the scrutiny of the informed consumer and demanding marketplace *␣*␣*. The Canadian Government, as well as other western governments will be under constant pressure to limit spending as the aging population places more and more demands on services and as the Federal deficit is addressed. This means inspection programs cannot expect to have ever increasing resources to meet the challenges of the 1990's. Smarter and more cost effective ways must be developed to carry out their mandate. (Ref. 32, p. 502.) The ``smarter and more cost effective way'' chosen by the Canadians is HACCP. A. What is HACCP? HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control. Its application to food production was pioneered by the Pillsbury Company (Pillsbury) during that company's efforts in the early 1960's to create food for the U.S. space program. Pillsbury concluded that then existing quality control techniques could not provide adequate assurance that the food being produced was not contaminated. The end-product testing necessary to provide such assurance would be so extensive that little food would be left for space flights. According to Howard E. Bauman: We concluded after extensive evaluation that the only way we could succeed would be to develop a preventive system. This would require us to have control over the raw materials, process, environment, personnel, storage, and distribution as early in the system as we possibly could. We felt certain that if we could establish this type of control, along with appropriate record keeping, we should be able to produce *␣*␣* a product we could say was safe. For all practical purposes, if this system was implemented correctly, there would be no testing of the finished packaged product other than for monitoring purposes. (Ref. 33, p. 2.) In the succeeding years, the system devised by Pillsbury has been recognized worldwide as an effective system of controls. The system has undergone considerable analysis, refinement, and testing. FDA believes that HACCP concepts have matured to the point where they can be formally implemented for seafood on an industry wide basis. HACCP consists first of an identification of the likely hazards that could be presented by a specific product, followed by the identification of the critical control points in a specific production process where a failure would likely result in a hazard being created or allowed to persist. These critical control points are then systematically monitored, and records are kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are also documented. The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), which was established by USDA in conjunction with FDA at the recommendation of NAS, has developed seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explain this process in greater detail (Ref. 34). These HACCP principles follow.
