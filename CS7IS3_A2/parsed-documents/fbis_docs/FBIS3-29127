The senior officials, speaking shortly after President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed regrets about the collapse of the talks, said Washington may act against Tokyo by July. Meanwhile, Japan's Vice Trade Minister for International Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu said at a news briefing that if the U.S. takes unilateral punitive steps, Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). "We're reviewing all our options and will proceed promptly," a senior U.S. official said. U.S. officials emphasized that the U.S. will act before the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes its annual summit meeting in Naples in early July. The officials, briefing reporters on the Hosokawa-Clinton summit, declined to disclose the specific actions under consideration but said they range from unilateral to multilateral moves. While refusing to comment on whether U.S. trade sanctions are included in the U.S. options, a senior U.S. administration official said the threat of trade sanctions has been effective in opening foreign markets. He cited examples such as the threat to impose trade sanctions that U.S. officials said resulted in the opening of the Japanese construction market to foreign firms. The U.S. officials also said Washington will "reassess the viability" of the whole framework trade accord if Japan does not accept the types of "objective criteria" the U.S. has proposed to measure the progress of imports in Japan. Clinton told reporters after the summit meeting with Hosokawa that indicators the United States has proposed for measuring that the Japanese market is receptive to foreign goods include the level of imports, the state of domestic demand in Japan, exchange rate movements and efforts of U.S. firms to compete in the Japanese market. Japan has rejected the U.S. call for adoption of "objective criteria" as unacceptable, saying they amount to setting import targets and managed trade. U.S. administration officials said Washington will not reopen the framework negotiations unless Tokyo changes its position. The U.S. is not prepared to continue the negotiations "under the present circumstances," one senior U.S. official said.
