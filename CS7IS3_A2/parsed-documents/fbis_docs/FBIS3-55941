That Is the Verdict of the Russian Superior Court of Arbitration"] [Text] On the penultimate day of the year, a court of arbitration consisting of chairman O. Boykov and judges A. Kozlova and I. Polubenina published the main part of its ruling on a case in which the joint-stock company "IZVESTIYA Newspaper Editorial Office" was a third party. The protagonists were the Russian Federal Property Fund (old model) and the IZVESTIYA publishing house, which had been trying for nearly a year to secure a ruling that all directives of the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State Property] relating to the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial office to a joint-stock company are invalid. Their petition was rejected. Readers of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT, and several other publications will doubtless remember that last year from time to time they saw reports on the "tug-of-war arbitration" involving IZVESTIYA. Admittedly their authors, who still believe to this day in the primacy of the material world, represented the case as a primordial struggle on the juridical "carpet" over a piece of state property. But just before Christmas we received the full text of the Superior Court of Arbitration ruling, which states "that the subject of the present dispute is an act in the sphere of administrative activity, and not a property dispute over the use of specific premises." So the court confirmed that it was not a property dispute. Frankly, prior to the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet it was not a legal dispute either. And the events developed not so much "on the carpet" as "under the carpet." The Supreme Soviet was using others to fight on its behalf for the newspaper IZVESTIYA, while IZVESTIYA was fighting for its independence. Remember that first we totally won the case in the Constitutional Court. Then the same happened thing at the Supreme Court, which overruled certain points in the Supreme Soviet decree touching on the IZVESTIYA collective. In November the Russian Federal Property Fund totally abandoned its suit. We can only speculate what pressure had previously been put on the Superior Court of Arbitration -- the last hope of a vainglorious and notorious politician in his struggle against IZVESTIYA. Well, it seems we are all still here. The arbitration ruling declared that the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo, in issuing directives on the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial office to a joint-stock company, was acting within its powers. That is the main point. It can be assumed that the Russian Federation Superior Court of Arbitration has confirmed the legality of the formation of the "IZVESTIYA Newspaper Editorial Office" joint-stock company of the open type, and its existence for the past year and three months. The discursive section of the court ruling ends with a reservation: The conversion of the editorial office to a joint-stock company must not violate the publishing house's rights to the premises it actually occupies. Who is going to argue with that? Especially since it goes on to say, in black and white: "Where there is a dispute over specific premises, the dispute should be examined under the general complaints procedure between the editorial office and the publishing house." On the one hand this is reassuring -- the "general procedure" -- but on the other, does this really mean that as the Superior Court of Arbitration ruling enters into legal force we will only receive the right to be the protagonist and not a third party in the next court case? But time will tell. At the moment the IZVESTIYA editorial office is sincerely grateful to Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo expert N. Osokin and the lawyers of the law firm "Samsonov and Partners", who upheld the justice of our common case in the court of arbitration. One last point: The end of the proceedings in the Superior Court of Arbitration coincided with the start of the printing of IZVESTIYA at the "Pressa" publishing house's printing plant. This timing was no accident. But in order to avoid misinterpretations, let us explain: The move to the "Pressa" printing plant was motivated solely by technical factors, specifically the need (under an international contract) to continue to print FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA on our English partner's paper and our desire at the same time to produce the television supplement on blue paper. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the extra trouble for ourselves and some of our readers who did not receive the first issues of the newspaper on time. For which we offer them our apologies.
