FR940817-0-00030 FR940817-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB83 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Endangered Status for Lilium Occidentale (Western Lily) AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) for the plant Lilium occidentale (western lily). This lily is known to occur in 31 small, widely separated populations in sphagnum bogs, coastal scrub and prairie, and other poorly drained soils along the coast of southern Oregon and northern California. Threats to the species include development (e.g., roads, cranberry farms, buildings, and associated infrastructure), competition from encroaching shrubs and trees into lily habitat, bulb collecting, and grazing by domestic livestock and deer. Human activities have interrupted natural processes of bog and wetland creation and maintenance, so that there are fewer bogs in early successional stages suitable for this lily. This rule implements the Federal protection and recovery provisions provided by the Act for this species. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Boise Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4696 Overland Rd., Room 576, Boise, Idaho 83705.
