FBIS4-53490 "dreas097_d_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea * Pak Kwan-yong President's Right-Hand Man * Pak Kwan-yong President's Right-Hand Man 942C0106A Seoul WOLGAN CHUNGANG in Korean Mar 94 pp 165-175 942C0106A Seoul WOLGAN CHUNGANG Korean CSO [By reporter Yun Sok-chin: "Those Who Have Kim Yong-sam's Ears"] [Text] Whose word does President Kim Yong-sam listen to most in leading his administration? WOLGAN CHUNGANG polled 69 Chongwadae and National Assembly reporters covering the president's conduct of state affairs firsthand and at short range. Following is an analysis of the traits and backgrounds of those exerting mighty influence on the president, based on the findings of this survey (Editor's note). The survey found that the person who exerts greatest influence on the Kim Yong-sam administration is Chongwadae Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong. He is followed by Yi Hoe-chang, prime minister; Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi Won-chong, senior presidential secretary [SPS] for political affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS for educational and cultural affairs, in that order. Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], placed sixth. The poll showed Pak Kwan-yong "overwhelmingly at the top" of a list of public office holders with influence on the administration in general, as 68 of the 69 political reporters who responded to the survey voted for him among the top 10. As seen in "Table 1," 40 of them saw him as No. 1 in this category, 10 as second, and 6 as third. Thus, they unhesitatingly gave him higher ratings. In total points, Pak gained a whopping 599 points out of a possible 690 to hold a virtually incomparable lead over rivals. It is often said that "how often you open the door to the president's office determines the degree of your influence." Pak Kwan-yong, in his capacity as Chongwadae secretary general, holds a one-hour tete-a-tete with the president at 0700 every morning, giving reports and receiving instructions. It is seldom skipped. People say that the frequency of tete-a-tete is the indicator of influence, and we saw the truth of what they say in the fall of the commander of the Defense Security Command [DSC] of our National Armed Forces in his status under the civilian government. As late as in the No Tae-u regime days, the power wielded by the DSC commander was an almighty one; he often was in emulation with the Chongwadae secretary general and the director of the Agency for National Security Planning [ANSP]. This was because the presidents in the past had considered the DSC as a major channel of information and held a tete-a-tete with its commander on a regular basis. In the poll, altogether 50 persons were named at least once to one of the top 10 places but the DSC commander's name was not among them. Pak Kwan-yong's rise is not just because of the post he holds. He was elected to the National Assembly four times. As the record shows, he has political sense, which is a necessity for a Chongwadae secretary general, plus an outstanding ability to analyze and deal with matters, however complex. For instance, on North Korea as the biggest pending issue, he is an expert to some degree. In addition, he is deft in handling business. Notable more than anything else is that Pak, as Chongwadae secretary general, is displaying his superb leadership for harmony. He is playing without a hitch his role as the leader of the 50-odd members of the Chongwadae staff, including nine senior secretaries, holding them together in perfect cooperation to "assist the president." Outstanding is his ability to transform discord, predictable in the Chongwadae relationship with the DLP or the cabinet, into harmony whenever such tuning is needed. When President Kim picked Pak as his chief secretary, it was a surprise to the public. He is not one of those so-called born-and-bred Sangdodong [Kim Yong-sam's private residence] men. He had never been a Kim Yong-sam follower, and when Kim Yong-sam was an opposition leader, Pak belonged to a faction opposing him. He had never held any of the top three posts in the former Reunification Democratic Party [RDP]. At the time of the three-party merger, he belatedly became a member of the 15-man RDP negotiating team, as a pinch hitter for Yi Ki-taek, the present chairman of the Democratic Party, who dropped out at the last minute. That was about the highest party post he ever held. Nonetheless, Pak Kwan-yong beat other longtime followers of the president and became the "center fielder" in the core of power. The promotion was a superb pick by President Kim eliminating from the beginning every potential cause of dispute such as acts of arrogation and human walls. Pak functioned correctly as a Chongwadae chief of staff should to be deeply trusted by the president--and to emerge in the poll as No. 1 of the president's men. Of the top 20, as many as seven are Chongwadae staff members. Yi Won-chong, SPS for political affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS for educational and cultural affairs, placed fourth and fifth respectively, while Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, ranked eighth and Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, 12th. Pak Chae-yun, SPS for economic affairs, and Chu Ton-sik, SPS for public information, unexpectedly found their way to the list, in lower spots though, the 14th and 15th respectively. Of those who are not among SPS's, it is noteworthy that Kim Ki-su, director of the Office of Presidential Suite, made the list. Yi Won-chong, Hong In-kil and Kim Ki-su belong to the ranks of Kim Yong-sam men born and bred. Conspicuously among RDP men born and bred, Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u and former Minister of State Kim Tok-yong placed third and ninth respectively. They appear to be seen as exerting great influence on President Kim regardless of their official positions. Less than a year after his resignation as DLP secretary general because of a college entrance scandal involving his son, Choe Hyong-u was reinstated, as minister of home affairs this time, demonstrating his influence as the president's "right-hand man." The same thing can be said about Kim Tok-yong, former minister of state, who once was generally viewed as "Kim Yong-sam's other self." Except his seat in the National Assembly, he currently holds no office in party management. According to some observers, however, he will be named to an important post again when the time comes as President Kim hinted at his New Year's press conference by expressing his confidence in him. Kim Tok-yong had to leave the Administration because of controversies over his private organization and, for this reason, placed rather low in the poll for the weight he actually carries. But he is viewed as a darkhorse capable of a rollback to the top group at any time. So Chong-won, who succeeded Kim Tok-yong as minister of state, placed 19th. He is another RDP man born and bred. DLP figures are lagging a great deal in the ratings. The fact that even Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who is said to be entrusted with the "Yoido [location of DLP headquarters] administration," only placed sixth and behind senior presidential secretaries Yi Won-chong and Kim Chong-nam clearly shows it. Even that came after the president at the New Year's press conference bolstered Kim's image by saying that "party affairs will be the responsibility of the party chairman." It is an alarming development indeed. But for that comment by the president, what could have happened to Kim Chong-pil's ratings? Reporters themselves who responded to the questionnaire raised the same question. However, there is no question that in view of the "next" presidency, the chairmanship of the ruling party is always a powerful post and can by no means be treated lightly. The DLP could save face, so to speak, with Mun Chong-su, secretary general, and Kang Sam-chae, director of the Office of Planning and Coordinating, placing 11th and 15th respectively. Particularly conspicuous is Mun Chong-su's rapid rise. He is a "YS man to the core" who, in the days when Kim Yong-sam ran for the National Assembly as an opposition candidate from Pusan's West district, used to accompany him to his nighttime stumping, carrying a torch in his hand. The two beat Yi Han-tong, flood leader, and Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy Committee, both influential members of the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction, to place among the top 20 in the poll. This development can be explained by what is called a trend of political lineage prevailing over the weight of individual character. This means that Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae do not owe their rise to the party itself. Rep. Kim Yun-hwan, rather unexpectedly, placed as low as 18th. While it is unavoidable for him to act as leader of the TK [Taegu-Kyongsang] group whether he likes it or not, Kim Yun-hwan personally keeps a very low profile, presenting himself as a "person to be tested in light of the new era." But he is the man who contributed most to the DLP nomination of Kim Yong-sam as its presidential candidate, and it is only assumed that President Kim may not have lost his gratitude for the contribution. From the National Assembly, only Speaker Yi Man-sop was listed among the top 20. Neither Vice Speaker Hwang Nak-chu, a member of the RDP faction, nor any of the standing committee chairmen was even close to the 20th spot. Even in the case of Yi Man-sop, it was because of the weight of the office he holds as the leader of one of the three branches of government that he placed as he did. Thus, Yi Man-sop's case can be compared to an "ornament" carrying little clout, according to reporters' opinions. Compared with the party and the National Assembly, the poll showed the cabinet as exerting greater "influence" on President Kim. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang placed second and Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and concurrently minister of the Economic Planning Board [EPB], 10th. Also, Han Sung-chu, minister of foreign affairs, and So Chong-won, minister of state, respectively took the 13th and 19th spots. Yi Hoe-chang also represents another of one of the three branches of government. The weight of the office he holds, combined with his strong will as a fresh reformist, seems to have brought him high marks. Earlier, as the director of the Board of Audit and Inspection, he held fast to principle with his characteristic tenacity, and this was received with enthusiastic applause by the public. It should be noted that President Kim is, first and foremost, a politician relying on the masses and that the degree of his trust in a public office holder is generally influenced by how the latter is received by the public. Therefore, it is not impossible that, if Yi Hoe-chang's performance as prime minister should prove creditable, the president could bring him into politics through the 15th general election and have him set his sight on the next presidency, although it is still too early to say so. At any rate, Yi is a man of conviction and his conviction changed the image of the Board of Audit and Inspection in a short period of time; when President Kim put him in charge of the cabinet, we were able to get a glimpse of his style of personnel management. In this connection, attention should be paid to the rise of Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok whose unique individuality and conviction propelled him to the top of the economic department. Since its creation, the successive directors of the ANSP had held the levers of power, as one of them said "I am the power. I can ruin anyone." In the civilian government, however, ANSP Director Kim Tok placed seventh, indicating a measure of decline. He staged a close match with Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, sandwiched between them by a margin of less then 10 points. In the number of votes they received within the top 10 places, there were little difference between the three, all marking slightly over 40. Meanwhile, those polled were unanimous in saying that the seventh place for the ANSP director represents a substantial improvement from the initial days of the new government when President Kim unhesitatingly hinted at his intent to reduce the excessively enlarged power of the ANSP. Symbolic of it was his decision barring the ANSP director from attending cabinet meetings. In principle, that decision still is in effect. Nevertheless, President Kim, who recognized once again the importance of the ANSP's existence after he entered Chongwadae, is known to see its director once a week for regular briefing. He seems to highly appreciate the leadership of Kim Tok, who was a scholar before becoming the ANSP director. In view of the nature of the ANSP as an agency operating behind the scenes, its real status could possibly be higher than people think. Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, who placed 13th, especially attracts attention in many ways. An ex-prosecutor, he served as ANSP deputy director, then as assemblyman from the DLP national constituency. As the record shows, his career contained little that President Kim could appreciate. Nevertheless, he became the head of the civil affairs secretariat, an office that combined the functions of the audit and inspection secretariat and the civil affairs secretariat of the No Tae-u days. It was none other than Kim Yong-su who actually wielded--at working levels--the sword of reform and investigation which President Kim drew as soon as he took office. Whoever its head, it was inevitable for the office of SPS for civil affairs to increase its influence rapidly during the first year of the YS reform. The fact that, of the six secretaries directly under him, three are "Sangdodong men" tells how much President Kim did to prop up Kim Yong-su. The three are Kim Kil-hwan, first secretary for civil affairs; Kim Mu-song, second secretary for same; and O Se-chon, first secretary on audit and inspection. Also, Kim Hyok-kyu, governor of South Kyongsang Province, had served as second secretary on audit and inspection until two months ago, helping Kim Yong-su. It appears that Kim Yong-su's influence will continue unless the president slows down his reform program in the future. Another figure attracting attention is Yi Won-chong, SPS for political affairs. Since his days as an information secretary at Sangdodong, Yi has been one of those closest to YS, although his name was little known. They used to say that Yi Won-chong "can read YS' mind from the look of his eyes." When President Kim formed his first cabinet, he appointed Yi vice minister of public information in a surprise move, then senior political affairs secretary in less than a year, putting him at the top of senior Chongwadae secretaries. Yi Won-chong thus gained additional power and became a tiger with wings, so to speak. As vice minister of public information, he had attracted public attention as he exerted much influence on the administration. Since he has his place even closer to YS now, it would be interesting to watch how much more frequently the president will be seeking for "our Won-chong." It so happened after all that the "top 20 men exerting their influence on the administration in general" shows that the closer the individual's workplace is to the president's office geographically, the greater is his influence. Chongwadae secretaries are unquestionably ahead, followed by those in the Integrated Government Building on Sejong Street. "Namsan" [ANSP], further away, is that much more behind, while the DLP and the National Assembly, located across the Han River, have even less influence, the survey found. On the other hand, Sangdodong men are asserting their prominence regardless of where they are. One may say that "Sangdodong is in all its glory now." In the "political" category, they demonstrated their influence even more conspicuously. Of the top 10, only three--DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who placed 4th; Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, 8th; and ANSP Director Kim Tok, 10th--were non-RDP members. The rest were all Sangdodong men, a fact clearly indicating that it is not an overstatement to say that they are in control of the nation's politics. As seen in "Table 2," Chongwadae Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong again emerged at the top in the "political" division. Although he did not score as overwhelmingly in total points as in the "administration in general" division, 28 of the 69 political reporters put his name in the top spot. However, only 47 altogether voted for him for one of the top five spots. So, in total votes, Yi Won-chong and Choe Hyong-u were found ahead of him with 57 and 50 respectively. Most noteworthy in this category was the rise of Yi Won-chong to the second place. While 20-odd points behind Pak Kwan-yong in total points, he prevailed over Choe Hyong-u by more than 50 points, clearly reversing their positions in the "administration in general" category. However, as in the "administration in general" category, Choe Hyong-u led Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Rep. Kim Tok-yong by substantially large margins. Also notable is the advance to the seventh place of Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, whose office seems to be remote from politics. He strikes a good contrast to Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, who placed second in the "administration in general" category but eighth--next to Hong In-kil--in this category. In the Sangdodong days, Hong managed the Kim Yong-sam faction's difficult housekeeping; he is known to be unrivaled in the depth of rapport with the president. At any rate, it is another case demonstrating the power of Sangdodong men. ANSP Director Kim Tok received 24 votes, ranking last in the 10th, a fact unthinkable in the past. It would strike people even strange--as strange as the fact that nowhere in the survey did the name of the Secret Service chief arise. The ANSP and the Secret Service, known in the past as a hotbed of political intrigues, are thus being returned to where they belong in what should be viewed as a welcome indicator of political development. In the Pak Chong-hui era, Secret Service Chief Cha Chi-chol behaved as if he had been "vice president," while under President Chon Tu-hwan, it was Chang Se-tong, Chon's Secret Service chief, who was known to all as the "No. 2 man in power." Compared with those days, the Kim Yong-sam era Secret Service has changed immensely indeed. A general view of the "political" top 10 presents a fair mixture of Chongwadae secretaries, the cabinet, party executives and heads of the agencies under the president's direct control, seemingly maintaining a reasonable degree of balance. As said in the above, however, an in-depth analysis will unveil a virtual monopoly of power by Sangdodong men, prompting concerns about the lopsidedness. Critics say that at a time when improvement in the nation's competitiveness is an urgent demand, the larger the pool of talents, the better. In the "economic" division, the cabinet held a conspicuous lead over Chongwadae. As "Table 3" shows, Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and concurrently EPB minister, placed first by marking 291 points, while Hong Chae-hyong, minister of finance, came out third, and So Sang, minister of health and social affairs, fifth. Meanwhile, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry, was tied at sixth and Kim U-sok, minister of construction, shared the 10th spot. Moreover, if Han I-hon, EPB vice minister, placing fourth, and Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of Tax Administration, sharing the sixth place, should be included in an expanded cabinet category, the cabinet accounts for an overwhelming seven out of the 11 [including ties] listed in the top 10. A point common to all the seven is that they are ex-career bureaucrats and economic experts. Only three were picked from Chongwadae--Pak Chae-yun, SPS for economic affairs, placing second; Choe Yang-pu, SPS for agriculture and fisheries, eighth, and Pak Kwan-yong, secretary general, ninth. Perhaps because the economy requires expertise more than anything else, Pak Chae-yun and Choe Yang-pu are, exceptionally, ahead of Secretary General Pak in this category. Of the 11 persons, a surprise is the case of Yi Se-ki, DLP policy chief, who shared the 10th place. He is not an economic expert but yet was voted among the top 10 apparently for the reason that as chairman of the party Policy Committee, he is in the position of supervising DLP economic policies. Of the many self-styled economic experts in the DLP, reporters practically saw him as the only one who has any influence on President Kim. In this category, Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok, the number one in this category, and SPS Pak Chae-yun, the runner-up, give the impression that they were engaging in a see-saw game as economic experts representing the cabinet and Chongwadae respectively. The result was that Chong Chae-sok prevailed over Pak Chae-yun by 40 in total points and four in total votes, or virtually by a decision. This strikes a good contrast to the days of Yi Kyong-sik, Chong Chae-sok's predecessor. Pak Chae-yun, senior economic secretary, is a stubborn man with a style persisting in academic conviction, a factor having contributed to the consistency of policy and to its implementation. Based on that, he had worked as a behind-the-scenes adviser for YS since the latter's presidential candidate days, then played a leading role in drawing the 100-Day Plan and the Five-Year Plan of the New Economy. As a result, former Deputy Prime Minister Yi Kyong-sik was kept at a distance in the decisionmaking process on major economic policies, until the day of his retirement. He was, in effect, dragged around by Pak Chae-yun. If Yi Kyong-sik had stayed on as deputy prime minister, Pak Chae-yun would have, in all probability, topped the "economic" category list. However, the arrival of Chong Chae-sok--who rose to deputy prime minister and EPB minister only four months after his surprise promotion to minister of transportation--put on the brakes on Pak Chae-yun's one-man race. The "lack of experience in administration" and "want of political sense" was the weakness on the part of Pak Chae-yun; Chong Chae-sok had no such weakness. In addition, as seen in his unconventional speech and conduct, Chong Chae-sok could simply leap over what Pak Chae-yun would persist in in his scholarly fashion. This also enabled Chong to score higher. Choe Yang-pu entered Chongwadae in December last year when the post of SPS for agriculture and fisheries was created. Although it is too early yet for him to be appraised of his performance, his name apparently came up in the poll for the reason that he is one of the economic experts among the Chongwadae senior secretaries. A graduate in economics of Seoul National University, Choe is a typical agricultural economist. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Missouri and, after that, worked at the Korea Rural Economics Institute for 25 years. His extensive theoretical expertise is viewed as his strength. While Choe's administrative capability is yet to be tested, he served as the "mouth" of our government delegation in the 1989 Uruguay Round negotiations. EPB Vice Minister Han I-hon is a graduate of Kyongnam High School, President Kim's alma mater, who served as an economic adviser in YS' presidential candidate days. He is generally known to be a notch above Pak Kwan-yong, the Chongwadae secretary general, in reading the president's mind. On the start of the new government, Han was appointed chairman of the Fair Trade Commission and, while in that post, reportedly continued to provide advice and suggestions to YS as requested. It is possibly for this reason that he emerged as the only vice minister making the list, placing as high as 4th. The fact that Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of Tax Administration, a vice minister-level post, placed sixth seems to be the result of consideration that he is the head of a "powerful agency" rather than that he is exercising any policy influence on President Kim. Under the past regimes, the Office of Tax Administration had been called an "ANSP of the economy." Chu Kyong-sok, appointed its commissioner in the Sixth Republic days, retained the post under the Kim Yong-sam government, which is a rare case. And behind it is a school relationship--Chu and the president attended the same high school. Similar is the case of Kim U-sok, minister of construction, who placed 10th. He is neither an economic expert nor a minister of a powerful department; however, he once served as chief secretary when the president was an opposition leader. And political reporters apparently expected that he would be exercising influence visibly and invisibly. Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, placing third, Health and Social Affairs Minister So Sang-mok, fifth, and Trade and Industry Minister Kim Chol-su, sixth, are all among the top experts in their fields and, as such, needed by President Kim. However, it remains to be seen whether the president would still want them after the three quit their cabinet posts. Expert judgment is more in demand in the economy than in any other sectors. Perhaps for this reason, President Kim seems to value the views of ex-bureaucrats who have long experience. In the "foreign policy, national security and reunification" division ("Table 4"), it was a close match between ANSP Director Kim Tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu second, and Chong Chong-uk, SPS for foreign policy and national security. The three were all professors before joining the government, and people are rather anxious to know who of them really exerts more influence on the president. In this category, ANSP Director Kim, holding a monopoly on intelligence concerning North Korea, placed first, followed by an extremely small margin by Foreign Minister Han, whose overseas trips are exceptionally frequent, including visits to Washington over the North Korea nuclear issue. Scholastic ability is one thing and administrative efficiency for insight into North Korea issues is another. SPS Chong Chong-uk, whose ratings for the latter are not very high yet, was pushed to the third place after all. With regard to the exposed deficiency in the realistic sense on Chong's part, it is known that Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong makes the necessary intervention each time. When Han Wan-sang was deputy prime minister and concurrently minister of the National Unification Board [NUB], Pak Kwan-yong acted as mediator whenever differences occurred within the government's national security team. In the RDP days, Pak long served as chairman of the party special committee on reunification and of the National Assembly ad hoc committee on the same. As a result, he is known to be considerably familiar with North Korea issues. His fourth place, therefore, is nothing unusual. The fifth place for Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister [and concurrently NUB minister], cannot but be a natural one for his post. However, affected by the current status of the NUB, plus his own conservatism, Yi was found not high in this category although he chairs the government's national security team. The minister of national defense is limited in his authority; the impression of the post is that it is more for the implementation of policies that have been decided than for making the decisions. Possibly for that reason, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae placed only sixth. In the military government days, the chief of the General Staff of the Army and the DSC commander wielded considerably great power in connection with the security of the regime; under the civilian government, however, they were completely left out, in the same context that the Police Agency director, responsible for public security, was treated as irrelevant. Also noteworthy is that Hwang Pyong-tae, ambassador to China, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu placed seventh and eighth respectively with almost the same marks. As for the ambassador to the United States, it seems that his post was given due consideration under the circumstances that the nation is required to maintain close relations with Washington over "foreign policy, national security and reunification." Meanwhile, Hwang Pyong-tae was, in President Kim's Sangdodong days, so close an aide that people called him "No. 1 policy adviser" for Kim. Furthermore, Beijing, his present post, is the best observation point on North Korea, and he is assigned the extremely important duty of negotiating China's exercise of influence on North Korea concerning the nuclear issue. These factors seem to have led to the high marks. Interesting is the fact that Rep. Chong Chae-mun placed not 10th but ninth in the "foreign policy, national security, and reunification" division. He has successively served as chairman of the National Assembly committee on foreign policy and reunification and, as such, is duly recognized for his expertise. He belongs to the RDP faction and, moreover, he and the president share Pusan as their home city. So, it is quite possible that he will be exerting further influence in this field in the future. Based on what has been said, it can be concluded that Pak Kwan-yong, the secretary general at Chongwadae, is the man of super power only next to President Kim Yong-sam. He not only placed "overwhelmingly first" in the "administration in general" division but topped the list in the "political" division as well. In the "foreign policy, national security, and reunification" division, too, he placed fourth among the top 10. Moreover, he even ranked ninth in the "economic" division where he is seen as a layman. Thus, in the survey, Pak Kwan-yong emerged as the unrivaled, all-around champion by scoring a majority decision. The survey also clearly showed that those who are now wielding mighty power, including the secretary general, are mostly Sangdodong men. In particular, the results in the "administration in general" and "political" categories showed the following as the leading characters from Sangdodong: Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi Won-chong, SPS for political affairs; Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs; Kim Tok-yong, former first minister of state; Mun Chong-su, DLP secretary general; and So Chong-won, first minister of state. Among cabinet members, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Deputy Prime Minister and EPB minister Chong Chae-sok, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu surfaced as men of influence. The "team power" of the cabinet could not beat the "group power" of Sangdodong men. The survey also found that except the case of ANSP Director Kim Tok, the holders of other offices that had been regarded as the "seats of power" in the past--the prosecutor general, the commissioner of the Office of Tax Administration, the chief of the General Staff of the Army, and the director of the Police Agency--have been greatly reduced in their voice under the civilian government. This poll was conducted under the management of WOLGAN CHUNGANG. The questionnaire-based survey was made on political reporters assigned to Chongwadae and the National Assembly, including those of dailies, radio-television networks, and press agencies. It also included many reporters of local dailies but no foreign correspondents. The questionnaire sheets were distributed on 8 and 12 February, and altogether 69 of them were retrieved. The questionnaire was as follows: QUESTION: Of public office holders, who do you think is exerting most influence on the conduct of state affairs by President Kim Yong-sam? Please write in the names of persons you choose--10 names in the first category and 5 each in the other three categories--in order of importance, as indicated below: --administration in general: 1, 2, 3 ... through 10; --political: 1, 2 ... through 5; --economic: 1, 2 ... through 5; --foreign policy, national security, reunification: 1, 2 ... through 5. The "administration in general" was designed to get a general picture of those influencing the Kim Yong-sam administration. Considering the potential public interests nationwide in this division, the reporters were asked to choose 10 persons, one each for the first through 10th spots. Separately, the survey had the "political," "economic" and "foreign policy, national security and reunification" divisions because these divisions, while representing major branches of the administration, require expertise. For each of these categories, reporters were asked to choose five persons. In the tables below, "Overall Standing" of the person was determined by the "Total Points" he scored. First, the number of votes each received for each place was counted. As for points scored, a different weight was assigned to each place--i.e., 10 points to the first place, 9 points to the second place, and so on down to 1 point to the 10th place in the "administration in general" division. Thus, the maximum points was 690 in the "administration in general" category and 345 in the other three categories. The "Total Votes" indicates the total number of votes received by each and is unrelated to the "Overall Standing." Generally, the "Total Points" and the "Total Votes" were in proportion to each other, but they were not in a few cases. The significance of the "Total Votes" lies in the fact that the person cannot, after all, be left out in his influence on President Kim in the respective division. In the "administration in general" category, the respondents picked their top 10's and, based on the total points thus computed on them, WOLGAN CHUNGANG arranged the top 20 point-getters in order of "Overall Standing." In the other three categories, the respondents picked their top five's and WOLGAN CHUNGANG arranged the top 10 point-getters in order of "Overall Standing" in each category. The survey found that some names cited in the "administration in general" category came up again in other categories. Also, the reporters were asked to consider only public officials to prevent any unnecessary misunderstanding or irresponsible criticisms that might be caused by involving relatives by blood or marriage.
