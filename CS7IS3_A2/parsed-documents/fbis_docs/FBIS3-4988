As agreed last week after exhaustive negotiations between North Korea and the United States, Seoul announced suspension of this year's "Team Spirit," the joint military exercise with Washington held annually since 1976. Washington is to follow up with the announcement of a March 21 meeting with North Korean officials in Geneva, the third round of high-level dialogue, wrapping up a small package deal in a first-phase resolution of the nuclear problem. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu labeled these announcements as steps "enabling thorough inspections in North Korea, preventing a threatening situation and allowing room for a solution through dialogue." But he admitted to shortfalls in details that outwardly show Pyongyang holding more marbles after the game. "But let's look at the forest, not each tree. There are more optimistic aspects than negative ones," Han said. As things stood Thursday, the decision on Team Spirit's suspension and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks was conditional. Pyongyang must allow unrestricted access to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team. It also has to exchange presidential envoys with Seoul. The former condition is likely to be met easily. South Korean officials expect the latter to be fulfilled in one form or another. Pyongyang doesn't come right out and say it, but it fully understands that the envoy exchange is an absolute prerequisite to the March 21 meeting with Washington, Seoul officials insist. But their explanations hardly allay concerns that North Korea is succeeding in isolating South Korea from the nuclear negotiations. A high-level official in Seoul admitted that realistically, there wasn't enough time for both sides' envoys to make the visits. Seoul is thinking of sending its representative to Pyongyang first, around March 15, which may have to suffice for the demand on envoy exchanges, according to this official. Shortfalls in such small but significant items serve as bases to claims of failure in microscopics. But as the foreign minister says, looking at the big picture, the nuclear stalemate has turned back from the brink and is heading in the right direction. All concerned parties -- South Korea, North Korea and the United States -- will all keep on negotiating. Meanwhile, the more immediate task of nuclear inspections in North Korea can continue. Although pessimism lingers on the viability of the inter-Korean envoy exchange, officials here point the finger at Pyongyang for refusing to accept it. "Once the envoys do meet, they cannot but discuss inter-Korean matters," said Han in sounding a note of optimism. Besides, officials here reason, to break off the negotiations over differences on the envoy issue would be a serious setback for all concerned. There would be no IAEA inspections, no more diplomatic dialogue. One official goes as far as saying that "if there can't be a meaningful inter-Korean dialogue anyway, then it's better to at least secure IAEA inspections."
