Deng, 89, was filmed at a Lunar New Year's reception in Shanghai, the television said. The report of more than four minutes on the national evening news showed him looking frail, with a somewhat vacant look, and walking with difficulty, supported all the while by two of his daughters, Deng Rong and Deng Nan. The television said Deng spoke to local officials, wishing them a successful new year and predicting "new victories" for China. But the report did not give the sound of Deng's voice, merely reporting his message. The few words he spoke were apparently pronounced with difficulty. He also expressed best wishes to communist party secretary Jiang Zemin and called on communists to unite around Jiang, who is also head of state and touted by analysts as a likely successor to Deng, the report said. Deng also congratulated the people of Shanghai, China's largest city, for their economic success. China's media reported only four brief outings by the supreme leader in Beijing and Shanghai late last year, but no photographs or television images were shown. The official news agency Xinhua, in a dispatch marked "urgent", said Deng "exchanged spring festival greetings with local officials and retirees." Deng holds no official post other than that of president of the China bridge players' association, although he remains at the top of China's political power structure. He was spending his seventh consecutive Lunar New Year in Shanghai, China's biggest city. The new year's celebration, which is on Thursday, is the biggest date in the Chinese calendar, and the occasion for feasting and family reunions.
