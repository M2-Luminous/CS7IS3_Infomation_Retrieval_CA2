In addition, they will have a business breakfast with Spanish businessmen. Bolivia has started a program of state company privatizations in which the private partner will take total control of the management for an ongoing term and will be the sole owner of the profits. Spanish aid for Bolivia is another item on the agenda. Since 1989 Spain has granted credits to Bolivia worth $200 million, half of which have been used, while the rest is waiting for the Bolivian projects to be financed to be identified.
