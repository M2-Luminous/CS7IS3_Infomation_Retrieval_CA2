This is the firm stance adopted by Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who today met his Portuguese counterpart Jose Durao Barroso, who has emphasized his support for Spain in this area. Solana also referred to yesterday's attack on a Spanish airplane while flying on a United Nations mission. The attack took place over Krajina, an area controlled by the Serbs. Solana described the attack as very serious, and said that it is up to the international community to respond because this is the first time that a UN plane has been attacked.
