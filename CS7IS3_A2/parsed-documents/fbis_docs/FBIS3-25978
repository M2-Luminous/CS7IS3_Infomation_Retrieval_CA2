A New China News Agency (Xinhua) official has snubbed the offer on the grounds that it falls short of China's demands. The Xinhua official said Beijing still insists that the maximum debts for the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government should not exceed $20bn. The latest funding proposals would leave the SAR government between $20bn and $30bn in debt. The official maintained that the Government is still breaking the Memorandum of Understanding which stipulates that Government borrowing should not exceed $5bn without China's blessing. The Executive Council yesterday approved a new funding proposal which involves an equity injection of about $60bn into the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation. China has been angered further by the Governor, Chris Patten, calling the concessions a "new year present". The official, obviously upset by the Governor's remarks, said: "It is not his present. The money belongs to Hong Kong people." There was an indication that China may be willing to soften its stand, despite its initial harsh reaction to the proposals. The Xinhua official welcomed the Government's overtures, hinting Beijing may be willing to negotiate on the latest offer at a reconvened airport committee meeting. There has been no airport committee meeting under the Joint Liaison Group since last August. Beijing may also be willing to be more flexible on the sale of land along the airport railway. A spokesman from the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land Commission was cautious in his reaction. "The disposition of the airport-related land is part of the overall funding package of the new airport," he said. As long as the Government can assure China that the 62 hectares of land over the airport rail link stations will be sold in phases over the next three years, Beijing would not insist that it should be included in the annual land sale programme. China's official reaction has been echoed by Tam Yiuchung, a Pro-China legislator and the chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). He said that the Government's proposal would still not satisfy China. "Sixty billion might sound a lot, but it's only $15bn more than the Government had already agreed to inject into the airport in its last proposal," he said. DAB proposed last week that the Government provide a total of $89.2bn for the $99.2bn airport and related railway project. The Government is likely to face an uphill battle in getting Legislative Council support for the new airport funding proposals. The United Democrats' spokesman on the airport, Albert Chan, said his party will not accept a $60bn equity injection into the airport unless the proceeds from land sales are included. Chan said that this equity should not come entirely from the Hong Kong government, but also from the SAR government. Chan said that he felt that China's demands were "unreasonable" and that the Government had been "weak" in complying with China's wishes. Howard Young, a Liberal Party legislator, said his party would only approve a financial package affordable to Hong Kong. "We will examine very carefully if the amount of equity injection would have an adverse impact on social expenditure and public works," Young said. "We'll look at any plan in the context of Hong Kong's overall financial situation, its surpluses and reserves," he added.
