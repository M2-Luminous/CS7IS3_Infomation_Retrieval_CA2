FBIS4-31500 "dreeu112_h_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-112 Daily Report 11 May 1994 HUNGARY Uncertainty in Future of Compensation Coupons Uncertainty in Future of Compensation Coupons 94CH0268B Budapest NEPSZABADSAG in Hungarian 11 May 94 p 7 94CH0268B Budapest NEPSZABADSAG Hungarian CSO [Text] The uncertainty surrounding compensation coupons has been apparent for a while from the decrease in the coupons' market value. At the beginning of the week, the price of the instrument approached the 500 forint [Ft] limit, which corresponds to approximately 30 percent of the face value compounded by interest. However, on Tuesday, the drop in the value suddenly stopped, and the average price increased by Ft30. According to experts, though, if no adequate privatization inventory is offered for the coupons, the stop will only be temporary. According to State Secretary Tamas Sepsey, president of the National Compensation Office, if there is no adequate offer for the coupons, the current market value will remain. So far, compensation coupons were issued in the value of Ft110 billion, 30 billion of which have already been used, and Ft80 billion is waiting to be invested on the market. The claims for supplemental compensation "forecast" that compensation coupons will be issued in the value of another Ft20 billion. What is known of future offers is that a Ft750-million portion of the Antenna Hungaria company can be subscribed to starting on 16 May, property in the value of Ft3.9 billion can be acquired in the Hungarian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation at the end of May, and after 16 June, a Ft500-million package of stock in the EGIS Pharmaceutical Factory will be offered in exchange for compensation coupons. The palette of exchange offers also includes the Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical Products Corporation, the Hungarian General Forwarding Enterprise [Masped] and the Golden Spider [Aranypok textile retail chain], as well as the Hajdu Dairy Products, Hajdu Grain Products, and Hajdu Bakeries companies. According to Tamas Sepsey, the land auctions can be concluded by the end of May, by the time the extended deadline expires, with the exception of Szabolcs-Szatmar, Bacs-Kiskun, and Csongrad counties. Incidentally, the auctions of state-owned land will only begin in September. Coupons can be bought for less than 60 percent of face value only if families need the money to buy food, we heard from people who tried to buy coupons through classified ads in Szombathely. This opinion is backed by the findings of the local office of the State Property Agency, according to which people carefully consider selling even at face value. According to local experts, the drop in the market value is due to seasonal fluctuations: In the slow summer season last year it was possible to buy compensation coupons for as little as 40 percent; according to forecasts this year, the market value is expected to be below 50 percent. In Miskolc, many ads appeared in the newspapers offering 100 percent for compensation coupons. In some stores, the coupons are also exchanged at face value instead of the daily market value. In spite of the deteriorating market value, many people feel that compensation coupons are worth keeping, because sooner or later the trend will be reversed. In Szabolcs-Szatmar county, the best deal was offered at the land auctions. For instance, in Nagyecsed, as much as Ft1,200-1,500 was paid in cash for Ft1,000 coupons, while "on paper" the original owner, in whose name the bids were made, remained. According to Laszlo Bekesi, economic specialist of the Hungarian Socialist Party, compensation must be completed as soon as possible. State property intended for privatization must be offered in exchange for the coupons, creating a portfolio which would exclude property the sale of which could involve capital as well. The acceleration of compensation could propel inflation to some extent, but in his opinion, this would still cause less damage than dragging out the process. The shareholding program for small investors already involves an obligation of Ft100 billion for the new government. The Socialists do not plan retroactive changes if they get into a position to govern, but they would immediately close down the program for small investors because they consider this form of property distribution, which was started as a campaign tool, extremely damaging.
