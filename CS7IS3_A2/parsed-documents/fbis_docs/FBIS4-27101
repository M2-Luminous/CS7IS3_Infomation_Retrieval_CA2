He said: A working negotiation was held in Pyongyang from May 25 to 27 between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station. The main question discussed at the negotiation was the method of preserving the technical possibilities of the measurement of spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case the DPRK undergoes routine and ad hoc inspections with a package solution of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United States in the future. As has been reported, we are refueling the reactor in a unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Under this condition, we cannot allow routine and ad hoc inspections by the agency. But we have clarified our stand of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of safeguards corresponding to our unique status and for replacing fuel rods in such a manner as to preserve technical possibilities of selected measurement of fuel rods in the future. The United States, the main party concerned with the solution of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as encouraging and expressed to us the hope that we would discuss its method with the agency. At the negotiation, the agency, to begin with, raised the method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods. But, an understanding was reached between the sides that it was not acceptable in principle for it was essentially an inspection activity falling under the category of ad hoc inspection and going beyond the unique status of the DPRK. Hence the discussion was focused on the reasonableness of the method now applied by the DPRK to the replacement of fuel rods. The DPRK side earnestly explained that this is an appropriate method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of freely measuring selected rods as demanded by the agency when the unique status of the DPRK is dissolved in the future, while guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards to suit its unique status at the present stage. And we ensured all conditions for clearly understanding the reasonableness of our-style method by allowing the agency delegation to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and work there and have sufficient technical consultation with the operators of the facilities while the negotiation was on. The agency side took note of the theoretical feasibility of this method of ours and its experimental confirmation and requested us to arrange its content in writing, promising us to profoundly study the efficiency and practical safeguards of this method of DPRK style with good will. We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little the amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt in view of the present conditions of political restrictions. We promised that we would continue the refueling of the reactor in such a manner as to accept a series of opinions of the IAEA side concerning this method and would respond any time to negotiation that might be proposed by the IAEA side in future. At the negotiation, a final agreement was not reached on the DPRK-proposed method, but this method was supplemented and perfected through the negotiation. We immediately applied this method to the refuelling of the reactor so that the possibility of selected measurement of fuel rods could be increased, and we are placing the process of all work under a strict supervision of the IAEA inspectors and monitoring cameras. We consider that through the negotiation with the IAEA side and the monitoring activities of the IAEA inspectors concerning the refueling of the reactor, our good will to place our peaceful nuclear activities strictly under the control of the IAEA was fully manifested. We will actively strive to ensure the transparency of our nuclear activities and do the utmost as ever to find a final solution to the nuclear issue through the DPRK-USA talks.
