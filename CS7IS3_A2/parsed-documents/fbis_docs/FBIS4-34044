As is customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons. Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force, accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated at over ECU250,000.
