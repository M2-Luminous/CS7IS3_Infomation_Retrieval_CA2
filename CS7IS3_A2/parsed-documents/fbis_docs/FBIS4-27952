FBIS4-27952 "dreas109_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-109 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea Daily: ROK `Brutally Suppressed' Demonstrators Daily: ROK `Brutally Suppressed' Demonstrators SK0406052494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0455 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406052494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Sword-brandishing of Nuclearmaniac" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique a few days ago brutally suppressed inhabitants in Uljin County in a demonstration against the building of a nuclear waste dump, leaving some 20 people mortally wounded and arresting 24 on the scene. NODONG SINMUN today says this brutality can be committed only by such fascist tyrants as the Kim Yong-sam group whose mode of existence is sword-brandishing. To maintain one's existence and protect living environments pertains to the intrinsic independent rights of human beings, the analyst says, and continues: The exercise of these rights can never be criminalized or suppressed in any case. Nevertheless, the puppets are brutally suppressing the people's righteous struggle for existence at the point of the bayonet. This is really a fascist outrage fully revealing the ferocity of the "civilian" dictatorship. Their suppression of people opposing the building of a nuclear waste dump is a brigandish act for forcing them to reconcile themselves to nuclear harm. Unpardonable is the crime of the Kim Yong-sam group which is going to build a nuclear waste dump and inflict irrevocable nuclear disasters upon the people, after converting South Korea into a nuclear base of the United States.
