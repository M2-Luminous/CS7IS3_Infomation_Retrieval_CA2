"The COSATU Executive Committee is totally opposed to any change in the election date, for whatever reason," the statement said. "This date has now become carved in stone and it would be a disaster for our country if we allowed those opposed to progress to hold the elections hostage," it added. The committee pledged the full support of COSATU and its affiliates to striking workers in Bophuthatswana. "We fully support the demands of people in that region for re-incorporation and free political activity, as well as the securing of their pension monies, which are not safe while in the grip of the corrupt (President Lucas) Mangope regime". The committee said Mr Mangope's refusal to submit to the democratic process had left people in that region with no option but to bring him to his knees. The committee also rejected the replacement of the South African Police by a private security firm at major airports. "At this crucial time it is highly irresponsible to allow such sensitive public institutions to become vulnerable to attack by forces opposing the democratic process. COSATU demands the immediate reversal of this decision," the statement said.
