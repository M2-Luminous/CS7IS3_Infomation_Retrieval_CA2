FBIS4-6638 "dreas078_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan U.S. Interpretation of Talks Said Different U.S. Interpretation of Talks Said Different OW2204131694 Tokyo KYODO in English 1306 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2204131694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States have fundamentally different interpretations of the overall goal of the so-called "framework" trade talks, a senior Trade Ministry official said Friday. The perception gap emerged during the latest meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who declined to be named. The MITI official was referring to "basic objectives" mentioned in the joint statement on the Japan-U.S. framework, which was issued after the summit meeting between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Clinton in Tokyo in July last year. "The U.S. interpretation was found to be fundamentally different from Japan's understanding," said the official, who attended the Hata-Kantor meeting on April 15 in Morocco. But the official did not explain the difference. He also refrained from specifying which part of the joint statement was discussed during the Marrakech meeting. The Hata-Kantor meeting fell short of setting a specific time for resumption of the stalled framework talks. The MITI official said that Kantor requested Tokyo to give a "satisfactory" answer to U.S. proposals made during the Marrakech meeting on three areas -- macroeconomic areas, objective criteria and overall goal. But the official declined to reveal details of the proposals. The MITI official said the U.S. proposals on the three areas were "far from" acceptable for Tokyo. He said Tokyo will make a reply to these proposals by sending an official to Washington probably after the Golden Week holiday season ending on May 8. The Japanese understanding is that Washington is prepared to reopen the framework talks through informal channels, only when the Japanese answer is found "satisfactory," the MITI official said. During the Hata-Kantor meeting, Kantor sounded "softer" on the issue of numerical targets, the idea of which Hata flatly dismissed at the outset of the meeting, the MITI official said. But the official did not elaborate, only saying Kantor did not show any response. Asked if the Japan-U.S. trade ties have worsened after the Hata-Kantor meeting compared with the situation immediately after the February 11 breakdown of the summit, the MITI official said it is difficult to judge. Tokyo could avoid discussing the conceptual gap over the "basic objectives," if it focuses on sector-by-sector discussion, the official said.
