"There is a good prognosis; the president is always willing to discuss the problems of laborers," was the comment by Belweder Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. "The fact that the president did not sign the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law is a step in the right direction and also a gesture for the union," said "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski. He expects that the president will act similarly when it comes to the budget law. "Then one will be able to evaluate the true intentions of the president," Krzaklewski believes. Minister Mieczyslaw Wachowski has recently held several meetings with a member of the KK Presidium on the organization of a meeting between the union's leadership and the president. Opinions within "S" were divided. Some believe that such talks are necessary because the president may become an ally in the union-government dispute. Another group of KK Presidium members, including Kwasniewski, was skeptical. They believe that Walesa would want to take advantage of the temporary rapprochement with "S" for his game with the government coalition. The Unsuccessful Strike One of the "S" leaders said during a serious talk that the present strike situation was caused by the impulsiveness of the chairman, who, at a 9 February demonstration, delivered an ultimatum on the "Pact on Enterprise" to the government (Marian Krzaklewski demanded that the entire packet of the "pact" laws be passed by 15 March). "We were not prepared for strikes; however, one must defend a young chairman whose nerves turned out to be too weak," our informer told us. Now it seems that the union once again wants to save face after the unsuccessful strike action, which started on 7 March. One could find several examples of the union's inconsistency. On 11 March, trains were supposed to be stopped. However, the railroad directors managed to break the strike, and the affair ended up in mere announcements of a strike. "S" was supposed to picket the Sejm from 0830 on 17 March and continue the action until a decision on the popiwek was made. The Sejm deputies put off the voting until the following day, and the picketing broke up after a few hours. Permanent statements about staging a general strike depreciated the most dangerous weapon of the union. The "S" leaders are themselves beginning to doubt the sense of the strike action. Some KK members have started voicing opinions that the strike should be stopped. The "S" leaders know very well how difficult it is to stage a protest in a situation when enterprises are going bankrupt and even the lowest-paid employees are afraid of losing their jobs (last year Mazowsze Region chief learned about it himself--the general strike of the region was, generally speaking, nothing more than putting up banners at the enterprises). People's opinions about the protests are also rather unfavorable: A definite majority of them believe that, in the present situation, strikes will not yield any results. "S" managed, however, to collect the strike fund. It is not known how large the fund is, but it is said to be a considerable sum. Another problem then appeared: Some want to use this money at once, while others would rather invest the money to multiply it. "Then one could go to a meeting with the prime minister and show him how large the bank account has become. If the sum is enormous, it will make an impression on him. One does not have to stage a strike; the threat would be strong enough. However, this might be possible in three or four years, if we do not fritter this money away before that," says one of the younger KK members. Controlled Talks Because it wanted to find a way out of the difficult situation, "S" decided on talks between the experts of "S" and those of the government. From the very beginning, each party wanted to discuss different things, and, as a result, no agreement was reached. However, "S" believed it was a success that the joint communique included the union's demands because the communique would be read by the Council of Ministers. "Here the game is played in the foreground, and on two levels of each of them," journalists were told by "S" Spokesperson Piotr Zak. The union activists were aware of the fact that the experts' talks were an element of the game in the triangle of the prime minister, the president, and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. Waldemar Pawlak wanted to have an additional advantage, the possibility (for the SLD, the threat) of giving in to "S." Until 13 April, "S" is waiting for the ministers to make the political decision--namely, whether to accept the demands. However, a solution favorable to "S" is almost out of the question. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement and its partner, Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, would protest such a decision. Only the President Remains Nevertheless, Marian Krzaklewski seems to need a success. The "S" congress is drawing closer. He will have to explain the election failure and show what he has done since last June. Therefore, if talks with the government prove unsuccessful, the unionists will have to turn to the president, who most clearly feels like trying to build an alliance with "S" once again. A year ago, we saw a similar situation. Marian Krzaklewski did not want to speak with the government. Therefore, a team of experts was set up, but the talks did not result in anything. Can the president do more than he could last year? He does not exert great influence over the government's decisions, and he is in conflict with the parliament. However, he can veto laws (last year, when he held talks with "S," the parliament was already dissolved). The budget law is waiting for his signature. There is no doubt that, even though the president's veto would not satisfy the demands of "S," it would certainly be a success, something the union has not had for a long time.
