This administration considers any developments aimed at realizing this suspicious objective as part of the grounds for establishing the new world order. This order is a unipolar order that ignores the will and aspirations of other peoples and the role they are supposed to play in the balance of international interests and relations, which are based on the principles of mutual respect and noninterference in the affairs of other countries. Last year in particular, the United Nations witnessed massive efforts to propagate this concept of limited sovereignty. It saw attempts to provide this concept with an international cover that would lend it legitimacy, thus giving the United States and its allies the chance to pressure other nations and governments to bow to their illegal will to dominate, using the banner of human rights as a pretext for intimidation, terrorism, and forcing their evil designs without facing any resistance to such dangerous trends. In this context, it is enough to refer to the current General Assembly session debates in which blatant calls were made to propagate this U.S. concept. These calls tried to sugar coat their arguments with sweet-sounding words and resounding phrases with dubious meanings. Regrettably and incredibly, the UN secretary general has become a party to this process, and in his discussions he openly propagates this concept of limited sovereignty. He does this despite the fact that everything indicates that this concept is an attempt to violate the sovereignty of nations, or at least deprive them of their right to practice their sovereignty over their internal affairs under the same pretexts that are raised occasionally in the interest of the United States and its allies. Any people that is proud of its dignity and basic right to sovereignty over its own land and affairs must denounce and reject the concept of limited sovereignty. This is not because it is rude to interference in the internal affairs of a country that enjoys sovereignty and independence, but also because it brings international relations back to the stage when the law of the jungle prevailed. It would allow the strong to impose their mandate and threaten to use brutal force against those who are smaller and weaker by materialistic standards. Hence, the logical question is that if the United States wants-- through these suspicious efforts--to interfere in the internal affairs of countries under the pretext of protecting human rights, is it prepared to accept that the interfere of others in its own affairs for the same reason? Human rights violations are numerous and dangerous in the United States in particular, and in the colonialist West in general. Shouldn't other nations have the same right that the United States proclaims for itself but at the same time denies to others? Despite these designs, whose nature and timing may or may not be calculated, the peoples of the world will eventually win. This determination will certainly have the final say on all practices, violations, and conspiracies that target the world peoples and their honorable forces that believe in justice, right, and principles. The experiment of steadfast and mujahid Iraq is a model that opens the way for those who reject any form of injustice, arrogance, aggression, mandate, and hegemony.
