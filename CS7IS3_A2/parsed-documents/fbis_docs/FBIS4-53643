The message was conveyed through the North-South Liaison Office at Panmunjom. Recalling that the North side had warned against the kidnapping of North's lumbermen by the South side in the far east of Russia, the message said: Your side kidnapped again our six citizens engaged in normal tree-felling in the Far East of Russia on May 18 and 20 and took them to Seoul. Such a shameless, inhuman and barbaric act committed by your side against fellow countrymen even in an alien land is a heinous crime destroying harmonious families and increasing the number of families living separated on this land and a deliberate challenge aimed at extremely deteriorating the relations between the North and the South which have alreay reached an impasse. This has aroused irrepressible indignation among the entire fellow countrymen. Your side's shocking crime can never be covered up with anything nor can it be tolerated. Though your side is claiming that our lumbermen defected to the South, its maladroit trick is nothing but a drama the deceptive nature of which has already been fully revealed. The authorities of your side must unconditionally and promptly send all the kidnapped lumbermen back to the North and apologize to the nation and the world for the inhuman crimes it perpetrated, undermining the dignity of the nation in an alien land. If your side refuse to send them back to the North and continue kidnapping our lumbermen, it would entail grave consequences in the North-South relations as a whole and the South side would have to pay dearly for it. Your side will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed in the North-South relations and history and the nation will never tolerate your side's inhuman and anti-national crimes.
