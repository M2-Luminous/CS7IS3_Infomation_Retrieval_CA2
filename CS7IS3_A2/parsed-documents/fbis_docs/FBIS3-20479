As to the New Airport, Hong Kong Is Not the Host, as Beijing Is Going To Have To Pay the Bill At the Fourth Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin officially became the general secretary [of the CPC Central Committee], whereupon he asked the Central General Office to tell the the General Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA to report on the material sent by every daily paper to the Hong Kong press, as well as that in the mainland press on Hong Kong and mainland China. She Mengxiao [0152 1322 1321], deputy director and secretary general [of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA], told me that he had already complied with this. While She Mengxiao and I both agreed that the general secretary's concern for reports from outside and for our work in Hong Kong was good for our work in Hong Kong, She told me that when Jiang Zemin had been Municipal Party Secretary in Shanghai, he had also asked for material on the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee from a certain Xu [6079], who was a deputy director of the General Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA, and which Xu had actually handled on his own without asking instructions from the secretary general. In fact, the Working Committee provided on its own initiative certain information and data in areas, such as Hong Kong and outside political, economic, and cultural matters, for reference by officials of mainland ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal party Committees. And the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA specially published various "references" for this purpose. When Jiang Zemin was Minister of Electronics Industry, this Xu was a secretary to Vice Minister [of Electronics Industry] Cao Weilian [2580 4850 1670], and had later accompanied him as secretary when Cao Weilian came to the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA as deputy director, and then had been made deputy General Office director after Cao passed away. As to Jiang Zemin's use of such connections at the time to get material from the Working Committee, we were surprised. While such methods were out of line with the party's organizational principles, the matter was past and Jiang Zemin was now general secretary so that, after She Mengxiao reported it to me, we smiled wryly at each other, shook our heads, and said no more about it. Before long, the Central General Office again issued instructions to the Organization Department of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA, with Zheng Hua [6774 5478] [deputy director of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA] telling me and several other deputy directors at a meeting of the Working Committee that Jiang Zemin had nominated Xu by name for director of the General Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA. This greatly surprised us all, with one deputy director sighing that "the general secretary is truly managing things in too great detail to be so concerned about a mere general office director!" While we all objected to this without being willing to take a stand, I acted as a peacemaker to "preserve" the general secretary's prestige, by telling Zheng Hua that "Liu Lin [0491 2651] (the General Office director) had best resign and let Xu take his place." When Zhou Nan subsequently became the secretary of the Working Committee, he immediately designated Xu to be mostly in charge of sorting out the "material" about myself. When I later heard about this, I could only sigh. On 11 July 1989, when Jiang Zemin said at a meeting with the Hong Kong members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and some of the members of the Advisory Committee that "well water does not intrude into river water [or we'll mind our business if you mind yours]," which was taken unkindly in Hong Kong, someone called it "a witticism [or proverb] about the tense China-Hong Kong relations." We colleagues at the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA commented among ourselves that: "How could he have said this? This is likely to make people feel that they do not understand Hong Kong's situation." As over 98 percent of Hongkongers were Chinese, and Hong Kong was already facing a reversion [to Chinese sovereignty], how could he treat Hongkongers as outsiders, calling them "well water" standing outside of the "river water" of the Chinese? During the 4 June incident, the patriotic actions of Hongkongers could not be regarded as "well water" intruding into "river water" as, even if there was some intrusion, it was by a tiny minority. So how could he consign the majority of his Hong Kong compatriots to a hostile status? I guessed at the time that Jiang Zemin had probably done so after hearing Li Hou and Lu Ping's report, and accepting their inaccurate information and views. But before long, there was another incident over Jiang Zemin's comments about the new airport. The British Hong Kong government's plan to build a new airport was a huge construction plan, which grew into a major incident in Sino-British political relations. Ji Pengfei had once asked my view, to which I had replied that while British Hong Kong had planned in the 1970s to build a second airport at Ch'ihlachiao to replace the existing one, they had later shelved the plan when they learned that we were going to recover Hong Kong. Then in 1986, when Hu Ying-hsiang and Li Chia-ch'eng had proposed a plan even bigger than British Hong Kong's for developing Tayu Mountain and the sea area west of Hong Kong Island, by building a second airport and expanding the port zone, it had died in embryo because the British Hong Kong government did not support it. So the current British Hong Kong's bringing up again of the so-called "rose garden" plan to win popular support before its pullout and leave some cherished memories for afterwards, as well as acting in the interests of British firms before its pullout, was more out of political than economic considerations, or at least equally weighted. I said that in light of Hong Kong and even Mainland China's economic growth, building a new airport and expanding the seaside docks was necessary and, having done a preliminary estimation of the investment possibilities, had found no major problems. Based on British Hong Kong's past actions, there was not much possibility of a purely government investment, so that social funds would probably be used, to turn over some of the project through bidding to commercial operation, which was also the only way that British firms could benefit. Even with complete government investment and the completion of the project in eight years not at their announced HK$100 billion framework but doubled to HK$200 billion, the British Hong Kong government's recent years of budget surpluses and average growth rates meant that as long as continued prosperity was maintained, it would be possible to draw on an average of over HK$20 billion a year. But it was guessed that the British Hong Kong government would not act in this way. I told Ji Pengfei that I had instructed the Policy Studies Department of NCNA's Hong Kong Office to do a study, which I would send a report on to the center before long. But several days later, Jiang Zemin suddenly took a stand on the building of the new airport in British Hong Kong at a meeting with a group of Hongkongers, saying that "you are not the host, as we are going to have to pay the bill," setting off another wave of negative feeling in Hong Kong public opinion. So I wondered: As they had already taken a stand and made a decision, why had Ji Pengfei not told me about it in advance? At the time, I wondered if Jiang Zemin's statement about the "we" who would have to pay the bill referred to all Chinese including Hong Kong's Chinese residents, or to simply the mainland people or government? As the general secretary recently had painstakingly separated Mainland China's "river water" from Hong Kong's "well water," his current statement about "we" left one feeling that he meant only the mainland people or the Central Government. This was also the general public response. If the "we" was interpreted in this way, and the building of the new airport created a future deficit, how would the the mainland people or the Central Government "have to pay the bill," as it would increase the burden on Hongkongers instead? It the general secretary was using this angle to warn the British Hong Kong government, he might have won the good opinion of Hongkongers. But it was still necessary to wait for the situation to be clarified: Would the British Hong Kong government take on the whole project, not using social funds, which might be going beyond its means to leave the SAR Government with a bundle of debts and an unfinished project? The situation was not clear at the time. So this talk of "paying the bill" was too soon, obviously growing out of a mistaken confidence in the words of his "advisors."
