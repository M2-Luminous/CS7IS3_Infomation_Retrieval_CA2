It has given priority to explore local natural resources, helping local people develop agriculture and forestry. The regional government has taken measures to support development of Xihaigu instead of purely relying on government relief, according to Guo Zhanyuan, head of the regional Agricultural Development Committee. Last year, the region used a quarter of its aid-the-poor funds to create a number of production centers for grain, edible oil, animal husbandry, fruit, medicinal herbs and minerals, Guo said. A total of 8.7 million yuan (1 million U.S. dollars) was used last year. Yanchi County, near a desert, has concentrated on developing animal husbandry and planting medicinal herbs. Last year, the total number of sheep raised in the county reached over 700,000. A licorice root production center has been created. Thanks to the efforts, the county is among the first eight counties in the prefecture to end poverty. Xiji County has given priority to potato and pea planting to make dry noodles made from bean or potato starch. Its products are exported to ten Chinese provinces and regions, as well as Russia and Hong Kong. Last year, the eight counties' per capita income was about 370 yuan and grain 275 kilograms. China's poverty line is set at an income below 200 yuan a year.
