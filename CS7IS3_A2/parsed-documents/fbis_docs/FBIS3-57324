Its agenda included prospects of Russian-Chinese cooperation and border relations. The conference, the first of this kind, was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who arrived here on Tuesday night en route from Bishkek to China. The relations of partnership and cooperation with China, our great neighbour, should be worthy of the two great powers and should measure up to the current situation in Asia and the world in general, Kozyrev said at the conference. Speaking about the present state of Russian-Chinese relations, the minister touched upon the problem of the settlement of border disputes between the two countries. Some people mention the "seizure of Russian territories in favour of China," but this does not correspond to reality. Talks are under way between the two countries on this problem, which has become of late one of the main irritants in bilateral relations, Kozyrev continued. So far as border trade is concerned, its volume exceeded 2.5 billion dollars in 1993, Kozyrev said. However, we should now move to an entirely new stage of the development of border cooperation and ties and pass over to production cooperation, for which we have all the needed conditions. According to Kozyrev, the problem of opening check points on the Russian-Chinese border is also being discussed at the talks. During the visit to Beijing an agreement on it is planned to be signed, he said. Now there are 21 check points, of which 19 are functioning. It is necessary to make their work more orderly and to open new ones. The existing check points cannot cope with with the enormous flow of people wishing to cross the Russian-Chinese border. Last year their total number was 2.5 million. The Russian foreign minister devoted special attention to the creation of free economic zones. The study of the experience of creating such zones in China will be one of the objectives of his visit. Immediately after the end of the conference Kozyrev left for the city of Heihe, where he met senior officials of the province of Heilongjiang and Heihe. They discussed the development of border trade. The Russian foreign minister saw the Heihe free economic zone and a passenger check point on the Russian-Chinese border. After returning to Blagoveshchensk Kozyrev visited a frontier guard post in the western suburb of Blagoveshchensk and had a meeting with frontier guards. Kozyrev flies to Beijing today for an official visit.
