Arab businessmen are visiting Israel to investigate the possibility of investing here. Four Arab states -- Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, and Morocco -- have expressed a willingness to host the economic committees in the multilateral negotiations. There is a readiness by multinational companies, which had previously caved in to the boycott, to invest in Israel. Even in Japan -- the largest state to support the boycott -- there has been a revolutionary change and Japanese businessmen and companies plan to invest in Israel. He said, however, that he still finds it hard to foresee an Arab League decision to annul the boycott. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin made the remarks in answer to a motion in the Knesset.
