The new, regional, intergovernmental organization will unite nations with highly diverse political systems and socioeconomic development plans: [Pino] Over 200 million people on 25 island nations, in Central and South America, and in 12 Caribbean territories will establish diverse ties through the ACS. Could this forum eventually represent a convergence of kindred politics and serve as the voice of the region on international events? If so, what about Cuba's participation? [Robaina] Any integrationist event inevitably can be considered a forum for political convergence. In some measure, today's economic integration requires assuming certain positions and will intensify, above all, the Caribbean voice at important international events. It is important for us to join the Caribbean, the Caribbean to which we have always belonged and from which they have wanted to pretend to tear us. Depending on how well we get to know each other better and intensify efforts, we will clearly be better prepared to exchange and unite views and to have a stronger economic, political, and social voice. It will be extremely important to present a much more economically, politically, and socially united Caribbean at forums like the United Nations. When I speak of politics, I do not mean similar politics. Integration means that there is no need for identical ideological schemes to join things. We are being allowed to take united stands in the international arena. This clearly establishes a new voice and opens a period for the Caribbean that Cuba modestly asks to join, so that we can learn and modestly contribute whatever we can.
