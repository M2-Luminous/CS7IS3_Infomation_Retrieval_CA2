This was revealed during Prime Minister Carl Bildt's two-day visit to Estonia. Our correspondent in Helsinki Christina Gustafsson reports: [Gustafsson] The Baltic News Service, BNS, reports that Prime Minister Carl Bildt said -- somewhat surprisingly -- that Estonia should not sign an agreement like the one between Russia and Latvia. Prime Minister Bildt did not say which aspects of the agreement should be different. The Estonian criticism of the agreement between Russia and Latvia has mainly been that all retired officers are allowed to stay in Latvia. Ever since the agreement was signed, the Estonians have stressed that such an agreement will never be topical for Estonia. Estonia cannot accept the fact that those officers who have, for example, worked in the intelligence services, the KGB, or the GRU, would be allowed to stay on Estonian territory. This constitutes an all too great security risk, according to the Estonians. Parallel to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's visit, there was a new round of talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin headed the Russian delegation. He expressed a certain optimism when the talks were over. He did not think it impossible that an agreement will be reached enabling the Russian soldiers to leave Estonia before the last day of August. During the last few weeks, this timetable has been questioned by the Russians, because time is starting to run out. The negotiations will continue next week in Moscow. The training submarines at the Russian military base in Paldiski, with two nuclear reactors, are another growing problem in the negotiations. Prime Minister Carl Bildt visited the top secret base today and said later that it is easily possible to tear it down in a couple of weeks. The Russian side says that it will take from three to 10 years to dismantle the base. Because the Russians consider that Paldiski contains military secrets, neither Estonian nor foreign experts will be allowed to enter the base. The Estonian negotiators are of the opinion that Paldiski and all other bases should be handed over to Estonia on the last day of August.
