On 31 May in the Supreme Council a news conference was held by Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan Marat Ospanov with journalists. As he admitted, this was his first meeting with the press. The occasion was Marat Ospanov's desire to explain to the mass media certain details and circumstances related to the aforementioned statement. What factors motivated the members of parliament to do this? At the news conference Marat Ospanov gave these explanations. The Supreme Council is in favor of market reforms and in general supports the president's course. But our economy is in a lamentable condition today. In its statement the Supreme Council notes that this is blocking the movement toward the market. The work of the government has become ineffective; it has no unified team. Good ideas are quickly dispersed as the team members pass them on from one to the other. Taking these and other facts into account, the members of parliament decided to make the statement. The draft of it was discussed in two stages. In the first it was decided how constitutional the statement would be. In the second they discussed the form for transmitting it. The discussion, in Marat Ospanov's words, was lively and interesting. First the document was brought up for discussion by the committee; after that it was considered by the deputies, and then the plenary session and the editorial commission. It was also noted that the Supreme Council cannot work in isolation; it needs contact with the president and his team. After all, the Supreme Council is not calling for the resignation of the government, since it does not have the constitutional right to do that. Now the authors of the statement are impatiently awaiting the response from the president. How did Nursultan Nazarbayev react to the statement? This question was answered by Konstantin Kolpakov, the president's personal representative. "At my own risk," Konstantin Anatolyevich remarked, "I will say that the president addressed the statement calmly and attentively. And in general this expression of a lack of confidence in the government socioeconomic and legal policy was not a surprise to Nursultan Abishevich. He supports the desire for cooperation and dialogue."
