This represents a real increase of 23.66 percent as of March. Ministers will also benefit from the measure and receive a 95.14 percent hike. The move was voted on in a secret session and must be approved by a majority in the Senate (which did not have a quorum on 16 March). If the Senate ratifies the decision, federal deputies, senators, ministers, and Supreme Court justices will receive in March the equivalent of 6,123.51 URV's [Real Value Unit] (in other words, 4,699,606.77 cruzeiros at the 16 March URV rate). This decision will generate "a domino effect" because the internal rules and regulations of Congress allows for the revision of the salaries of all other employees to maintain parity. This will also occur in the state legislatures and municipal town halls where salaries are pegged to those of federal deputies, the National Accounting Office, and the Attorney General's Office. Within the executive branch, the rejection of the veto will permit employees of state and semi-state enterprises, such as Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the Central Bank, and the Federal Police to have their salaries readjusted. No estimation has been made of how much this will increase the payroll.
