The first pluripartite democratic elections in Moldova were run in "an atmosphere of normality and honesty" and according to the law on elections to parliament, stated from behalf of NATO delegation. The observers visited over 60 polling stations in various Moldova's regions; they noticed some technical and organization deficiencies, mainly caused by the lack of democratic experience in Moldova and this is not a reason to contest the results, says a press release issued by the observers. Lord Lucas said that about 12 percent of left bank population voted while other inhabitants of east Moldova had, though with difficulties, the real possibility to participate in elections. NATO and CSCE observers remarked as "a suggestion for future" the state's obligation to insure equal access to media for all political forces during the electoral campaign.
