However, as the greenback dominates the basket of currencies used by the Exchange Equalization Fund in fixing the daily exchange rate, the baht has depreciated in value in line with the dollar, Mr. Tharin said. "That will benefit the country in its trade with Japan and Europe although Thai trade in terms of U.S. dollars will be affected," he said. The dollar's dive to 99.50 yen in yesterday morning's trade in Asian markets, coupled with political disarray in Japan, shook the stock market with the key Nikkei index plunging more than 460 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 230 points. Although it was estimated that the Bank of Japan had spent more than U.S.$1 billion in frantically buying dollars to stop the slide, it was able to shore up the dollar only slightly to close at 99.93 yen. In Thailand, despite a positive mood caused by the acquittal of major market player Song Watcharasirot on share manipulation charges, the SET failed to escape, the index falling more than 37 points. Mr. Tharin forecast that the baht would be stable in a short period. The dollar's dive began last Tuesday and it dipped below 100 yen for the first time since the end of World War Two. The depreciation of the dollar against the yen stemmed from a failure by the U.S. and Japan to resolve trade deficits in February and the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other leading central banks of 19 countries, such as Japan, Germany and Switzerland, failed to take proper action to prop up the dollar until Friday, which was too late. Investors no longer see the need to hold dollars as the U.S. has lost some appeal. The economies of Japan and Germany are recovering and interest rates in both countries are moving upward. For example, the Japanese economy recorded 3.9 percent growth in the first quarter of this year. Mr. Tharin said the Exchange Equalization Fund would keep close watch on the foreign exchange situation and the central bank was maintaining sound liquidity. Arun Chirachawala, Bangkok Bank's senior vice president for finance and marketing, said the U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to increase its rates to stabilize the dollar and that could force local rates to increase too. But such a move could hamper the recovery of the U.S. economy in the long run. Another option for the Fed was to do nothing and let the dollar fall until a balance was reached, he said. The volatility of both currencies and the German mark has prompted investors to sell shares, driving down markets in several countries including the U.S., Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand, Mr. Arun said. He insisted the declining dollar and other external factors, not the acquittal of Sia [tycoon] Song, were responsible for the marked drop in the Thai market. "The exchange rate of the dollar, yen, and mark may tend to fluctuate further. The dollar has reached an alarming level of 1.57 marks and 99.5 yen and is likely to run downhill steadily as long as no intervention is applied," Mr. Arun said. "If the Fed raises its rates, Thai rates might rise unavoidably. Deposits are expanding at a much slower pace than credit and tend to cluster in certain banks instead of averaging throughout the financial system. "During the latter half of this year, interest rates might rise but at a slower and less dramatic rate than experienced in the first half," he said.
