Krauss said that the government is more than willing to contribute to their return to Chilean society, but noted that no one can avoid the court proceedings. Krauss also valued the recent presence in Santiago of the UNHCR regional chief for South America, and pointed out that the UN official confirmed the ending of the Chileans' status as political refugees because of the democratic normalization taking place in our country. Krauss also stated categorically that since March 1990 there have been no political prisoners in Chile, but rather terrorist criminals who practice violence to achieve political goals. He pointed out that the expression "political prisoner" is inadequate and misleading from the point of view of the political situation in the country. In this regard he accused the front organizations and the relatives of the prisoners for spreading rumors about the alleged existence of this kind of prisoner. Krauss made these comments yesterday during a conversation with reporters in La Moneda Palace. Krauss was asked about the activities carried out by Mohammed Benamar, UNHCR chief for South America, to facilitate the return of about 180 Chileans, who have charges pending or arrest warrants against them in Chilean courts. Krauss said that the UN official expressed real recognition for the Chilean situation in that the progress of our political process no longer allows for the existence of people who could claim refugee or asylum status for political reasons. [passage omitted] Krauss said that the justice and acting interior minister told Benamar that those who decide to return to Chile will have all the guarantees of an appropriate trial to resolve their situation according to the rules of a state of law.
