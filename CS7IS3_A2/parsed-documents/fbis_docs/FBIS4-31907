However, political entities which have emerged as a result of the breakup of the two former government coalition parties -- the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) -- are built on an "unsure footing" and have no voter base, the paper adds. The Democratic Union (DU), which emerged from the HZDS, as well as the National Democratic Party (NDS), established by members of the anti-Meciar wing within the SNS who later withdrew from the party, "had nothing but to join the government in March and begin to carry out their pre-election campaign for state money," the paper says. "The ministers rushed after voters and in order that their paths are not too obvious they came up with the government programme," the author says. Politicians from the other parties and movements who only a year ago spoke about turncoats with disrespect, now willingly offer them cooperation. However, the first ones are maneouvring in search of the most advantageous positions for themselves, their declared programme notwithstanding, the paper says. While as recently as a year ago Democratic Party Chairman Pavol Hagyari criticised NDS Chairman Ludovit Cernak for turning quite of a sudden from a nationalist to a conservative (Cernak was dismissed as SNS chairman and expelled from the party at its February congress for holding a moderate position) today Hagyari readily offers Cernak a coalition, the paper says. However, Cernak, who does not believe in miracles, has instead grabbed the more stable slate of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). Only elections will show whether his move was correct. The latest public opinion polls show that Jan Carnogursky's KDH does not enjoy the support of even five percent of voters, the author asserts. If someone thinks that there is a rush on the Slovak pre-election political scene then it is only appearance. The leaders of some parties simply want to wake up only after the elections, the paper concludes.
