In statements to the U.S. television network CNN, the top Cuban leader said that popular participation on the island is more practical than in the rest of Latin America. Castro said Latin America's land and wealth distribution systems are among the worst in the world and that Cuba, meanwhile, has made the greatest social progress in the hemisphere's history. As for the Ibero-American summits, Castro underscored the positive mark they have left in addition to fostering friendship among the nations of the region. Regarding the U.S. blockade against the island, Castro explained that he had to attend the summit to express his concern about the lack of opposition to that unfair measure aimed at making the Cuban people give in to hunger. He also described as complex the issue of Cuba's possible reinstatement to the OAS, adding that it is being considered.
