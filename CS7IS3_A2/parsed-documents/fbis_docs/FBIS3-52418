"The atmosphere is positive, but we are expecting difficulty over several points," said Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and member of a seven-member delegation holding talks with PLO officials here since Sunday. 'Arafat, who is yet to comment on the proposals, has come under increasing fire for his autocratic style of leadership. 'Amr told AFP the debate on democracy within the Palestine Liberation Organisation "has chances" for coming out with results. A change in the composition and structure of the teams negotiating with Israel over an autonomy accord signed in September in Washington was among the demands that could bear fruit, the Palestinian official said. The delegation, headed by Haydar 'Abd-al Shafi who led negotiations with Israel in Washington before the autonomy accord, was to present Tuesday night proposals to the Executive Committee on how to introduce more democracy and change the conduct of the autonomy talks. The proposals come in the framework of implementing nine points included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent Palestinian personalities and sent to 'Arafat last month. Several Palestinian officials said that most of the executive committee members were for applying more democracy in the organisation. But the PLO leader has so far commented only on issues related to the self-rule accord on which talks with Israel have stalled due to differences over who should control the international borders of the future autonomous zone, the security of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and the boundaries of the West Bank town of Jericho. Asked on how to apply democracy, 'Amr said it was "premature" to comment on the issue. But he said he was confident that positive results would be reached, taking into consideration ideas of reform already presented to 'Arafat. However, 'Amr said he expected some opposition to a proposal calling for the creation of a consultative standing committee made up of experts that would have a parallel role to that of the executive committee and help it "accomplish the big responsibilities it is facing at this stage". Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab also expressed optimism. There is no opposition to the call for democracy among the executive committee members. Some proposals have already been considered by the PLO leadership, he said. Among those proposals, al-Najjab referred to a draft constitution for the future autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho which he said was currently being reviewed by the committee charged with following up the autonomy talks with Israel. But other officials, close to the PLO leader, still doubt that any result would come out from the democracy debate as they consider the move itself a struggle for power only, rather than a call for real sharing in the decision-making process. 'Ali Ishaq, an executive committee member, told AFP recently that real democracy had never prevailed within the PLO. He said such an "ideal" would only be achieved through free elections for a "constitutional, democratic, independent Palestine".
