The plan was launched as part of a package of documents which represent the UK Government's response to the Rio "Earth Summit". It outlines the UK's role in conserving biodiversity at home and abroad. The plan, drawn up after extensive consultation, provides a strategy for the next 10 and 20 years and sets out 59 specific commitments to forward action. It emphasises what can be done at the local level to raise public awareness and involvement in conserving local biodiversity and pride in local distinctiveness. The Government commits itself to conserve, and where possible enhance: -- the overall populations and natural ranges of native species and the quality and range of wildlife habitats and ecosystems; -- internationally important and threatened species, habitats and ecosystems; -- species, habitats and natural and managed ecosystems that are characteristic of local areas; -- the biodiversity of natural and semi-natural habitats where this has been diminished over recent decades. A "Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group" will be created to take forward the commitments outlined in the plan. The Group will oversee the development of a full range of specific costed targets for key species and habitats for the years 2000 and 2010, to be published in European Nature Conservation Year 1995. In addition it will supervise the work proposed in the plan to improve the accessibility of wildlife data, encourage public awareness of and involvement in biodiversity, and review the delivery of the commitments contained in the Plan. The Steering Group will operate as a partnership between central and local government, agencies, collections, leading academic bodies and non-governmental organisations, and all of these groups are being invited to propose members. The document also outlines the UK's long history of scientific and practical involvement in the conservation of biodiversity overseas and sets out the Government's pledge to continue this support through the Darwin Initiative, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Overseas Aid Programme. Notes for Editors "Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan" is available from HMSO [Her Majesty's Stationary Office]; "Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan" was one of four documents published today. The others are: "Sustainable Development: The UK Strategy", "Sustainable Forestry Plan: The UK Programme" and "Climate Change: The UK Programme". "Biodiversity The UK Action Plan" is in response to article 6a of the Convention on Biological Diversity which the Prime Minister signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) at the Rio Earth Summit last year. The Convention calls for each Contracting Party to develop national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The Plan follows widespread consultation and contributions from central government departments, local government, agencies, academic institutions, businesses, voluntary groups and individuals. These included: -- a consultation paper issued in February 1993 to which more than 300 responses were received; -- a seminar held at the Royal Geographical Society in may 1993 with over 100 attendees half of which were from outside central government; -- a wide range of meetings between government officials and representatives of other organisations.
