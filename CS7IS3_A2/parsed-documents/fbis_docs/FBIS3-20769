Economic relations between countries are a reflection of political ones, and depend primarily upon the general situation in an individual country. And what can Slovenia expect in the near future? Let us take the former Yugoslav economic community as our starting point for such reflections. We obviously cannot erase the fact that mutual ties, including commercial ones, were tightly knit, and that Slovenia, for instance, sold almost a third of its goods to other republics, although perhaps at this time it is politically more expedient and generally popular to try to prove that nothing ties us to the south. To be sure, there is no clear picture of trade among the new states, because the pertinent services only started to monitor exports and imports in terms of individual states by means of customs declarations last year, but we can see a lot of "tectonic shifts." The share of the former Yugoslav states in the structure of Slovene foreign trade has shrunk drastically in the years since independence. Trade has declined by more than 80 percent (which is 28 percent of total trade). As economist Dr. Franjo Stiblar notes in an analysis of Croatian-Slovene economic relations, trade with Croatia also declined, although admittedly somewhat less. Before Yugoslavia's collapse, Croatia was Slovenia's number one economic partner. The data indicate that the total volume of trade has fallen from about $8.2 billion in 1990 to less than $1.5 billion last year. Last year, Croatia thus did not even reach 11 percent of Slovenia's foreign trade. (Now both of them, Slovenia and Croatia, are each other's third partners, after Germany and Italy.) Trade is unbalanced, and Slovenia has a considerable surplus. In spite of this, Stiblar thinks, Croatia remains an important and interesting trading partner for us. "That is why, in view of the development of political relations, and just because of pragmatic economic interests, it is to be hoped that Croatia will succeed in stabilizing its economy, since that would also have a favorable effect upon reviving Slovenia's." It actually seems surprising to Josip Skobermet, vice president of the GZS [Slovene Chamber of Commerce], that in such uncertain and changeable political conditions, in spite of all the tension and obstacles, trade with Croatia is still as high as it is. The enterprises that had serious economic interests have obviously coped and bypassed the obstacles in various ways. Dr. Tone Hrastelj, in the role of a practician and economic expert, a specialist on foreign trade, also has a similar opinion. In his opinion, political disagreements are the biggest obstacle in doing business with Croatia. Since we did not reach an agreement on a free trade zone, and since Croatia is treating Slovenia like every other foreign country and imposing customs duties, there is not enough interest in trade, and that harms both economies. In Hrastelj's opinion, Croatia is a more interesting trading partner for us than Serbia. That is why it would seriously be useful to institutionalize free trade with our immediate neighbor, whereas there would only be a theoretical possibility of that with the Serbs to start with (although, he admits, the Serbian economy is somewhat more complementary to Slovenia's than the Croatian economy). "In Serbia, Slovenia will probably be under the same foreign trade regime as West European countries, but I believe that trade will proceed in spite of everything. In comparison with Western competition, we will have certain advantages: private acquaintances, old commercial ties, knowledge of the language, the Serbian deficit in knowledge of foreign languages, Serbia's remoteness and foreigners' fears in connection with traveling to the southern Balkans...." Last year trade with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM], in contrast to other countries, was more successful than the year before. The two countries signed an agreement on economic cooperation, payment transactions, clearing trade based on commodity lists (that agreement from 1992 did not go into effect), and they have also established a joint Slovene-Macedonian chamber of commerce. Slovenia only has a real free trade zone with Macedonia. Trade, however, is still associated with several difficulties, among which the Macedonians are primarily emphasizing the high deficit on their side, and problematic payment transactions, while on the other hand Slovenia does not see enough products of interest to itself in Macedonia. In spite of that, last year's results (about $300 million in trade) are favorable in comparison with 1992, and expectations are still optimistic, but it will probably never be possible again to achieve the record trade in the amount of more than $1 billion in 1990. Slovenia had already started to negotiate with Bosnia-Herzegovina on economic relations on a new basis, but in the meantime the war in Bosnia came. Trade with Bosnia-Herzegovina, converted to dollars, has declined abruptly from independence onward: from about $250 million in 1990 to about $29 million in the first 11 months of last year. One cannot expect anything else in the future either in a war situation. No one knows how much longer the war can drag on. When it is over, devastated Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be rebuilt. The country's rebuilding will probably rely on international aid. Slovenia, whose advantages will be--if nothing else--geographic proximity and familiarity with the market and language--will certainly also apply for some of the work. The main limitation, however, will be the established practice of investors, who in such cases prefer to employ their own economic capacities. Future cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro, in particular, is arousing polemics. At the moment the issue is still not too urgent, as the UN Security Council embargo is still in effect for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. As Slovene state authorities, the chamber of commerce, and enterprise directors assert, Slovenia is observing the embargo. It only trades in products for which the UN Security Council's sanctions commission issues a special permit, namely medicines and goods for humanitarian purposes. Thus, Slovenia's trade with the FRY (including miscellaneous items) during the first 11 months of last year reached $7 million in exports and $0.3 million in imports. Ljubljana's Lek, for example, is exporting several medicines to Serbia, with a permit. This is not a continuous business, Lek's director Metod Dragonja says, and it depends on Serbia's (modest) ability to pay. In terms of volume, it is only about a tenth of deliveries three years ago. Medicines actually "sell themselves," and no particular commercial activity is needed, but Lek also does not have any privileges in comparison with foreign competition. At least a minimal presence in the Serbian market, however, is especially useful for the enterprise in the long term, "so that later, with more optimistic developments, it can improve its position in that market." In spite of that, there are many suspicions about violation of the embargo. On the shelves of Serbian shops one can find products from well-known Slovene producers, and sometimes Belgrade television even shows them, claiming that trade (even with Slovenes) is proceeding in spite of the sanctions. In some people's opinion, the Slovene surplus in trade with Macedonia is also ending up in Serbia. Josip Skoberne rejects such hints. "Slovenia does not border directly on Serbia. Consequently, they should not ask us how Slovene goods have ended up in Serbia; instead, they should ask our neighbors first--the Greeks, Romanians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, and also the Croats and Macedonians. Our data on exports to Serbia's neighbors also indicate that exports, with the exception of Macedonia, are not growing, and instead have decreased. And if Slovene products are ending up in Serbian shops, the producer does not necessarily even know about it; it can be due to the middlemen, dealers." Finally, the Croats and Serbs are also trading actively with each other, not to mention the Greeks, who are the craftiest merchants in the world and Serbia's allies. Joze Drofenik, head of the republic coordinating group for implementing sanctions against the FRY, confirms that Slovene violations of the embargo are rare. The Security Council takes care of oversight at Serbian border crossings, and Slovenia controls its own borders. If a Slovene enterprise turns up among the suspected violators, the proper authorities receive information about it, and the suspects, if the violation of the sanctions is proven (there are difficulties in proving it, to be sure), also pay monetary fines, and the goods are confiscated. Any consideration of future economic relations with Serbia and Montenegro, or the FRY, just as in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina, starts with a condition: if (when) the Security Council sanctions are lifted, when the war is over, and when transportation routes are opened... The resounding declaration that the FRY and Croatia recently signed, to be sure, does not bring any sort of guarantees that relations between the signatories will really be normalized. If it does contribute to opening transportation routes to Eastern Europe, that will be of great significance for the Slovene economy as well, Skoberne thinks. The Chamber and the economy particularly favor the idea of a free trade zone, and forms of trade with mutually accorded privileges (in all former Yugoslav republics). There will not be free trade, for which an agreement obviously has to be reached at the state level, if politics prevails over sound peasant intelligence, they think. "Free trade means benefits for both partners, especially with respect to third parties, developed ones. Finally, we already have experience with free trade in the former Yugoslavia." State institutions, as far as the FRY is concerned, are somewhat more restrained, saying that regulation of mutual relations at the institutional level is a matter for both sides, for coordination of interests, for negotiations. Vojka Ravbar, secretary in the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development, says: "It is hard for me to say how we will negotiate with Serbia. When political relations are normalized, after a UN resolution, we will try to establish normal economic relations. Time, and also Serbian interests, will show whether it will be a free trade area, and at how high a level relations will be. Specifically, it is usually harder for the weaker partner to decide on liberalization, since it has to protect its own economy against outside competition. There are usually transitional periods for it, and agreements are a result of hard negotiations. We therefore expect a gradual normalization of economic relations, to which the former commercial ties, knowledge, and experience in that market will contribute." The former republics' share in total Slovene sales will never be 30 percent again. There is no reason, however, for it to remain at last year's 6 percent. It can increase substantially; about 20 percent would be a logical, realistic level, naturally under normal conditions, Josip Skoberne of the GZS thinks. When the war and the embargo are over, trade in spare parts can begin very quickly. There are a multitude of products, technical items, capital equipment, machines and devices, in the former Yugoslavia that are associated with a brand and a producer. It will all need to be serviced and rebuilt. Since there will be difficulties in payment, the enterprises that have experience in supplying the southern markets are already thinking about what goods they will buy in exchange for what is exported; they will conclude barter arrangements. And if, or rather where, there are free trade zones, the partners will trade in products which that market is already accepting, but which are noncompetitive in demanding Western markets.
