He called the proposal of Dushanbe to initiate unilateral disarmament of the opposition's armed formations as unacceptable. For its part, the Tajik opposition proposed to start bilateral disarmament under the supervision of representatives from the UN, CSCE, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Kazakhstan, the expert said. The opposition insists that the Interior and Security Ministries' forces be disarmed as well. The opposition proposes that Russian forces carry out the functions of the republic's security bodies during a replacement of the staffs of those bodies. The expert added that the parties continue examining proposals on a cease-fire brought forward by the UN General Secretary Special Envoy Ramiro Piriz Ballon. Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax Akbar Turadzhonzoda, co-chairman of the Movement for Tajikistan's Islamic Revival, declared that the opposition "does not strive for power" and is ready to participate in national elections. However, as he said, it is necessary to permit the activity of all political parties, to publish newspapers irrespective of their political orientation, and to release political prisoners in order to hold these elections. A popular government, made up of those who have not stained themselves by "the fratricide war," should rule the country during the preparation for the elections and adoption of the republic's Constitution, Turadzhonzoda said.
