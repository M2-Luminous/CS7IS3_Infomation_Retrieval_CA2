Silvio Berlusconi has retreated to his villa at Maccherio; Umberto Bossi has gone to Ponte di Legno; Gianfranco Fini has gone to Anzio; Achille Occhetto has gone to Monchiano in the Maremma area of Tuscany. The leaders will rest for a further 24 hours before returning to Rome on Tuesday [5 April]. On Wednesday, there will be a fresh round of meetings in order to form a government -- a task which has proved to be more difficult than at first thought. Bossi has said that he does not want Berlusconi to be the prime minister and once again he has stressed his federalist demands. He is also threatening to boycott the government, and to this end he has set up a number of meetings with the electoral losers. Fini has warned Bossi not to make too many demands; Berlusconi is keeping quiet but the Forza Italia clubs have asked for Bossi's loyalty. The strategies at the center of the Freedom Alliance seem to be diverging. Giuseppe Mazzei reports: [Mazzei] Victory was easy, but government is more difficult for the center-right coalition. It now emerges that the losers have also rejoined the game. Who would have thought it? The Alliance enjoys a big majority in the Chamber of Deputies and has practically put a working majority together in the Senate; everything seemed clear. Five years of stable government under the leadership of the victor, Silvio Berlusconi. However, Bossi has taken it upon himself to wreck the party; he has taken center stage away from Berlusconi, claimed it for himself, and is seeking to keep Fini out of the game altogether. He is scared that his influence will wane in any long-term government, and so he is brandishing his sword: federalism now, coupled with constitutional changes, and in one year's time, according to Gianfranco Miglio's reckoning, Italy will be transformed into another country. On this point nobody can attack Bossi, and so he plays his trump card; in order to win he is prepared to ally himself with the devil. He wants to hold talks with Mario Segni and even with the left. For Occhetto and his friends, who are still in shock at the election defeat, Umberto the Terrible could offer an escape route. He will tell them that, if they do not want five years of unassailable center-right government, they should form an alliance for federalism with him. A constituent government would be formed, and a fresh election would be called within a year. For the losers this will be a temptation hard to resist. The chess match has still to get under way.
