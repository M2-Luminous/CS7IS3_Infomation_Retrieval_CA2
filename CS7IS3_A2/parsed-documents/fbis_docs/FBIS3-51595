The alleged military conspirators presumably had the help of Former Interior Minister Antonio Arguedas (1966-68) and the (national) prosecutor at that time, Juan Carlos Camacho, who have been arrested and will be arraigned before the courts charged with conspiracy. Quiroga told FIDES that military men are presumably involved, including some high-ranking officers, who are discontent with the most recent list of promotions issued in December by the High Military Command. The minister also warned that these military men, whose identity he did not reveal, "are going to be investigated in accordance with the internal military rules and regulations, in order to entirely clarify the case that has been the constant concern of the nation over the past few days." The "concern" to which the minister referred relates to the public apparition, through the English-language weekly BOLIVIAN TIMES in its 23 December and 11 January issues, of a former sergeant named Ernesto Beltran Gardiazabal. This former military man confessed that he had participated in the infamous attacks and political murders that occurred in Bolivia during the 1960's, which he attributes to the anticommunist "military lodges" that were active at that time, while also promising to provide the details known to him after having been assured of guarantees from the government and the judicial branch. After the Government Ministry and the La Paz Prosecutor's Office offered the guarantees, the imaginary sergeant never put in an appearance. It was then that government and military intelligence services began to investigate the motives behind the sudden reappearance of events that had occurred some 25 years ago. According to Quiroga the investigation confirms that Beltran Gardiazabal never existed, having been invented by the conspirators with the help of Arguedas and Camacho "with the objective of destabilizing the democratic government, thus setting it against the Armed Forces." Arguedas is a singular personality, having in 1968 become famous for sending Fidel Castro the hands and campaign diary of Ernesto Che Guevara, who had been executed in 1967 in Bolivia. After many years of ostracism, Arguedas, who in general is considered to be a typical "double agent," reappeared on the political scene. Quiroga told FIDES that the group of discontent military men finally turned to Aguedas to fabricate the "Beltran case," with the purpose of preparing an action to destabilize the current government in a confrontation with the Armed Forces.
