What brought about the LDP's collapse after over 37 years of one-party rule? What steps should it be considering next? To find out, we asked party elder and lower house member Masaharu Gotoda. Nagata-cho Logic, Political Reporters [Takakazu Matsuda] One of the things you've been saying for quite awhile is: "If the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] doesn't carry out political reform, it's going to see hell." How do you view the political situation today, now that there's been a change of administrations? [Masaharu Gotoda] When I made that comment, what I meant to say, first of all, was that, if we didn't take another look at our political system and make changes while we could, the issue of political reform would get gridlocked in the Diet and the objective situation at home and abroad would have completely changed. Political reform is something that should be undertaken at the hands of the LDP as the ruling party. If we don't do it, I was saying, we'll see hell. By "hell," I was referring to the day when people would no longer have any trust in parliamentary politics and just throw up their hands and turn away from government. That kind of climate, I was saying, would be very dangerous for our country. In another sense, I was saying that, if the present political situation continues, there will be no end to the corruption surrounding politics, and there would no longer be any clear line between money and politics. There would be a growing distrust of politicians and government among the people, and the end result, I was saying, would be the collapse of parliamentary democracy in this country. I meant the statement as a warning, but unfortunately, the party's reign came to a close. I guess you can say, a new bud has sprouted. So we can hope, at least as far as restoring the image of government is concerned, that the Hosokawa administration can carry out its work without any undue confusion and disorder. For me, the LDP is a very important political party. But in a real sense, the most important thing, as far as our citizens are concerned, is that we create the kind of environment where they have a definite sense that government exists in Japan. So, for us, the Hosokawa administration is like a partner and here, on this point, I would like to see it succeed. [Matsuda] What was one of the reasons you thought the LDP would be "seeing hell"? [Gotoda] First of all, there are certain background factors to consider. Until recently, the ideological confrontation between East and West was carried over and projected into the confrontation in this country between the ruling and opposition parties. That's gone now. The LDP has come this far by having successfully pursued policies as a member of the democratic camp. The age of ideologies has literally disappeared. But the LDP is still living in the age when there was one-party rule. It has become careless, thinking that things will somehow turn out as it wants. It still has an arrogant "do if we dare" attitude about itself. Also, there's the turbidity that comes with having maintained power for a long time. The raison d'etre for political parties is usually to gain power and put their ideologies into action. But the opposition has neither that kind of ability nor vitality. But because of that ideological tension in the background, the opposition does serve a positive role for the country in restraining [the power of the ruling party]. When that confrontation no longer exists, the opposition exists without a role. So, what happens between opposition and ruling parties is the kind of government where they rely on each other and work in collusion with each other behind the scenes. To put it in a less flattering way, they build up a mutual relationship while licking each other's wounds. People no longer understand that [kind of mentality]. So, we get the phrase "Nagata-cho logic." According to this kind of logic, politicians get things done with easy-going, behind-the-scenes maneuvering. This is all pretty far removed from the average citizen. They might not have a clear understanding of what's going on, but somehow they sense something odd is happening. So, when a scandal breaks, they say, "What? Again!" and they end up distrusting government even more. I'm sorry to say, it is the mass media that is to blame. It's the fault of those who are assigned to cover us politicians. Even when they know something is going on, they don't report what's really happening. A give-and-take relationship develops between the reporter who is assigned to cover the politician and the politician he's been assigned to. I think this works as a big negative for Japanese politics. Those in the mass media are directing some pretty harsh criticisms at the government but, from our perspective, they haven't really gotten the truth out. In the end, reporters and the politicians they're reporting on naturally begin to take up the same breathing pattern. Prerequisites for Being Prime Minister [Matsuda] What you say hits home. But to turn your argument around somewhat, wasn't it former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka who abused the assigned-reporter system the most and made it into what it is? [Gotoda] The change of administrations this time marks the end of Tanaka-style politics. In other words, the quarrel over who was to succeed (Noboru) Takeshita was a struggle over the Tanaka legacy, and it threw the entire party into disarray, leaving us with what we have today. It was a real pain for the other factions. That's why (Ichiro) Ozawa (secretary general, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) didn't try to become party president. (Ryutaro) Hashimoto (chairman, LDP Policy Research Council) has the potential to become president. But he didn't even try to get nominated. It's a period for him for self-examination--which, I think, is good. Probably he's looking over the political scene, knowing he should take a term or two to quietly reflect on his situation. [Matsuda] For a time there was a "Gotoda, [LDP] presidential hopeful" theory going around. [Gotoda] Not as far I was concerned. When there's a change of government, like the one now, people expect big changes. They want someone fresh and new, not the head of some faction who's like merchandise that's been on the floor for a long time. I'm too old. Unlike before, today's prime minister is on the run all the time. Generally speaking, he has to be about 60 or thereabouts and be in good health and have lots of energy, or else he isn't going to do this country any good. I wouldn't have the stamina to keep up. There's also another reason. You'll find it happening in a company, a government office, wherever. Usually, he's a section head or in that class. When he reaches 40 or so, say until he's in his mid-40's, there is something in the air or something about him that makes people think, "that guy is going to be a top company executive" or "someday he's going to be vice minister." It's the same with politicians, isn't it? After someone has been reelected to his fourth or fifth or sixth term, people are going to think, "there's a chance that guy is going to be prime minister someday." But, then, there's the guy, totally devoid of that kind of atmosphere, who tries and makes it. It's all really very unfortunate for the country. [Matsuda] Does (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa have that air about him? [Gotoda] Yes, he does. It's his upbringing. The Hosokawa cabinet had a good start, which I thought was very good for the country. If you ask yourself why his administration has been able to get a 70-percent voter approval rating, it's a reaction by the voters. They were disillusioned with existing political parties, especially with the LDP and Social Democratic Party of Japan, and wanted something new. That feeling, I think, has something to do with the new administration's positive ratings and was fueled to some degree by the mass media. Whether the administration can maintain those ratings or not depends on its performance from here on out. The test will probably come in three basic areas: political reform, emergency economic policy, and the economy's medium- and long-range restructuring. The degree to which the Hosokawa cabinet succeeds in these areas will determine its worth. If it succeeds, it'll find itself a niche in history. [Matsuda] What, then, in the midst of all this should the LDP be doing? [Gotoda] We're looking into a number of reform proposals--for example, into an age limit of 70 and the dissolution of party factions. Nothing startling or unexpected. [Matsuda] Can you go for a system that imposes an age limit of 70? It will be like cutting your own throat. [Gotoda] It doesn't bother me. Mandatory age limits are something we should have. As for our factional system, it has presented too many obstacles in the past. On the other hand, we can't have some 200-plus members of the lower house running around every which way. Of course, some of them are on top of any developments in our committees or affecting national politics as a whole. Some have a half-way decent understanding of what's happening. Others don't know what's happening. And so, to discuss policy matters and share information, there have to be meetings of various sorts--by region, for example, or with regard to specific policy issues, or by the number of terms one has served in the Diet. The most important point here is that there be avenues for communication. All 200-odd members of the party can't be together all at once, so we have to have some alternative means to communicate. But it's best to dissolve the kind of factions we've had until now. Factions will have to be dissolved. It'll happen, like it or not, if our political contributions system is reformed. Practices like leaving it up to the factions to see to whatever funds are necessary for routine political activities or helping out with contributions when elections are held are probably going to be a thing of the past. The day for that has come, so there is no need to fight it. Shedding Old Ways To Become a `Party of Trust' [Matsuda] Would it be necessary to place age limits on the heads of local governments, too? [Gotoda] If you look at what's happening these days, with so many gubernatorial and mayoral elections, you naturally begin to wonder whether it wouldn't be better to impose restrictions. That way, voters would be able to focus their attention again on national politics. [Matsuda] In planning its comeback, does the LDP have any strategies with regard to national policy? [Gotoda] There's the issue of the tax system. I wonder if voters are going to go along with the idea of simply lowering the income tax while raising the consumption tax. It will mean higher taxes for the less affluent voter who is living on a tight budget. Voters who have fatter wallets are the ones who are going to benefit from an income tax cut. In a situation like that, if you ask whether you can raise the consumption tax rate, I would say, no, probably not. Then, you're going to have to consider the consumption tax in regard to specific items. Some items--like food, for example--are necessities whether you're rich or poor, and you're going to have to consider how such items are going to be handled. Or, to give another example, how much of the consumption tax is going to be shifted to the social security system? At what percentage will the ratio be held between the tax burden and the social security burden. Questions like this must be clarified. Sitting at roundtable discussions these days, I'm always asked the same question: "Sensei [teacher], people like me are now contributing to the pension system, but when we retire, will we be getting the same kind of benefits that others are getting now?" Everyone is worried. We have to give very clear answers to those kinds of questions and then say, "We can't do everything at once. This year we'll do this, next year we'll do that." We want voters to have an image of us of the sort where they're going to say, "The LDP is seriously studying the issues. It's a party we can depend on." Then, when that happens, we'll win in the elections. There is no reason at all, I think, for the party to lose confidence. How much confidence does an opposition party with a collection of 50 or 60 members have? There's no way a major party with 227 members in the lower house alone will lose confidence. [Matsuda] What do you see happening in terms of the political situation in the future? [Gotoda] The realignment, or regrouping, of parties due to the change of administrations is just the first step, I think. Depending on the objective situation, there may be as many as two or three further regroupings. Whether that will happen before or after the next election or the election after that I can't say. But it's still my opinion that there will be more realignments. Although I personally think it will be hard to get to the point where we have a two-party system, the aim of political reform is an electoral system--namely, a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation--that, in effect, creates the kind of situation where there are two major opposing parties, with political power alternating between the two. Two major political forces engage in a healthy face-off. Sometimes they switch off and the other party is in power. It's a political relationship with a certain degree of tension. And because of that, Japan's parliamentary government is invigorated. That, I think, will happen. It's what political reform means. Political contributions, the electoral system--they're means, not ends. They are a way of getting our foot in the door so we can create the kind of political situation I've just described. [Matsuda] To change the subject, what is your opinion of (Ichiro) Ozawa? [Gotoda] I'm not sure. His political skills are impressive and I respect him for all the effort he's seemingly putting into political reform. But, if I were to consider just what I've read in print about him, I'd think he had a dangerous leaning toward national hegemony. I would frankly have to admit having certain misgivings about him. Friendly U.S.-Japan Relationship Is Fundamental [Matsuda] There is a lot of talk about Komeito being an issue for the Hosokawa cabinet. [Gotoda] It will be a problem unless we can get a clear separation between church and state. I'd hate to see the day when religious antagonisms are brought in to plague us domestically. Komeito says a separation between church and state exists, but that's certainly not the impression I get. [Matsuda] Recently, at the general meeting of the Watanabe faction and elsewhere, LDP president Yohei Kono's pro-Constitution stance has been criticized. [Gotoda] To be sure, there's that kind of criticism. But if we take that attitude, we'll end up being isolated outcasts in Asia. It's what you call being a national supremacist. What other Asian countries fear most is a remilitarized Japan. [They have] the plutonium and the technology to make nuclear bombs at any time. The manufacturing ability exists to make any number of them. So, we can't have Japan go overseas and start using its military power. By then, warnings will be too late. The most important thing for us to consider now is maintaining friendly relations with the United States. We can't be a dependent state. When something has to be said, we shouldn't hold back. But at the same time, an amicable relationship between our two countries is basic. So, in dealing with Asian countries, we have to make sure we include the United States. Don't leave the United States out and try to go it alone. That's basic. [Matsuda] How do you feel about Prime Minister Hosokawa's "war of aggression" pronouncement? [Gotoda] That I can't agree with. Colonialism isn't good, and certainly an apology to Korea is called for. I would also acknowledge that [ours] was a war of aggression against China. But there's absolutely no reason at all for apologies from us concerning World War II. That's because it was a war waged for world hegemony between two super-camps--on the one hand, Japan, Germany, and Italy; and, on the other, England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The only difference between us is that we lost. There's no need to apologize later. But, in the process, Japan occupied other Asian countries. That wasn't good. But you also had Indonesia under Dutch rule, the Philippines under U.S. rule, and Singapore under British rule. So, when the time came, Japan felt compelled to do what it did. But that's speaking like a disinterested third party. In the end, I guess you could say our actions were inexcusable. Masaharu Gotoda. Born in 1914 in Tokushima Prefecture.
