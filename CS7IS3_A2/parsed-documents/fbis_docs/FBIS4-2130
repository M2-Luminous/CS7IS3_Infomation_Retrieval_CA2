FBIS4-2130 "drchi066_l_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Science & Technology Space Probe Obtains `Important' Technical Data Space Probe Obtains `Important' Technical Data OW0504104994 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0807 GMT 5 Apr 94 OW0504104994 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- This reporter has learned from the relevant department of the Chinese Space Technology Research Academy that the "Shijian [Practice] No. 4" space probe satellite, launched by China earlier, has been running safely in its fixed orbit for two months. All logistical systems on the satellite have been operating normally, and all payloads for probing the space environment and studying environmental effects have obtained important data. Currently, all instruments inside the satellite are continuously transmitted probing data to the ground. "Shijian No. 4," which was developed by the China Space Designing Institute's Beijing Spacecraft General Designing Department, was launched to its predetermined orbit with a Changzheng [Long March] No. 3 rocket carrier on 8 February. After two months of tests in space, instruments inside the satellites have functioned normally and have obtained a series of useful reference materials. Through tests under adverse conditions in synchronous orbit for 20 days, the original data put into the "ultraviolet ray erasable and programmable read only memory," an instrument for measuring single particle effects in space, are totally wiped out by the secondary radiation caused by high-energy particles in space. After functioning for 19 days, the central processing unit's dynamic single particle monitor arrested a serious lock-in effect from an instrument inside the satellite. The "lock-in effect" caused an "overflow protection" phenomenon in the secondary power supply system inside the satellite. After the ground command rebooted the instruments, they resumed normal functioning. It is understood that the preliminary results obtained from the current space probe can give technical explanations for computer breakdowns that occurred previously in satellites. The contingency measures taken by the "Shijian No. 4" under special circumstances will provide invaluable experiences for improving satellite computers' adaptability to the space environment. According to a briefing, since 26 March the "Shijian No. 4" flight control group and the Xian Satellite Monitoring and Control Center have worked intensively for more than a week and used remote-control command to successfully switch the power supply system inside the satellite from nickel-cadmium to nickel-hydrogen accumulators. Used by China for the first time in spacecraft, the nickel-hydrogen accumulator is a kind of space energy with great potential.
