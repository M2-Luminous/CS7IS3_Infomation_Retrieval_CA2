The upper ceiling for investment return and the land value-added tax rate set by the detailed regulations are likely to be around 50 percent, which is lower than the original ceiling, and thus guarantees that investors will make profits. When China issued the "Interim Regulations on Land Value-Added Tax" at the end of last year, there were strong repercussions among real estate investors at home and abroad. Property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, in particular, poured out endless grievances and reacted strongly, with numerous queries and criticisms. They pointed out: By setting the value-added tax at 30-60 percent and collecting income tax, property investment companies will have to pay 73 percent of taxes at the high end or 53 percent at the low end, which makes business practically unprofitable. Over the past few months, both developers and professionals have raised many views with the mainland authorities through various channels. Many property developers in Hong Kong and Taiwan said: Property investment involves high risks, a huge volume of investment, and a long cycle of investment. If the mainland authorities overlook developers' loan interest rates, inflation, and other factors and deliberately bring down investment returns, it will be difficult to attract foreign capital. According to many overseas property developers and professionals, the speculation and huge-profit-making activities on the mainland property market are primarily caused by man-made factors. Taking advantage of their positions to seek private gains, some local officials collude with businessmen eager for quick success and instant profits. As a result, the phenomena of indiscriminately enclosing or approving lands for property development and speculating on building lots have emerged in some localities. Even the practice of obtaining "building lots through favors or brief informal notes" has been observed. This phenomena has significantly contributed to the dramatic loss of state-owned land revenue. These problems cannot be solved by relying exclusively on the collection of land value-added tax, but should be restricted and standardized by strict measures and regulations. On a public occasion the other day, Ma Kewei, deputy director of the State Land Administration Bureau, admitted that there were indeed serious cases of non-observance of the law in the mainland property market. He said: Most of those speculating on building lots and making huge profits are those who have backgrounds, connections, and brief informal notes. These people can speculate on building lots without using capital. Ma also pointed out: Some local officials are eager to develop the economy and have an inappropriate understanding of land. Thinking that the economy can be developed by releasing land, they approve vast pieces of land at extremely low prices, thus providing some foreign businessmen with an opportunity to make huge profits. Since the beginning of the year, the relevant department officials have repeatedly stated that the aims of introducing the land value-added tax are as follows: First, we must stabilize land and property market development and suppress speculation and profiteering so that the real estate industry can develop in a healthy manner and so that only the best survive on the market. Second, we must rationally regulate land appreciation earnings by returning to the state the portion of natural land appreciation belonging to the state, i.e. the portion of land appreciation due primarily to government investment in the infrastructure; and third, to protect the legitimate business of investors and ensure the legitimate profits of developers. Although mainland officials are prudent about the detailed regulations, they have explicitly indicated that the regulations will fully embody the rational views of developers and professionals and try as far as possible to make tax burdens fair and rational, so that developers can make profits. As the detailed regulations for the implementation of land value-added tax have yet to be made public, there is still some uncertainty. For the first three months of this year, overseas developers have been adopting a wait-and-see attitude. This has prompted local governments and Hong Kong and Taiwan developers to call for the early release of the detailed regulations, lest it dampen investment enthusiasm and hinder the normal growth of the property market, which is still at an early stage of development.
