FBIS4-53929 "dreas100_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 South Korea Seoul Dailies Assess ROK-U.S. Sausage Dispute Seoul Dailies Assess ROK-U.S. Sausage Dispute SK2205115294 SK2205115294 BFN [Editorial Report] On 22 May, ROK vernacular newspapers carry editorials and an article on the ongoing sausage dispute between the ROK and the United States. On page 3, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial entitled, "Customs Clearance of Deficient Sausages Cannot by Any Means Be Allowed--Rather Than Dissolving the Trade Friction, National Health Must Be Thought About First." The editorial starts off by explaining how the ROK and the United States are in discord because of the sausages. It criticizes the United States for continuing to pressure the ROK to import deficient sausages that are detrimental to people's health. Noting that the United States may suspend the extension of the economic cooperation dialogue between the two countries; apply the Super 301 Section; and present the sausage dispute issue to the GATT, it stresses that the ROK must take resolute measures regarding this issue. It continues to emphasize that the people must not be allowed to eat such deficient sausages, urging that such a situation must be appealed to international organizations and the world's public opinion. The editorial concludes by saying that the government must never forget the fact that the settlement of the trade friction is important, but protecting the national health is more important. On page 7, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word article by reporter An Chae-sung entitled, "The U.S. Trade Strategy as Revealed in the Sausage Dispute." The article starts off by saying that a U.S. Government document, obtained by HANGYORE SINMUN regarding the ROK-U.S. sausage dispute, notes that the U.S. State Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Embassy in the ROK, and ROK sausage manufacturers importing sausages are making all kinds of efforts to resolve the sausage issue. It says that since no result has been achieved, the U.S. side is actively examining the possibility of using the Super 301 Section as a weapon to resolve the sausage dispute. The article continues to criticize the U.S. rationale on why it is inevitable to apply the Super 301 Section if the sausage dispute is not resolved. This editorial also says that the trade dispute between the ROK and the United States is not only limited to the sausage dispute but to the overall U.S. agricultural products and foodstuffs. On page 3, CHUNGANG ILBO carried a 700-word editorial entitled, "Is the Super 301 Section Everything?" The editorial begins to express concern by saying that the strong measures the United States is planning to take against the ROK regarding the sausage dispute not only establishes a bad precedent in the ROK-U.S. trade, but it will also arouse the people's sentiment. It notes the one-sided theory of a big power saying that it will apply the Super 301 Section if the ROK does not abide by the U.S. demand. The editorial continues to note that the sausage dispute is an issue related to the safety of foodstuffs. It concludes by saying that foodstuffs officials from the two countries must exchange opinions on the safety of foodstuffs, and not carry out trade retaliations. On page 3, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial entitled, "Codfish Heads and the Super 301 Section." The editorial starts off by expressing disappointment over the government's decision to import U.S. codfish heads. Notes that such a decision was made because of the U.S. retaliation threat to apply the Super 301 Section if the codfish heads are not imported. Citing that such a threat also exists on the ongoing sausage dispute, the editorial urges the government to discuss this matter with related ministries and take resolute measures. The editorial concludes by saying that a resolution can be achieved in the sausage dispute and the codfish import issue only when a consistent trade strategy and tactic are established.
