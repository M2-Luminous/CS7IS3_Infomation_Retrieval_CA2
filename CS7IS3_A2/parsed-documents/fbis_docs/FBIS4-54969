It is being marked for the first time this year, with the support, and participation, of the International Federation of Journalists, which represents 320,000 journalists from 75 countries, including the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Syndicate of Journalists [SSN] as a specialized professional and nonpolitical organization issued a statement on this occasion, which it made available to the TA SR. It states, among other things, that fundamental changes in the status of the mass communications media and in the building of the independent position of journalists took place in Slovakia after November 1989. "In spite of this we observe attempts, which we regard as a relapse into past practices, to politically control media, which should serve the public and not narrow political interests." According to the SSN, this has been documented in the last few days by the events surrounding the Slovak Television Council. The SSN goes on to draw attention to the fact that Slovak Radio is short of 8 million korunas a month, even though it has already reduced the number of radio stations it operates from three to two. Due to economic pressures, Slovak Radio abolished last year 125 permanent posts of editors and other creative workers. In the process of transformation, the media has found itself in a complicated economic situation. The SSN considers it essential that stable economic conditions be created for the press, radio, and television. A system of support, which is quite common in democratic countries, must be established where necessary for the democratic and pluralistic operation of the media. The SSN regards as optimal a combination of indirect and direct support.
