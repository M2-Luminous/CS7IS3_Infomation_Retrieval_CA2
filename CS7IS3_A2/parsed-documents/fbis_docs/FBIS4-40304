[Begin recording] [Correspondent N. Miroshnik] Before the State Duma delegation left by air for Germany, delegation head Ivan Rybkin said that the program of the trip includes a visit to the Western Group of Forces, and a meeting with commander General Burlakov. On the subject of providing facilities for servicemen, the speaker gave assurances: [Rybkin] The sums in the budget allocated for paying servicemen's wages are protected, that is they cannot be removed or reduced under any conditions. [Miroshnik] Servicemen in this case, like cultural institutions, are put on a level with the least protected strata of society -- children and veterans. A total of 40.6 trillion rubles has been allocated for defense in the new budget, and, Rybkin believes, this sum is sufficient for the normal maintenance of the Army. [Rybkin] For the first time in the past three years, the Army has a firmly fixed sum for its maintenance. [Miroshnik] Furthermore, 1.2 trillion rubles has been put in a non-budgetary fund. It is expected that this money will be received from the income from monetary privatization. Experts believe that the actual income from that will be no less than 12 trillion rubles, and in this case: [Rybkin] All the income from privatization in excess of 1.2 trillion rubles will go toward building housing for servicemen and toward conversion.
