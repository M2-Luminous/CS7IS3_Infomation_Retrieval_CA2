The decision to grant him a visa marks a reversal of President Clinton's ruling last November. Then Mr Adams was refused entry on the grounds that he was involved in devising IRA strategy at the highest level -- that as, a terrorist. Since then things have changed. But an underlying consistency can nevertheless be discerned. For a start, the visit takes place under tight constraints. Mr Adams is in New York to attend a conference on Northern Ireland organised by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, whose honorary chairman is the former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. (The other sides in the Ulster conflict have also been invited, although Unionist politicians have refused to attend.) Mr Adams is not allowed to engage in fundraising and he is barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York. While the Sinn Fein president no doubt hopes to persuade the Irish-American lobby to put pressure on the Clinton Administration to intervene on behalf of the republican cause, pressure can also work the other way. A conference such as the present one provides a prime opportunity for interested American parties to make clear to Mr Adams that present developments provide a chance for peace which should not be wasted. Mr Clinton's original plan to send a peace envoy to the province was rapidly watered down after the presidential elections in the face of resistance from the British Government. The permission for Mr Adams to attend the New York conference may be a sign that Washington is adopting a more subtle approach. Last November the speaker of the House of Representatives, Tom Foley, noted that Sinn Fein could be part of constitutional talks if there was a genuine and convincing repudiation of paramilitary violence. It is a message which must be repeated to Mr Adams. He is seen now as a possible instrument for peace -- but he must also be reminded that he is an obstacle to it as well. The Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneux boasted in his interview with THE SCOTSMAN that he had succeeded in removing all the meat from the Downing Street declaration. If that claim is to be gainsayed, the U.S. may have to lean on Mr Major and persuade him to begin turning the sentiments expressed in the document into reality: Their task will be made that much easier if they have first gained concessions from Adams.
