The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said yesterday such actors as the technological level of the domestic aerospace industry and access to the world market after development have led it to opt for international cooperation instead of a purely Korean effort. But when international cooperation is hard to come by, the ministry said, Korean firms will have to work on their own after introducing foreign technology. The ministry also said the prototype aircraft will be developed by a consortium comprising all three Korean aircraft assemblers--Samsung Aerospace Industries, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air. This decision goes against Samsung's insistence that the development program be carried out by one single prime contractor to ensure control of the whole program. The consortium, however, will be led by one company. To select it, the ministry will soon form a committee, which will map out criteria for the leading firm and send request for proposals (RFP) to the three candidates. The ministry's decision, following advice by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), has put the three firms in fierce competition to gain designation as the leading company. The final selection is expected to be made in May this year. The consortium, after being formed, will seek participation from advanced foreign companies into the Korean commuter development program. The ministry will leave it to the consortium to decide on how large the envisaged aircraft should be. Originally, it planned to develop a 50-seat commuter craft, but Daewoo and KAL opposed the idea on the grounds that a 50-seat aircraft would not be profitable. The government plans to complete the development program by 1998 at an estimated cost of 279 billion won (about $344 million). Over half of the cost will be shouldered by the government. The development program will be promoted in four divisions--overall management, aircraft development, design verification and certification. Except for the actual development work, other jobs will be handled by relevant professional research organizations, the ministry said. The ministry intends to finalize its development plan in March after acquiring endorsement from the deliberation committee on aerospace industry development. The medium-sized commuter development program is part of the government efforts to foster the domestic aerospace industry. By developing an exportable commuter, it intends to secure core aircraft design and testing technology, put the industry on a solid growth path and reduce deficits in the nation's aircraft manufacturers. According to a report by KARI, the international medium-sized commuter industry, unlike the large aircraft (over 100 seats) industry, is not dominated by an oligopoly, implying that entry by Korea will not be difficult. The institute forecast that the break-even point for Korea will be about 180 aircraft. The ministry expects that by 2010, Korea will have a domestic demand of 170 medium-sized commuters. by then, it hopes,the domestic aerospace industry will also be able to export 50 to 100 commuter aircraft.
