A vicious cycle is at play because the regions are so poor, qualified educators cannot be enticed to stay and improve the schools. Then the students who attend -- or more likely, drop out of -- the substandard schools do not acquire the skills and knowledge needed to bring about progressive economic growth. Adding to the problem, native students who have been sent to study in other areas of the country quite often refuse to come back after graduation. The shortage of talented teachers endangers the very existence of some of the schools in minority regions. Low salaries and bad working and living conditions for the teachers are to blame, according to Hu Shiqiang, a professor at Yunnan Normal University. Yet even if a good teacher stays, the poor facilities of the schools make it difficult to carry out many educational programmes. Of course, having good teachers and facilities is pointless unless the school has students. But in the minority areas, economic pressures keep many students out of school. In the rural areas of Inner Mongolia, the annual expenses of a primary school or high-school student in a peasant's family is about 100 yuan ($11), Wang said. But many minority families have more than one child and very low incomes, and they can't pay for all of their children to go to school at the same time. As a result, many peasants stop their children's schooling after primary school. Similar problems plague Yunnan, according to Hu. For example, a student of the Lisu nationality who was admitted into a university had to refuse the offer even though he would receive a 30-yuan ($3) monthly allowance and transportation expenses between his home and the university. "I am grateful to the goodwill of the departments concerned, but this can only solve my own problem, and not that of my family, who depend on me to make both ends meet," said the student. And now, schooling costs are getting even steeper. The traditional educational system that enabled students to receive college education largely at governmental expense is changing, due to the establishment of the market economy. Most students now have to pay some of the tuition themselves. Hu offered several suggestions to overcome the roadblocks to educational progress. First, the government should allocate special funds to the regions to improve the school facilities and the teachers' living and working conditions. Teachers working in such areas should be offered higher salaries than their counterparts in other regions. Secondly, scholarships and allowances should be provided to a certain proportion of students from poor minority areas. Thirdly, the central government should establish an educational fund encouraging teachers who devote themselves to ethnic education in the remote and under-developed regions. In addition, Hu suggested that the educational administrations should make it clear that college graduates from other areas can return to their home towns for work after five to eight years of teaching in minority nationality areas.
