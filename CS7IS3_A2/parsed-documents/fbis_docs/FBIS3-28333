The idea of replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax with the welfare tax in April 1997 was not conceived "abruptly" as widely reported, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a regular press conference. The idea resulted from full-fledged discussion on reform of the tax system that was launched by the government's tax commission last September, Kumano said. Creation of the best tax system to meet the needs of the graying society was one of the aims Hosokawa mentioned in a new year speech and the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, an advisory body to the premier, called for a system suitable on a long-term basis toward the next century. The Social Democratic Party, the largest party in the ruling coalition, dismissed the welfare tax as having been announced without proper procedures being followed among parties concerned. Apparently in response to strong criticism of the new tax from both the SDP and the public, Hosokawa retracted the original proposal a day after announcing it. At present, views are being coordinated to form a new consensus among the seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is waiting for "a political decision" to settle the matter, Kumano said.
