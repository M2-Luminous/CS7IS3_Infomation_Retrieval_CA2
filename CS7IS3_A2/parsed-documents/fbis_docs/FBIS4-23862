The administration of almost 800 regional laws was involved. The transfer included almost all laws dealing with housing and health. The provinces would also receive almost all the laws administered by the now-defunct TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing territories. "The transfer of such major executive powers to provincial governments represents a significant step towards bringing government to the people," Dr Skweyiya told a press conference in Pretoria. All the powers vested in the administrations of the four former provinces, the TBVC states and the self-governing territories were temporarily transferred to the central government two weeks ago. The constitution lays down that the provinces will execute certain exclusive powers in the areas of urban development, local government, nature conservation and roads, among others. It is these powers that are being transferred. In addition, there are other powers which are exercised jointly by the provinces and central government, such as policing powers. These second-phase powers would be transferred to provincial governments as soon as possible, Dr Skweyiya indicated. He said education laws were in the process of being revised and that the education powers of the former provinces were not yet being transferred to the provinces. However, the education powers of the former TBVC states and self-governing territories were being transferred. "The remainder of the executive powers to be executed by the new provincial governments will be transferred to them as soon as possible. Substantial amendments to these laws, however, are required before any transfer can be affected. Significant progress has been made in this regard. "The transfer of these executive powers to the new provinces will have to be accompanied by a restructuring of the relevant government administrations. This is being attended to." He said the deployment of powers between national and provincial governments constituted one of the fundamental aspects of the new constitution. Dr Skweyiya has been consulting provincial premiers and public service corps around the country for the past month.
