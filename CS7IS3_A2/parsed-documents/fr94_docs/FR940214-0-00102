No. 139&hyph;20] RIN 2120&hyph;AF26 Airport Certification; Amendment of the Compliance Date for Signs Identifying Taxiing Routes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends a final rule issued without notice based upon comments received in response to that final rule. This final rule amends the compliance date for certain sign requirements required under the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for airports certificated under 14 CFR part 139. The compliance date for these sign requirements expired on January 1, 1994. This amendment will provide the time necessary for industry to manufacture and airport operators to install the required signs. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William DeLoach, Safety and Compliance Division (AAS&hyph;300), Office of Airport Standards, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;8723. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 18, 1987, the FAA published a final rule (52 FR 44276) revising and reorganizing 14 CFR part 139 that became effective on January 1, 1988. The revision included modified requirements, as contained in §139.311, pertaining to markings and lighting. On October 18, 1988, 14 CFR 139 was amended (53 FR 40842) to, among other things, establish January 1, 1991 as the compliance date for the marking and lighting requirements in §139.311. After the amendment establishing the 1991 compliance date for §139.311, however, the FAA decided to revise the guidance material on one aspect of the marking requirements. The FAA undertook to revise the advisory circular (AC) related to signs identifying taxiing routes on the movement area (§139.311(a)(3)). The FAA wanted to resolve the controversies regarding the types and design of airfield signs, applications, colors, and other matters. In addition, because of the global nature of aviation, the FAA wanted its sign standards to be consistent with the ones being considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for installation at airports throughout the world. Operators of certificated airports were informed of this revision and encouraged to wait for publication of the revised AC before attempting to comply with the requirements of §139.311(a)(3). This was to preclude installation of signs identifying taxiing routes on the movement area where significant changes were being considered. The process of revising the sign standards was further complicated by the involvement of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). As noted above, ICAO was developing international airport sign standards during the period the AC was being revised. To make sure the United States was in conformity internationally, the FAA met with the ICAO to help develop standardization and consistency of airport signs. This precluded the FAA from issuing its revised AC on sign standards until after the ICAO working group made recommendations for revised airport sign standards. The ICAO working group did not make its recommendations until May of 1991, months after the January 1, 1991 compliance date set out in §139.311(f). Prior to the deadline, however, the FAA began issuing exemptions to those airport operators requesting them, and advised airport operators against installing signs solely for the purposes of complying with §139.311(a)(3). Airport operators were urged to wait until the FAA issued the revised AC. On July 31, 1991, the FAA issued its revised AC entitled ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems.'' The FAA estimated that it would take several years at a minimum for certificated airports to comply with §139.311(a)(3) because of the lead time required to produce and install the new sign systems. Hence, certificated airports, through no fault of their own, would not be able to meet the requirements of §139.311(a)(3) for several years. The FAA decided that instead of issuing approximately 600 exemptions, the appropriate response was to revise the regulations to extend the compliance date for §139.311(a)(3). The 1991 date for compliance for the other marking and lighting requirements was retained. On April 24, 1992, the FAA issued a final rule (57 FR 15162) extending the compliance date with §139.311(a)(3) to January 1, 1994. The FAA knew that this was a very ambitious target date. Therefore, in this final rule, which was issued without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking, the FAA requested comments from the public as to the reasonableness of the new deadline. This was done to allow the FAA the opportunity to further extend the compliance date if necessary. The FAA received two comments; one from the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and one from the State of Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (Alaska). ALPA supported the extension and encouraged the FAA to remain steadfast in its implementation of §139.311(a)(3). Alaska had several concerns with the established compliance date of January 1, 1994. First, Alaska stated that they had 27 certificated airports that needed to be brought into compliance. Due to the high demand for signs across the country, manufacturers would not be able to provide the materials to these 27 airports in a time frame which would allow them to meet the new deadline. Alaska also was concerned with securing the funding necessary to install new signs by January 1, 1994. Because they rely almost entirely on federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds for all capital improvement projects, they would have to defer other, more critical, safety related projects in order to meet the new signage installation timeframe. Therefore, Alaska recommended that, at the earliest, the installation timeframe be January 1, 1996. The FAA agrees substantially with both commenters. While it is important that every reasonable effort be made to come into compliance with §139.311(a)(3), a realistic date is necessary to adequately provide time for industry to manufacture, and applicable operators to install, sign system on their airports consistent with the revised AC.
