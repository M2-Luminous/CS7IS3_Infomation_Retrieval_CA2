I. Osipov, B. K. Lapochkin and O. N. Yeremina, UDC 624.131] [Abstract] The need for and desirability of constructing deep underground repositories in rock salt formations for the storage of solid and cast-off toxic and radioactive industrial wastes is demonstrated. Foreign experience along these lines is discussed. The principal requirements on rock salt formations, regarded as potential sites for constructing cavernous repositories, are examined and the technological procedures for preparing such repositories are outlined. Different variants are evaluated, but in every case the excavation results in recovery of great volumes of valuable mineral raw material useful in the production of various kinds of soda, paper, artificial rubber and other products. The need for developing a special engineering geology classification of salt formations is validated. A table lists the principal regions in Russia which could be considered for constructing such salt formation repositories. The selection criteria show that it would be most effective to use salt formations of the stratum type, as well as those characterized by a relatively simple internal structure. In this selection process it is particularly necessary to ascertain the spatial position of intercalations of insoluble rocks and also easily soluble (potassic, magnesian salts) formations. Additional factors must be taken into account when considering complex structures of the salt dome type. References 10: 5 Russian, 5 Western.
