He then stressed: "The object of Kim Il-song's nuclear attack is South Korea where his fellow countrymen live, not the United States or Japan." He is warning against "war criminal" Kim Il-song every day. He said the above in a training for members of the Yongwol-Pyongchang, Chongson, and Taebaek district party chapters held at Yongwol County Cultural Center on 24 June. During field education programs for party members in Andong, North Kyongsang Province on 22 June and at the Veterans Association office in Seoul on 21 June, Kim warned: "We must not let down our guard against North Korea since no one knows what Kim Il-song will do." DLP leader Kim Chong-pil is the only person who strongly denounces President Kim Il-song every day at a time when people's expectation of the South-North summit is ever increasing as the summit has been promoted. There are different analyses of the reason why Kim is frequently making remarks running counter to the trend of the time. Some people view that this is an expression of disputes inside the ruling party over the party line. Some view that his remarks represent conservatives stressing that one should not meet face-to- face with Kim Il-song with such an idea as expressed in President Kim Yong-sam's inauguration statement noting "any allied country is not better than the nation." Some view that criticism of Kim Il-song is a portion allotted to Kim Chong-pil. Those close to Kim Chong-pil explained: "He is making such remarks to warn the people against their conviction that the South- North summit will immediately be followed by reunification." Many other people view that Kim's criticism of North Korea and his alerting the people against it are linked with his political position. That is, they think Kim is trying to take this opportunity to secure his position as the leader of conservatives. Some people note that Kim's remark against Kim Tae-chung, president of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, that "if there is a person who stated that it does not matter if North Korea possesses one or two nuclear weapons, he or she is not a person living in this land" was aimed at driving the political situation to a progressives-versus-conservatives structure. People are interested in how far his moves will go after breaking his silence while presenting himself as a "housewife" since the inauguration of the civilian government.
