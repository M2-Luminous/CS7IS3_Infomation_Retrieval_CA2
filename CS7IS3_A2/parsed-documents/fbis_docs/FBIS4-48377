FBIS4-48377 "drafr096_a_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Colonel Comments on Talking With Government RPF Colonel Comments on Talking With Government EA1705162394 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1100 GMT 17 May 94 EA1705162394 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Text] In a message to the local and international community published on 16 May 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, denounced the clique of politicians and Army officers who have plunged the country into bloodshed that is unprecedented in this country. The RPF chairman prays for those who have lost their loved ones in this bloodshed and commends the efforts and sacrifices of the RPF youth in their endeavors to liberate our country. The RPF chairman said that the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] political party, in conjunction with small political parties opposed to the Arusha peace agreements, are responsible for the bloodshed in Rwanda. They killed politicians who were fighting the truth, they shed the blood of innocent people. These political parties ignored the process of setting up a government that respects the rule of law and ignored the respect of human rights. These political parties violated multiparty democracy and went against the spirit of ethnic tolerance. The RPF chairman said that the RPF cannot accept any negotiations with this clique of politicians who staged a coup against the Arusha peace agreements. The RPF chairman said that negotiating a settlement with these killers would be the same as endorsing the atrocities that the clique has been committing. The RPF chairman said that the RPF has made a concession and agreed to talk with the Rwandan Government forces. These talks are being arranged and the RPF fully supports them. The RPF chairman said that the UN secretary general special representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, has been biased against the RPF and has also been giving false reports concerning the situation in Rwanda. And as such, the RPF does not want to have anything to do with Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh. The RPF chairman said that Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has failed to be a mediator and has been working with the killers openly. Jacques- Roger Booh-Booh has been working with the dictatorship in Rwanda and with the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic political party. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has also been working with the current illegitimate government in Rwanda which he helped to install. Concerning the deployment of UN forces to Rwanda, the RPF chairman said that the RPF would accept in principle the deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda with a humanitarian mission. The RPF chairman said that the RPF is currently engaged in the following priorities: 1) to assist people who have survived the massacres, 2) to fight and neutralize the clique of Rwandan Government forces who are responsible for the genocide in Rwanda and to restore peace in the country, and 3) to call upon the international community to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the massacres in Rwanda so that those responsible can be brought to justice. This set of priorities will soon be realized. The RPF has already liberated more than half of the country. RPF civilian cadets are now organizing the displaced people so as to facilitate the administration and distribution of humanitarian aid and to enable the people to return to their homes. The RPF has established some administrative structures in areas that have been liberated, and peace and tranquillity have returned to these areas. People have returned to their homes and have started growing their crops in order to benefit from the current rains. The RPF chairman is therefore calling upon those who have been displaced to return to their homes in the RPF-controlled area so that they can take advantage of the rains to grow their crops. The RPF chairman said that even the members of the Interahamwe [MRND militias] who are ready to put down their arms and stop their barbaric acts may return to their homes and start normal life. The RPF chairman appealed to the people of Rwanda that madness and barbaric acts should be replaced with sanity. Ethnic discrimination and ethnic supremacy should be replaced with the rule of law, unity, and equality among Rwandan citizens. The RPF chairman therefore appealed to all the Rwandan citizens, and particularly the members of the RPF, to calm down and desist from vengeance-based violence. The RPF chairman said that the fundamental principles of the RPF have not changed. We are still committed to national unity, democracy, and security of persons and property. The RPF still supports the principles enshrined in the Arusha peace agreements: rule of law, respect of human rights, multiparty democracy, the principle of power-sharing and formation of a single national Army. The RPF chairman called upon the people of Rwanda to support the above principles because this is the only remedy to Rwanda's problems. All of us together shall win, said the chairman of the RPF, Col. Alexis Kanyarengwe.
