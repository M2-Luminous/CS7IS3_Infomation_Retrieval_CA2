The state budget for this year envisages a rise of 3 percent above last year in the investments in these sectors. In the coal industry, the coal mines will concentrate on securing more reserve coal deposits and cutting faces by accelerating tunnelling and pit construction and on modernizing coal-cutting equipment. In the power industry, the construction of large hydroelectric power stations and thermal power plants currently under way will be accelerated vigorously and many more minor power stations be built in all parts of the country. In rail transport, the existing rails will be replaced by heavy-duty rails at an accelerated pace on the trunk lines including the Pyongyang-Chongjin line, more sections be switched over to electric traction and the modernisation of transport means be hastened to increase the railway transport capacity. The investment will be up in the metal industry 2.6 percent on last year and the production of irons and steels will be placed on a reinforced foundation. Last year the investment in the preferential sectors of the national economy went up 3.5 percent above the preceding year to considerably increase the capacity of coal and ore production. Power production and railway transport capacity has been largely boosted with efforts concentrated on the construction of power stations and the strengthening of the material and technological foundations of railways.
