As previously reported, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper on Wednesday [2 March] published an article about armaments used by the Lithuanian field army. The report was based on information provided by MP Kestutis Gaska, who is a member of the committee and recently left the parliamentary faction of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]. In the opinion of some other committee members, the information published by the newspaper is a state secret. Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the committee, told the LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper that he would not provide any such information to the press and described Gaska as an "emotional" lawmaker with a "great imagination." The committee chairman, who is a member of the ruling LDDP faction, said "you cannot put handcuffs on him and you cannot stop him from talking." But in Petkevicius' opinion, Gaska's critical remarks about the quality of the army equipment donated by some foreign countries are correct. LIETUVOS RYTAS, referring to Gaska's words, said the 30 jeeps that were donated by the French government are meant for a tropical climate and can be used in Lithuania only 3 or 4 months a year. On Thursday, the French embassy in Vilnius circulated a press release saying that "it would be a pity if polemics based on erroneous information would cast a shadow on military cooperation between France and Lithuania." The embassy said the jeeps were still used by the French army only four years ago and denied that they are meant only for hot climatic conditions. Petkevicius said he personally attended the ceremony during which the jeeps were handed over to Lithuania and it "would have been impolite not to accept them." He noted, however, that the jeeps were made in 1942, they use 27 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers and can only "be sold to a museum of antiques." Petkevicius is also very skeptical about the automatic rifles from Israel which are suitable "not to shoot but to sow bullets." LIETUVOS AIDAS quotes the lawmaker as saying that donated batteries for communication equipment are also old and should have been "buried in the ground" back were they came from.
