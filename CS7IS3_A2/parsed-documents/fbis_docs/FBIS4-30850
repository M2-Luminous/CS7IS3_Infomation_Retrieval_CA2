It is a plan which, according to Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, can result in an increase of the GDP by as much as 22 percent within four years. The real consumption is supposed to increase by more than 10 percent, as is the number of work places. The plan is to be discussed at the next session of the Council of Ministers. Next week it is to be debated in the Sejm. The deputy prime minister also stated that "today there is neither a possibility nor a necessity" for amending the budget. The deputy prime minister announced all this at the Third Congress of the All-Polish Trade Union Agreement and received a thunderous ovation. What the Plan Contains According to Kolodko, the new government plan includes all Poles, even though this does not mean that everyone will be happy. He added that it is the human being, not the money, that is the central point of the new strategy. The plan envisions a processes of deregulation, decentralization, denationalization, and lessening the participation of the state in the economic life, said Kolodko. The strategy for Poland consists of a key program whose theses put the main emphasis on the following: Lowering the social costs of reforms, creating a strategic concept (rapid economic development, systemic and economic stabilization, improvement of living conditions for the people). These theses are broken down into 10 main programs: 1. Shaping of modern work relations and regulation of remuneration.2. Reform of the system of social insurances.3. Combating unemployment.4. Development of rural areas.5. Investment in human capital.6. Improvement of the efficiency of the management of state-owned property; ownership transformations.7. Development and reform of the financial sector.8. A medium-term financial strategy.9. Security of the economic exchange and absorption of the gray market.10. Competitiveness of the Polish economy in foreign markets. These programs are then divided into more specific and detailed programs; the ideas of previous governments were also taken advantage of in the preparation of these programs. The deputy prime minister explained that everyone will be able to benefit from the reform of the social insurances; however, this will be possible only after "more than ten years." He gave assurances that "the government will carry out a policy as a result of which unemployment will be dropping." He promised that "in the long run, investment in human capital (education, science, culture, health protection) is looked upon by the government as one of the springboards of development; it wants the share of the budget expenditure for these four areas to increase." He stated that the economic sectors will be treated equally and that the areas of state-owned property will be separated. According to him, the inflow of foreign capital is to be treated as an instrument for improving the Polish economy. The strategy for Poland proposes a solution, whereby in the regions that are particularly threatened by unemployment the time of work should be shortened: more people would have jobs, but naturally the salaries would have to be smaller. What the Plan Will Yield According to Kolodko, the "Strategy for Poland" will result in an increase in the GDP "perhaps even" by as much as 22 percent within four years. It is also to be expected that real consumption will increase by more than ten percent; this increase should not omit any social groups. It will create new work places; the strategy will also result in economic and systemic stabilization. "The coalition government proposes a strategy for Poland. It is our option which the people will or will not accept. We do not claim that there are no other options; however, we do claim that this one is the best." Kolodko called the strategy for Poland "the result of four trends": social listening ("we are listening to what the people are saying"), economic professionalism ("we will only promise solutions that are possible to implement, because this coalition will give such promises as were given by some of the previous governments"), pragmatism, and conciliation ("we are proposing a program that all Poles can reach agreement over"). Revision of Budget Not Very Likely The deputy prime minister said that there is no additional money in the budget, although he conceded that receipts are a little higher than expected. "A revision of the budget will be made this year, if there is such a possibility and necessity. Today there is neither such a possibility nor necessity. If such a possibility appears, the shifts will be minimal. I will ask trade unions for advice as to how these several trillion zlotys, if they appear, should be spent."
