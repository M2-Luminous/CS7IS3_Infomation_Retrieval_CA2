The papers say the new group is opposed to the planned constitutional conference by the present military regime in Nigeria. The papers, CHAMPION, GUARDIAN, VANGUARD, and the NATIONAL CONCORD, report the story differently. Ajasin, Ukiwe, Others Oppose Parley: that is the CHAMPION. The paper reports that Nigeria's second in command in the early days of the former administration of General Babangida, Retired Navy Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe; a former civilian governor of Ondo State, Chief Adekunle Ajasin; and Malam (Lawan Dimbazo) have spoken against the holding of the constitutional conference scheduled to begin next month. According to the paper, they launched their opposition to the conference at the weekend because they felt the conference was ill-conceived and would only amount to a waste of public funds since nothing concrete will come out of it. The paper says the three were speaking under the aegis of the newly formed National Democratic Coalition, NADECO. THE PUNCH and THE GUARDIAN say the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, has urged Nigerians to boycott the proposed constitutional conference. The papers say NADECO, a pressure group in nature, has also urged the present military government in Nigeria to shelve the planned conference. According to the papers, NADECO has described the conference as a ruse and [word indistinct] intended to perpetuate military dictatorship in Nigeria. VANGUARD and CONCORD report that the group has given the military regime in Nigeria an ultimatum to make way for Chief M.K.O. Abiola who allegedly won the June 1993 annulled presidential election. The papers say NADECO has given the military up to 31 May to call on Chief Abiola to form a broad-based government. Military Blamed For Crisis: THE REPUBLIC. The paper reports that a pressure group known as the Campaign for Democracy [CD] has blamed what it calls the current crisis of confidence in Nigeria on the military class. REPUBLIC quotes a communique issued by the Kogi State wing of the CD as saying that for Nigeria to successfully move out from such crisis of confidence, it will require genuine political education of its citizenry.
