Does this mean the Palestinians want to slow down the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First? [Peres] I am not certain this report is correct or official. The delegation will be able to deal with the issue of Hebron as well as the issue of resuming the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. It has been decided that the parties will first discuss the issue of security in Hebron and, if they reach agreement, they will immediately move on to the issue of Gaza and Jericho. I hope they will reach an agreement. [Margalit] How many Palestinian policemen are we willing to allow into Gaza, Jericho, and Hebron; and how many Norwegian observers, for example? [Peres] This is precisely what we will tell the Palestinians tomorrow. I would not like to state it on television now. [Margalit] What does it really matter whether there will be 20 or 200 Norwegians? Either we trust them, or we do not. [Peres] Basically, we trust the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. It is in charge of security in Hebron. We make supreme efforts to prevent friction, to take the other side's needs into consideration as well. We would not really want to set up three equal forces in Hebron. At the same time, we agree to bring in an international presence -- as we pledged in the Declaration of Principles with regard to Gaza and Jericho. The figure is important. It will determine whether it is a presence or more than that. [Margalit] Who will command the Palestinian policemen in Hebron, for example? [Peres] Overall and supreme responsibility over issues of security will remain in the hands of the IDF. [Margalit] But, there will be situations, such as the one we saw on television, in which settlers fire their guns. Can Palestinian policemen fire at them, or will they first have to ask the permission of Gen. Mufaz? [Peres] It is not as simple as that. We want to prevent contact between the two altogether. I suppose that the Palestinian police will guard Muslim and Arab sites, and there will also be joint patrols. As a whole, the IDF will have the overall and supreme responsibility. [Margalit] If you want to prevent friction, you must ban the settlers from going to the marketplace in Hebron, because it is not clear whether we should protect them or protect other people from them. [Peres] This is not the only alternative; you can have two access routes, one for the settlers, the other for the Arabs. We seek solutions for the complicated situation, as you pointed out. [Margalit] Speaking on this issue, are you for or against the settlers staging a march in Hebron [on 30 April]? [Peres] I certainly oppose it. Who needs it? [Margalit] How about a rally? [Peres] Look, one of the worst things to have happened, other than the Cave of the Patriarchs incident, is the incessant appearances of the those people on the international media. One may have the impression that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza settlers control the State of Israel. They use extremist language, painting a picture of an nearly unrecognizable Israel. The situation is incredibly tense; there is enormous anger; nothing has calmed yet. Who needs this rally? What for? Against what? What does it serve? [Margalit] It is against the government policy, which is their democratic right. [Peres] You can stage demonstrations against the government policy in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. You do not stage demonstrations in tense and hurting places. There is a limit. Look, everything is allowed; I could come into your house and pull you out [as heard]. The question is what do we do when the situation is very tense; when there is a lot of friction; when some people use their arms illegally; what do we do to reduce the tension? [Margalit] Would the friction not have been better reduced by pulling out the settlers from the heart of Hebron, not Qiryat Arba', but Bet Hadassah and Tal al-Rumaythah? [Peres] I do not know. I will not say anything on this matter outside the cabinet sessions. We are in the midst of negotiations, not only with ourselves. Anything you say immediately turns into a concession before negotiations were even held. Being a member of the cabinet, I believe that the only place for me to discuss such issues is the cabinet session. I suggest that we do not task the IDF with this matter. I expect the members of the cabinet to have the courage to ask how to construct a situation which would minimize friction and clashes, while securing the life of people of all sides, settlers as well as Arabs. [Margalit] Assuming that the, so called, security package is wrapped up -- that is, the first stage of the Palestinian police and Norwegian observers entry into three regions in the territories -- when do you believe, will the Gaza and Jericho stage of the negotiations be over? [Peres] It depends. If we reach the agreement on providing a feeling of security in Hebron tomorrow and begin discussing Gaza and Jericho the next day, and if the delegates sit all next week -- day and night -- in an accelerated process of negotiations, we can finish the whole thing in two to three weeks. [Margalit] But, as we just heard, the PLO wants negotiations to start only when the security package is wrapped up. [Peres] I hope they will end it tomorrow. [Margalit] Are we that close? [Peres] I believe so. The gaps are such that I believe they could be bridged. We can end discussing the issue of Hebron tomorrow evening or night, and make an agreement. Then, we will be able to immediately begin discussing Gaza and Jericho the very next day. At the same time, we were to begin discussing economic issues, but the PLO announced that it wants to begin discussing this next Sunday. Let me tell you: Any delay in the beginning of the discussions, will naturally lead to a delayed conclusion. [Margalit] Finance Minister Shohat said today, however, that the economic agreement is ready, and if it was not for the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, it would have been signed by now. [Peres] I believe there are some issues that need to be agreed on; there is agreement on some things, and disagreement on others. Negotiations are still called for. [Margalit] Would it not have been more convenient had we been in the midst of negotiations with Syria? [Peres] I believe that we must first end the matter of Gaza and Jericho. We must first crate a piece of new Palestinian reality. Nothing will change the situation in the Middle East more than a change in the physical reality. Making another declaration, statement, or appearance is unimportant. We are pretty close, I believe, to turning the Oslo agreement into a new political reality. After this, we will have to start the Syrian issue. [Margalit] Not before? Not at the same time? Last week we heard al-Asad saying that if Rabin wants peace in the north, he should come and make an arrangement. [Peres] I do not know where he was quoted.... [Margalit] It made the headlines. [Peres] Another headline.... If he opens the negotiations, they will open and right now. We are putting off nothing. It should be understood that peace is not made between leaders only; it is peace between peoples. Negotiations involve both nations. In any event, our people have to see, in no uncertain terms, that the Syrians are really willing to enter full negotiations for full peace. [Margalit] Mr. Peres, do you agree with the prime minister that, in its deliberations, the Shamgar commission causes damage to the IDF? [Peres] It certainly causes problems. I would not like to reach conclusions about the commission before it reaches its own conclusions about what happened, but it is very problematic. The Army officers must prepare and be ready for their appearances, explain, worry, and convince others. This is very difficult.
