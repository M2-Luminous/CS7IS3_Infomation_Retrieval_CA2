FR941025-1-00021 FR941025-1-00006 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 16 CFR Parts 1615 and 1616 Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 Through 6X; Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 Through 14 AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission. ACTION: Proposed amendments. SUMMARY: The Commission proposes to amend flammability standards applicable to children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X and sizes 7 through 14. The amendments proposed below would revise the definition of ``children's sleepwear'' in the standard for sizes 0 through 6X to exclude garments in some infant sizes and tight-fitting garments from the products which are subject to the standard, and would revise the definition of ``children's sleepwear'' in the standard for sizes 7 through 14 to exclude ``tight-fitting garments.'' The Commission is proposing these amendments because it has reason to believe that the existing children's sleepwear standards may not be limited to those sleepwear garments which present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths and injuries. Information available to the Commission indicates that by removing certain garments which do not present that unreasonable risk of injury, the proposed amendments would afford consumers a wider selection of sleepwear garments for children without diminishing the protection provided by the children's sleepwear standards. 1 1 The Commission voted 2&hyph;1 to propose amendments of the children's sleepwear flammability standards, Chairman Ann Brown dissenting. DATES: (1) Written Comments concerning the proposed amendments should be received by the Commission not later than January 9, 1995. (2) The Commission will provide opportunity for oral presentations of data, views, and arguments concerning the proposed amendment at a date to be announced. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed amendments should be mailed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, telephone: (301) 504&hyph;0800; or delivered to the Office of the Secretary, room 501, 4330 East-West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. Comments should be submitted in five copies and captioned ``Amendment of Children's Sleepwear Standards.'' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Terrance R. Karels, Directorate for Economic Analysis, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301) 504&hyph;0962, extension 1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Provisions of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.) authorize issuance of flammability standards and regulations to protect the public from unreasonable risks of death, injury, and property damage from fires associated with products of wearing apparel made from fabric and related materials. In 1971, the Secretary of Commerce issued a flammability standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X to protect young children from death and serious burn injuries which had been associated with ignition of sleepwear garments, such as nightgowns and pajamas, by small open-flame sources. The standard for sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X became effective in 1972 and is now codified at 16 CFR part 1615. In 1973, authority to issue flammability standards under provisions of the FFA was transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Consumer Product Safety Commission by section 30(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2079(b)). In 1974, the Commission issued a flammability standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14. That standard became effective in 1975 and is now codified at 16 CFR part 1616. Both standards prescribe a test which requires that specimens of fabrics, seams, and trim of children's sleepwear garments must self-extinguish after exposure to a small-open flame. Both standards require manufacturers of children's sleepwear subject to their provisions to test prototypes of sleepwear garments with acceptable results before beginning production. Both standards also require manufacturers to sample and test garments from regular production. Failure to comply with the sampling and testing requirements of the standards is a violation of section 3 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1192). The standards do not require or prohibit the use of any particular type of fabric or garment design as long as the manufacturer successfully completes the prescribed prototype and production testing.
