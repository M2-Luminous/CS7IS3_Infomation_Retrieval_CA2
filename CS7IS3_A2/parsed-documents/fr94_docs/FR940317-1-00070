FR940317-1-00070 FR940317-1-00013 (9) Part IX. Responses to Pleadings (for claims in litigation only) (i) Proposed answer. (ii) Defenses. (iii) Counterclaims. (iv) Crossclaims. (v) Dispositive motions (identify and list). (b) Personnel Claims memorandum. See section 536.168 for instructions on preparing a Personnel Claims memorandum. (c) Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims. On all dental and medical malpractice claims, claims JAs will attach DD Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims) to all memoranda prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and forward to USARCS. Claims JAs will also submit this form to USARCS on all dental and medical malpractice claims settled or denied within their local authority. When a claim is transferred to USARCS without a forwarding memorandum prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, DD Form 2526 must still be completed and forwarded within 60 days after the medical records are available for review by the MTF/DTF risk manager (RM). (1) Claims JAs/MCJAs will coordinate the completion of the form pertaining to the Standard of Care, Diagnoses, and Procedures with the MTF/DTF RM or the RM's designee. If the RM does not provide this information, claims JAs/MCJAs will note the reason and submit the form to USARCS. The sections pertaining to Provider Information and Type of Provider and Specialty of DD Form 2526 will not be completed on the form submitted to USARCS. OTSG will task subordinate commands to forward provider information on settled claims. (2) Claims JAs are required to submit one DD Form 2526 for each incident (course of treatment or nontreatment that results in an injury) for which a claim has been filed. Derivative claims do not require a separate report. However, separate reports are required when claimants allege physical injury to more than one claimant (for example, an infant's claim for brain damage as a result of birth trauma and a mother's claim for physical injury caused by the delivery would require two reports). When a claimant alleges negligent medical care at more than one MTF/DTF, USARCS will designate the claims JA who will complete the DD Form 2526. (d) Subsequent action. It is not necessary for each claims authority who considers the claim to write a separate memorandum. If a claims approval or settlement authority agrees with the memorandum of opinion written by another authority, he or she can adopt the earlier memorandum by merely stating that he or she concurs in the adopted memorandum and stating the nature of the action. If there is disagreement, in whole or in part, with the earlier memorandum, such disagreement should be stated and reasons therefor set forth in a separate memorandum or in an addendum. The approval or settlement authority will personally sign the action, indicating position title. §536.23 Actions. The following actions may be taken as appropriate: (a) Transmittal of the claim to the appropriate claims office for proposed disposition. (b) Disapproval of the claim provided the person signing the action is a settlement authority. (See appendix B to this part). (c) Final offer. (See appendix B to this part). (d) Approval and certification of the claim for payment. (1) SF 1034 (Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal) will be used on all claims settled under this regulation except claims settled under subpart D which will be paid utilizing an SF 1145 (Voucher for Payment Under the Federal Tort Claims Act). (See §536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) (2) When an SF 1034 is to be paid by the GAO, the certification block of the SF 1034 will not be signed by Army Officials. GAO officials will certify any payment made by that agency. (See §536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) (3) Payment of a claim under subpart D in excess of $2,500 is obtained by forwarding necessary documentation to the GAO. Complete information on the requirements to effect such payments are set forth in §536.35(b). Note that the approval or settlement authority signs only the approval block (lower left) of the SF 1145 before submitting a claim to the GAO for payment. (e) Subsequent action. See §536.22(d). Liability and Quantum Determinations §536.24 General considerations. (a) Liability. In the adjudication of tort claims arising in the United States, the liability of the United States generally is determined in accordance with the law of the state or country where the act or omission occurred, except that any conflict between local law and an applicable United States statute will be resolved in favor of the latter. However, in claims arising in foreign countries, liability may be based in whole or in part on local law or as otherwise provided in subpart C for settlements of claims of United States inhabitants arising overseas under the Military Claims Act. (See §536.55(c). Where liability is not clear or other issues exist, settlements should truly reflect the uncertainties in the adjudication of such issues. Compromise settlements are encouraged provided agreement can be reached that reflects the reduced value of the damages as measured against the full value or range of value if such uncertainties or issues did not exist and were it possible for the claimant to successfully litigate the claim. (b) Quantum exclusion. The costs of filing a claim and similar costs (for example, court costs, bail, interest, inconvenience expenses, or costs of long distance telephone calls or transportation in connection with the preparation of a claim) are not proper quantum elements and will not be allowed. (c) Property damage. Property damage compensable under the tort claims provisions of this regulation means damage to tangible real or personal property (see glossary). It does not include mere diminution of value of real property unless there is some corresponding physical damage to the property, nor does it include damage to reputation, employment rights or constitutional rights. Other remedies may be available for such injuries but they are generally not cognizable under the FTCA, MCA, FCA or the Maritime Claims Settlement Act.
