B." in Rome; date not given: "`But the Party Is Not Theirs'" ] [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you sleep well last night, Deputy Mastella? [Mastella] Very well. I really do not see why we too should not exhibit the serenity always displayed by [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] Martinazzoli. Nobody is Dante Alighieri; nobody, not even Martinazzoli, can decide who is to be in Paradise, who in Purgatory, and who must be confined to hell. [LA REPUBBLICA] But how do you feel, outside the DC? [Mastella] Outside? Look, let it be clear: We are all in the same fold until it is formally decreed that one party is finished and another has begun. Today is a day like any other day. I am here with many friends from the Campania region. We are talking politics and asking questions. [Mastella ends] Clemente Mastella counterattacks: Martinazzoli cannot chase anybody away, the "DC still belongs to everybody." He and Pierferdinando Casini, the "centrist" leaders, have been a bit too busy and the secretary has had enough. They have been behaving like a party, they have had political meetings with the League.... [LA REPUBBLICA] What happened? [Mastella] The more I think about it, the more I try to understand, the less sense this outburst by the staid Martinazzoli makes. At exactly the moment doves of peace were flying between us and him and between him and us... Russo Jervolino and Mancino, Buttiglione, Formigoni.... When I think that two years ago, when Mino announced that he wanted to retire at 60, that he wanted to go home and abandon politics, I signed a document asking him to stay. I was obviously persuasive, because he did stay. In short, how can he think of building the new party by starting by throwing out people like us? At any rate, I would like to ask him a question.... [LA REPUBBLICA] Please do. [Mastella] Martinazzoli accuses us of having relations with the League. But he does not realize, or he pretends not to realize, that people close to him, like Formigoni and Buttiglione, say it is necessary to form an alliance with Berlusconi and Bossi. In other words, just look at the pulpit the sermon of excommunication is coming from! And there is more. [LA REPUBBLICA] Yes.... [Mastella] Mario Segni is also making overtures to the League. So the equation is becoming more and more complex. To be consistent, Martinazzoli should say "no" to Segni as well, but that is one thing he is steering well clear of. And do you know why? Because Segni knows full well that his leadership has a meaning only within the framework of an alliance with the League; otherwise he will get a majority allowing him to be premier in about A.D. 2500. [LA REPUBBLICA] So? [Mastella] So what we do not accept is that if we say something, it is heresy, but if Segni says it, it is fine. [LA REPUBBLICA] You are also suspected of plotting with Fini... [Mastella] I have never said anything about forming an alliance with the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. What I have said is that "closed-circuit democracy" is over; we should keep an eye on the MSI's evolution: If it takes place, then... [LA REPUBBLICA] So what is it that brought the "centrists" together and keeps them together? [Mastella] We simply realized that the new electoral mechanism will bring about a bipolar system, so there is a need to create two alternative poles. And the People's Party cannot fail to be part of the moderate pole. It cannot fail to be "modern," as I call it, as opposed to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] "progressivism." And there is another important point: If the People's Party does its job, if it rises to its task and the prestige of its role, Silvio Berlusconi will not enter the political arena. [LA REPUBBLICA] Did he tell you that? [Mastella] I have understood it. Besides, it is understandable that, if politics plays the absentee, the void will be filled by something else authorizing other players to maneuver and to fulfill the functions proper to politics. If we stay united, this moderate pole can succeed. [LA REPUBBLICA] But how many of you are there? Have you counted? [Mastella] There are very many of us, certainly more than the four or five poor fools people would like us to be. And our numbers will increase, in the North, the Center, and the South, from Campania to Sicily, where we also have electoral weight. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is it true that De Mita, whose right-hand man you were until a few years ago, is going to make a political comeback? [Mastella] Let him. De Mita certainly does not need my authorization. [LA REPUBBLICA] To sum up, Deputy Mastella, what is there outside Piazza del Gesu [DC headquarters], the desert? [Mastella] Listen, I have spent the day answering calls and letters of esteem and solidarity from grass-roots militants, from the party rank and file. But also from important leaders, all of whom say they are shocked and bewildered. It is a pity they do not say so, they do not make public statements to proclaim out loud what they tell me over the phone. I repeat: Nobody is outside, for the moment we are all in the same fold.
