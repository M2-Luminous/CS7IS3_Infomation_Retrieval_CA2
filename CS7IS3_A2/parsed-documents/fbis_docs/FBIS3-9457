Oleh Slyepichev, Ukrainian external economic relations minister, stated this in an interview for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY following his talks with the Czech economy ministers with whom he signed, at the end of last week, treaties on economic cooperation and support, and mutual protection of investments. "Because mutual relations used to be centrally controlled, we are searching for suitable mechanisms for their revival," the minister said. That was one of the reasons the two partner institutions, the Ukrainian External Economic Relations Ministry and the Czech Industry and Trade Ministry, agreed to create a mixed, broadly conceived interdepartmental commission, which would even include representatives from customs, the banking sphere, and so forth, and devote itself to the building of mutual relations. The Czech Republic and Ukraine have already prepared a legal basis for this, but we cannot avoid some problems in the near future. According to the minister, these problems emerge particularly in the sphere of payments. The volume of mutual trade has markedly declined of late years to reach a current turnover value of approximately $200 million. The trade is more or less balanced. "We should try to keep up our trade, even with the payment difficulties, because there are priorities, feasible solutions to the payment difficulties that must be sought. I assume that our banks will deal with this in the very near future, perhaps in April," Slyepichev emphasized. Of the specific priorities in mutual trade relations, the minister pointed to the pressing need for restoration and continuous supply of spare parts for the extensive pool of the Czech trolleybuses and streetcars in Ukrainian cities. Ukraine, for its part, used to supply the Czech Republic with iron ore, and it would be difficult to find a replacement for this market. "Hence, we are now looking at the possibilities of joint enterprise and mutual investments, with the idea of not only supplying our two markets but also penetrating third markets," the minister emphasized. To a question regarding the financing options for the planned trade, the minister replied that such options exist--opening accounts, clearing, and barter trade. At this time, according to him, it is necessary, above all, to create favorable conditions for direct cooperation between enterprises, the more so because, in certain areas, a little effort could bear fruit in a very short time. In this context, Minister Slepichev spoke about his talks with the Association for Trade with Ukraine, which collects bids for the supply of small bakeries, breweries, and meat-industry-processing lines, and seeks contacts for Ukrainian buyers. The representatives of the interested sectors already agreed to help realize these deals through certain mediating activities.
