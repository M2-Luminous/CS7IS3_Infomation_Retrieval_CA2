FR940222-1-00025 FR940222-1-00007 C. Statutory Provisions Under section 1876(c)(2)(A) of the Act, an HMO or CMP is required to furnish to Medicare enrollees the Medicare covered services to which they are entitled, but only to the extent that those services are available to beneficiaries who reside in the geographic area served by the HMO or CMP but are not enrolled in the organization. The only exceptions to this general rule are: (1) That risk contracting HMOs and CMPs are not required to provide hospice care services, or to assume financial responsibility for inpatient care furnished to an enrollee who, on the effective date of enrollment, was an inpatient in a hospital paid under the prospective payment system; and (2) risk contractors are not required to enroll Medicare beneficiaries who have end-stage renal disease (whether aged, disabled, or entitled to Medicare solely because of having end-stage renal disease). In summary, before enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), under sections 1876(c)(2)(A), 1876(a)(6), 1876(a)(1)(D), and 1876(a)(3) of the Act, respectively_ •Risk HMOs and CMPs were responsible for furnishing NCD services of significant cost even though that cost had not been taken into account in determining the per capita rate that HCFA paid the HMO or CMP during that year; •Payment for services furnished to Medicare enrollees of a risk HMO or CMP could be made only to the HMO or CMP, and only in the form of advance monthly per capita payments; and •Those per capita payments were made instead of the amounts that would have been made on a fee-for-service basis. II. Changes Made by OBRA '90 Section 4204(c)(1) of OBRA '90 added section 1876(c)(2)(B) of the Act, applicable to contract periods beginning on or after January 1, 1991. Under section 1876(c)(2)(B), if HCFA projects that the cost of furnishing the NCD service will be significant, and the cost of the service was not taken into account in calculating the most recently announced per capita payment rates, then, unless otherwise required by law_ •The risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish the new or expanded benefit established by the NCD until the first contract year that begins after the next payment rate announcement (that takes into account the cost of the NCD service); and •If the risk HMO or CMP does furnish the new or expanded benefit during the current contract period, the prohibition of section 1876(a)(3) does not apply, and HCFA's intermediary or carrier would pay the risk HMO or CMP for the NCD service (under the usual Medicare payment rules and methods) in addition to the monthly capitation payment. (Usual Medicare payment methods require that payment for services furnished by a participating provider such as a hospital be made only to the provider.) Section 4204(c) of OBRA '90 also amended section 1876(a)(6) of the Act (the general prohibition against paying any entity other than the risk HMO or CMP for services furnished to a Medicare enrollee) by providing an exception for NCD services in section 1876(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under that exception, if a Medicare enrollee chooses to obtain an NCD service from a source other than the risk HMO or CMP, HCFA may make payment under the usual Medicare payment methods and rules to the beneficiary, or to the qualified provider, physician, or supplier, as appropriate. III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule To implement the provisions of section 4204(c) of OBRA '90, we propose to make the following revisions to 42 CFR part 417 (``Health Maintenance Organizations, Competitive Medical Plans, and Health Care Prepayment Plans''). We also plan to make various technical changes. A. Definitions In §417.401 we would add definitions of ``National coverage decision'' and ``significant cost.'' National coverage decision (NCD) means_a statement of national policy regarding the Medicare coverage status of a service that we make under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act and publish in the Federal Register as a notice or HCFA Ruling, issue as a manual instruction, or announce by other formal notice. The term does not include coverage changes mandated by statute. Significant cost, as it relates to a particular NCD, means either of the following: (1) The average cost of furnishing a single service exceeds a cost threshold that_ (i) For calendar years 1991 and 1992, is $100,000; and (ii) For 1993 and subsequent calendar years, is the preceding year's dollar threshold, adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the United States per capita cost (USPCC) for the preceding year.
