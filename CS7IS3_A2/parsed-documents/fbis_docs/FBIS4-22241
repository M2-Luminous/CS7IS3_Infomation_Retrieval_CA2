It Is Unnecessary, Useless, and Dangerous"] [Text] Carte Blanche The parliamentary elections in Ukraine stimulated an international discussion on the fate of this state and on the future of Russian-Ukrainian relations. The general initial premises for analysis are sufficiently clear. In Ukraine, on the one hand, the economy is falling apart to the accompaniment of inflation that sometimes reaches 100 percent a month; social tension is increasing, which is only slightly eased by such phenomena as shuttle trade with Russia and the emergence of a stratum of Ukrainian migrant workers in Russia; and Crimea is threatening to become a Ukrainian Ulster. On the other hand, there is a noticeable desire of the Kiev politicians to maintain the status quo: to reject economic reforms, to suppress the trend toward state federalism as much as possible, and to preserve the old majority electoral system, under which the western oblasts were without many of their own potential representatives in the new parliament. But in Russia, despite the fact that public opinion got over the shock that resulted from the separation of Ukraine in 1991, the positions of many political forces changed only slightly. Those who in 1992 resentfully said to Ukrainians, "You will be sorry," are maliciously grinning, and they are saying, "The eyes saw what they were buying...." Others who have still not resigned themselves to the breakup of the USSR await with hope the appeals of the new "Pereyaslavites" concerning the support of Moscow, thinking that all Russia has to do is to open its arms and in no time Ukraine can be integrated into Russia anew. Neither one side nor the other goes further in its analysis, which would show that nothing is that simple. Theoretically, four variants in the political development of Ukraine are possible at the present time. The first variant--the most optimistic, and therefore the least likely--is that market reforms, nevertheless, will gradually take place in Ukraine, that Ukraine will rid itself of the aspiration to maintain a large army in Europe, and that it will very cautiously conduct a policy directed at the decentralization of the country. However, even if all of this becomes a reality, the process of "recovery" will be too long, considering the unenviable starting positions and the absence of a national consensus regarding the need for market reforms; and without the necessary care, including on the part of the invited doctors, the possibility of a lethal outcome is present. The second variant--this is a continuation of "limping on both legs." No kind of fall can continue endlessly, but development in this direction is entirely probable in the medium-term outlook. The third variant assumes a controlled dissolution of Ukraine in the east (plus the south) and the west, with still unpredictable borders. It should be noted immediately that Western Ukraine can fully provide a viable statehood (high national ideological motivation with respect to the need for the existence of an independent Ukrainian state, the presence of energy sources, and massive assistance on the part of the diaspora), but externally and internally a statehood that, nonetheless, is unstable (the presence of a considerable Hungarian minority, Transcarpathian Ruthenians, and Russians; religious tensions of the Serb-Croat type between Catholic-Uniate Galicia and the Orthodox Volyn; territorial claims on the part of certain forces of Romania to Bukovina, and problems with Poland.) The viability of this state is the higher the more exactly its borders coincide with the borders of the potential nucleus--Lvov, Ternopol, and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts. The east Ukrainian state will strive for integration not with Russia, but into Russia, inasmuch as the power capacity of eastern Ukraine production does not allow it to hope for an independent restoration of the economy, and help cannot be expected from anywhere. Friction with Lvov serves as an additional factor. The fourth variant is the uncontrollable dissolution of Ukraine with a possible civil war of all against all on a territory crammed with AES's [nuclear power stations], GES's [hydroelectric power stations], and nuclear and conventional weapons, which will mean millions of refugees and epidemics spreading from one place to another, and the possibility of an ecological disaster on a continental scale. Which of the variants is most advantageous for Russia? The first is not viewed as a real choice--under conditions of the dissolution of Ukraine, which is starting before our eyes, the probability of its implementation is infinitesimally small. The importance of not permitting the fourth variant is too obvious. Apparently, the best solution will be the second, because, while it is not a gain, it is not a loss. The Kiev government is controlling the situation in the country by simultaneously assuming the social pressure and not permitting the development of an open conflict. And, indeed, it is much easier for Moscow to do business with politicians of the Leonid Kravchuk type than with leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party and the Donetsk-Dnepropetrovsk lobbyists. A unified Ukraine, which has moved into a cycle of preserving territorial unity, will not become a source of challenge to Russian security. This rather weak state will be interested in the invisible political presence of such a guarantor of stability, like Russia, that will promote the establishment of good neighbor relations. This factor, in its turn, will make it possible objectively to examine the territory of Ukraine as a kind of "strategic forward defensive position" in the development of plans for the defense of Russia. In the event of the division of Ukraine into two states, Russia will have to save the economy of eastern Ukraine with trillions of infusions, which will destroy all of the results of reform in Russia itself, but in Ukraine, in the best case, it will preserve the situation, but it will not lead to real integration, inasmuch as the economic systems of the two countries are already fundamentally incompatible on a macro scale. Recognizing that such a luxury is beyond Russia's capabilities, it will be impossible, nonetheless, to avoid the problem. A massive migration will begin--and not of old women from Kievskiy Railroad Station, but of strikebreakers who will aggravate the unemployment problem; the influx of narcotics will intensify. Economically, the justified refusal of Russia to accept eastern Ukraine into its system, given a continuation of present trends in the condition of Russian society, will increase the influence of nationalist forces in Russia itself. Thus, the disintegration of Ukraine does not bring any benefits at all to Russia. Therefore, it is necessary to strive as much as possible to promote the stabilization of the situation in the present Ukrainian state. Russia, naturally, also does not have any surplus money now; however, it is possible to follow an already established precedent on the transfer of part of Ukrainian property to Russia in exchange for energy sources, or a possible redemption by Russia as such. To facilitate the conduct of negotiations, it is necessary for Moscow to display good political will, in order that it be understood in Kiev that Russia is not conducting "subversive activity," and that it does not want to wreck a unified Ukraine. It is important to start a dialogue in this context with the opposition forces of Ukraine, if at least in order not to repeat the error of the USSR with respect to the countries of Eastern Europe, when a change of government began to denote a complete break. It is necessary to organize cooperation with regional leaders of Ukraine, whose influence in 1993 was strengthened significantly, together with a desire to develop cooperation. It also must not be forgotten, however, that there is the possibility of a worse outcome. For a feasible neutralization of the challenge (disintegration), what seems especially important is the completion of the task of transforming Ukraine into a nuclear-free state, rendering assistance to Ukraine in the destruction of stockpiles of conventional weapons jointly with the world community, and preventing the Ukrainian Army from getting out of Kiev's control and its switching over to the influence of potential "uncles." The specific measures can be argued. But in the development of a general line of Russian policy with respect to Ukraine, the keystone should be an understanding that the existence of a stable Russia is hardly possible without a unified and stable Ukraine, albeit not a fraternal one.
