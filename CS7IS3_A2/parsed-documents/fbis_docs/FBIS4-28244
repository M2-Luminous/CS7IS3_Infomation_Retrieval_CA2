The license was due to expire Thursday. The Japanese ministry also plans to extend similar license for five U.S. airlines on seven route until Oct. 29, ministry officials said. This averted a total suspension of service by U.S. and Japanese airlines in the persistent aviation dispute arising from Washington's demand for expansion of rights to fly beyond Japan for American carriers. The officials said the dispute remains unsettled because Japan still insists on restrictions on operations by U.S. airlines to third nations via Japan due to financial straits facing Japanese carriers. The United States and Japan traded sanctions against respective airlines in March, cutting short their license periods.
