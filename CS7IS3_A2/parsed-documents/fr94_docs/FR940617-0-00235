(2) Grounds for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Action or inaction by the ICI or the laboratory performing the emission test on behalf of the ICI, which results in fraudulent, deceitful, or grossly inaccurate representation of any fact or condition which affects a nonroad engine's eligibility for admission to the United States under this subpart; (ii) Failure of a significant number of imported nonroad engines to comply with federal emission requirements upon EPA inspection or retest; or (iii) Failure by an ICI to comply with requirements of this subpart. (3) The following procedures govern any decision to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue certificates of conformity under this subpart: (i) When grounds appear to exist for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Administrator must notify the ICI in writing of any intended suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity, proposed ineligibility to apply for new certificates of conformity, or intended suspension of eligibility to conduct modification/testing under §89.609&hyph;96, and the grounds for such action. (ii) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(3)(iv), the ICI must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider withdrawing notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certification or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under §89.609&hyph;96: (A) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the nonroad engine, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the ICI to prevent the future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies are to be implemented or (B) Demonstrate that the nonroad engine does in fact comply with applicable regulations in this chapter by retesting, if applicable, the nonroad engine in accordance with the applicable emission test specified in subpart E of this part. (iii) An ICI may request, within 15 calendar days of the Administrator's notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under §89.609- 96, that the Administrator grant such ICI a hearing: (A) As to whether the tests, if applicable, have been properly conducted, (B) As to any substantial factual issue raised by the Administrator's proposed action. (iv) If, after the Administrator notifies an ICI of the intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under §89.609&hyph;96 and prior to any final suspension or revocation, the ICI demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to initiate suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity or eligibility to perform modification/testing under §89.609- 96 was based on erroneous information, the Administrator will withdraw the notice of intent. (4) Hearings on suspensions and revocations of certificates of conformity or of eligibility to apply for new certificates or of eligibility to perform modification/testing under §89.609&hyph;96 will be held in accordance with the following: (i) The procedures prescribed by this section will apply whenever an ICI requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
