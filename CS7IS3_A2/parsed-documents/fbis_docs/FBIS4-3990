Wu Yi made this statement at a news conference last evening while answering a question concerning Sino-U.S. trade relations. She said: The most-favored-nation [MFN] issue is one key provision of the trade accord China and the United States signed when the two countries established diplomatic relations. It is also the foundation of the development of the two countries' trade. She stressed: The MFN issue is strictly a trade issue. China will never accept any attempt to link trade with irrelevant issues, especially the human rights issue. Wu Yi said: China is not afraid even if confrontation ever occurs on the MFN issue [ru guo shuo zai zui hui guo dai yu wen ti shang fa sheng dui kang, zhong guo ye bu hai pa 1172 2654 6141 0961 2584 1920 0948 1765 0795 7344 0006 4099 3932 1417 2123 0022 0948 0048 0008 1364 1830]. It has now established trade relations with more than 200 countries and regions. It has many trade partners. She added: We hope the United States can properly resolve the MFN issue and will not do anything that may give rise to confrontation on this issue because that will not be in the interest of both countries. Wu Yi arrived in Macao from Hong Kong the other day to attend the seventh board of directors meeting of the Nanguang Holdings Company Ltd. after concluding her visit in the United States.
