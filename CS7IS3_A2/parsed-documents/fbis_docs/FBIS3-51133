The country's conditions of accumulation have changed radically. This demands the elaboration of a new concept, an instrument that may make it possible to understand why the economy can or cannot grow, said the specialist in statements to PRENSA LATINA. The economic model, he said, must be basically understood as an analytical abstraction in which there are several levels: the economy's macro additions [macroagregados] (investment and consumption), the sector's structure, the international situation and insertion (under what conditions it takes place), and the institutional framework. He said many economists limit the concept of the model to this last aspect, in which two basic things prevail: organization and norms. According to Monreal, even if the most urgent task of the Cuban Government were to be the adoption of a package of measures aimed at correcting the island's financial problems, the most important job will be in-depth economic restructuring. According to estimates from the Finance Ministry, the Cuban budget deficit in 1993 amounted to 4.2 billion pesos (the same amount in dollars per the official exchange rate) and excess money in circulation surpassed 10 billion. Cuba -- he said -- has a very open economy, whose structure was not designed to compete in the world market but to operate within another constitutional framework: that of the Council of Mutual Economic Aid, which it joined in 1972. He added that within the economy there are competitive sectors, such as sugar, nickel, citrus, tourism, tobacco, rum, electronics, construction and engineering services, and some steel products, among other sectors. There is a second front, not operating right now, but which could be if modernized and reduced. It is reflected in the 130 investment opportunities offered by the State Committee of Economic Collaboration for Foreign Enterprises, as well as a third area (food production), which he considers nonoperational. Monreal is one of those who believes that no proposal for a solution to the economic crisis can accept a squandering of the labor force, which is doubtlessly the country's most valuable resource, he stressed. In this sense he recalled that a possible economic adjustment presupposes the elimination of state subsidies for production and therefore a reduction in jobs. There are at least three options to the former: aspire to the growth of a new state sector that may reabsorb the unemployed, create new jobs in joint ventures, or expand cooperatives beyond the agricultural sector. The two first options -- he said -- have the drawback of having very big external component, whereas the extension of cooperatives to other fields, such as services (particularly in trade) would create a new sector in the economy with a capacity for absorbing an important amount of labor. It is convenient -- he stressed -- to exhaust these three possibilities without undermining the emerging private sector (some 87,000 citizens with licenses for self-employment) which technically is not capitalist, as it is a simple mercantile producer. The structural changes in the economy will ultimately define future growth in that sector, as the constitutional framework has been undergoing modifications and today is much more flexible than two years ago, he said. In socialist production -- he concluded -- there is now a growing presence of market mechanisms, understood to be stimuli for social cooperation, although often surrounded by the myth of the intrinsic impossibility for regulating them, which is totally untrue.
