India had emerged as a major space power in satellite building and space applications in the areas of communication, meteorology, disaster warning and remote sensing, the minister of state in Prime Minister's Office, Mr Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi, said in a written reply. With two operational space systems, Indian national satellite (INSAT) and the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS), the country had demonstrated its technological capabilities in these areas, he said. India had already developed technological capabilities to launch 1000 kg IRS class, satellite through design, development and testing of polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV), Mr Chaturvedi said. The development and operationalisation of geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) before the end of the century, will make India self-sufficient in satellite launch vehicle technology, he said. The minister also said there was no proposal to shut down any of the Trombay nuclear research reactors. However, the Apsara and Cirus research reactors were planned to be refurbished in view of their long service life of about 38 years and 34 years, respectively, he added. [passage omitted]
