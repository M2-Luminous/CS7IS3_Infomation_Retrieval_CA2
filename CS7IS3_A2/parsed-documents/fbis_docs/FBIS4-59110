FBIS4-59110 "drnes091_d_94006" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Libya Silence From Saudi Arabia Questioned After UK Actions Silence From Saudi Arabia Questioned After UK Actions LD0805143394 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 8 May 94 LD0805143394 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] Through its Arabic service, which is controlled by British intelligence, London radio has interviewed the wife of the Saudi dissident Muhammad al-Mas'ari, a prominent member of the human rights committee in Saudi Arabia, who now lives in Britain. Mas'ari's wife said in the interview that she and her family are being harassed by the Saudi authorities and that the latter arrested three of her husband's brothers. Commenting on this, JANA's Arab affairs editor says: For the second time in a few days London radio's Arabic service, which is controlled by the British intelligence, has attacked the Saudi authorities and reported news, statements, and information which tarnish the reputation of the Saudi political regime in such a way that it can clearly be considered as blatant interference in Saudi internal affairs. Despite this, no Saudi official reply has been made. The editor wondered: Why does Saudi Arabia not reply to and protest this British Government radio station which is being incited by British intelligence to insult Saudi Arabia and attack its regime. What would have happened if what this radio has done had been done by an Arab radio or other Arab media. Would Saudi Arabia have remained silent and accepted it with magnanimity, as it once accepted what was published by the U.S. TIME magazine, which is linked to U.S. official circles, and what is broadcast by the Arabic service of the British radio station which is controlled by British intelligence?
