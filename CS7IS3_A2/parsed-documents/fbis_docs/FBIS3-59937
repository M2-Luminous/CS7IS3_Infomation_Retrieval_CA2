Even with the reservations made by Ukraine's Supreme Council, said Oleh Bilorus, the parliament's decree on the ratification of START-1 opened up new possibilities for the practical implementation of Ukraine's international obligations on the destruction of nuclear weapons on its territory. At the same time, Oleh Bilorus stressed the special position occupied by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who insists on a new discussion and ratification by a future new parliament of START-1 complete with the Lisbon Protocol on Nuclear Nonproliferation.
