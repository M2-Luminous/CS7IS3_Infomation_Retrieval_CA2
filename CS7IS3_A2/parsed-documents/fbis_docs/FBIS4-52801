FBIS4-52801 "dreas093_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Foreign Minister Calls Kantor About Trade Talks Foreign Minister Calls Kantor About Trade Talks OW1305141494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1358 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305141494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor agreed Friday night that the two countries should seek to resume the failed trade framework talks before the summit meeting of Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized powers in Naples in July, Foreign Ministry officials said. Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official indicated that subcabinet-level trade talks will resume next week. In a 15-minute telephone call, Kantor agreed with Kakizawa that Japan and the U.S. should create a basis for the resumption of the framework talks before the G-7 summit meeting in July, the officials said. The two also agreed that Tokyo and Washington should hold unofficial contacts on the matter as early as possible, they said. Kakizawa, who made the phone call to have his first conversation with Kantor since assuming the post in late April, told Kantor he thinks it important to establish a relationship of personal trust between them, they said. He also pointed out the importance of Japan-U.S. ties, especially in the economic field, they said. Kantor was quoted as saying he agrees that personal trust is important. Japan and the U.S. failed to reach agreement on the trade framework talk in February when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton, failing to narrow differences over the definition of the previously agreed "objective criteria" to be used to gauge progress in the opening of Japan's markets. The senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said earlier on condition of anonymity that Japan and the U.S. will resume subcabinet-level framework talks next week if a new proposal to break the deadlock wins the approval of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs. Trade Minister Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference that the top-level officials will not carry with them any specific answers to three new U.S. proposals made as conditions for resuming the framework talks. Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks and the "objective criteria" sought by the U.S. to assess progress in Japanese efforts for opening its markets.
