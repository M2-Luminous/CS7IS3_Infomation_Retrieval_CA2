Today, Xu Penghang, State Economic Restructuring Commission vice minister, made the above remarks. Ten years ago, China set the strategic goal of manufacturing major technological equipment at home, and in line with the state long-term development plan, decided on 15 special research projects centering on energy, transportation, raw material sectors including complete technological equipment for large open-cut coal mining, large-scale thermal power stations, an ultra high tension power transmission and transformation project, the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex's second stage project, large chemical fertilizer plants, a 300,000-tonne ethylene plant, the Daqin Railway, and desert oil drilling. Because the state attaches importance to these projects, great cooperation among relevant departments, provinces, and municipalities; joint efforts by thousands of enterprises, institutions, and by hundreds and thousands of scientific and technological personnel; and through the integration of technology and trade and through importing and assimilating technologies, China has gradually mastered the key technologies and built production bases for a number of major technological equipment. So far, 40 complete sets of major technological equipment have been completed, commissioned, and applied in some 50 key construction and technological transformation projects. For instance, Beijing's electron-positron collider has been operating smoothly and reliably over the last several years, has been highly evaluated by international high-energy physics circles, and has been made public to the outside world. A complete set of single bucket-wheel excavator technology for open-cut mining, capable of producing 10 million tonne output annually, has been promoted at the Nanfeng Iron Mine and Huolinhe Coal Mine and was exported to Pakistan, where it was well received. Both the electron-positron collider and the single-bucket wheel excavator technology won the State Scientific and Technological Progress Prizes. Through technological imports and joint ventures, large capacity generators for thermal power stations, thirteen 300,000 kw generators in all with over 90-percent domestic-parts, have been completed, commissioned, and have begun transmitting power. In addition, two 600,000 kw generating sets for thermal power stations, with over 80-percent domestic-made parts, have been commissioned at the Pingxu Power Station and have begun transmitting power, thus ranking China among the world's leaders in designing, manufacturing, installing, testing, and operating large capacity generating sets for thermal power stations. In the area of large metallurgical equipment, China is now capable of designing and manufacturing international advanced level large continuous slab casting machines. As for chemical equipment, a capability of annually producing 240,000 tonnes of phosphamidon, has been installed in areas including Nanjing. A complete set of equipment, with over 80-percent domestic-parts, capable of annually producing 200,000 tonnes of synthetic ammonia, has been installed at Sichuan Chemical Plant and begun operation. It has been learned that the State Council recently decided to disband the State Council's Leading Group for Major Technological Equipment and transfer its functions to the State Economic Restructuring Commission. The Commission will be charged with managing major domestic-made equipment and with formulating an annual plan for manufacturing domestic-made major technological equipment. The purpose is to make use of the Economic Management Department's comprehensive functions to further promote enterprises' technological progress.
