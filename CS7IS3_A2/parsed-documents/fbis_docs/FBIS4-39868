Grachev described his talks with Aliyev as "successful." The discussion focused on two military issues -- the future of the Gabelinskaya missile attack warning station in northern Azerbaijan and the establishment of a united air-defence system in the Trans- Caucasus. The sides agreed that the station is of strategic importance not only for Russia and Azerbaijan, but also for other CIS states and foreign countries. Experts have been ordered to discuss the question and work out an agreement for signing. Grachev also called for establishing a common air-defence system in the region. Earlier the idea was supported by Armenia and Georgia. Grachev expressed the hope that Azerbaijan will give a positive answer, adding that if it agrees otherwise, Russia will proceed with building the system in cooperation with Armenia and Georgia. Speaking about the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Grachev said that he learnt many new things about it from Aliyev, particularly about the impact of the political situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict and that no cease-fire deal can stop the conflict unless a comprehensive political agreement is signed between Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia on conflict settlement. The minister said he will inform President Boris Yeltsin about the talks, adding that such a document is now being considered by the Russian Foreign Ministry and other concerned agencies. Azerbaijan and Armenia have been observing the cease-fire on the whole, Grachev said. However, according to available information both sides are building up strength in preparations for a new wave of hostilities. At the same time, he noted that Russia as a mediator controls the situation in the region. He said the deployment of Russian peace-keeping troops in the region was not discussed at the talks. During his June 8-11 tour, Grachev also visited Armenia, Georgia and Abkhazia.
