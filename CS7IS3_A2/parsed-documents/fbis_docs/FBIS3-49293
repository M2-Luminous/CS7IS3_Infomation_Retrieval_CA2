Robert Richard Kiss reports from their news briefing: [Kiss] A request for the registration of Torgyan's party has been refused, Torgyan himself said at a news briefing. The party was formed in order for the electors to clearly see who they are voting for in the elections. Just like the Independent Smallholders' Party, other parties would also like to get into parliament. There would have been only one Torgyan party but, following the refusal, it is clear that the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] can launch the fight on its own and it will not establish an alliance with anybody before the first round of the elections, Jozsef Torgyan said. He then talked about the party's foreign political strategy. The green light must be given to Asian and Pacific capital, because companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan would invest billions of dollars in Hungary. [passage omitted]
