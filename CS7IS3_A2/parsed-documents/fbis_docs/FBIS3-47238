Depending on North Korea's attitude, there is a high possibility that North Korea and the United States will establish their respective embassies in Washington and Pyongyang within one to two years. Diplomatic observers predict that if the present trend continues as it is, the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean talks will be held in February to discuss the matter of improving diplomatic relations and economic cooperation between them, including the matter of eliminating the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development. Because North Korea is the most closed society in the world and distrust between the United States and North Korea is so deep, there are many obstacles that should be eliminated before diplomatic relations are realized between them. North Korea's Attitude Cannot Be Foreseen In view of the present situation we can hardly foresee what will happen in the negotiations between the United States and North Korea even before they realize the third round of their high-level talks. This is because North Korea's attitude so far has made us believe so. For instance, bilateral negotiations that we had believed to be successful have suddenly returned to the starting point so frequently that even experts could hardly make estimates. At present North Korea has agreed with the United States on nuclear inspections and the resumption of North-South dialogue. However, many experts wonder if North Korea will sincerely discuss detailed procedures for the inspections with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and will provide sincere coordination to the IAEA inspections. Diplomatic experts who are critical of North Korea's negotiation attitude diagnose that "it is difficult to expect a de facto dialogue between North and South Korea because North Korea has persistently employed the policy of splitting up the cooperative relations between South Korea and the United States particularly in connection with the issue of North-South Korean dialogue." Of course, South Korean and U.S. officials concerned believe that North Korea will have to offer coordination to some degree if it finds this necessary. The United States thinks that if North Korea sincerely shows its intention to hold dialogue with South Korea, the ROK Government will not oppose the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks even before the exchange of special envoys to discuss the North- South mutual nuclear inspection issue is realized. Many experts on North Korean affairs, including senior researcher (Leonard Spector) at the Carnegie Foundation, diagnose that because its present internal and external realities are completely different from those of the past, North Korea will inevitably seek even partial opening up and internationalization within a scope that does not hurt its present political system. Estimating the overall situation, it is almost certain that the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks will be held within several weeks. The U.S. Government position is that North Korea and the United States, which have had hostile relations for half a century, can discuss all pending issues, including the North Korean nuclear issue, at the third round of talks where they are to discuss the matter of improving political and economic relations. Normalization May Hardly Come If the third round of high-level talks are held, the United States is expected to put forward seven demands to the North Korean side, namely, the complete return to the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty], special inspection of two undeclared nuclear sites; tangible progress in inter-Korean dialogue, including mutual nuclear inspections; suspension of missile exports; improvement of the human rights situation; return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean war; cessation of terrorist activities; and suspension of denunciation of the United States. These demands were put forth also by the Bush administration as a precondition for the improvement of U.S. relations with North Korea. On the other hand, the North Korean side is expected to come up with all the pending issues it wishes to solve with the United States--such as the normalization of relations; assistance in building light-water moderated reactors; the abolition of the Armistice Agreement and the signing of a peace agreement; the disbanding of the UN Forces Command and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the ROK; lifting the restrictions on trade with and investment in North Korea pursuant to the U.S. law on trade with hostile states; lifting the ban on communications; a promise not to wage a preemptive nuclear strike on North Korea and not to use nuclear weapons against the North; economic cooperation; and assistance with North Korean entry into international economic bodies--and a call for a package solution, according to diplomatic sources in Washington. Will it be possible that all these problems are solved as a package deal in the third round of talks and bring about the normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations within this year? To this question, even the most optimistic observers are expressing doubts. Both sides intend to carry through all of their demands in the third round of talks, but it is practically impossible to settle so many pending issues at one stroke. Indeed, North Korea is eager to normalize its relations with the United States, but if it fails to be so successful as establishing its embassy in the United States, it may well try to establish a liaison office or a trade mission within this year to concentrate on economic cooperation, according to an analysis of diplomatic experts. U.S. Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis stressed on 5 January that in the third round of talks, the United States will certainly induce North Korea to accede to special inspections. Flexibility for Special Inspection The experts, however, are of the opinion that North Korea will take a stubborn attitude of refusing to permit the first ever special inspection of the undeclared nuclear sites by the IAEA, thus using it as a card for negotiation. Because of this position of North Korea, the third round of talks is likely to come up against quite a few difficulties. Therefore, four or five or more round of talks could be necessary, involving many rounds of unofficial contacts for each of them. However, as to the method of nuclear inspections, the United States and the IAEA hinted a flexibility of considering methods that could bring about the effect of inspection close to the special inspection without using the term "special inspection." This enhances the chances for reaching compromise. There is a high probability that the special inspection will be linked with the inter-Korean mutual nuclear inspection including inspection of the U.S. military bases in the ROK, thus complicating the process for the solution of the problem, diplomatic sources said. The officials, in particular, revealed that there is a high possibility that the North Korean side will utilize this issue as a means for "adjustment of speed." Diplomatic observers in Washington believe that there was a previous instance that North Korea suspended the mutual visits of separated families while it was partially pushing ahead with them after having judged that the visits were harmful to maintaining its system. Therefore, it is highly likely that North Korea will push for the improvement of relations with the United States while continuing the political and diplomatic evaluation of its efforts for the improvement. Dependence on Adjustment of Speed by the North Meanwhile, the U.S. side is regarding the issue of missile proliferation as a very sensitive issue no less than the nuclear issue. Therefore, it is likely that the United States will not allow the improvement of relations without the solution to this problem. At the same time, the observers predict that the human rights issue, to which the Clinton administration attaches as much importance as that to nonproliferation of mass lethal weapons, will emerge as a major pending issue when ambassador-level envoys are exchanged, although the issue may not be a grave obstacle at the stage of establishing liaison offices. A U.S. State Department official said that "one should pay keen attention to the development of ROK-China relations before reading the script of improvement of U.S.-North Korea relations," thus strongly suggesting a method of step-by-step approaches. In addition to the U.S. Government, a diplomatic expert who maintains close relations with North Korea noted that "epochal steps, including the disbanding of the UN Command and replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, should be taken before the two sides formally establish diplomatic relations." He added that "it seems that this issue will not be resolved simply in the future few months" and that "the establishment of mutual liaison offices within this year itself, if realized, should be assessed as successful." He revealed that "North Korea seems to wish that the United States will open communications with North Korea first of all, exclude North Korea from being subject to application of the law on trade with hostile countries, and open the door for economic relations with it." He pointed to the great possibility that North Korea will attach greater importance to economic cooperation than to formal diplomatic relations, which will rapidly accelerate its opening up, in a bid to maintain its system. He observed that the North Korean side's request for U.S. support for construction of a light-water atomic reactor is aimed at making the United States lift its restrictions on investment and trade. Some other observers note that there is a possibility that North Korea will, as in the past, pursue a "package deal solution." However, North Korea is not in a position to immediately accept all of the U.S. side's demands. In conclusion, it is a common view of experts that the script concerning the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea will vary in different forms according to the degree of adjusting the speed by the North Korean side. There is also a pessimistic view that even the establishment of liaison offices will not be possible within this year.
