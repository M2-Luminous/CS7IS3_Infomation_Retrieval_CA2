At least three helicopters and two planes are participating in the bombings that began in early this morning in a zone located approximately 4 kms south of San Cristobal de las Casas and where there are 13 Indian towns with a population of 5,000. The main towns under attack, where clashes have been held with scattered guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), are: Corralito, San Isidro, El Ocotal, Corazon de Maria, San Antonio Los Banos, and Pinavetal. The residents of San Cristobal de las Casas have said the situation has become "alarming" because the bombings started behind the mountain ranges and are now continuing on the outskirts of the city, although sources said that at first glance one cannot detect the presence of guerrillas. The sources could not say how many soldiers are involved in the operation but noted there are 10,000 soldiers just in the state's capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, in addition to other contingents in Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Ocosingo, where the fighting continues. Official reports indicate the bombings and clashes have ceased, although there is the possibility that the authorities have refused to give information on the new attacks to keep it from leaking to other rebel groups and warning them. This past Tuesday alone, approximately 5,000 soldiers, 27 tanks, two amphibious vehicles, 18 all-terrain vehicles, two fuel trucks, a repair unit, and 10 troop transport trucks arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas. Unofficial sources indicated that the Army had possibly uncovered several rebel headquarters located in the Lacandona jungle and those were the objectives being bombed at the moment. According to experts, the force deployed to Chiapas is greater than any used by neighboring Central American countries against a particular guerrilla force. This force has become a genuine military offensive. Unofficially it is being said that, despite the Army having regained near total control of the municipalities of Ocosingo, the Zapatists continue to harass nearby communities. Ocosingo as well as the communities of Altamirano, San Cristobal, and La Margaritas have not yet returned to their daily work or school activities, neither has potable water, electricity, or gas been reestablished. On the other hand, several warnings have appeared written in red on the walls of buildings in the municipality of Tapachula, located 12 kms from the Guatemalan border, indicating: "We are already here, we will continue our struggle," and describe the population as cowards. In the meantime, rumors still persist in San Cristobal related to the alleged capture of "Commander Marco," leader of the armed uprising that broke out this past Saturday. The prosecutor general of the republic has scheduled a news conference in the next few hours to provide details on the numerous rumors circulating on the situation.
