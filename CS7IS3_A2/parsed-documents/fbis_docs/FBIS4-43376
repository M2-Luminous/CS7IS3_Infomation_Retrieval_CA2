"We need a national employment pact in Germany," SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf Scharping stressed at the 15th DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress in Berlin today. "Courage and political decisiveness" are needed to attract available money in Germany to finance jobs and not unemployment. It is not acceptable that 120 billion German marks [DM] are spent each year to finance unemployment, he said. Changed framework conditions for economic and taxation policies are now required. Scharping again came out against the solidarity levy [to finance German unity], which is to be reintroduced next year. This is "socially unjust" and "economically questionable." If 80 percent of those liable to taxation have to "dig deep into their pockets," then they will be forced to compensate for this deficit in the next pay round. The business world should also be aware of this fact. Instead of a "stream of ever new taxes," the government should finally commit itself to an active campaign against tax evasion and subsidy abuses at the big companies, the SPD chairman stressed, in light of the recent scandals at Baederkoenig Zwick or concerning the property magnate Schneider. In this connection, the "dangerously high state debt" is alarming. It would have reached DM2 billion by the end of the year. That is equivalent to a per capita debt of DM25,000. Not least for this reason, higher earners should at last be turned to in order to finance German unity. Scharping was critical of the low level of state expenditure for research, which only makes up 1.5 percent of the federal budget. Only by means of a clearly expanded research and development program can an ecologically sound economy with international competitive advantages be achieved. The SPD emphatically appealed for more rigorous action against the right-wing and tougher intervention by the police during violence. "If drunken idiots chase citizens, then the police must intervene and lock them up instead of releasing them before the state prosecutor sees them," and the ringleaders must be held up by the [land] parliaments. The SPD leader offered the trade union federation close cooperation in modernizing the social welfare state. Many things in the public sector are too bureaucratic and too inflexible. With a view to the imminent postal reforms, he emphasized that purposeful privatization can definitely be put into practice more effectively if common responsibility for it is accepted.
