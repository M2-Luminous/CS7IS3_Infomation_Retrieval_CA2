Suzhou, an ancient garden city, has developed into an economically-booming city in east China. At present, Singapore companies have concluded letters of intent and agreements on more than 50 contracts on cooperative projects with the Suzhou city government. With a sum of three billion U.S. dollars, these projects involve the fields of tourism, energy development, transportation, electronics, machinery, textiles, chemicals and the service trade. A local official noted that banking and economic entities from the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Austria and Taiwan have contacted the Singaporean government to express their wishes to participate in the development of the industrial park.
