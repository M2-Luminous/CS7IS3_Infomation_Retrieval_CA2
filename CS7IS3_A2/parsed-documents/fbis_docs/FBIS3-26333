The group, set up two years ago, is engaged in computer science, and has developed a dozen new products, including a computer worked by writing instead of by a keyboard. It invested 50 million yuan in the construction of a software development center, the largest in the country. The number of subsidiaries has grown from eight in 1992 to 38 in 1993. Last year, its sale value reached 360 million yuan and its profits and taxes totalled 46 million yuan, respectively up by 125 percent and 31 percent over the previous year. Premier Li Peng visited the group on January 6, 1993. He showed great interest in the research and development of the software for the computer worked by handwriting. He asked Shi Yuzhu, general manager of the group, to send a telegram if they succeed in the research. In August 1993, Shi sent a telegram to the premier telling him that their research program had passed the technological test sponsored by Guangdong Province. When Li Peng was at the company on February 2, Shi told the premier that his group was now working on a new software program for translating Chinese into English and vice versa. The premier expressed his best wishes for the success of the group. During his visit, Li Peng also talked with employees of the group and had a group photo taken with them.
