FR940207-2-00113 FR940207-2-00062 Panel on the Environment & Public Health Plans Field Trip and Workshop on Yucca Mountain Terrestrial Ecosystems Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Panel on the Environment & Public Health has scheduled a field trip to Yucca Mountain followed by a one-day workshop in Las Vegas on March 21 and 22, 1994. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is being characterized by the Department of Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. Both the field trip and the workshop will focus on the terrestrial ecosystem studies being conducted in conjunction with the Yucca Mountain project. Although the field trip and the meeting are open to the public, the number of participants who can attend the field trip will be limited, and advance reservations will be necessary. (See information below on making advance reservations.) The workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 4255 South Paradise, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109; telephone (702) 369&hyph;4400; fax (702) 369&hyph;3770. The field trip on March 21 will allow panel members and consultants to review the work described to the panel by the DOE at the panel's November 22, 1993, meeting in Las Vegas. The panel will visit locations where environmental monitoring activities are being conducted, as well as other locations where scientific studies are under way at the site that could help project the long-term environmental effects of a potential repository. These might include sites where infiltration and evapotranspiration are being studied, and places where there is evidence of fracture-rooting of plants. No cameras or videorecorders are allowed on the field trip. A box lunch will be provided. Persons wishing to attend the field trip must submit the following information by telephone or fax to Frank Randall at the Board's offices in Arlington, Virginia; telephone (703) 235&hyph;4473; fax (703) 235&hyph;4495. Non-U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship, passport number and expiration date, immigrant alien status, type of visa and expiration date, name and address of employer, name and address of work place (if different from employer's), length of time in the United States, and alien registration number. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the field trip. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued. This information must be provided to the Board no later than February 17, 1994. You also must bring your passport or alien registration card with you to the badging office when you begin the field trip. U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, place of birth, date of birth, and your business name and address. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the field trip. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued. All information must be provided to the Board no later than March 4, 1994. The workshop, which will begin at 8:30 a.m. on March 22, will continue the panel's review of the DOE's environmental activities at Yucca Mountain, focusing particularly on the potential long-term interactions between a possible repository and the overlying and surrounding environment. The workshop also will explore a previously stated Board concern that experimental studies might be needed to develop the information necessary to adequately forecast the long-term environmental effects of a repository. Panel members will hear presentations from representatives of the DOE and its contractors on the Thermal-Loading Study Design, evapotranspiration, and heat transfer from a potential repository to the surface environment. The panel also will investigate the legal requirements for environmental programs at Yucca Mountain, and the implications of those legal requirements for the technical studies to be conducted. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning May 4, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs, Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; (703) 235&hyph;4473. Dated: February 1, 1994. William Barnard, Executive Director, Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2674 Filed 2&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;AM&hyph;M
