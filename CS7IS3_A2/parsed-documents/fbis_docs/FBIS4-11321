Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the Communist Party Politburo, confirmed this decision during his speech to close The Nation and the Emigrants conference, which lasted three days and was attended by the over 200 guests living in 29 countries. I want to emphasize our determination not to turn back on the path we have taken and to continue working in the future with a common and constant effort to build this two-way road in relations between Cuba and its emigrants, despite the Cuban-U.S. disagreement, Balaguer stressed. During a nine-minute speech, Balaguer stressed that despite political, ideological, or any other sort of differences among participants in the conference, Cuba's independence and sovereignty constituted the most important points of agreement. Balaguer added that this attitude conveys the patriotism felt by a large number of Cuban emigrants, many of whom also demanded that the 30-year U.S. embargo against Cuba be lifted. Balaguer pointed out that discussion topics such as the elimination of the U.S. blockade, the preservation of our undeniable social conquests, and not returning to the horrors of a past of exploitation and submission for Cuba have been widely agreed by participants, which demonstrates the sincere patriotism that prevails among emigrants. In addition, Balaguer indicated that the maturity and culture of Cubans on the island is the fundamental starting point that today enables us to advance our goal of normalizing relations between Cuba and the emigrants. Balaguer asserted that "we must not forget the wound that has not yet completely healed or the abnormal circumstances that still threaten the security of the fatherland." Balaguer only excluded from the rapprochement process supporters of the island's annexation to the United States, terrorists, political demagogues, and those referred to as false patriots. He maintained that they -- those who insist on the goal of destroying the revolution and thus endangering the existence itself of the nation, its sovereignty, and that Cuban nature we have mentioned so often -- do not have any room in these noble intentions, which do not target anyone in particular. At the end of Balaguer's speech, several participants chanted in the plenary hall of the Conventions Palace. Down the halls they shouted the slogan, Cuba yes, blockade no. Today's session was marked by the special participation of Vice President Carlos Lage, who talked about the state of the economy and its outlook. Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso said Lage told Cubans living abroad about the possibility of participating in the opening to foreign capital initiated in Cuba last year but said the application of this policy would be discussed in future meetings. In yesterday's session, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced six government measures, many of them old aspirations of the participants in the meeting with the purpose of facilitating the emigrants' links to their nation and cultural exchanges.
