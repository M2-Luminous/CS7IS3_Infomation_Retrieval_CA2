From this angle, the Romanian diplomat added, the Foreign Ministry has made some points in connection with certain statements regarding the granting to the Russian Federation of a special status within the Partnership for Peace: the discriminatory character of the partnership was to Romania the main argument to accept this initiative. "Our country", the spokesman added, "along with the other states, is aware of the importance of the Russian Federation's role in ensuring stability and security in Europe and considers it natural that the relation of cooperation between the NATO and Russia should materialize in an individual, substantive and comprehensive program of partnership that should reflect Russia's status, importance, ability and wish to help in attaining the partnership participants' common objectives. However, this relation must not alter the prime requisite of equality among the states participating in the partnership. In this context, the Romanian Foreign Ministry considers that the specific contribution the Russian Federation can make to security and stability in Europe, by developing constructive relations with the North-Atlantic Alliance can be fully reflected in the Partnership for Peace." As announced by the Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, the premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Peng, will be on an official visit in Romania over 9-12 July to examine with the host country the present stage and the prospects for the development of the friendship and cooperation relations between China and Romania, and to sign a number of documents, such as the joint declaration on the friendship and cooperation relations between Romania and the People's republic of China, economic, commercial and cultural agreements. Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu will be in Warsaw on 23 and 24 June for an official visit, and on 28 June he will be in London for a working visit in Great Britain.
