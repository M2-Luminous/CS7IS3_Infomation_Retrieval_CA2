The election date has been set three times and has been postponed three times -- the last time until 20 November 1994. The majority of the kray's political forces have come out sharply against this, including the "Otechestvo" patriotic movement with the biggest mass appeal here, the All-Kuban Cossack Host, and the kray organization of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Moreover, "Otechestvo's" Coordinating Council has even brought a court action against Kray Administration Head N. Yegorov for violating citizens' constitutional electoral rights. This situation has now been exacerbated by a new development. It was learned right after the May holidays that Nikolay Yegorov had been appointed a Russian Federation minister (it has not yet been divulged what his functions will be in the government). According to unofficial data, V. Gladskoy, first deputy head of the kray administration, has categorically refused to take up this post and is still merely acting governor. Thus, the Kuban is at present without both legislative power and executive power in the person of a legitimate administration head. Yu. Skokov, previously the leader of a major Krasnodar Kray enterprise; V. Samoylenko, the present mayor of the city of Krasnodar; and some others are being named here among the possible candidates for this post. It is not, however, a question of which of them the president will choose and whom he will appoint in his edict, already for the third time, to rule the Kuban. Public opinion is unequivocally inclined to hold an election of the administration head. The Kuban deputies in the State Duma have sent a letter to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin demanding the holding of simultaneous elections of the kray administration head, the kray legislative assembly, and the organs of local self-management no later than September (in other words right after the end of the cereal grain harvest). Today the same demand is being advanced by the Cossacks and a number of the kray's political and public organizations. As for the population, it advocated elections in a referendum as long ago as 25 April last year. If the country's leaders do not heed public opinion this time either, the political situation in the kray might be sharply exacerbated by the beginning of summer.
