Meanwhile, more are gathering them, and more are being poisoned. The Voronezh, Rostov, Lipetsk, and Tambov oblasts are the clearest examples. In all cases, poisonings with lethal outcomes have resulted from using death-cup amanitas in food. In a random survey, they were found in every eighth to tenth basket! One and a half grams is enough to end up in the hospital. In 1992, 400 cases of mushroom poisoning were recorded in Russia. Thirty-three persons, including 18 children, died.
