The parents of Eyal Moqed, one of the administrative detainees, announced that they would demonstrate tonight outside the Hasharon Prison demanding that their son be presented immediately before a judge as is the practice in administrative detentions cases of any Israeli citizen. Shmu'el Ben-Ishay of Qiryat Arba', who was detained for three months under an administrative order, is also incarcerated in Hasharon Prison, and the High Court of Justice will consider the legality of his detention this week.
