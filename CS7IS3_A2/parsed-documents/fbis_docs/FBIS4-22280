Importers of food products suffered the most, since up until recently a large part of these goods had been imported duty-free. Now the amount of import duties on a number of goods in this group will comprise an average of 10-15 percent of the customs value. Specifically, meat and meat products, fish, butter and vegetable oil, milk and dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables, white sugar, grain and products made from it have been placed in the category of food products which are subject to payment of duty. Despite the fact that for individual types of food products, sausage goods for example, the amount of duty has been increased to 20 percent, in the opinion of the primary suppliers of these types of goods to the Russian market, it is unlikely that there will be a significant change in the level of their wholesale prices in the near future. First of all, everyone was ready for the introduction of the new import tariff, and therefore the products were brought in ahead of time. Secondly, for now the regimen of preferences is being retained, as is the possibility of re-orienting our activity for delivery of a greater portion of products from countries which enjoy these preferences, i.e., from the developing countries and the least developed countries. The rates of import duty on the long-suffering alcoholic beverages have been subject to significant changes. Added to the recently increased excise tax rates were also increased import duty rates. As for the rates themselves, evidently heeding the repeatedly expressed wishes of domestic producers, the rate of tariff on the import of alcohol will be fixed to the "literage." For example, while on hard liquor (TN VED code 2208) the duty will now comprise 2 EKYu for 1 liter, on ethyl alcohol (220710000)--although the rate of tariff is set in percent of the customs value--after final computation of the amount of payment it should be correlated with the established 2 EKYu for 1 liter. Undoubtedly, tariff determined in this manner excludes the possibility of excessive underestimation of the contract value (the favorite and easiest method of minimizing customs payments). However, we must note that the representatives of the domestic alcohol industry did not count on the setting of such high duties for analogous import products. According to their computations, the optimal duty rate for the import of alcoholic beverages is approximately $1.5 for 1 liter. If this amount is exceeded, the importers will be tempted to re-orient themselves toward contraband import. However, prior to the arrival of the designated time, direct importers of alcoholic beverages, just as the importers of food products, had prepared a unique buffer in order to smoothe the inevitable leap in wholesale and retail prices: Today there are enough goods stored up in the warehouses to ensure a "smooth price increase." From the standpoint of the principle of defending the interests of domestic producers, perhaps the most effective have proven to be the innovations relating to the import of automobiles. The recent increase in excise taxes on the import of foreign makes has already yielded a "positive effect." With the increased cost of foreign models, not only did their import begin to decline, but consumers began to exhibit increased interest in domestic-made automobiles. This sets new tasks for their dealers. As for the owners of automobile dealerships, in their opinion, under the new conditions the main part of the income will now come from servicing the rather large pool of foreign made cars which already exists in Russia and selling spare parts for them.
