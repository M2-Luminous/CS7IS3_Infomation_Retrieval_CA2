FR940504-0-00042 FR940504-0-00011 47 CFR Part 73 [ET Docket No. 92&hyph;298, FCC 94&hyph;88] Broadcast Services; AM Radio Stereophonic Transmitting Equipment Standard AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule; supplemental order. SUMMARY: By this Supplemental Order, the Commission affirms its decision to adopt the Motorola C-Quam system as the standard for the stereophonic AM broadcast radio service. On November 23, 1993, the Commission released a Report and Order implementing the C-Quam AM stereo standard. Subsequent to the release on the Report and Order, it has come to the attention of the Commission that a number of comments had been inadvertently overlooked. After review of these additional comments, the Commission finds no new evidence or information that warrants a change in its decision in this matter. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David L. Means, Office of Engineering and Technology, Authorization and Evaluation Division, (301) 725&hyph;1585, extension 206. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Order, FCC 94&hyph;88, adopted April 12, 1994, and released April 28, 1994. The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies may also be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International Transcription Services, at (202) 857&hyph;3800 or 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Summary of the Order 1. In response to the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 (Authorization Act), the Commission adopted a Report and Order in this proceeding, 58 FR 66300, December 20, 1993, selecting the C-Quam system as the single AM stereo transmission standard. 1 Subsequent to the release of the Report and Order, it was found that twenty comments had inadvertently not been considered. Most of these comments were improperly or untimely filed. Nevertheless, because other late and improperly filed comments were considered in the Report and Order, we have elected to consider all of these comments at this time. 1 See Telecommunications Act of 1992, Public Law No. 102&hyph;538. See also Report and Order, FCC 93&hyph;485 (released November 23, 1993). 2. All of the previously unconsidered comments oppose the Commission's proposed selection of C-Quam as the AM stereo standard. Most parties generally allege some form of technical superiority of the Kahn system, or conversely, some technical inferiority of the C-Quam system. Specifically, these parties claim the C-Quam system exhibits technical flaws, including ``platform motion,'' loss of coverage, and increased adjacent channel interference. 2 In addition, some commenting parties recommend that additional testing or evaluation be undertaken. Other parties question the compatibility of C-Quan with future AM band digital audio transmission systems, argue that adopting a system other than Kahn's as the standard will force them to re-engineer antenna array, or contend that Motorola unfairly manipulated the marketplace to create its competitive lead. 2 See, for example, comments of Hughes H. Brewer, Broadcast Devices, Inc. (BDI), E. P. De La Hunt, Joseph A. Dentici, David Smith Forsman, Interstate Broadcasting Company (Interstate), Richard W. Jolls, Robert M. Kanner, Patrick M. O'Gara, and Ridgefield Broadcasting Corporation (Ridgefield). Discussion
