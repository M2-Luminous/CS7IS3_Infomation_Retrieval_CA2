Any hopes that such ardour might cool with time have again been dashed in recent weeks. Like a poor man's Communist International, the Iranians still seek to export revolution and violence across the globe. This was most recently exemplified by the crude forgeries of British Government correspondence on Bosnia -- in an attempt to prove anti-Muslim bias -- which triggered the round of Anglo-Iranian diplomatic expulsions. Along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and North Korea, Iran not only chooses to remain outside the family of nations, but also assaults its basic values. While all these countries lack the resources of a superpower, they share a siege mentality that prompts them to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- as Iranian funding for the North Korean Rodong missile programme so chillingly demonstrates. In Iran's case such behaviour is, of course, always affected by the regime's internal power struggles. Divisions between the pragmatists led by President Rafsanjani and the radicals led by the spiritual leader, Ali Khamene'i, endure; indeed, far from being a figment of Western imagination the distinction between the two camps is made by the Iranians themselves. In the West there is a general belief that it should be easier to treat with the "pragmatists." But if anything, it might in fact be easier to live with the religious radicals, because they are less interested in the non-Muslim world. By contrast, the pragmatists pay far greater attention to Iran's strategic interests. Merely because they believe that Iran and Islam cannot triumph through spiritual elan alone, and require Western capital and technology to accomplish their ends, does not make them easier partners. But the truth is that neither faction is as concerned with foreign policy as many in the West suppose; to be seen publicly to undo any segment of Ayatollah Khomeyni's legacy is to court disaster, and so Iran's overseas adventurism continues as though on autopilot. The Clinton Administration's policy has been one of "dual containment" towards both Iran and Iraq, based on the assumption that as long as Iran is kept weak there will be no need to depend on Iraq to contain it. Pressure on Iran should be maintained, especially as the Iranians are vulnerable following the halving of their oil revenues since the Gulf war. Britain, for its part, should join America in pressing for an end to concessional finance and the transfer of high technology goods, even if countries such as France and Germany are willing to soft-pedal their differences with Iran over terrorism for short-sighted commercial and political gain.
