Xie Fei spent 11 days inspecting six cities and 10 counties in eastern Guangdong, including Huizhou, Shanwei, Shantou, Jieyang, Meizhou, and Heyuan. He inspected crop growing bases, aquatic cultivation bases, and some development zones and village and town enterprises. He also investigated and studied the current rural economic situation and future development trends in eastern Guangdong. On many occasions, Xie Fei repeatedly stressed the importance of the agricultural issue, pointing out that Guangdong can quicken the pace of its modernization drive only if it can ensure good agricultural work. He said to local cadres: Guangdong's secondary and tertiary industries have developed rapidly over the last few years, and the trend has been very good. However, we should realize that some people in some localities still tend to overlook agriculture, especially grain production, and this problem is quite serious in some localities. We must not forget China's national conditions and the rural areas -- the foundation of the country. If the rural areas are not developed, Guangdong's development will be impeded, affecting its plan to achieve set modernization goals in 20 years. Therefore, this year, while continuing to develop the secondary and tertiary industries, we should focus on rural work in some key areas. Xie Fei was especially concerned about grain production. He pointed out: The core of the agricultural issue is grain. The primary issue of Guangdong's agricultural work is to stabilize grain production; we should not totally rely on grain supplies from other provinces. Our grain output can surely increase steadily as long as our guiding thought is clearly set forth and the policy is correct; and as long as we practice scientific farming and maintain good efficiency in grain growing. He also cautioned city, county, township, and town cadres to pay attention to protecting cultivated land. In Shanwei and Heyuan cities, he inspected a few typical projects using hilly areas to develop secondary and tertiary industries, and fully approved this method. He highly praised the Shantou City New and High-Technology Industrial Development Zone for planning to build multi-story factory houses to minimize the use of land. Xie Fei was extremely concerned about how Guangdong's rural economy will develop. He inspected several places where both farming and aquatic cultivation were quite well developed. He said: Modern agriculture should be an open and export-oriented one. After Guangdong has stabilized grain production, it should feel free to develop a diversified economy. As when developing industry, it can introduce funds, technology, fine strains, and processing equipment from outside the country to develop new production work, exploit marine resources, develop mountainous areas, and develop the farming, aquatic cultivation, and processing industry on a big scale. Beside grain, for which it will still need to rely on other provinces, Guangdong will be able to export large amounts of other agricultural products, such as vegetables, fruits, poultry, and aquatic products. He stressed Guangdong has been very successful in opening up its industry, and that it should also open up agriculture. During his investigation and study tour of eastern Guangdong, Xie Fei also expressed his views on developing village and town enterprises on a large scale, and on speeding up the shift of the surplus rural work force to secondary and tertiary industries.
