FR940217-0-00016 FR940217-0-00006 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 426 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 194 airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04. The requirements of that AD were estimated to take approximately 360 work hours at a current average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was estimated to be $9,600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the total cost impact of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04 on U.S. operators would be $5,703,600, or $29,400 per airplane, over the initial 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.) The FAA estimates that a total of 269 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by the new requirements specified in this AD. This increase in the number of affected airplanes is due to various reasons, including transfer of ownership and the fact that additional airplanes have accumulated time-in-service since the issuance of AD 90&hyph;16&hyph;04 and have now reached the threshold for modification/inspection. The new additional requirements contained in this AD action will take approximately 796 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost an additional $101,900 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $39,187,920, or $145,680 per airplane, over a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, and tool acquisition.) The figures discussed above are based on the assumption that no operator has yet accomplished the currently required or the newly required requirements of this AD action. However, the FAA has been advised that various modifications that are required by this AD have previously been accomplished on many of the affected airplanes. Therefore, the future total cost impact of this AD is less that the figure shown. Additional airplanes will be affected as they accumulate time-in-service and reach the threshold for modification/inspection. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
