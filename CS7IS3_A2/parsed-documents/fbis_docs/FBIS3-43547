A report from Harare said this was the first increase in salaries of the president and his ministers since 1992, when all increments were suspended due to a severe drought that left half the country's population of 10 million dependent on imported food. Mr. Mugabe got the largest increase of 64 percent, pushing his annual salary to 17,560 U.S. dollars, plus housing and other allowances of 6,829 dollars a year. An average Zimbabwean worker is paid about 900 dollars a year. Mr. Mugabe also does not pay income tax. Mr. Mugabe's two vice-presidents received 60 percent increases and sharply increased housing and general allowances. Ministers received a 30-percent increase in salaries, plus allowances which rose by nearly 90 percent, while the salaries of Members of Parliament were raised by nearly 50 percent.
