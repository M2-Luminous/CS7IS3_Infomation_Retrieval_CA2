FBIS3-58698 "drweu009__a94006" FBIS-WEU-94-009-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 December 1993 ANNEX EC, U.S. Agree To Boost Uruguay Round Results BR1301091594 Brussels EUROPE in English 93 12 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1301091594 Brussels EUROPE Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "USA and EU Have Common Desire To Build on Uruguay Round Agreement"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] [Text] Talks between the U.S. representative for trade matters, Mickey Kantor, and three European Commissioners highlighted the common desire of the EC and the United States to: (a) Reinforce and expand as much as possible the results of the Uruguay Round by the time of the signature of the agreements; (b) Go further in the organization and liberalization of international trade. After meeting Sir Leon Brittan, Mr. Kantor held talks with Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi. Below is an overview of the results of the three meetings. Sir Leon Brittan and Mickey Kantor discussed: - The procedures to be implemented by the two parties for the Geneva agreements to be signed by mid-April as scheduled. On the Community side, the European Parliament will be consulted (although it cannot, obviously, modify the content of the agreements); - The efforts to be made to improve the results achieved, especially with regard to market access. The European Commission and the U.S. Administration believe a meeting of the "quadrilateral" (EC/United States/Japan/Canada) appropriate before 15 February as well as contacts with certain Asian countries; - The situation in some specific sectors (maritime services, financial services); - The situation concerning public procurement. The GATT agreement covers the contracts concluded by the central authorities. The EC attaches great importance to further progress by the United States in liberalization at the level of the States of the Union; - The subsequent efforts to go beyond the results of the Uruguay Round. The World Trade Organization (WTO) will not only have to implement Uruguay Round agreements and manage the new system to settle differences and the mechanism for examining trade policies, but it should also develop new working programs on trade/environment and trade/competition problems. The EC and the United States are in agreement about the importance and urgency of these developments. Mr. Kantor also discussed the aspect of "working conditions and standards" which the EC is examining. The two interlocutors also brought up the subject of aluminium. A third multilateral meeting (after those in Moscow and Washington) between the main producer countries and main importers will take place next week in Brussels. Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor discussed: - Telecommunications. Mr. Kantor confirmed that the central government was pressuring the states of the Union to free access to their public contracts. As for standardization, a few problems exist on copyright and European standards; Mr. Bangemann will go into more depth on these matters with his American interlocutors when he visits the United States in spring; - Shipbuilding. Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor agreed that the negotiations had to be concluded urgently in the framework of the OECD on aid and trade; - Aluminium. The multilateral approach is considered by far preferable to unilateral restrictions. That is why both the EC and the United States would like successful talks next week in Brussels between the main producers (including Russia) and importers. Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi and Mr. Kantor examined; - Financial services. The significance of the result of the Uruguay Round (involving the inclusion of financial services in the GATT rules, through the General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS) has perhaps not yet been understood by the business world; an effort to clarify this seems appropriate. The fact remains that the agreement must be completed and improved; - Public procurement. The Commissioner reaffirmed the importance that the EC attaches to the application by the United States of the commitments of the memorandum of understanding of May concerning the extension of liberalization to levels other than the level of central administration (federal).
