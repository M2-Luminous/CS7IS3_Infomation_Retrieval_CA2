So says a Russian Foreign Ministry statement circulated at UN headquarters in New York as a Security Council document. The first day of open debate on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrated the three fundamental approaches taken by the NATO member countries, Russia, and the Muslim countries. The NATO countries' stance has not changed, they still insist that the decision to carry out air strikes does not require additional approval from the Security Council. Evidently NATO will continue to disregard Russia's diametrically opposed stance by preparing to undertake the first ever military operation outside the bloc's zone of responsibility. The representatives of the Muslim leadership of Bosnia, and of Iran and Turkey, reflected the Muslim side's stance in their speeches. They insisted that NATO attack Serbian positions not only in Sarajevo but also in other parts of Bosnia. In all probability no one now knows how to coordinate the largely polarized notions of a Bosnian settlement without splitting the Security Council along cold war lines. A great deal will depend on the actions taken by the conflicting sides in Sarajevo over the next few days. Russia's proposal to immediately convene the Security Council to examine practical ways of demilitarizing Sarajevo and introducing a UN administration there could, evidently, be a compromise solution. That allows the NATO countries and Russia "to stick with their friends," so to speak, while resolving what is the main task at this stage -- the demilitarization of the Bosnian capital. Russia did incidentally submit this initiative long before the present deterioration in the situation in Bosnia and, had it been accepted by its Western partners in a timely fashion, it might have been possible to avoid the bloody drama in Sarajevo's market that spurred NATO to decide on bombing raids. Real moves to transfer Sarajevo to UN control could remove the threat of air strikes. Nonetheless the way to secure a lasting peace in Bosnia lies in the formulation by the main interested parties -- the United States, the EU, and Russia -- of a unified concept of a political solution to the conflict. This was stated at the Russian State Duma hearings Tuesday. Indeed, if these sides want to keep Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unified state and member of the United Nations they should first remember that after World War II this republic was a state with three peoples -- Serbs, Croats, and Muslims -- where all vital decisions were adopted by consensus alone. Consequently, it is inadmissible at any stage in the settlement process to take anyone's side in the conflict, which may result in the escalation of the conflict. At the moment the Muslim side alone benefits from the bombing threats. The proposal made by the United States and most Islamic states that the embargo on arms shipments to Bosnia be lifted is also untenable since this means shipments of arms to the Bosnian Muslims alone. The latest news from Sarajevo is depressing. Serbian forces have stopped handing over heavy arms to the "blue helmets" and are demanding UN monitoring of the numerically superior Muslim infantry. In its turn, the Muslim leadership is not showing willingness to do this.
