At a news conference in parliament, Abdullah Gul said that the weapons of the former Yugoslavia are now in the hands of Serbs and that many countries are openly giving arms to the Serbs. The Bosnians are still under an arms embargo, he said, and are left defenseless before the Serbs. Gul stressed that Turkey must urgently violate the embargo and withdraw the Turkish ship serving with the United Nations in the Adriatic Sea. Turkey is the first country that must help Bosnia, he said, and within this framework, the defense weapons requested by the Bosnians must be sent there without delay.
