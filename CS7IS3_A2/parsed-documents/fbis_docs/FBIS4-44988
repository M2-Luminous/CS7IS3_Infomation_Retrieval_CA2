FBIS4-44988 "jpnea030___94044" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 3 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Details of ASLV Modifications Reported Details of ASLV Modifications Reported 94AS0286A Madras THE HINDU in English 3 May 94 p 1 94AS0286A Madras THE HINDU English CSO [Text] Madras, May 2. The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle [ASLV]-D4 to be launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on May 4 incorporates significant modifications for the rocket to achieve a minimum perigee of 400 km altitude, and ensure a one-year life for the satellite that will be placed in orbit. The launch window for the ASLV, whose last developmental flight was a success in 1992, has been set for 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Modifications have been carried out in the ASLV-D4 in three areas compared to previous flight missions. Refinements have been done for the four spin rockets to provide the required impulse. In the ASLV-D3, only two of the four rockets could give the required impulse resulting in fewer revolutions per minute. The computers and software have been updated, and adequate safety margins provided to handle the shock imparted to the ongoing stage by the separated stage of the rocket. The ASLV-D4 has five stages using solid fuel, including two strap-on motors that propel the 23.8 metre high rocket with a lift off weight of 41.7 tonnes. The SROSS-C2 [Stretched Rohini Satellite Series] satellite payload weighing 113 kg to be put in the 400 km elliptical orbit has two scientific experiments -- Gamma Ray Burst Detector and Retarding Potential Analyser. The satellite weighs about 7 kg more than the last one. Briefing visiting presspersons at Sriharikota today, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman, Dr. K. Kasturirangan, said the 47 hour countdown for the launch was progressing satisfactorily. The scientific experiments were being repeated in the current satellite from the last time as the previous satellite had less than estimated life and did not provide the required quantum of data. The previous flight -- ASLV-D3 -- as against the expected orbit of 400 km achieved only 264 km. The modifications in the vehicle this time have been brought in to overcome this. Dr. Kasturirangan said the primary objective of the mission was to evaluate a number of technologies from the previous flights, including the strap-on motors, their separation dynamics, closed-loop guidance system, bulbous heat shield and flexible dynamics. Mr. V. Manoharan, Project and Mission Director, ASLV, explained the modifications carried out in the latest developmental flight. Member, Space Commission New Delhi, May 2. Dr. Arjun Sengupta, Member-Secretary, Planning Commission, has been appointed a member of the high-power Space Commission, an official release today said. -- UNI
