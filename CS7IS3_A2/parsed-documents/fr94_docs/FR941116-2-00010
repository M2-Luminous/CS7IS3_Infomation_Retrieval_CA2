FR941116-2-00010 FR941116-2-00003 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1995 Census Test &hyph; Update/Leave Operation. Form Number(s): DG&hyph;105A, B, C, D. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 1,278 hours. Number of Respondents: 51,100. Avg Hours Per Response: 1.5 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Census Bureau will use two methods to collect population and housing data in the 1995 Census Test: mail&hyph;out/mai&hyph;back in the two urban sites (Oakland, CA, and Patterson, NJ) and update/leave in the rural site which is made up six parishes in Northwest Louisiana. An address list will be compiled for the rural site in November 1994 during a prelist operation. During update/leave, census enumerators will canvass the site to update that address list and Census' TIGER database of geographic features, and leave a census test questionnaire at each housing unit for the residents to fill out and return. Enumerators' only contact with residents will be to verify name and address information and to hand them the questionnaire. Utilizing update/leave procedures allows Census to improve its address list and housing coverage in rural areas. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230.

Dated: November 9, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
