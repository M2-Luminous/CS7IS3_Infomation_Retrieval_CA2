FR940504-0-00057 FR940504-0-00014 Classification This notification of annual management measures and technical amendment are exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Section 661.23 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations states that the Secretary will publish a notice establishing management measures for ocean salmon each year and will invite public comments prior to their effective date. If the Secretary determines, for good cause, that a notice must be issued without affording prior opportunity for public comment, the measures will become effective, however, comments on the notice will be received by the Secretary for a period of 15 days after the filing of the notice with the Federal Register . Because many ocean salmon seasons are scheduled to start May 1, the management measures must be in effect by this date. Each year the schedule for establishing the annual management measures begins in February with the compilation and analysis of biological and socioeconomic data for the previous year's fishery and salmon stock abundance estimates for the current year. Two meetings of the Council follow in March and April which incorporate a public review period. In 1994, the Council recommended management measures at the conclusion of its meeting on April 8, resulting in a short time frame for implementation. In addition, delay in the start of the fishing season would deny ocean fishermen access to harvestable salmon stocks which, if taken later in the year, would produce unacceptable impacts on other salmon stocks, such as those listed under the ESA. Due to the migratory patterns of the various salmon stocks, harvest regimes account for the timing and location of harvestable stocks in concert with the stocks of concern. Therefore, in light of the limited available time and the adverse effect of delay, the Secretary has determined that good cause exists to waive prior notice and comment on the management measures. Although this document will be effective without prior opportunity for comment, the public had opportunity to comment on these management measures during the process of their development. The public participated in the March and April Council, STT, and Salmon Advisory Subpanel meetings, and in public hearings held in Washington, Oregon, and California in late March that generated the management actions recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary. Written public comments were invited by the Council between the March and April Council meetings. The technical amendment provisions of this regulatory action make only minor, non-substantive changes and do not change operating practices in the fishery. Accordingly, it is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to provide for prior public comment, and there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) not to delay the effective date of the technical amendment for 30 days. Comments will be accepted for 15 days after the effective date of this notice. On March 31, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the FMP on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The opinion concluded that implementation of the plan is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. The 1994 season falls within the scope of the 1991 opinion, and the seasons and management measures comply with the recommendations and incidental take conditions contained in the biological opinion. Therefore, it was not necessary to reinitiate consultation on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS has issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the 1994 salmon management measures on wild sockeye salmon, wild spring/summer chinook salmon, and wild fall chinook salmon from the Snake River, which concluded the fishery in 1994 under the FMP is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed stocks.
