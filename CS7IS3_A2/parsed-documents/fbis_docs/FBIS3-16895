ROSSIISKIYE VESTI quotes Chernomyrdin as saying about the results of the talks with Mr Hata that "Russia, when tackling a solution to the territorial dispute with Japan, will act without haste. The issue cannot be resolved at a sweep". The newspaper points out that the Russian premier expressed hope that the issue would be resolved. "We shall approach the conclusion of a peace treaty between our two countries in any case. A solution to the territorial problem is one of prerequisites for such a treaty". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA remarks in this connection that "it is, probably, the Russian side that to a greater extent remains pleased with the results of the talks held in Moscow by Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Although the meeting with Russian premier gave certain satisfaction to the Japanese minister: This time the Russian premier did not make tough remarks, as he did at the end of last year, about it being impossible to hand over the Kuril Islands under any circumstances". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on elections to local power bodies: "Last Sunday's elections to the local representative power bodies in the regions of the Russian Federation revealed, on the whole, the electorate's indifference and passivity. Irrespective of the final election results, this conclusion could be drawn immediately after the polls closed." TRUD on local election results: "Such outcome of the elections in a number of Russian regions can hardly satisfy the federal authorities either. For a low turnout of voters is indicative of the Russians' low trust in power in general. And this is understandable. Over the past several years, there were so many well wishers who promised people a lot. Meanwhile, the life of the majority of ordinary citizens has not changed for the better". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on local election results: "People, having got disillusioned with the abilities of `the people's elected representatives' to change if only anything in their life, were not in a hurry to go to the polls. "Experts explain the passiveness of the population by a number of other reasons as well. Not of least importance in this respect is the excessively protracted nature of the election campaign, and Moscow's insufficient interest in the electoral process at the local level". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of defence, under the headline " The Second Phase of the Reform: What Awaits the Army". The newspaper points out that the first phase of the reforming of the Russian Army and Navy is over. Main organising measures to create the armed forces of Russia proper have been carried out. In response to a question what awaits the armed forces in the future, the deputy defence minister said: "The armed forces will become, firstly, a relatively small but powerful and modile army provided with the most effective systems of weapons and military hardware and capable of defending Russia from encroachments from the outside and be the guarantor of peace and stability in the country. "Secondly, this will be an army of a democratic state, which has fundamentally different relationships with society and the state and enjoying respect and prestige among the people. "Thirdly, this will be an important instrument of national policy, maintaining all the best from the traditions of its predecessors, everything that was connected with the accomplishment of exclusively defensive tasks. "These three positions in point of fact reflect the principal meaning of the current process of the Russian Armed Forces reform", General Kondratyev said.
