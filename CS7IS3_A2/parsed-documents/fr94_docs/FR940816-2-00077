FR940816-2-00077 FR940816-2-00059 EDI is intended to complement and enhance the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (see 24 CFR §§570.700&hyph;710 for regulations governing the Section 108 program). This provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, and large scale physical development projects. HUD is authorized pursuant to Section 108 to guarantee notes issued by CDBG entitlement communities and nonentitlement units of general local government eligible to receive funds under the State CDBG program. Regulations governing the Section 108 program are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. Additionally, assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). Section 3 requires that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated from certain HUD financial assistance be directed to low- and very-low income persons. The eligible activities for which funding is provided under this NOFA are consistent with the objectives of section 3. Public entities awarded funds under this NOFA and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction should consult the regulations published on June 30, 1994, to determine applicable requirements. The Section 108 program is authorized at $2.054 billion in loan guarantee authority in Fiscal Year 1994. Under this program communities and (States, if applicable) pledge future years' CDBG allocations as security for loans guaranteed by HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under Section 108. The Section 108 program, however, does not require CDBG funds to be escrowed for loan repayment, which means that the community can continue to spend its existing allocation for other CDBG purposes, unless needed for loan repayment. Further, EDI minimizes the potential loss of future CDBG allocations by lowering the cost of borrowing under Section 108, reducing the risk that the pledged annual CDBG allocation would be required to fund repayment shortfall, and enhancing the ability of communities to leverage federal resources and private funds. An EDI grant can reduce the risk to future CDBG funds: (1) By strengthening the economic feasibility of the projects financed with Section 108 funds (and thereby increasing the probability that the project will generate enough cash to repay the guaranteed loan), (2) By directly enhancing the security of the guaranteed loan, or (3) Through a combination of these risk mitigation techniques. HUD envisions that the following project structures could be typical. Provision of financing to for-profit businesses at a below market rate _While the rates on loans guaranteed under Section 108 are only slightly above the rates on comparable U.S. Treasury obligations, they may nonetheless be higher than can be afforded by many businesses. The EDI grant can be used to make Section 108 financing affordable, as illustrated in the following example: A public entity wishes to make financing available for businesses located in a distressed neighborhood. The public entity applies for Section 108/EDI assistance to carry out a $5.75 million economic development (ED) program. The ED loans will be funded from a financing package that includes a $5,000,000 Section 108 loan and a $750,000 EDI grant. If the rate on the Section 108 loan is 7.25 percent and the term is 15 years, the rate on the ED loans can be reduced to 5.1 percent (a level which is approximately 30% lower than the Section 108 rate). Thus, the EDI grant serves to ``buy down'' the interest rate on the ED loans, thus reducing the income the business needs to generate to provide program income to the public entity to repay the Section 108 loan. (Note that the extent to which rates on ED loans can be reduced depends on the maturity of the Section 108 loan and the amount of the EDI grant.) Direct enhancement of the security of the Section 108 loan _The EDI grant can be used to cover the cost of providing enhanced security. An example of how the EDI grant can be used for this purpose is by using the grant funds to cover the cost of a standby letter of credit, issued in favor of HUD. This letter of credit will be available to fund amounts due on the Section 108 loan if other sources fail to materialize and will, thus, serve to protect the public entity's future CDBG funds. Funding reserves _The cash flow generated by an economic development project may be expected to be relatively thin in the early stages of the project. The EDI grant can make it possible for debt service or operating reserves to be established in a way that does not jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project. An example is a supermarket or neighborhood shopping area that is designed to provide basic services to and jobs in a distressed neighborhood. The public entity must be prepared for a period after completion during which space in that shopping center is not fully leased. It may therefore require the developer to establish with a trustee a reserve account (or accounts) that would be available to cover operating expenses and/or debt service during the lease-up period. While such reserves are commonplace, their cost may be so high as to make an already risky neighborhood shopping center project economically infeasible. The increased cost resulting from establishing such reserves may be defrayed by the EDI grant. As with the letter of credit example above, the reserves protect the CDBG program against the risk that CDBG funds will have to be used to cover shortfalls in the intended source for repayment of the Section 108 loan. Over-collateralizing the Section 108 loan _The use of EDI grant funds may be structured in appropriate cases so as to improve the chances that cash flow will be sufficient to cover debt service on the Section 108 loan and directly enhance the guaranteed loan. One technique for accomplishing this approach is over-collateralization of the Section 108 loan. An example is the project which involves the joint use of a Section 108 loan and EDI grant to fund a loan pool project. For instance, a community might borrow $5 million under Section 108 and obtain an EDI grant of $500,000. It can then make $5.5 million in loans to various businesses at a rate equal to or greater than the rate on the Section 108 loan. The total loan pool of $5.5 million would be pledged to the repayment of the $5 million Section 108 loan. Since the program income from the $5.5 million will be greater than the debt service on the Section 108 loan, the community can accumulate a loss reserve that will further mitigate the risk to future CDBG funds. This kind of loan pool project has the added benefit of reducing the risk to future CDBG funds through diversification of the community's loan portfolio.
