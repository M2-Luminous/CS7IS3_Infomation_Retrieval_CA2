A consultative meeting of the delegates of the DPRK Government, political parties, and public organizations was held in Pyongyang on 25 May to discuss various matters connected with the convocation of the national meeting. Participating in the consultative meeting were the delegates of the DPRK Central People's Committee, State Administration Council, political parties, and public organizations. The consultative meeting discussed various measures to be taken at the present which include the matter of sending to the South Korean authorities a telephone message urging them to respond to our proposal for convening a national meeting and for forming a national meeting preparatory committee and the matter of electing the North side's delegates to the national meeting. The consultative meeting pointed out first that the 10-point program for great unity of the whole nation clarified by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is enjoying great support and sympathy among the people at home and abroad with each passing day and that the proposal for convening a national meeting for its realization has been evoking deep interests among the people in the North and the South and overseas compatriots. The consultative meeting expressed deep regret over the fact that the South Korean authorities did not accept our side's letter related to convening a national meeting, which was proposed proceeding from the desire to open the road for peace and peaceful reunification with the nation's united strength, amid the circumstances under which North-South confrontation is being intensified and the danger of a nuclear war is growing on the Korean peninsula and that, furthermore, they went so far as to intercept and block en route the letter sent to individual addressees by international mail. The consultative meeting has decided to urge the South Korean authorities to accept the proposal to convene a national meeting as soon as possible, taking note of the positive position expressed on 15 April by the preparatory committee to form the South side's headquarters of Pomminnyon regarding the holding of the national meeting. For this end, it has enabled the CPRF secretariat to immediately send a telephone message which urges South Korea to accept the proposal and to elect the delegates of the South side's preparatory committee for the national meeting to the South Korean National Unfication Board. Based on the reaffirmation of the need to elect the delegates of the preparatory committee, the consultative meeting first elected the delegates of the North side's preparatory committee and those are as follows: Chong Mun-san, secretary of Secretariat of the Administration Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice chairman of Korea Social Democratic Party Central Committee; Paek Nam-chun, secretary of the CPRF Secretariat; Kim Yong-nam, vice chairman of General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea; and Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Korean Christian Federation Central Committee and vice chairman of the Korean Religious Council. Participants in the consultative meeting have expressed their firm resolution to open a new significant phase to secure peace in the country, as well as to achieve peaceful reunification based on the great unity of the whole nation, thus surely holding the national meeting on the occasion of 15 August of this year, a year ahead of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the fatherland. Also, they expressed the expectation that the South Korean authorities immediately respond to the proposal to convene the national meeting, and that the South side elect the delegates to participate in the national meeting at the earliest date.
