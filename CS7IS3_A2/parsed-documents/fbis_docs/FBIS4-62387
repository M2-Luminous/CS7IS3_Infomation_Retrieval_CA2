Several shells and missiles hit the city of Bolshoy Kamen, many kilometres from Novonezhino. This was announced on Monday at a press conference for Russian and foreign journalists by the head of administration of the Maritime Territory Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. He also said that units of field engineers are being brought to the Maritime Territory from Russia's entire Pacific rim to clean up the effects of the accident. They are expected to thoroughly inspect the entire affected territory, locate and eliminate any unexploded ammunition. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said the bombs, missiles and shells which have remained intact in the storage facilities will be exploded, and the facility will never be restored in the same place, particularly since the local inhabitants had expressed their disagreement with its location for some time past.
