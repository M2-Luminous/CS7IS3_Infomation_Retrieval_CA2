The Armed Forces issued a communique in which they warn that alien interests seek to discredit the high command and to create an appropriate climate to eliminate the institution. They assert that this will not be allowed to happen. Information disclosed yesterday states that military and executive branch authorities, in complete secrecy, discussed the alleged plan to "drastically reduce" the number of troops and that this initiative is allegedly supported by the U.S. Embassy. The alleged plan would have the financial support of the U.S. Government and would allegedly seek to convince officers and soldiers to accept a "voluntary retirement" through the payment of illegal bonuses, like the procedure used to "relocate" thousands of workers. The Armed Forces command, after regretting the spreading of distorted information, states: "The military career is based on a strong professional desire to serve the nation, a task which is fulfilled with dignity, based on honor and respect, whose strength even contemplates sacrifice if circumstances so demand." The communique adds: "In our capacity as the main protagonists for the creation of the fatherland, our fate is linked to that of the nation and no misinterpretation or political plot will threaten our existence because the Armed Forces' noble mission cannot be modified or distorted." The Armed Forces communique continues: "Despite this concealed provocation, which has the evil purpose of discrediting the high command by accusing it of being aware of such an ignoble plan, we clearly state that we will loyally fulfill our commitment to preserve dignity and institutional integrity." Admiral Julio Molina, the Bolivian Navy commander, minimized the press report, stating: "I don't know anything about a plan of this sort, moreover, that information is not explicit because it does not mention a source." Molina added: "This sort of information must be investigated and documented by the media because if not it will cause unrest in any involved institution." Other military high command sources stated: "The information is completely false and designed to cause problems for the government. It creates false expectations among officers and sergeants due to the irresponsible mention of alleged economic compensations. The military high command never discussed or talked about such a proposal." More than two years ago the Armed Forces command ordered the compulsory retirement of some 600 civilians, which is the most recent rationalization of the military institution's personnel which, at that time, was interpreted as the beginning of a gradual process to establish "a smaller but more efficient and operative Armed Forces." At that time the military authorities rejected rumors and justified the measure by pointing out "it was just an administrative measure that by no means represented the beginning of a process to purge military personnel." FIDES NEWS AGENCY states that the U.S. Embassy has said that "the decision to determine the size of the Armed Forces belongs to Bolivia," and denied exerting any pressure to reduce the number of troops. U.S. Embassy officials have stated: "The United States does not have any financial plans regarding an alleged reduction by paying Bolivian officials to retire." The diplomatic authorities recalled that Barry McCaffrey, commander of the South Command headquartered in Panama, paid a protocol visit in March. When consulted about the reduction of the Armed Forces in Latin America, he answered: "I cannot imagine anything more unlikely. High-ranking U.S. leaders are aware that security in Latin America relies greatly on having Armed Forces that are strong, disciplined, subordinated to the civilian power, and that act within the framework of the law."
