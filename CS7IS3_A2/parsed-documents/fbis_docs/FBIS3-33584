However, because there is no asylum treaty between Spain and Paraguay, Friedmann was unable to achieve his goal. Nevertheless, Spanish Ambassador Asuncion Anzorena put Friedmann into contact with Interior Minister Carlos Podesta, who offered him the necessary guarantees and placed a police guard at his disposal. Friedmann also made serious charges against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Senator Juan Carlos Galaverna. Former Guaira Governor Rodolfo Friedmann yesterday reported that during the evening of 21 February three armed individuals who got out of a Santana at the corner of Republica Argentina and Espana Avenues made death threats against him, his wife, and his children. Friedmann added that he was warned that if he did not withdraw all charges made against the president in view of the decree accepting his resignation, his wife and children would suffer the consequences. In view of this incident, Friedmann tried to seek asylum at the Spanish Embassy to protect himself. He added that because there is no asylum treaty between Spain and Paraguay, the Spanish ambassador put him in contact with Interior Minister Carlos Podesta. According to Friedmann, Podesta offered him the necessary guarantees. This was evidenced yesterday afternoon, when Friedmann received police custody. Friedmann added that after having held a telephone conversation with the Spanish ambassador he again received death threats, warning him that the action was to be perpetrated yesterday.
