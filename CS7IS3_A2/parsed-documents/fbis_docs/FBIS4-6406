The World Trade Organization (WTO) will be formed next January at the earliest as a new multilateral trade framework in place of the 46-year-old GATT. The WTO was adopted Friday [15 April] by more than 120 GATT countries during their Marrakech ministerial conference. When dispute settlement efforts between two countries go out of control, the WTO will step in, seeking a solution basically on the basis of consensus, the same dispute settlement mechanism as employed under GATT. But procedures used by the WTO provide stronger and clearer rules for a wide range of trade areas that will newly include services and intellectual property rights in line with the just-signed final accord of the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade talks. The biggest difference with the system under GATT is that the WTO rules will be enforced by a judicial mechanism that will no longer allow countries to block findings against them. Under the so-called "negative consensus system," findings prepared by a dispute settlement panel will be automatically formalized unless there is a unanimous consensus to reject them, meaning that only a single vote in favor of a finding is needed for the WTO to adopt it. The new mechanism is designed to answer increasing frustrations by trading countries about the GATT system in which one member can deny a panel recommendation. Under the new system, countries which fail to comply with panel recommendations will face trade sanctions under strict time limits. The new trade framework's strong spirit against global protectionism is well reflected in part of the Marrakech Declaration that confirmed a "determination to resist protectionist pressures of all kinds." The United States has officially supported the new dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO, with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently saying, "the new system... will work and it will work fast." But countries like Japan, which has often come under the threat of trade sanctions, want the mechanism to work as a deterrent against Washington's inclination to resort to unilateral and retaliatory trade measures such as the recently reinstated "Super 301" trade clause. Ministers from Malaysia, India, Thailand and other countries joined Japan's stance in ministerial speeches made during the four- day Marrakech conference that began Tuesday. Ministers from the countries blasted a growing unilateral approach among superpowers as a tool to settle trade rows, describing the stance as destabilizing the world trade order. A barrage of such criticism was made in an apparent reference to Washington, which has appeared to be threatening to use retaliatory weapons in its intellectual property trade with Asian countries. Although supporting the overall mechanism under the WTO, Kantor said action under Washington's domestic trade provisions such as Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act would not be affected by the WTO rules.
