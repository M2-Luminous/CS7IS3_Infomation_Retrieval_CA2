Under the ministry's pedagogical and organizational instructions and teaching curriculums, an extra one to two hours of Slovak language and conversation [per week] are to be added in schools with a non-Slovak language of instruction. Moreover, preference is to be given to the division of classes during Slovak language lessons. Lubomir Harach, minister of education and science, informed us that the ministry has released from its budget a reserve of 100 million korunas to secure education [in the Slovak language] in the ethnically mixed territories.
