ACTION: Final rule; petitions for reconsideration. SUMMARY: In this Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order the Commission resolves petitions for reconsideration or clarification of its competitive bidding rules for the entrepreneurs' blocks, including provisions established to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed ``designated entities'') have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (called ``broadband PCS''). Among the issues the Commission re-examines in this Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order are matters concerning: the financial caps for entry into the entrepreneurs' block and qualification as a small business; the equity requirements for the control group and other eligibility criteria; joint venture and consortia rules; guidelines for defining de facto control of an applicant; permissible management agreements between noncontrolling investors and entrepreneurs' block applicants; treatment of affiliated entities and ownership attribution rules; and installment payments and bidding credits. The rules and decisions made in this Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order are designed to result in auctions that will serve the public interest by ensuring that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women have the opportunity to attract the necessary investment capital to compete for and obtain broadband PCS licenses and ultimately to have meaningful involvement in building and managing this nation's broadband PCS infrastructure. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 6, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen O'Brien Ham at (202) 634&hyph;2443 or Peter Tenhula at (202) 418&hyph;1720.

Paperwork Reduction Act In the Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, the Commission has amended 47 CFR Part 24 which contains rules and requirements governing the award of broadband PCS licenses through a system of competitive bidding. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the Commission can determine whether the applicants are legally, technically, and financially qualified to be bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks as entrepreneurs and/or designated entities. Affected members of the public are any members of the public who want to become a broadband PCS licensee in the frequency blocks allocated for entrepreneurs and designated entities. Implementation of the rules contained in the Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order will impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on certain members of the public. The Federal Communications Commission will submit an information collection request to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507. Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 3225, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561.

By this action, we resolve petitions for reconsideration or clarification of our rules governing competitive bidding for ``entrepreneurs' block'' licenses in the 2 GHz band Personal Communications Service (``broadband PCS''). 1 Twenty-six petitions were received, as well as 17 oppositions and 8 replies. Specifically, in this Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order, we resolve issues associated with our entrepreneurs' block rules, as well as other provisions we established to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed ``designated entities'') have meaningful opportunities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS. Our goal in this proceeding is to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to obtain licenses at auction as well as the opportunity to have meaningful involvement in the management and building of our nation's broadband PCS infrastructure. Thus, as we describe below, we make certain modifications to our rules so that they will better serve these goals. 1 The Commission designated frequency blocks C (1895&hyph;1910/1975&hyph;1990 MHz) and F (1890&hyph;1895/1970&hyph;1975 MHz) as ``entrepreneurs' blocks''. See Fifth Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;178 (released July 15, 1994), reprinted at 59 Fed. Reg. 37,566 (July 22, 1994) ( Fifth Report and Order ). We also address herein petitions for reconsideration or clarification filed in response to the Commission's Order on Reconsideration , FCC 94&hyph;217 (released August 15, 1994), summarized , 59 Fed Reg. 43,062 (August 22, 1994). 2. When the new broadband PCS auction rules were adopted in the Fifth Report and Order, the Commission declared its intent to meet fully the statutory objective set forth by Congress in Section 309(j) of the Communications Act. See 47 U.S.C. 309(j). In particular, we observed that it was the mandate of Congress that the Commission should ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.'' See 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(D). We also noted that Congress has directed us to ``promote economic opportunity and competition and ensure that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants.'' See 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). With these congressional directives in mind, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks and designated entity provisions contained in the Fifth Report and Order , which are now under reconsideration.
