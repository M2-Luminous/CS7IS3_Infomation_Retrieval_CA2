FBIS4-11780 "drnes063_k_94009" FBIS-NES-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 IRAQ Columnists on `Development' in UN Blockade Stance Columnists on `Development' in UN Blockade Stance JN0104070394 JN0104070394 BFN [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 23, 24, 25, and 27 March 1994, and Baghdad BABIL in Arabic on 26 March 1994 publish articles by Iraqi columnists on the latest UN Security Council debate over the Iraqi blockade. All articles note a "development" in the UN Security Council stance, saying now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, Security Council members should honor their resolutions "despite any endeavor by the United States to continue the blockade." However, while most articles hail "the new UN stand" as a development "in Iraq's favor" and predict "great victory" soon, one columnist, while acknowledging this development, thinks Iraqis have been too euphoric, and warns local papers against playing up the "split," saying "our papers have been carried away by this game of nations." Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 23 March carries in its "Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah entitled: "The Security Council Must Honor Its Resolutions!" The article says Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz's intensive deliberations and contacts with UN members have led to "further international understanding of and clear sympathy with Iraq's rights and legitimate demands." Referring to the "Iraqi message of facts" which 'Aziz submitted to the Security Council, the article says: "Facing the Security Council with the facts and asking it to stand by its decision had fully exposed the situation so that it was no longer acceptable for anyone to remain silent." "The message," the article adds: "was echoed by several permanent member states, which acknowledged Iraq's positive steps toward and tangible cooperation with the UN resolutions." The article concludes: "Thus, the new change occurred as a result of Iraq's steadfastness and firm struggle as well as its people's courage and patience in adversity. The coming days portend the harvest of a great victory over the tyrant and the collapse of the unfair blockade." The paper also publishes in its "Attention" column on page three a 300-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "The Blockade and the Requirement." Al-Kashif says due to "absolute U.S. and British hostility to Iraq" those Security Council members "who acknowledged Iraq's commitment and cooperation with the United Nations are alone qualified to represent international will." He adds: "Washington has chosen to be the enemy of Iraq and this is its own affair. But, if it wants to express its dirty options, it should do so outside international legitimacy. At any rate, This is not something new to the United States, which is blockading Cuba due to an American decision with which no one agrees. Therefore, it can, if it wants, remain captive to its failure before Iraq's willpower. But it has no right to ask the international community to adopt a stand which is not based on legitimacy or law. It cannot justify the murder of Iraqi people through hunger and disease." Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 24 March publishes in its "Standpoint" column on page two a 700-word article by 'Adil Sa'd entitled "The International Change and the Internal Requirement," saying: Two factors were behind "the creation of a significant majority in the Security Council calling for a new approach" Iraq's cooperation with the UN resolutions and its citizens' "great patience and ability to adjust to hardships." Sa'd calls upon the government, headed by the Prime Ministry, to make up for the citizens' endurance internally by improving public services and being "very tough with the renegade parasites and horders who speculate on people's livelihood." Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 27 March carries in its "Standpoint" column a 500-word article by 'Isa Ismail al-'Abbadi entitled: "The Blockade In a Bottleneck." Al-'Abbadi says contacts inside and outside UN lobbies between Iraq and world nations indicate that the blockade "is in a bottleneck and its continuation can no longer be justified by anyone," despite "contradictions" in recent statements by Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, "who, in one press interview, says he cannot now say that he is completely satisfied with what he has achieved in Iraq concerning the implementation of what was requested by the Security Council, and in another press interview says that he is 'completely satisfied' with what he achieved in Iraq in this regard, but also adding that he cannot now recommend lifting the blockade on Iraq." Al-'Abbadi concludes by saying that in view of these contradictions "It is essential for the Security Council to consider the facts as they stand without being influenced by the biased political influences of the United States." Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 26 March 1994 publishes on page two an article by Mazhar 'Arif entitled: "The Security Council and the Game of Nations!" (filed as JN3003215794) in which he warns lraqi news media against playing up the "split" in the Security Council by raising citizens' hope about "an impending breakthrough," saying what took place was "a game of nations," and the outcome was "a gain for the United States, and not for Iraq." Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 25 March 1994 carries in its "AL-THAWRAH Diary" on page eight an article by Wadi' al-Muzaffar entitled: "A Pledge by Marsh Arabs." The item says since President Saddam Husayn's "historic speech" to the Iraqi cabinet on Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz' mission to the UN Security Council to lift the blockade, Ba'th Party offices in the , al-Basrah Governorate witnessed continuous tribal rallies in support of the president. The item says tribal chiefs and citizens "armed to the teeth" poured into those offices "demanding to volunteer as fighters against evil aggressors." The item reports on one particular rally in a tribal camp in the marshlands, where an 80-year old tribal chief addressing his sons and grandsons says: "The mean, treacherous act of the Americans and Zionists in blockading Iraq and depriving our people of food and medicine, and their flying of their crows in our airspace on the pretext of protecting us have driven me crazy." He pledges: "We stand behind the leader Saddam Husayn with all we possess: soul, spirit, and the tribe."
