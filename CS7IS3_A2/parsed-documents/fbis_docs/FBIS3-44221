The devaluation of the CFA franc has already been the subject matter of a communication by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou. Yesterday, the minister of national education reported on the situation in the country's schools and colleges sector. This session is currently in progress, and we have Mohamed Ali on the spot reporting from the National Assembly. It seems the parliamentarians debated among others an item on discriminatory practices in various government departments. Here is Mohamed Ali.

The calm was broken both inside and outside parliament. Indeed, two incidents which have as common denominator the criticism of policies of the Government of the Third Republic, occurred. First, outside parliament, university and other students arrived in small groups early this morning for a so-called peaceful demonstration to remind the parliamentarians that in spite of the national education minister's reassuring utterances yesterday, their financial problem remains unresolved. They hung on the main gate of the closed parliament house using loudspeakers to spit out insults at the government and the National Assembly, and thereby preventing parliamentarians from resuming business at the scheduled time -- that is at 0900.

This morning's demonstrators later embarked on a march which took them to the office of the prime minister. Security men had taken position at several road junctions and around the prime minister's office but they did not intervene. Furthermore, the demonstrators issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the government to release the USN secretary general. [passage omitted]
