The Australian treasurer, Ralph Willis, says he raised the matter during a meeting in Honolulu with the American treasury secretary, Mr. Lloyd Bentsen. He said he received an assurance that the legislation would definitely be passed by July next year. The two men were in Honolulu for the inaugural meeting of finance ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Mr. Willis also said that during the meeting some countries made it clear they were not going to be pushed into too rapid liberalization of their capital markets. [Begin Willis recording] The Malaysians, for instance, have made it clear that they believe they had already opened their capital markets considerably and that they were concerned that if they simply abandoned all control in the banking industry, for instance, they could (?simply) be (?flooded) by foreign capital. So, there is no arguing about the direction of change; it was rather concerns being expressed by some of the developing countries about the points at which they could cope with the current liberalization of their economy.
