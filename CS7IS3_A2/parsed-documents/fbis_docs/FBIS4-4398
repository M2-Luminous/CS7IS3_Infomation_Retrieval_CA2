Hosokawa was speaking at a meeting of the House of Councillors budget committee. Answering questions from Tatsuo Shimizu of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa denied suggestions that he had not repaid 100 million yen he received in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group and that the money was not a loan but a secret political donation. Hosokawa said he has collected as much evidence as he could and submitted it to the Diet. The documents he has submitted were enough to prove "the fact that I borrowed 100 million yen and repaid it," he said. The premier has said he has lost the receipt for the loan repayment, and had the Sagawa Kyubin group submit related documents, including a photocopy of the receipt, to the Diet last December. Shimizu suggested the submitted documents are fakes. Hosokawa said the fact that he had offered his vacation house in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, as collateral and later had the company return the collateral shows that he repaid the loan. Shimizu, however, said collateral can be canceled upon an agreement between the lender and the borrower, thus a cancellation does not necessarily mean Hosokawa repaid the money. The prime minister also denied allegations that he personally had a hand in the 1986 purchase of 300 shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). "Even supposing it was my deal, what's wrong with that?" the premier retorted, prompting uproar and a temporary halt in the Diet deliberations, which were held ostensibly to debate the fiscal 1994 provisional budget program. Hosokawa has repeatedly told the Diet that the share transaction was conducted by his late father-in-law. Stock consultant Shuzo Fujiki said Wednesday the NTT deal was Hosokawa's. The premier told the House of Representatives budget committee on Wednesday that he has never met, nor sought advice from, Fujiki. Fujiki said he arranged a 418 million yen loan for a then aide of Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help finance the purchase of 300 NTT shares in 1986, just after NTT went public. According to Fujiki, the stock investment financing company agreed to allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at the request of Hosokawa's Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama. Shimizu asked the committee to summon Fujiki as a witness. He also reiterated demands to summon Miyama. Hosokawa repeated his objection to summoning Miyama, saying such testimony may violate the human rights of the former secretary's family. When Shimizu compared the Hosokawa allegations to the Whitewater scandal afflicting U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hosokawa responded by saying that the political systems of the two countries are different. Hosokawa commented that he is obliged to appear before the Diet, while the U.S. presidential system does not mandate comparable appearances by Clinton. During the lunch break of the committee deliberations, Hosokawa denied to reporters the truth of a statement by the head of the LDP chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture who said he received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Hosokawa's race for the prefectural governorship on the LDP ticket at the time. Hosokawa came to power last August, promising change in Japan's money-driven politics. But his political foes in the Diet have been relentless in their attempts to prove his alleged involvement in a series of money scandals involving NTT, Sagawa Kyubin and other businesses and parties. Hosokawa has rejected demands from the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party to produce more data pertaining to the Sagawa Kyubin affair and other related cases.
