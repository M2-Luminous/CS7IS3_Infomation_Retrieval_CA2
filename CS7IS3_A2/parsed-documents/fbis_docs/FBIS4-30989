Follows the letter: The General Council of Omonoia, the organisation representing the Greek minority in Albania, deems it necessary to thank you, personally, the Greek Government and whole Greek people, for the all round and constant support for the Hellenization of the long suffering North Epirus. On this occasion, Mr. Premier, let us decide and express some of our opinions on general problems preoccupying the Hellenization of North Epirus and on whose solution depends further development. Firstly: The present international conditions, I believe, allow the North Epirus problem, too, to appear on the international arena. We are confident that the government of the motherland will exploit all the existing possibilities to resolve this national question. Secondly, our organisation, since the first moment of its functioning, has assumed as its main objective the revival of the Hellenism living in Albania as well national, religious, spiritual, cultural, economic and social development, because in this way Hellenism is believed not only to stay in its own hearth but also to recover and flourish obviously. But, our zeal, toil, and efforts do not suffice to attain this significant objective. We also need the support and love of our motherland, a programmed political, economic, moral assistance as well as the Greek Government aid. Concretely: 1. It is necessary that Omonoia be gradually organised into a small undeclared government with the corresponding services based on the Greek ministries with employees, offices, and a budget, as the conditions prevailing in Albania enable it to exercise the policy and carry out the duty of governing in the North Epirus land. In case this objective is realised, we gradually create predispositions for the autonomy of the region, make it evident and develop as an internal national political, cultural, economic and running force at home. In order to move ahead in this direction, we necessitate experience and special advice as well as considerable amounts of money. 2. Coordination of efforts is necessary and every ministry of the Greek Government should designate counsellors competent for Albania's Hellenization, give orientations, supervise the correct application of the governmental policy and coordinate this government's accord. An equal extension for all the bodies with leading and executive powers is an indispensable demand for the Foreign Ministry. 3. It is the sole and insisting demand of this country and people to have a free communication with the homeland, it is a measure which was successful before the war and for the special value and conditions created it will have magnificent results for all the question of North Epirus because it: a. Will bring the people closer to the final solution through its national and psychological spirit: b. Will economically bring about a rapid improvement of the standard of living of the people and later their continuous staying in their homes: c. Will lead to non-abandonment of their homes by our people who have been forced to install their families in Greece because they will be given the possibility to legally bring their families back whenever they want and whenever it is needed: d. It will stop the phenomenon of refugees and reprisals among North Epirus people who are forced to pass illegally and secretly the border between the two countries and become refugees hunted on the streets and villages of Greece, or arrested by Greek relevant bodies. Tortured, humiliated, and hopeless they are forced to be back to Albania. 4. A necessary and primary condition for the salvation and survival of the Greek minority in Albania is the rapid development of this region through all sided investments and "a unique program of development of the economy of Epirus" until the other side, too, wins. You, Mr. Premier, have expressed this idea during your latest visit to the border point of Kakavije. Thus, fast investments, both private and state, and the valuation of fruitful economic sources and the labour force of the people of this region are necessary. We should also stress the importance that the spheres of agriculture, industry, communication, telecommunication, improvement of roads, construction of hospitals, education and culture have for the development of our country. For optimal conditions, these spheres demand fast and efficient involvement of the Greek state. 5. Another question to be considered with responsibility and seriousness, a question that should be solved by the Greek state, Greek universities, and scientific organizations is the opposition to the systematic anti-Greek propaganda which through a political, spiritual, and economic devotion has been spread throughout Albania and in the foreign world with the technical creation of the "Cam question" and the falsification of the history of Epirus. It is still necessary that the Greek mass media (television, radio and press) must give an oral reply to Albanian liars and falsifiers, pseudo-scientists and through a high responsibility they should address the Greek minority and North Epirus in general in their programs and news bulletins. 6. Finally there is a need of strengthening essentially the exarch of the Orthodox Church of Albania, the honoured Anastasios Janullatos, to be able to carry out his as difficult as precious job for our national interests. Assured of having your continuous support on our way, Mr. Premier, we thank you and again wish you good health and strength for the success of our most important and national work that you are leading.
