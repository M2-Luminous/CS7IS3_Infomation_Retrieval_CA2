They held in- depth discussions focusing on Tibet's reform, opening up, foreign trade, and education for this year; and maintain that Tibet must pay keen attention to the two major issues of development and stability, and must subordinate the work in all fields to the overall interests of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability [the 20-character principle], thereby actively and prudently pressing reform and opening up ahead in an all-round manner and creatively implementing the central authorities' guidelines. Minister Song Defu and Vice Minister Zhang Zhijian of personnel; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation; and Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education Commission; attended the discussions to hear deputies' opinions and answer their questions. NPC deputies Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional party committee; Raidi, Standing Committee member and deputy secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional people's congress Standing Committee; and Yang Chuangtang and Luosang Toinzhub, vice chairmen of the regional government, spoke at the discussions. They emphasized: Development and stability are two major issues for Tibet. To accomplish the various tasks of this year, we must correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability. Reform is the motive force for economic development; development is the foundation for stability; and stability is the prerequisite for reform and development. To correctly grasp and handle the relations among these three issues in the light of the overall situation is crucial for the success of this year's work. In spite of mounting difficulties on the road of establishing a socialist market economic system in Tibet, we must resolutely implement the 20-character principle to serve the interests of the overall situation. We must take the overall interests into account and, in line with the principle of "three conducive's," go all out to proceed everything from reality and to work hard and conscientiously to achieve concrete results. Currently we should further solve deep-rooted problems of ideology and understanding, especially such problems among leading cadres; and should correctly handle the relations among the maintenance of social stability, the acceleration of reform and opening up, and the pace of economic development. We should also correctly handle the relations between self-reliance and hard work on the one hand and support and assistance from the state and fraternal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions on the other; as well as the relations between economic and social benefits. We should get mobilized immediately and, based on the capability of each locality, department, or unit, work hard and conscientiously to continually scale new heights in Tibet's reform and opening up. The deputies concluded: In invigorating Tibet's economy, we should continue to promote agriculture and animal husbandry, and more importantly, break the region's self-confinement and open it to the outside world. Song Defu, Wu Yi, Liu Bin, and other officials answered questions raised by deputies on Tibet's institutional reform, foreign trade, and education. They said: The party Central Committee and the State Council have shown great concern for Tibet, and have stressed the need to support and assist the work in Tibet. Under the new circumstances of a socialist market economic structure and while continuing to implement the central authorities' preferential policies for Tibet, new preferential policies in keeping with the new situation have been studied and formulated. The central authorities have begun investigations of problems raised by deputies from Tibet. Efforts are being made to resolve most of the problems. The officials unanimously pledged to do everything possible to solve Tibet's problems. Meanwhile, they urged Tibet to seize the opportunity; further promote reform and opening up; and make ample flexible, and effective use of the central authorities' preferential policies for Tibet to push its economy to a new stage of development.
