His title will be National Criminal Police chief. Not quite as distinguished as SAPO [Security Police] chief, which has the rank of commissioner. But organizationally they will be on an equal footing, as Almblad will command a more independent National Criminal Police Corps. "I needed only two seconds to think it over when I was asked this morning. This is the most exciting job one can have if one is interested in operational police activity," Almblad said at Thursday's [14 April] news conference just after he was appointed by the government. Not Unexpected He said he was bowled over. However, his appointment was not unexpected. Since 1989 he has been the second in command at SAPO, in charge of counterespionage, and since Mats Borjesson's recent retirement he has led the entire organization. DAGENS NYHETER has been informed that Almblad stated that he would not remain at SAPO unless he became its permanent chief. And last week it was not he but Anders Eriksson who was named as Borjesson's successor. Eriksson will take over on 1 May. Almblad will leave SAPO the same day. The National Criminal Police Corps, the Swedish FBI, is primarily known on account of its former chief, Tommy Lindstrom. This unconventional and unbureaucratic person performed a hazardous balancing act in the gray zone between prohibited and permitted police methods. In the end it was too much of a strain for the National Police Board, RPS. This is illustrated by the fact that Lindstrom has now been suspended from his job and is under indictment for falsifying documents and making false statements under oath. Additional indictments can be expected. Without Supervision It was against this background, among other things, that one-man investigator Hakan Winberg proposed that the central police organization be remodeled. The highest police leadership had no real supervision over the National Criminal Police, and it was necessary to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The chief of the National Criminal Police Corps, like the head of SAPO, should have managerial qualifications and does not need to have experience in the field, in Winberg's opinion. The role of the National Criminal Police Corps in providing operational support for police districts around the country in difficult crime investigations has also become less important as the districts themselves acquire qualified detectives. At the same time serious crimes requires a central criminal intelligence service and international police cooperation. Winberg proposed that this be the main task of the National Criminal Police. RPS did not approve the proposals. A parliamentary committee was appointed, after National Police Commissioner Bjorn Eriksson, among others, acted and made it a political issue, to the government's annoyance. But RPS itself has already reorganized the National Criminal Police Corps. And it could be difficult to make changes when the parliamentary committee presents its proposals at the end of 1995. The reorganization is based on establishing two new assistant commissioner posts for the National Criminal Police in addition to the chief commissioner. The government decided to do this on 7 April. Over 300 Employees The three police commissioners will head the secretariat and the criminal intelligence and crime-fighting units respectively. Two police superintendents will take care of Interpol and guard duty. Almblad will supervise the more than 330 employees. What are the qualifications that make him suitable for the job? Is he the operationally experienced police chief Bjorn Eriksson wanted and asked the government for? Almblad himself says: "I have been with SAPO for five years. And I have worked as a prosecutor and judge. In addition I have had international contacts in recent years, and that will be useful." Gunno Gunnmo, the chairman of the Policemen's Union, was informed of Almblad's appointment only hours before it was announced. He is not entirely satisfied about this. "We think it is important to have an advance discussion on the National Criminal Police Corps' organizational changes, the demands they place on the chief, and the extent to which these demands will be met by the person to be appointed," Gunnmo said.
