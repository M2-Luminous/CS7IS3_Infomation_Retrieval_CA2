The Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Allan Taylor, said the recent visit to Australia by Indonesia's Army Chief General Wismoyo Arismunandar had nothing to do with the so-called effort on Australia's part to replace the U.S. as a military aid donor to Indonesia. Last year, the U.S. cut its military aid program to Indonesia following allegations that Jakarta had committed violations of human rights in East Timor. [passage omitted] Mr. Taylor said that, as far as Australia was concerned, the U.S. military involvement in Asia was important mainly because it could help generate economic growth in the region.
