In both cases, coordination of the nitroxyl group with the metal ion in the complex was not observed. For this reason, new ways of introducing a spin label at the amino group of easily accessible amino derivatives of crown ethers were proposed. Diazonium salts prepared from aminophenyl-substituted crown ethers were reacted with a paramagnetic imidazolinium salt to form spin-labeled crown ethers containing an arylazoenamine group as a component of the molecule. A second approach to synthesizing spin-labeled crown ethers was also proposed. It entailed reacting amino derivatives with paramagnetic isocyanate, which reacts with amines to form paramagnetic ureas. Equimolar quantities of isocyanate and amine were mixed to produce spin-labeled crown ethers that, together with an NaOH water-alcohol solution, form paramagnetic amidines. The latter approach makes it possible to synthesize spin-labeled crown ethers that contain an amidine grouping as a component of the molecule. This in turn makes it possible to control pH in a study micro-object by means of electron paramagnetic resonance. Table 1; references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.
