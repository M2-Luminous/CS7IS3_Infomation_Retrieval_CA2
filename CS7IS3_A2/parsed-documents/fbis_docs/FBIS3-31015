"Sarajevo is the biggest detention camp in which the Serbs have been held since the start of the war. This is why it is illogical to claim that the Serbs have encircled Sarajevo, and even more illogical that they do not want a negotiated solution for this Serb city," Krajisnik told local Radio Jagodina (central Serbia). He reiterrated that in Geneva RS is willing to discuss the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the putting of this multi-ethnic capital of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina under U.N. control. "Tomorrow in Geneva the Serb side will clearly state its conditions for pulling out its heavy weapons," Krajisnik said and explained that this is necessary because the Moslems also have the same type of arms. "If the Moslem weapons remain at the line of fire, and ours are put out of action, then it is clear that the international community's demand is to enable the Moslems to take the Serb territories in this part of the front," Krajisnik said. The Serbs will never allow this, he concluded.
