Such was his reaction to the decisions of a couple of judges and a magistrate who considered bills of indictment submitted by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] inadmissible. Claiming that these decisions had caused the release of "dangerous drug traffickers," Carpizo exploded, resorting to a verbal and even incriminating attack. Also exhibiting alleged errors made by judges and magistrates in their action, he publicly accused them of "negating the PGR's efforts in the battle against drug traffic." Within the next few days, the PGR will file an administrative complaint in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) against Olga Sanchez Contreras, the third district judge of criminal proceedings, for having released two presumed participants in the 24 November shooting at the Ochoa Bali-Hai restaurant. The judge maintained that the PGR is attempting to conceal its own mistakes by accusing the Judicial Branch. She declared that, in fact, the PGR has compiled its preliminary investigations poorly, and that its charges are groundless. The clashes between Jorge Carpizo, head of the Executive Branch's juridical division, and "certain" representatives of the Federal Judicial Branch, of which Carpizo was a member before joining the Executive Branch, are nothing new. According to sources close to the PGR, during recent months it has been common practice for judges to refuse, or to declare themselves disqualified, to hear cases remanded by that department, particularly those associated with drug traffic. On other occasions, they have refrained from issuing arrest warrants or orders for the formal imprisonment of presumed criminals.
