I am a member of the Number 2 Brick Factory of Regiment 123, 7th Agricultural Division in Xinjiang's Kuitun. I have had little education. Since my divorce in 1988, I have been raising three children on my own. Last year, I planted more than 70 mu of cotton on the farm. After handing over the farm's share, I took home the remaining cotton and was going to sell it to Regiment 123's processing plant. On 17 November of last year, I rounded up several fellow villagers to load the cotton onto a cart. We packed more than 4,000 kilos of cotton and covered the cart with canvas. Night fell before the selling procedure was completed, so I left the cart in front of my house. I was afraid someone would steal the cotton, so I stayed up all night. That night someone came and dragged the cotton cart away. Someone told me that those people were from the local police station, because they suspected that my cotton had belonged to someone else. I went after them to get my cart back. They said, "You must pay us a hundred yuan, hand over the cotton that don't belong to you, and pay us back the wages we had paid to the men who got the cotton, and then you can have the cotton back. We paid 100 yuan to hire that cart." I spent two days and went there four times. They said, "We have weighed your cart already and unloaded the cotton at the processing plant." I toiled for more than a month, running back and forth more than 20 times. My feet were badly frostbitten; I could hardly walk. During that period, I have gone to the leaders of the 14th Company to prove that I was a member of the brick factory, I had planted the cotton in the farm, and that I was living in the 14th Company's family compound. I have also gone to the farm's cadres. They said, "She has delivered her share. We told her to take the remaining cotton and sell them." But they still decided to fine me 500 yuan. At that time, they had not given me the ticket. On 16 December, I went to the police station to get the cotton ticket, the deputy chief told me to hand over 500 yuan. In my present condition, I can't come up with 20 yuan, let alone 500. I did not give him the money, and they would not give me the ticket, and without that ticket, I could not settle the account and get my money, and without money, my children and I would soon die. To borrow the 500 yuan, I ran around for two days. It was no easy task, but I got the 500 yuan and got the ticket, but it said I had delivered only 3,510 kilos. My big piece of canvas was gone too. Now my family owes people more than 10,000 yuan. We have no electrical appliances at home. There is only the four of us and three beds. I singlehandedly raise three students. The oldest is enrolled in the Bayi Agricultural College this year; number two is enrolled in Dongyin Petroleum College. Both are four-year, full-time college students. The youngest is in his third year of junior high. I depend on the cotton I plant to send them to school. The cotton was hard-earned! In the seven months from 17 April when I sowed the seeds until the time I picked the cotton, rain or shine and no matter how hot, I brought a steamed bun and a bottle of water, and at noon, I worked and ate at the same time. In July, one after another, my three children came home for vacation. Every morning, they came down to the farm at 8 o'clock and returned home at 3 o'clock and came down again at 5 o'clock and would not go home until 11 o'clock. They worked till school started again. They only took one day off. I am 42 years old. Just watering the land would take me several days and nights. All by myself, I picked the cotton, had it weighed, paid for it, and delivered it. We worked hard for a whole year and bought everything with our own sweat and blood, and in just one sentence, they fined me 500 yuan. The leader even said, "You got off easy with a 500-yuan fine. According to the regiment's regulations, your cotton should have been confiscated." Comrade editor, tell me, whom should I tell my troubles to?
