At a press conference at the close of his two-day working visit to North Moravia and Silesia, Uhde said he had very good feelings from his meeting today with teachers from a Karvina basic school where Slovak is a teaching language. He said he saw no reasons for keeping its existence secret. However, he said the existence of this school, the only one in the Czech Republic, will not lead parliament to start considering the expansion of this sort of school into other cities in the republic. Uhde described his talks with members of the Polish council in Cesky Tesin, which represents the interests of more than 50,000 ethnic Poles living in the Czech Republic, as stimulating. In the Karvina area alone there are currently about 23,350 citizens claiming to be of Polish origin and 23,550 citizens describing themselves as ethnic Slovaks. Asked about a possible return of property confiscated from the ethnic Poles under the communist regime (toppled in Czechoslovakia in November 1989), Uhde said that it is impossible to extend the date further back beyond February 1948 (when the communists seized power in the former Czechoslovakia). He recalled that the property was confiscated not only after 1945 but also before and in the course of the Second World War.
