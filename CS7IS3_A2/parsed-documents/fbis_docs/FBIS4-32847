Regarding the reelection of governors, he said: "The Constituent Assembly can in no way dedicate itself to this type of topic, and as of now we are not accepting any type of clause on this matter." "This is the responsibility of provincial constitutions, and it cannot be discussed or debated in a constitutional reform, and we are maintaining this position," he added. He also gave an advance warning about his "flat" refusal to the possibility of the existence a Lemas Law in Buenos Aires Province. "In truth," he said, "the province's constitution makes its implementation very difficult, and there is no way in which the official sector can structure it." Asked about the changes that occurred during the past 20 years that could justify a new constitution, Alfonsin said that "there have been various events," and he highlighted "the role of the Armed Forces, which today is blended with the institutions." He also maintained that after 10 years of exercising democracy "it is evident that it is not a good thing for the president to name judges," and therefore with the constitutional reform "this activity will be carried out by the Magistrates Council in order to serve the Republic's interests in a much better way."
