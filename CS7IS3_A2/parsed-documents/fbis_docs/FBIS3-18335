The opposition is expected to try to exploit the change to force the government into calling an early election. However, the dissident Centre Democrat, Mrs Bente Juncker, has said that as long as the government sticks to the policy programme agreed when the government was formed in January last year she would not help to bring it down. An election to the Folketing must be called by the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic party leader, by December 6. Mr Rasmussen has repeatedly said that he will postpone calling an election as long as possible. Mrs Juncker was appointed minister for social affairs, replacing a Social Democratic minister, in a cabinet reshuffle on January 27. The reshuffle was intended to strengthen the government in general and the Centre Democrats in particular in the run-up to the election but it went badly wrong. Two weeks after the reshuffle Mrs Juncker was dismissed for passing on libellous rumours to journalists concerning the head of a home for mentally retarded adults. Recent opinion polls suggest that the government -- made up of the Social Democrats, the Centre Democrats, the Christian People's party and the Radical Liberals -- will lose seats in an election. There is a risk that the Centre Democrats, with nine seats, and the Christian People's party, with four seats, will be eliminated from the Folketing altogether. If an election result were to follow the opinion polls, Mr Rasmussen would continue to have a good chance of forming a minority administration, but he would have to rely on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's party.
