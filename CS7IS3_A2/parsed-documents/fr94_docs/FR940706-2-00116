The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24483). At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The findings show that Nu-Place and Sportette were subsidiaries of Quartet Fashions in New York. The findings show that production at Nu-Place was integrated with the production at Sportette and Nu-Place closed in January 1994. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification by including the workers at Nu-Place, Inc. in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,618 is hereby issued as follows: ``All workers of Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania and Nu-Place, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania engaged in the production of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed in Washington, DC, this 21st day of June 1994. Violet L. Thompson, Deputy Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
