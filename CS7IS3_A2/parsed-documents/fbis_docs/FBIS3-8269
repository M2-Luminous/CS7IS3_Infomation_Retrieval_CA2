Bosniaks in Bosnia and Sandzak are one people and have been living in the same state since the Berlin Congress in 1878. This congress had passed a decision whereby the Bosnia-Herzegovina borders were redrawn, Sandzak was separated from Bosnia and divided between Serbia and Montenegro. From 1878 to 1945 the people of Sandzak were under various forms of pressure and emigrated to Bosnia and Turkey. The pressure on Muslims in Sandzak increased after the disintegration of Yugoslavia and reached its peak during the war in Bosnia. Organized state terror against the Bosniak minority has caused a new wave of emigration of Muslims from Sandzak not dissimilar to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The focus of world attention on the tragedy in Bosnia has pushed our people outside Bosnia into the background. These people are exposed to the terror of the same forces and people who had planned and carried out the genocide in Bosnia. Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia are actively involved in the Geneva talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this way conditions are created for a global settlement of the national status of Serbs and Croats, as well as the status of Muslims in former Yugoslavia. It is obvious that the issue of the Bosniak people outside Bosnia cannot be resolved by temporarily sending a working group from Sandzak, which took part in the Conference on Former Yugoslavia in London, The Hague, and Geneva. Therefore, I think it necessary to accede to the demand of the Sandzak Muslim National Council to include representatives of this council in the talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina as an interested party, we read in President Izetbegovic's letter to the cochairmen of the Peace Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
