The church was packed with worshippers. Father Antoine Sfayr, who was leading the service, was among 55 people wounded in the explosion, which rocked the church as he began reading from the scriptures. U.S. President Bill Clinton, Jordan's King Husayn and Pope John Paul II joined in condemnation of the attack. There was no claim of responsibility but an unidentified suspect was arrested, prosecutor Tarabayh Rahmah announced late Sunday after an emergency meeting of security officials which included Syrian officers. The authorities were aware of "a plan to commit attacks in places of worship in Lebanon," Rahmah said, noting that the suspect was arrested a few days before the blast. Lebanese newspapers, echoing officials here and in Syria, pointed an accusing finger at Israel and linked the attack to the massacre Friday of 52 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on the occupied West Bank.
