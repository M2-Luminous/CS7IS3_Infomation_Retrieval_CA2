Here is our colleague Miroslav Milar with more information on the visit of the Indian guests. [Milar] The official welcoming ceremony took place at the Defense Ministry shortly after 1500. Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis welcomed his Indian counterpart. Shortly afterwards, the Indian army delegation took part in the first round of talks with the representatives of the Slovak Defense Ministry and military command. Pavol Kanis briefed journalists about the agenda of the talks. [Begin Kanis recording] Our negotiations focused mainly on the possibilities of cooperation in armaments production and on contracts relating to the sale of Slovak arms and armaments systems to India. It must be said that the Slovak Republic is continuing in the tradition of all the positive contacts we have had in the past, i.e., the contacts between the former Czechoslovakia and India. The Indian Defense Ministry and representatives of the Indian Army are seriously interested in contracts with Slovak armaments producers. We exchanged views on some areas in which India might be interested, for example spare parts and other products, but definitive steps will be taken in the next few days. [end recording] [Milar] After the talks at the Defense Ministry, Indian Defense Minister Mallikarjun was received by Slovak President Michal Kovac and afterwards by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan.
