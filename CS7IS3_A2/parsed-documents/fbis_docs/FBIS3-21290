Nazim: "Ulemas and Duate Conference; Creation of the Republican Islamic Rally (RIR)"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] "To end `itna' and bloodshed among Algerians." The participants who took turns speaking at the ulemas conference focused their speeches on this slogan. Called last Thursday at the Harcha auditorium by seven Islamic personalities, including Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, the ulemas conference brought together several hundreds of people, in particular Algerian and foreign Islamic leaders. The participants took this opportunity to express their outrage at "the fratricidal fight among Algerians, assassination and threats against intellectuals, the worsening of the political situation, economic failure, and the rise of political and religious violence." This situation prompted the ulemas to denounce "in righteous words, whatever is counter to divine order, with no fear of either the governing or the governed." In this respect, the meeting gave the organizers an opportunity to announce the forthcoming creation of a Republican Islamic Rally, the TADJ [RIR]. It would be a nonpartisan movement including all the ulemas and all the Algerians who might feel concerned by the appeal, even armed groups "provided they put down their weapons," Mr. Nahnah indicated. "We want the TADJ to bring together all the ulemas, the preachers, the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], whether dissolved or not, En-Nahda [Awakening], the El Oumma (editor's note: league headed by Benyoucef Benkhedda), etc. "All upright nationalists and all the Algerians who want to bar the way to those who cause trouble and divisions," he added. At the close of the conference, Sheik Abou-Djara Soltani, professor at the Constantine Islamic University and conference spokesman, made it a point to clarify some issues raised by the organization of such a meeting. Answering a question concerning the similarity [of the RIR] with Mr. Said Sadi's MPR [Movement for the Republic], Mr. Soltani bluntly stated that the RIR does not aspire "to any complementarity or normalization between Islamism and secularism"; the speaker even went so far as to state that the movement he is calling for "would oppose the MPR." To those who wonder whether the time was well chosen to hold such a conference and create the RIR, Mr. Soltani said that the RIR does not claim to be a political formation and "has no ambition to take a direct part in the National Conference," although he did not rule out the possibility that the RIR might act as a mediator between the FIS and the government, should it be asked to do so. In answering all these questions, Mr. Soltani insisted on the nonpartisan nature of his movement which, he said, will strive to fulfill the function which was initially assigned to the Dawla Islamiya [Islamic State] league but which the league could not fulfill "for reasons beyond its control or reasons of its own." At the end of his conference, Mr. Soltani announced a forthcoming RIR conference designed to examine questions concerning its organization and operation, and the eventual creation of a forum for reconciliation and the settlement of conflicts.
