Sinn Fein is viewed as the political wing of the underground Irish Republican Army and Adams has already made similar visits, despite protests from London, to the United States and, last week, the Basque regions. Adams is slated to meet in Venice with Martino Dorigo, MP for Communist Refoundation, and in Turin with another Communist MP, Marco Rizza, before winding up his visit Monday with a press conference.
