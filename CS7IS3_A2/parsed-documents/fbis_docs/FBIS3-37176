In the words of Nur Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power [DerzhKomAtom], problems with the supply of nuclear fuel from Russia have to do with the lack of funds to pay for energy carriers. In order to provide Ukraine's nuclear electric power station's with fuel and spare parts for this year, 350 billion rubles are needed. So far, DerzhKomAtom has no such a sum. The leadership of the committee sees the settlement of this issue in putting into practice the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow.
