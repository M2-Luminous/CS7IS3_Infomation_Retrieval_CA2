FR940722-1-00008 FR940722-1-00005 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Part 3 Ethics Training for Registrants AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is proposing amendments to its rule governing ethics training for registrants to provide additional guidance relative to ethics training providers. The proposed amendments would: allow a person to provide ethics training if he certifies to a registered futures association that he is not subject to statutory disqualification from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (Act), barred from service on self-regulatory organization (SRO) governing boards or committees, or subject to a pending proceeding or investigation with respect to possible violations of the Act or rules or orders promulgated thereunder; prohibit certain representations with respect to a person's status as an ethics training provider; prohibit an ethics training provider from using that fact to qualify as an expert witness in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission or from proffering evidence of that fact to qualify as an expert witness in any adjudicatory proceeding to which the Commission is a party; allow wider use of ethics training presentation by interactive means and videotape; and require ethics training providers to furnish records of attendees to a registered futures association upon request. DATES: Comments must be received by September 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581 and should refer to ``Ethics Training for Registrants.'' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lawrence B. Patent, Associate Chief Counsel, Division of Trading and Markets, at the above address. Telephone (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 210 of the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 added a new paragraph (b) to Section 4p of the Act mandating ethics training for registrants. 1 The Commission adopted Rule 3.34 to implement this Congressional mandate. 2 The Commission subsequently issued a notice to give further guidance with respect to information to be supplied in applications by persons seeking to provide ethics training to registrants. 3 1 This provision of the Act is codified at 7 U.S.C. 6p(b) (Supp. IV 1992) and states that: The Commission shall issue regulations to require new registrants, within 6 months after receiving such registration, to attend a training session, and all other registrants to attend periodic training sessions, to ensure that registrants understand their responsibilities to the public under this Act, including responsibilities to observe just and equitable principles of trade, any rule or regulation of the Commission, any rule of any appropriate contract market, registered futures association, or other self-regulatory organization, or any other applicable Federal or state law, rule or regulation. 2 58 FR 19575, 19584&hyph;19587, 19593&hyph;19594 (April 15, 1993). 3 58 FR 47890 (September 13, 1993). The Commission has reviewed several applications from persons seeking to provide ethics training to registrants and several other applications are currently pending with the Commission. In light of this experience, the Commission is now proposing amendments to Rule 3.34 regarding ethics training providers in an effort to enhance the operation of this program. Those provisions of the rule that relate to what must be covered in ethics training and specific requirements concerning attendance at such training by registrants would remain unchanged. II. Proposed Amendments A. Certification by Ethics Training Provider Presently, there are three categories of persons that may provide ethics training to registrants under the Act: (1) an SRO, such as an exchange which may have a program for its member floor brokers (FBs) and floor traders (FTs); (2) an entity accredited to conduct continuing education programs by a state professional licensing authority in the fields of law, finance, accounting or economics; or (3) any other person ``if its program is approved by the Commission for this purpose.'' 4 The proposals set forth herein would maintain SROs and state-accredited continuing education programs as ethics providers. The Commission is also proposing, however, to permit any other person to provide ethics training if the person files a notice with a registered futures association certifying that the person, any principals thereof (as defined in Commission Rule 3.1(a)) 5 and any individuals, on behalf of such person, who conduct in-person ethics training or who prepare ethics training videotape or electronic presentations, are not subject to: (1) statutory disqualification from registration under Sections 8a (2) or (3) or the Act; 6 (2) a bar from service on SRO governing boards or committees based on disciplinary histories, pursuant to Commission Rule 1.63 7 or any SRO rule adopted thereunder; 8 (3) a pending adjudicatory proceeding under Sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act or Commission Rules 3.55, 3.56 or 3.60; 9 or (4) a pending investigation by the Commission's Division of Enforcement of which the subject has been notified. 10 4 Rule 3.34(b)(3). 5 17 CFR 3.1(a) (1993). 6 7 U.S.C. 12a(2) and (3) (1988 and Supp. IV 1992). The Act specifies several grounds for disqualification including, among others, prior revocation of registration, felony convictions, and injunctions related to futures or securities activities. 7 17 CFR 1.63 (1993), as amended by 58 FR 37644 (July 13, 1993). 8 Thus, if Mr. Jones sets up Jones, Inc. to offer ethics training and hires Ms. Smith to conduct the lectures, the certification must include Jones, Inc., Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith. Such certification must also cover any additional instructors who would be hired if necessary to handle the number of registrants enrolling in the ethics training program. 9 A pending proceeding is a basis to bar a person whose registration has expired within the preceding sixty days from obtaining a temporary license upon mailing a new registration application to NFA (see 17 CFR 3.11(c)(1)(i)(B), 3.11(c)(1)(ii)(B), 3.12(d)(1)(iv), and 3.12(i)(1)(iv) (1993)), to bar a person from serving as a sponsor or special supervisor of a conditioned or restricted registrant (see 17 CFR 3.60(b)(2)(i)(A) (1993)), and to prevent withdrawal from registration (see 17 CFR 3.33(f)(1)(1993)). 10 The Commission also notes that this has been used as a basis to prevent withdrawal from registration ( see 17 CFR 3.33(f)(3) (1993)).
