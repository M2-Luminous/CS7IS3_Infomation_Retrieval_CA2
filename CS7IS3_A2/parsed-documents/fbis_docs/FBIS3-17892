This purely military issue, which is solely a matter of strengthening Russia's national security, is being whipped up by the European media. In this connection, Yuriy Matochkin, head of administration in Kaliningrad Oblast, said the military in the amber region, together with their families, amounted to 10 percent of the population. After the defense region has been set up, the grouping of troops will number 26,000 people. This is considerably lower than allowed by the treaty on conventional arms in Europe.
