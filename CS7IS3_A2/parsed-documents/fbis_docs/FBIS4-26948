The specific measures are as follows. Strengthening and improving registration and examination of the setting up of foreign-funded enterprises, examining the investment they have made, investigating and prosecuting cases involving their violations of laws and regulations, and carrying out annual examination of their operations. A Chinese-foreign joint-venture enterprise to which the Chinese side only contributes its existing assets is required to produce the Chinese side's assets assessment report confirmed by the department in charge of administering state-owned enterprises when it registers with the proper authorities. For a Chinese-foreign joint-venture enterprise to which the foreign side contributes equipment and goods, the actual prices of the equipment and goods must be clearly stated in the contract and confirmed by a notary office acceptable to both sides. If the articles of association or the contract submitted by the Chinese-foreign joint venture violates the principle of both sides sharing profits and risks or fails to state that both sides will provide guarantees for their investment in loans [tou zi dai kuan dan bao 2121 6327 6313 2949 2137 0202] in proportion to their investment or that the Chinese side will guarantee the rate of return on foreign investment with loans, bonds, or the like, the relevant authority has the right to require both sides to amend their contract; if they refuse to do so, they shall not register. Strengthening inspection of the supply of capital by investors of foreign-funded enterprises. The investors must supply the capital in full within six months of the date of issue of their licenses if their registered capital amounts to $2 million or less; within one year for registered capital between $2 million and $5 million; two years for registered capital between $5 million and $10 million; three years for registered capital between $10 million and $30 million; and longer for registered capital of more than $30 million subject to the approval of the relevant authority. If the investors fail to do so, their licenses shall be revoked. If the Chinese side of a foreign-funded enterprise supplies the registered capital on behalf of the foreign side, it is unacceptable and the foreign side shall be prosecuted for failing to supply the registered capital. If the Chinese side obtains a license by using the name of a foreign businessman or materials supplied by him and gives him free shares as a reward, the license shall be revoked and the offender punished once the offense is confirmed.
