"Very pleased." The minister made a fist: The package introduced Wednesday [8 June] is a combination of "strong" measures, he said, which will have no repercussions on our financial situation, "for the simple reason that it is self-financing." In other words, budgetary constraints "will be honored." True, there is a more general tendency for revenue to decrease, "because the effect of the various once only measures adopted by [former Prime Ministers] Ciampi and Amato is coming to an end." But the government remains committed to "not altering overall fiscal pressure." He also talked about the response of the markets, Italy, the European Monetary Union, the lira, inflation, and coming moves on the public finance front expected at the end of the month. Lamberto Dini covered the whole field, the day after the Berlusconi's first real test in finance and employment policy. The treasury minister reaffirmed his commitment to stringency, having been general manager of the Bank of Italy for 15 years. He clearly reaffirmed his utmost attention to the problem of the debt, to inflation, and to Europe, without losing sight of the objective of increasing the levels of growth and employment. Yesterday he met in Bonn with Theo Waigel, his counterpart at the German Finance Ministry. Italy's "innovations" were also broached at the meeting, which was described as "extremely cordial." In this regard, Waigel displayed "the utmost interest, the utmost understanding, and no anxiety" with regard to the government headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the treasury minister revealed, while describing as "awesome but inevitable" the new government's program centered "on the deregulation of labor, privatization, and the reform of public finance." CORRIERE spoke to Dini after the meeting. [Cecchini] Minister, are you really sure that the package will have the desired effect? [Dini] This is both our hope and our belief. [Cecchini] Are you really sure that it will not all ultimately place yet another burden on the state budget? [Dini] Look, if the package does work -- and it will work -- the resulting higher growth and employment levels will generate the necessary resources to compensate for the initial reduction in revenue. If it does not work, there will be no reduction in revenue. From the budgetary viewpoint, the effect will in any case be neutral. [Cecchini] But the markets did not respond with excitement to its announcement: The lira and government stock remained static, but the stock market actually weakened. [Dini] It must be realized that we are in an era of globalization. The markets behave according to mainly external stimuli. What has happened recently? What has happened is that after months of falling interest rates, those active in the economy have realized that the scope for further reductions is becoming exhausted: Especially in the debentures field, capital is shifting to areas where there are greater opportunities for profits -- the United States, for instance. [Cecchini] You inherited an unbalanced public finance situation from the Ciampi government. Taking account of the recession, there is a gap of at least 5 trillion lire in the 1994 budget. Do you intend to bridge it by means of a possible additional package? [Dini] We will have to see; I cannot rule it out as a matter of principle. Now we must draw up the new three-year economic and financial planning document, which we expect to do by the end of the month, but we will have to examine the figures. There is a fall in revenue at present, because the effects of the once-only measures adopted by Amato and Ciampi are coming to an end, and we want to keep overall fiscal pressure unaltered. We could take action on tax rates, but the tax pressure must remain the same. We will see whether we can bring forward measures connected with the 1995 Finance Bill, in which case that could bridge the 1994 budget gap. But the issue is still open. [Cecchini] Meanwhile, the European Commission is waiting to hear whether we will use the third installment of the Community loan. [Dini] This too depends on other factors. The European loan was negotiated in connection with Amato's three-year document in 1992 and is therefore subject to observance of that plan. Since then, however, the scenario has completely changed. There has been a recession in Europe and a recession in Italy. Amato's plan envisaged an initial advance of 100 trillion lire, no less, and was based on entirely unrealistic macroeconomic hypotheses of expansion. Now we must draw up a new plan and see how close we can get to the objectives agreed with Brussels at that time. After that we will present it to the Commission; if it is acceptable, we will use the third installment; otherwise.... [Cecchini] Otherwise, what? [Dini] We will not use it. [Cecchini] You met with Waigel. Did he grant his approval of your economic program? [Dini] It is not a matter of granting approval; we do not grant our approval to the Germans, and they do not grant us theirs. Waigel showed great interest in and appreciation of our plans, because these ideas move in the direction of European convergence and because, both with regard to the issue of employment and with regard to finance, they are in line with the pointers issued by all the international bodies, from G-7 to the IMF. [Cecchini] With a lira exchange rate of 970 against the German mark, did you receive any pressure to rejoin the European Monetary System or for a revaluation? [Dini] None. [Cecchini] One last question: Italy has for some time been underrepresented in the international bodies; we lost over the issues of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] and the European bank for the East, and now the issue of nominations to the European Commission is about to arise and we await a decision on the World Trade Organization. What does the government intend to do? [Dini] There has been a great deal of confusion about the EBRD: We did not lose; the issue of the deputy presidency will be discussed again in 1995. For the World Trade Organization, we have our sights set on Renato Ruggiero. As for the rest, our policy is to do our utmost to ensure that the country is adequately represented.
