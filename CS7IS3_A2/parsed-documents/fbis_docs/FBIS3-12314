In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, the source said Khalid Husni al-Qurashi attacked (Lon Edwards), a British tourist, at the Hashimite Square at noon today and stabbed him with a knife. The tourist was immediately rescued. He is now in a good condition. The assailant was arrested. The Interior Ministry expresses its understanding of the overwhelming feelings that accompanied the grave event that took place at the Ibrahimi Mosque today. It, however, urges citizens to exercise self-restraint and close ranks so the feelings of support for our people in the occupied homeland will not turn into irresponsible, instantaneous reactions that harm our feelings and our just cause.
