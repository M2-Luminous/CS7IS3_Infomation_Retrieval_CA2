Israel is still barricading itself behind its futile ideas and continues to put spokes in the wheel of the peace process. The paper stresses that Israel is not only avoiding decisive answers on the substance of the peace process regarding the question of complete withdrawal, but also proposes absurd ideas, which constitute an attempt to escape forward. This is especially the case after it was pushed into a difficult dilemma by the Syrian position and the Geneva summit. Israel now does not have the chance to avoid, for very long, these answers. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Despite the ability it was provided by the Oslo and Cairo agreements with the PLO to promote separate solutions, Israel will be very mistaken if it thinks it can subjugate Syria and the other tracks to separate deals which it can tailor to fit its economic, military, political, and security interests. Peace, as Syria has always said, must be just and comprehensive or else there will be no peace.
