The generals in Moscow have developed a new chemical weapon. The project is considered to be a state secret (code: "A 232"). A scientist who informed the west about it was arrested for betraying state secrets. The nerve poison (called "Novikhok") reportedly works even faster and more strongly than all chemical combat agents known so far. Bonn is alarmed. Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the Foreign Ministry, says: "The Federal Government is worried about these reports."
