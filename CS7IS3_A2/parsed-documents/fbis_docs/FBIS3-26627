To safeguard the lives, security and legitimate rights and privileges of staffers and workers in all sorts of enterprises, the State Council recently adopted the draft "Law on Labor," to be submitted to the National People's Congress, and made explicit stipulations on establishing workers' union organizations in foreign-funded enterprises. At the same time, Guangdong Province, where there is the greatest number of foreign-funded enterprises, is preparing to enact specialized legislation to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of workers and staffers in foreign-funded enterprises. In the 150,000 foreign-funded enterprises -- whether cooperative, joint venture, or solely foreign-owned -- the capital-labor relations in most have been comparatively normal and harmonious, but a small number of foreign-funded enterprises lack safety installations and workers' welfare provisions, while paying no attention to workers' safety; they arbitrarily prolong working hours, are in arrears with or make deductions from workers' wages, arbitrarily fire workers and staffers, and even violate workers' personal rights and interests, including body searches upon leaving the factory after a day's work. Workers and staffers in related enterprises expressed their resentment and protest through work slow-downs, strikes, visits to supervising departments, or letters of complaint to the authorities. This being the case, labor disputes in foreign-funded enterprises in various places have increased markedly in recent years. According to incomplete statistics, there were 50 cases of labor disputes in Xiamen's foreign-funded enterprises in 1991, and 460 such cases in 1993. There were some 250 work stoppages in Shenzhen's foreign-funded enterprises in 1992, and some 4,000 complaints lodged, involving scores of thousands of workers and staffers; there were an even greater number of such incidents last year. The Shanghai municipal labor arbitration organization handled soem 70 labor disputes at foreign-funded enterprises in 1991, twice the number of such cases in 1989 and 1990 put together; in 1992 and 1993, the number of such cases exceeded 100 each year. Owing to insufficient safety installations, accidents have been frequent in many foreign-funded enterprises, and some fires broke out. The fire at a Hong Kong-funded technical toy factory in Shenzhen resulted in a tragedy involving 84 deaths and some 40 casualties. Statistics showed that of the 206 major fires that took place in China last year, foreign-funded enterprises accounted for one-tenth. Workers and staffers involved in labor disputes at foreign-funded enterprises were mostly laborers from rural areas. When they first worked at these enterprises, they had very little knowledge about what labor rights and privileges they should enjoy, so when they entered the factory, they did not sign contracts with those representing capital; they had a very weak sense of and capability for self-protection, and often were placed in the position of the weak. These peasant laborers who worked at foreign-funded enterprises valued their work opportunities, and generally were able to "endure" irrational things. When the state of affairs evolved into work slow-downs or strikes, it only proved that the working environment, conditions and treatment at some foreign-funded enterprises were so poor that they had gone quite beyond the workers' capacity to endure. Labor disputes took place primarily in some medium-sized and small enterprises funded by Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen which required little investment, but reaped high profits. These businessmen cherished hopes of repaying of their principal in a short period and of making money. This being the case, the factories' internal environment was very poor, lacking proper ventilation, dust-proofing, antitoxic safeguards, fire-proofing and noise-proofing, while constantly sparking serious accidents. At the same time, the work day could be extremely long. In many factories, workers and staffers had to work 10-12 hours on an average day; sometimes they had to work nonstop for 16 hours to get some particular job done on schedule. The payment for work at some foreign-funded enterprises was on the low side, with wage levels that were not up to the original stipulation. Sometimes, the level could be even lower than the minimum wage standards of local enterprises. At other times, foreign businessmen would arbitrarily keep the payment of wages in arrears. Welfare provisions were poor, too. Dormitories were dirty and disorderly; workers did not enjoy medical insurance and were not allowed compensation for injuries resulting from accidents in the workplace. What was more unbearable was that the managerial methods of some foreign-funded enterprises could be rough. Aside from being penalized when staffers and workers violated rules and regulations, cases of workers being confined, beaten, or cursed at sometimes took place. Mainland workers' unions believed that foreign-funded enterprises made contributions to national economic development, but the rank and file of workers and staffers in such enterprises rendered meritorious services that should not be nullified, either. Their legitimate rights and privileges should be protected. From the angle of the development of foreign-funded enterprises themselves, the harmony and stability of labor-capital relations is the basic factor in enterprises' advance toward a sound cycle and their striving for economic results. This being the case, foreign businessmen should not be eager for quick success and instant benefits, still more should they refrain from forgetting all moral principles at the sight of profits. From the angle of the rights and privileges of workers and staffers, the state must complete and perfect the law on labor as quickly as possible. The far-too-general existing decrees and regulations on labor lack feasibility in actual operation, nor are they capable of checking law-breaking behavior. This being the case, a complete and perfect "Law on Labor" is in great demand. On this basis, the labor insurance system will be established to protect rights and privileges in the workplace. To the mainland authorities, the completion and perfection of labor decrees and regulations, and the appropriate handling of labor disputes according to the law have a bearing on the confidence of investors from beyond our borders. In the wake of presenting the "Law on Labor," it is necessary to augment monitoring and examination, and to establish specialized supervision organizations. At present, some provinces and cities fear lest whatever they do should affect foreign investment. Thus they have provided 101 kinds of preferential treatment to foreign businessmen, paying great attention to allowing preferential treatment, but saying very little about administration according to the law. They have closed their eyes to many factory workshops failing to meet the requirements of the rules and regulations on safety and fire precaution measures. Thus the hidden danger of accidents has been left unresolved. From a long-range point of view, only by combining in an organic way the import of foreign investment with the completion and perfection of administration through the legal system will it be possible genuinely to push forward the healthy, stable, and sustained development of foreign-funded enterprises.
