They held an hour of consultations in view of the recent SKD proposal to form a government coalition of two parties, that is, without the United List, while the Social Democrats have already announced their departure from the government. As it was expected, today's meeting did not produce any concrete decisions about the fate of the future government coalition. After the meeting of the negotiating teams of both parties, we can also expect a meeting of the members of the LDS executive council and the SDK council. The SKD will make the final decision about this next week and definitely before the annual party conference that will take place between 22 and 24 April. A segment of the party's membership demands departure from the coalition. However, a sober examination shows the great political damage that the party would suffer if it left the coalition at a moment when tangible results in new spheres that will also bring electoral points are in sight. One, therefore, should not expect any more explicit decisions from the afternoon meeting of the SKD council. [passage omitted]
