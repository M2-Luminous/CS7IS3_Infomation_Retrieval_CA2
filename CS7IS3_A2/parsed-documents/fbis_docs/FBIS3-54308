This is as if Yitzhaq Rabin is telling the Syrians ahead of time that any agreement that might be reached with them will ultimately be subject to this referendum novelty, which is unprecedented in Israel. This already cancels the issue of negotiating over the Golan or any other territory if the Israeli Government is not authorized to decide on withdrawal. Indeed, what could Yitzhaq Rabin negotiate about with any of the Arab parties if the final say will be for the Israeli man on the street, whom we already know is inclined toward extremism and intransigence, and whom we now realize is obsessed with expansion after all the racism and racist grudge all Israelis have been raised on? It was hoped the U.S. reaction would be in line with the Western democratic traditions which authorize the elected governments to make decisions based on the conventional parliamentary majority. However, statements by the new U.S. ambassador to Israel contradict this rule adopted by countries that champion democracy. He expressed the United States' support for Yitzhaq Rabin's new notion, which is a direct blow to all the agreements reached in Geneva just a few days ago. The public referendum which Rabin is calling for is a new Israeli evasion of the requirements of the peace process. It also torpedoes the well known bases for negotiation. This is especially true as long as the Arabs are negotiating with a government that is giving up its authority to make decisions and is leaving agreements that could be reached up to the mood of the man on the street who could push an agreement one way or the other based on the personal whims of his leaders and through instigation and racist mobilization, all the effective tools which Israel owns.
