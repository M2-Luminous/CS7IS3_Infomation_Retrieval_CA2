Of the 3.8 million eligible voters in the city, 932,000, or 25.6 percent, turned out at election precincts on 20 and 21 March. The commission currently counts the elections as valid in 25 electoral districts in the city. It is possible that after the final vote count this number will rise to 26. And here is the rating of electoral coalitions. According to preliminary data, the right to participate in the second round was won by 19 candidates from Democratic Unity of Petersburg, six candidates from the All Petersburg bloc, five from The City We Love, two from the Our City--Our Home bloc, one from Unity for Progress, and 16 independent candidates. Vladimir Fomichev reported that the city commission is currently looking into numerous complaints and comments from various election precincts.

To this question Vladimir Fomichev provided a rather vague explanation. It turns out that the main voter registration list is put together 30 days before the elections. As to the supplemental lists, where the new category of voters were written in, they were put together at the precincts as out-of-town students and military servicemen showed up. The commission does not know the total number of such persons in the city. Their inclusion on the lists of registered voters, however, could substantially change the picture of population turnout at electoral precincts. This situation will certainly come up more than once as a subject of various inquiries.
