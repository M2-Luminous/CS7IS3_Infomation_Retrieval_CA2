FR940419-2-00025 FR940419-2-00019 Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement to National Governors' Association AGENCY: United States Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of non-competitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the National Governors' Association (NGA) under proposed Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FC01&hyph;94EW30330. The total estimated funding in the amount of $3,136,517 will be provided to NGA for this effort. NGA currently has an agreement with DOE to facilitate site treatment plan approval by States and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by providing a forum for regulators to review and discuss technical policy and implementation issues concerning site plans and to actively participate in the development of these plans. Funding for the proposed agreement will allow NGA to conduct reviews of DOE conceptual and draft site treatment plans, participate in discussions with DOE on related Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 (FFCAct) issues, and review other related documents not specifically required by the legislature, but having a bearing on the site treatment process. The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) that NGA's unique institutional ties to the State governments included in this project are required because of the need to balance individual State interests with national perspectives in the development of DOE's mixed waste treatment plans. NGA is the only organization that collectively represents all of the nation's Governors on matters of national and State policy. This organization's ability to access and mobilize its member governments on multi-state task forces and committees is needed to provide assessment of key issues identified in the FFCAct and facilitate issue resolution. The NGA's Center of Policy and Research has substantial expertise in Federal and State environmental programs and hosting forums for identifying and resolving critical policy and implementation issues. The period of performance is 16 months from the date of award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, Attn: Phyllis P.
