It is only too clear that the projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea practically means an extremely grave development that will frustrate the DPRK-USA talks for a solution to the nuclear issue and increase the crisis of war in the Korean peninsula. Kim Chong-pil's treacherous balderdash clearly proves how persistently the puppets are trying to bring weapons of destruction into South Korea. His outcry is no more than a shameless sophism to justify the criminal acts of the puppets in hastening the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. The South Korean puppet clique must immediately stop their reckless provocative moves to aggravate confrontation and tension between the North and the South by deploying missiles.
