However, the steady increase in urban population and the rising level of consumption among urban and rural households as well as changes in the mix of consumption have sharply boosted demand for meat, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables. The encroachment upon suburban land by ever-expanding cities, township and town enterprises, and assorted development zones has also severely weakened the ability of the outskirts to supply cities and industrial and mining areas with agricultural byproducts. The gap between the supply and demand of nonstaple food has widened. How to narrow this gap promptly and effectively has become a most urgent issue in social economic life in Yunnan. The most fundamental way to ease the shortage of meat, eggs, milk, fruits, vegetables, and other nonstaple food is to develop a host of nonstaple food production bases with a steady supply capability. This is the new demand of high-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency agriculture as well as an objective requirement of deepening rural reform in Yunnan and preventing a decline or instability in nonstaple food production in the outskirts of cities. The construction of nonstaple food bases is a piece of systems engineering that requires huge investments, is slow to take effect, and involves all sorts of factors, social, economic, and natural. Where should the bases be built? On what scale? What should they produce? What role should they play? What model should they follow? Where would the required funds and technology come from? How? These strategic questions pertaining to the construction of nonstaple food bases should all be answered based on the requirements of objective economic principles. The answers should have instructional significance and can be used as guiding principles on a macro level. Considering the reality in Yunnan's development, we should build nonstaple food production bases along the rivers, along railroads, and along the border, selecting from among those areas designated by the state as key development zones, regional urban centers, and border trade development areas. [passages omitted] Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases 1) The model for the construction of nonstaple food production bases should be based on the specific conditions in Yunnan and chart a path with local Yunnan characteristics. The construction of production bases should be integrated with the development of a high-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency agriculture in the outskirts. It should revolve around the modern suburban non-staple food production bases and be oriented toward the market. It should make use of science and technology and lead the peasants, special households, and Class 1 villages in creating a nonstaple food production base model that integrates agriculture closely with science, industry, and commerce (trade) and melds production, supply, and marketing into one. This development model has a dual function. On the one hand, it is open to the inluence of the urban economy, producing agricultural byproducts and supplying the cities with such byproducts. On the other hand, it serves peasants in the outskirts by organizing their production of nonstaple food and sharing their risk. 2) The Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases: Basic Ideas [Passage omitted] The concentric circle with the city at the center has indeed been the pattern of distribution of agricultural production bases both in China and elsewhere since ancient times. This gives the distribution of agricultural production the following characteristics. First, the agricultural population fans out from the city, losing in density the further you go from the center. Second, per capita farmland increases the further you go from the center. Third, the standard of agricultural production drops the further one moves from the center. Fourth, the degree of agricultural commercialization and the level of technology drop off. Fifth, an increasing percentage of the agricultural output is transported elsewhere to be sold. Sixth, the further from the center, the less polluted agricultural byproducts are. Besides taking into account a variety of social, economic, and natural factors, we must also consider moving the point of lowest costs and site the bases at different levels based on the concentric circle pattern. a) Bases for the production of meat, milk, and eggs as commodities in the outskirts. Expand, improve, and upgrade the existing pig bases at Fumin, Yiliang, and Jinning and the Fumin poultry and egg bases, turning them soon into pork, egg, and milk production bases in the outskirts that both are comprehensive and have their own respective focuses. In the wake of the development of the Kunming urban region and that of the Lanping lead and zinc mine, we should build three suburban meat, milk, and egg production bases one after another in the Eighth Five-Year Plan and the early part of the Ninth Five-Year Plan in order to satisfy the demand of Kunming, Dali, and the industrial and mining areas as well as the special needs of tourists. By the year 2000, the combined meat output of meat, milk, and egg production bases in the outskirts should be 99,000 tons, up 66.4 percent from the level in 1990, for an average annual growth rate of 5.2 percent. Total annual milk output is projected to be 66,000 tons, for an average annual growth rate of 6.8 percent. Combined annual egg output will be 17,000 tons, for an average annual growth rate of 4.3 percent. B. Pork production bases in the outer suburbs and outside the cities. Further consolidate and improve the existing 17 commercial pork producing base-counties. Then we should build on that achievement by gradually adjusting the distribution of the bases, shifting the focus to the southwestern and southern parts of the province and forming a cluster of bases to supply major cities including Kunming, Gejiu, and Qujing, and key opened tourist areas like Dali, Dehong, and Xishuangbanna with fresh products in the main, while putting equal emphasis on the production and supply of ham, juanti, and other specialty items. In addition, six pig bases including Simao, Jinghong, Binchuan, and Midu should be built in stages to serve the border ports and tourist areas. By the year 2000 base counties should have a total of 4,623,000 pigs in stock and produce 403,000 tons of pork, boosting the slaughter rate from 70 to 77 percent. C. Beef production bases. Go all out to develop beef bases and beef, milk, and leather processing. This is where a breakthrough can be achieved to rationalize the structure of Yunnan's animal husbandry industry and create an export-oriented grain-conserving animal husbandry industry. Commercial beef bases should be concentrated in southern and central Yunnan, home to large numbers of Hui people. Special pains should be taken to develop beef bases in southwestern and southern Yunnan. After the five beef bases of Xindian, Nanjian, Weishan, Guangnan, and Funing are upgraded, 11 other bases should be built, including Eshan, Shizhong, Changning, Tengchong, Zhenxiong, and Zhaotong. They should orient themselves to Kunming and the neighboring areas and concentrate on the production of high-quality fresh beef, before gradually branching out into the processing business and developing specialty items for the domestic and overseas markets. By the year 2000, base counties should have 1,885,000 cattle on hand, up from the 1,626,000 in 1990, and slaughter 204,000 cattle, up from 63,000 in 1990. The annual beef output will also rise to 9,500 tons by the year 2000, up from 2,800 tons. D. Mutton bases. Mutton from Yunnan goats is quite popular in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and various Southeast Asian nations. The pace of building mutton bases should be accelerated. By the year 2000, besides consolidating and improving the three bases of Shuangbai, Dayao, and Luquan, three other new bases --Chuxiong, Lengling, and Jingdong -- should be built gradually so that bases in central Yunnan produce black mutton while bases in Longling produce yellow mutton. Improve quality, better processing, and increase exports. By the year 2000, the bases should have 1,174,000 sheep on hand and slaughter 195,000 animals annually, yielding 3,11 tons of mutton. E. Dairy products base. Continue to build up the Eryuan cow milk base and Lunan milch goat base . Improve processing, packaging, and storage technologies. Work hard to increase the output of such specialty items as ruyan and milk biscuits, which are highly popular among consumers. Build Huaping and Jianchuan dairy bases. Open up a dairy products market in the industrial and mining areas centered on Pangang. By the year 2000, Eryuan and Huaping shall have a total of 36,000 milk cows on hand, producing 54,000 tons of milk and turning out enough cheese to meet the demand of the Kunming and Dali tourist areas. In addition, they shall gradually increase the output of a coherent series of dairy products and diligently cultivate the consumer markets in southwestern Yunnan and the neighboring countries. Between them Lunan and Jianchuan shall have 139,000 milk goats on hand, producing 3,800 tons of milk. Lunan County shall produce 550 tons of milk biscuits each year, its primary markets being Kunming and the Shilin tourist area. F. Commercial poultry and egg bases. To make sure the needs of such key industrial and mining areas as Gejiu and Manwan are met, commercial poultry and egg bases will be built over time during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. By the year 2000 annual fresh egg output shall reach 838 tons and poultry, 1,435 tons. G. Distribution of vegetable bases. There are four basic considerations behind the distribution of vegetable bases. First, consolidate and improve the old bases outside Kunming, Dongchuan, Dali, Chixiong, and Yuxi, creating specialized production bases of an appropriate scale which concentrate on upscale niche vegetables and other out-of-season vegetables. Second, in the short haul outer suburbs and mid-range suburbs should specialize in vegetables with a mass demand. Third, places in the periphery of Kunming like Tonghai, Yuanjiang, Yuanmou, and Binchuan should set up a number of export-oriented vegetable production and processing bases, focusing on early winter vegetables. Fourth, build vegetable bases along the rivers, along railroads, and along the border, in other words, namely the main paths of growth in the province in the future. a) Develop new specialized commercial vegetable production bases with a combined area of 70,000 mu at such points as Baoshan, Tengchong, Luxi, Lanping, Yunlong, Yun County, Jinggu, and Simao in the Lancang valley. The average yield per mu shall be 2,000 kilograms. Required investment: 28 million yuan. b) Build new bases in Yuanjiang, Tonghai, and Dongchuan with a combined area of 5,000 mu to develop improved vegetable varieties. They shall supply 2,400 tons of improved vegetable varieties each year and 1 ton of hybrid seeds. Required investment: 6 million yuan. c) It will require an investment of 6 million yuan to improve and consolidate 30,000 mu of newly opened vegetable growing areas near the central cities in central and eastern Yunnan along the Nanning-Kunming Railroad and Kunming-Hekou Railroad. H. The distribution of fruit production bases. In the future fruit production bases should be clustered around the key regions--central cities, key development zones--and be built in stages. Stage 1 (1993-1995): 1.5 million mu under fruit cultivation (including 600,000 mu under joint commodity production). Of the total output of 450,000 tons, commercial output accounts for 150,000 tons, or 12 kilograms per capita. Stage 2 (1996-2000). Between 2 million and 2.2 million mu are under fruit cultivation (including 1 million mu under joint commodity production). Of the total output of 800,000 tons, commercial output makes up 400,000 tons, or 21 kilograms per capita, which would place Yunnan near the national average. Build a million mu of high-quality high-yield orchards by the year 2000 through the distribution of different varieties in different stages and at different levels. Create a mango belt, the largest in the nation, based on Yuanjiang and Xinping in the upper and middle reaches of Hong He; a banana belt, based on Hekou, Hong He, and Yuanyang in the lower reaches of Hong He; an apple belt, based on Ningliang, Lijiang, and Zhaotong in northwestern and northeastern Yunnan; an orange and tangerine belt, based on Huaning, Jianshui, Luxi, and Shiping in Nanpanjiang; and a high-quality pear and peach belt, based on Kunming, Chuxiong, and Dali. This will put an end to the fragmentation that characterizes fruit growing in Yunnan and allows large quantities of marketable fruit to make their way from the valleys to the market. Right now the people of Yunnan, blessed as they are with ample natural resources, eat Shandong apples, Hebei pears, and sweet oranges from Guangdong. The build-up of fruit production bases should change that situation fundamentally. a) Special aquatic breeding bases. We should be realistic enough to see that as an inland province, Yunnan has limited potential in the aquatic industry. Its future here lies in intelligent distribution and in concentrating on the development of a number of high-value and sophisticated special, unique or rare aquatic products, thus offsetting its quantitative weakness with high-quality, well-priced, and unusual products and creating a new look in aquatic production. Bases for the production of soft-shelled turtle, lobster, river crab, California perch, rainbow trout, and bullfrog may be built in places like Kunming, Xishuangbanna, Hekou, Yuanyang, and Dehong. These bases should operate on a substantial scale and orient themselves to such markets as those in Kunming, key port cities, and other provinces. 3. Strategy for the Construction of Nonstaple Food Production Bases 1) Adopt new thinking. Right now vegetable production and sales are booming. We should take advantage of this momentum and, making the best use of the situation, promptly adjust our guiding principle by adopting unequivocally a new philosophy for the development of the vegetable industry. Raise the standing of vegetables in the urban and rural economies, particularly the latter. Remove vegetable growing from diversified operations and turn it into an independent industry in its own right on a par with grain growing, animal husbandry, and township and town enterprises. That will increase to four the number of major players in the rural economy in many counties and municipalities in the outskirts of cities: enterprises, grain, animal husbandry, and vegetables. Localities with the necessary wherewithal may go into the timber industry, fruit growing, and fish breeding, diversifying their economies in the course of time. 2) Strengthen the market mechanism. For one thing, we must organize the production and sales of vegetables, fruit, aquatic products, and other nonstaple food based on what the market wants, adhering firmly to the direction of upgrading. Guided by the new work philosophy, the departments concerned must provide peasants who grow vegetables and fruit with accurate information and comprehensive coordinated services in technological matters, transportation, and storage. This is essential to building a base-county. Secondly, an effort should be made to ensure success in superstructure construction by setting up a host of new high-standard large-scale special markets and wholesale markets. In the course of time there should be a nonstaple food market system that is intelligently distributed, well-equipped, easily accessible, and scientifically managed. We should work to make it more and more appealing and influential. Thirdly, we should go all out to open up the markets in other cities and then move into Southeast Asia, securing for ourselves a foothold in the international market. 3) Sources of funding for base construction. Nonstaple food base construction is characterized by the large amount of investment required over a long period of time. Accordingly what is needed is a sound investment policy with diversified funding sources. Some of the inputs should come from the state, some from the producers, and some from the consumers as well. The enthusiasm of the state, localities, local peasants, and all social quarters for base construction should be fully tapped. Initially, money for base construction may come from these possible source: a) Appropriations by the local government; b) appropriations by the central treasury; c) bank loans; d) fund-raising by peasants; e) idle funds in all social quarters in the city; f) foreign funds. At the moment, the state and local governments are the main financiers of the construction of non-staple food bases. However, this uniform pattern of funding does nothing to accelerate the building of new bases. Of the funding sources mentioned above, the most ignored hitherto are e) and f). As the open policy is broadened, foreign capital has also become an important source of funds to build nonstaple food bases in key areas. In addition, expanding lateral economic cooperation between different sectors and regions in funding, technology, qualified personnel, and commodities that is mutually beneficial and that is complementary is also an effective way to solve problem relating to funds, technology, and qualified personnel that may occur in base development. 4) Adopt a business and management model that integrates agriculture with trade and industry. Traditionally the agricultural sector was solely concerned with production; no external environment and basic conditions for participating in processing and circulation existed. Even as they overhaul their thinking, therefore, base-counties must work extra hard to integrate agriculture with industry and trade and branch out into non-staple food processing and circulation. Leading bodies at all levels should encourage and support their subordinate units in operations linking production and marketing. The primary processing, multiple processing, and other forms of sophisticated processing of nonstaple food allied to the raw materials products of a base should be tackled energetically, as should the development of foreign-exchange-earning and export-oriented agriculture and processing. The leading departments should also guide the entry of these units into the circulation arena, add value to nonstaple food without interruption, and increase the incomes of peasants and herdsmen. For a province like Yunnan with its underdeveloped commodity economy these issues assume additional urgency and importance. 5) Step up the macro-regulation and control of bases. The construction of nonstaple food bases is critical to upgrading Yunnan's food industry and satisfying the market demand in the 1990's. After we have planned their distribution intelligently, conducted scientific verification, and incorporated them into national economic construction in stages, we should step up close leadership in earnest and strengthen macro regulation and control. First, project management should be adopted for every kind of nonstaple food base. A project should be approved only after rigorous examination. Project management methods should also be worked out. Input and output should be strictly linked. Inspection should be tightened and evaluation methods should be formulated. After a project is completed, it should be inspected before acceptance. Group contracting should be adopted for comprehensive development projects, bringing together the leaders, technical cadres, and the masses. Inputs like policies, technology, funds, and materials should be coordinated and services rendered in a coherent manner. Responsibility contracts should be signed at each level and scientific and technical contracting should be adopted, thus linking wages and bonuses to how well or how poorly a job is done, responsibilities to rights and profits. Scientific and technical contracting should be used to widen income differences; S&T personnel with outstanding contributions should be heavily rewarded. Where a project is poorly executed or funds have been wasted, the leaders and other individuals involved should be held liable. [passage omitted]
