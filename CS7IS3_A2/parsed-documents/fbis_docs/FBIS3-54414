He noted that the bilateral boycott [muqata'ah thuna'iyah] can be ended gradually if progress is made on the basis of goodwill initiatives. At a press conference he held this afternoon on the sidelines of the second international conference on challenges facing the Arab world amid world changes, Shaykh al-Qasimi said that there is no fear of Israeli penetration of Gulf markets if a comprehensive peace is achieved. He remarked that the GCC states will not be a "piece of cake" for Israel. On the GCC stand on Iran's occupation of Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb al- Kubra, and Abu-Musa--the three islands of the United Arab Emirates-- al-Qasimi pointed out that the GCC will refer the matter to international organizations if Iran and the Emirates do not resolve the dispute. Asked about the varying stands the GCC states adopted on Iraq and Iran, al-Qasimi emphasized that the GCC summit resolutions on these matters are binding to all members. He pointed out that varying views do not mean that these states are divided. Each state is entitled to its own views and what counts is for all these views to serve the GCC's interests, he said. He added that any contact between a Gulf state and either Iran or Iraq is in the GCC states' interest because these contacts seek solutions to the problems involving these two states. On the GCC stance on borders among Gulf states, Shaykh Fahim remarked that the GCC is not a unique case and that these matters are on their way to a solution. Answering a question on increasing the number of the Peninsula Shield troops, al-Qasimi stated that the GCC has agreed to increase the troops from 8,000 to 17,000 and to develop united military and communication systems. Shaykh al-Qasimi added that the Gulf states must develop a common vision of cooperation. He also said that the Damascus Declaration leaves defense cooperation between Gulf states and both Egypt and Syria up to each individual state. Al-Qasimi answered a question on the visit the Omani energy minister paid to European and East Asian states to negotiate a reduction in oil output. He said the visit produced encouraging results and that he received a report from the Omani minister, affirming that the responses were very reassuring. He remarked that a reasonable reduction in the oil output will contribute to price stability.
