NODONG SINMUN today views their reckless act as a mean trick to block a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, lead the situation to an extreme phase, and find a justification of "sanctions" against the DPRK. The analyst says: Some forces are now charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms development" and "challenge to the international community" as regards the just refueling of a reactor in the DPRK. This is nothing but a sinister political plot to pursue another purpose by breaking up dialogue and increasing tension. To solve the nuclear issue in a fair way through dialogue is the principled stand and consistent policy of the DPRK. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has not yet been resolved because the United States has put pressure on the DPRK, pursuing a hostile policy for stifling it. If the United States had renounced such a policy and the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks had been held for a package solution, the DPRK would have been freed from its special status and routine and ad hoc inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] made. And such outstanding matters as the preservation of selected fuel rods and sampling by the IAEA would have been solved automatically. The U.S. hardline conservatives, however, are persistently intensifying pressure on the DPRK, far from seeking a fair solution. After all, they have only laid big obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, increased tension and helped munitions monopolies gain fabulous profits through arms sale. If those speaking for the interests of the U.S. munitions industry create obstacles to a fair solution to the nuclear issue, giving precedence to short-sighted interests, it will bring nothing good to the United States itself. The United States should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its obstruction of a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue.
