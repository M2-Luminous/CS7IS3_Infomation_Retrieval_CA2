The Medellin military command gave the details of this Sunday's joint operation -- which they described as effective -- against possible sabotage of the electoral process. The command also announced the arrest of the leader of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] Bolivarian Militia's urban group and 11 other rebels. The operation resulted in the seizure of 200 kg of dynamite, 19 16-caliber cartridges, five rolls of slow-burning fuse, and 882 9-mm bullets during a raid on a house in northeastern Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. Military sources have indicated that operations against FARC groups in the Medellin urban area are directed at preventing disruptions such as those that occurred during the 13 March legislative elections. The same sources also reported that there was significant property damage but no casualties during the March terrorist attacks against political party headquarters and the Venezuelan consulate in Medellin. The authorities stressed this Sunday that they intend to continue the operations against subversives and explained that the arrest of 12 Bolivarian Militia members and the seizure of war material followed 90 days of investigations and intelligence work.
