Soskovets was addressing a conference on preparations for harvesting held at the Russian government building. The conference was critical of the agrarian sector's level of preparedness for harvesting. The grain combine harvester fleet has been reduced by 29 thousand vehicles since 1993 and of the remaining ones less 50 percent are operational. As a result each machine will have to harvest 260 hectares (compared to the standard 131) and the harvesting season will take a whole month, whereas the optimal harvesting period is no more than 15-17 days. Soskovets asked manufacturers to urgently supply farm workers with 1,575 grain harvesters on credit supported by government guarantees, and called on the economics and finance ministries to pool efforts with the Central Bank of Russia to look into the possibility of financing the agro-industrial complex on favorable terms. The Russian government, Soskovets said, will take a number of urgent measures to make preparations for harvesting already this week. He strongly criticized the AIC leaders, in particular, such sub- units as the Rosagrosnab and Roskhleboprodukt joint-stock companies and the associations of Rosagrokhim which had assumed new names but failed to become full-fledged market structures to this day. Soskovets said that there was no united agro-industrial complex in the country, only fragmented structures in no way responsible for the farmers' end product.
