S.-IAEA SUMMARY In a string of confrontational actions and pronouncements, Pyongyang has raised the stakes further in its high-stakes nuclear issues game by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Although apparently unwilling to publicly concede that its own recent actions have damaged the chances for resumption of high-level U.S.-North Korea dialogue, Pyongyang appears to be trying to somehow salvage bilateral talks with Washington. END SUMMARY Pyongyang Threatens NPT Withdrawal, Calls for U.S. Talks Pyongyang's threat to withdraw from the NPT came in an authoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement issued on 21 March (Pyongyang radio, 21 March). In the statement Pyongyang said it will "carry into practice" its declaration of NPT withdrawal announced on 12 March 1993 under certain conditions: + If the United States refuses bilateral talks with North Korea and resumes Team Spirit, thereby "increasing its nuclear threat" against the DPRK. + If the IAEA "further expands it unfairness" by "distorting" the results of its recent inspections in North Korea and resorts to "forcible measures and pressures." The 21 March statement, which for the first time acknowledged that the DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for the same day in Geneva did not take place, also repeated familiar North Korean charges of U.S. violations of previous agreements with North Korea and declared that Pyongyang will "no longer" be duty-bound to ensure continuity of NPT safeguards. Hint of Moderation Possibly seeking to soften its threat--and thus somehow leave the door ajar for dialogue with Washington- -the statement seemed to imply that as long as there is any hope of resuming bilateral talks with Washington, Pyongyang may refrain from taking the final step of NPT withdrawal. North Korean withdrawal from the NPT, the statement said, would occur only if the United States "persists in avoiding" bilateral talks "to the end." Underscoring Pyongyang's reluctance to definitively rule out future talks, the statement asserted that the DPRK is "in no hurry at all"--presumably, to foreclose avenues of dialogue with Washington--"even if the DPRK-U.S. talks are not held." In addition, in contrast to North Korean pronouncements on the inter-Korean talks (see following article), the statement, like previous pronouncements on Washington's policy, refrained from extreme polemical attacks on Washington. Pyongyang media also appeared to react with similar circumspection to recent statements by high U.S. officials criticizing the North. For example, monitored North Korean media so far have not reported or commented on CIA Director Woolsey's charges that Pyongyang has been exporting weapons of mass destruction, is supporting terrorism, and may already possess nuclear weapons (Yonhap, 18 March). Implications Pyongyang clearly prefers to deal only with Washington on the nuclear issue. However, it seems unwilling or unable to acknowledge that its own dilatory and confrontational tactics are damaging the prospects for the dialogue it is seeking. Pyongyang Breaks Off Talks With Seoul, Threatens War SUMMARY Accusing Seoul of engaging in pressure tactics, Pyongyang has abruptly broken off bilateral talks and issued threats of war- -threats that it subsequently appeared to moderate. North Korea apparently hopes to gain from what it sees as differences within the ROK Government and between Seoul and Washington on the nuclear issue. END SUMMARY The North came to Panmunjom on 19 March clearly prepared to break off the ongoing negotiations with the South on the exchange of presidential envoys. The North Korean chief delegate--identified in Seoul media as Pak Yong-su--not only reinstated demands that he had previously indicated would be retracted, but also insisted that the ROK Government "apologize" to all Koreans--a formulation Pyongyang had typically used in the past to signal its noninterest in dialogue with Seoul and Tokyo--this time for allegedly obstructing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks (Pyongyang radio, 19 March). The North's main complaint against the South focused on what Pak described as Seoul's "sudden change of attitude" toward adoption of "tough measures" against Pyongyang. In particular, Pak said that North Korea's pique was based on reports of the 17 March "high-level strategic meeting" in Seoul, which had reportedly discussed holding Team Spirit, the deployment of Patriot missiles, and international sanctions. Pak equated this alleged change in the South's attitude to "a grave crime" and claimed that it necessitated the reimposition of the four demands made earlier by the North--demands that Pak had previously admitted were "barriers" to envoy exchanges erected by Pyongyang itself. (The North had demanded that the South refrain from 1) staging large-scale nuclear exercises, 2) introducing new weapons, including the Patriot missile, and 3) using threats of international sanctions. The North had also demanded previously that 4) the South retract ROK President Kim Yong-nam's remarks about not shaking hands with North Korean officials.) Demand for Apology Signaling that Pyongyang is no longer interested in continuing dialogue with Seoul, Pak accused the South of having used the envoy exchange talks "solely" for the purpose of derailing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks. He went on to "strongly insist" that the South "frankly admit" this "dark intention" and "apologize before the nation." Attempting to place the onus of any breakdown of dialogue on the South, Pak further accused Seoul of having in effect adopted "a declaration of abandonment of the special envoys exchange, a declaration of an all-out confrontation with us, and a declaration of war." Pyongyang radio on 19 March depicted Pak as making his most provocative remarks only in response to remarks the South made at the 19 March session. According to the radio, the South side had said that should the envoy exchange talks be discontinued, "there is no knowing what danger would materialize." To this Pak reportedly replied, "Don't worry about it. What do you think the South is? If the North suffers damage, do you think the South will go unscathed?" Pak went on to pledge unspecified "immediate and decisive countermeasures of self-defense" in case "some powers impose sanctions on us or otherwise provoke us." The radio said Pak coupled his pledge with a "stern warning" not to take the North Korean threats lightly, quoting him as saying, "we do not know how to engage in idle talk. "(SEE NOTE) (NOTE: Seoul's government-run KBS-1 television on 19 March broadcast video recording of even more inflammatory remarks by Pak that were captured by closed-circuit television coverage of the meeting. In the video, Pak told his Southern counterpart, Song Yong-tae, to "give a careful consideration to the consequences of a war," and warned that "Seoul is not far from here. If war breaks out, it will turn into a sea of fire. Mr. Song, it will probably difficult for you, too, to survive." Pyongyang media have not been observed to report on this portion of Pak's remarks.) Moderation of Threats Pyongyang subsequently appeared to backpedal a bit on its threats of war. In a 21 March statement issued in the name of the North Korean delegation to the inter- Korean contacts, which again chastised the South for "suddenly" assuming what it described as a hardline stance, the North made only passing references to the possibility of war, implying instead that the downfall of the ROK government will come from revolt within the South (Pyongyang radio, 21 March). The statement warned the ROK to realize that "no dictators" in the South had "survived committing the antinational act of betraying fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces" and that "these flunkeyist, nation-sellers have met a bitter end." North Korean Motives Pyongyang may calculate that its brinksmanship will sufficiently split opinions within the South Korean government to make a firm stand against the North difficult. For the past few months, Seoul media reporting on relations with the North has indicated that there are serious divisions within the Seoul government over how to deal with Pyongyang. The latest of these indications came shortly after a 12 March inter-Korean meeting. The Seoul daily Hanguk Ilbo on 13 March cited an unnamed ROK "government official" as saying that the South and the United States "believe" that by failing to agree to the exchange of envoys with Seoul, Pyongyang had "unilaterally invalidated" an agreement reached with Washington on resuming high-level talks in Geneva later in the month. Apparently alarmed by the possible effects such remarks could have on the inter-Korean talks, other "government officials" were cited the next day by the South Korean news agency Yonhap as advocating a different approach (14 March). One of them was quoted as saying that Seoul should not consider it "a violation of the North Korea-U.S. agreement" even if North Korea "refused" the envoy exchange outright. All that would happen, he reportedly said, would be that "the date of the third round [U.S.-North Korea] meeting would be delayed" until the envoy exchange was realized. In addition, there has been intermittent South Korean reporting of a division of views between Seoul and Washington that could have emboldened Pyongyang. Most recently, for instance, Yonhap on 16 March cited Kim Tae-chung, a "retired" opposition leader and former presidential candidate, as "lashing out" at U.S. "hardliners" for allegedly jeopardizing lives of Koreans in their pursuit of confrontation with North Korea on the nuclear issue. Similarly, in an article datelined Washington, the Seoul daily Choson Ilbo on 13 March claimed that the U.S. Congress has concluded that differences between Washington and Seoul over how to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue are serving as a "stumbling block" in the U.S. Government's formulation of its policy toward Pyongyang--reporting that could have encouraged Pyongyang to reinforce its constant attempt to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. Outlook Pyongyang media treatment of the 19 March meeting seems aimed at portraying the North Korean leadership as fully prepared to face the worst case scenario. By declaring Pyongyang's willingness to destroy Seoul in a conflict, the North Korean leadership may hope to frighten officials in the South into advocating concessions and thus further aggravate a perceived division between the United States and South Korea.
