One hundred and fifteen [Russian] and 24 foreign vessels were inspected. Twenty [Russian] and four foreign vessels were cited for breach of fishing regulations. The offending [Russian] vessels were fined more than 200 million rubles. The Japanese fishing vessel was fined $15,385 and fishing permits of the three remaining foreign vessels were revoked.

Various resources, namely the Pacific Border District, the Pacific Fleet, Primorrybvod, Sakhalinrybvod, the Environment Protection Committee, Spetsmorinspektsiya [Special Maritime Inspection], as well as the Pacific Fleet and Border District aviation took part in the operation. The next stage of the operation is planned for the latter part of June.

Already, the customs and border troops in Korsakov, Sakhalin Oblast, early this morning detained two vessels engaged in the illegal transfer of crabs. They are both currently under investigation.
