Had there been a revolution, then we would like to know who the leaders of the revolution were. As far as the changes that happened then are concerned, we think that it was necessary to eliminate Nicolae Ceausescu and his totalitarian regime." Expressing his belief that the reform has failed because it was not managed in a qualified and competent way, the PSM president said that: "those who were in power and promoted the reform should not be judged because they enjoyed 66 percent of the votes of the electorate." The Social-Democrats -- who have been ruling so far -- have not understood that they have to change the basic concept of this reform. Social-democracy was discredited in Romania for a long time because of Roman (Petre, former prime minister and president of the Democratic Party) and Cunescu (Sergiu, president of the Social Democratic Party of Romania). We voted in favor of the IMF memorandum, Verdet said, although it is onerous and unjust toward our country, but we could not possibly vote with the right wing. However, we have achieved a compromise, namely, that the respective memorandum should not be approved by law, so the parliament is now free to reject it and ask for it to be renegotiated. "We told the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] members that they should solve the case of [former Defense Minister] Spiroiu and Pancea [accused of spying for the French secret services], because they need to show some moral character at least at the top, because Mitrea [Fratia Free TU Confederation vice president] and Ciorbea [Fratia Free TU Confederation president] understand only the language of money." As far as foreign policy is concerned, the PDM president said: "We have no business in a war together with the United States against Iraq. Even if Saddam is a dictator and the Iraqi people support him, that is their business. What was our justification to side with the United States and Israel in the blockade against Cuba? What are we doing in a war side by side with the United States in Somalia?"
