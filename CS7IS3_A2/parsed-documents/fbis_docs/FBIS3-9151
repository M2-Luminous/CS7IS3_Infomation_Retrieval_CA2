At present Albania is the only Balkan neighbor on whom we can rely, although even this is doubtful. There was no place from where the 37 billion leva requested by the Rakovski Officer Legion could come. Subsequently, the Defense Ministry will have to make do with what it has. Cuts are inevitable in such a situation. What is bad is that in such cases the proverb that while the fish begins to stink at the head they are beginning to clean it at the tail applies to Bulgaria. If the current army payroll does not change, even the Brazilians and Thais, who are proverbial for their "inflation" of higher military ranks, will begin to laugh at us. Today there are 22,000 officers, 27,000 sergeants, and 36,000 soldiers in the Bulgarian Army. In other words, for every soldier there is one payroll officer or sergeant. That is one aspect of the problem. The other is that the cuts of officers and sergeants that have been carried out created the suspicion that a political purge was under way, or more precisely a process of settling personal accounts and striving to survive on a political pretext. As a result there are not enough platoon and company commanders for combat units, while the headquarter offices are full. Now they say that the army must be cut 50 percent if it is to be maintained within the framework of the current budget. This, however, does not prevent new lists of high-ranking officers who should be promoted from being presented. At Slivnitsa the Bulgarian captains defeated the Serb generals. This means that the number of stars on the shoulder straps have nothing to do with the state of the army. As Clausewitz said, "victory is a result of the number of soldiers and the personal qualities of the officers." We do not have enough soldiers. We cannot even dream of having a professional army because of purely financial reasons. At least let us make sure that after the next cut the army manages to retain young and able officers rather than clerks and bureaucrats in uniform. Clerks are incapable of being in charge of defense, or God forbid, waging a war.
