Kenneth Williams, vice-president of McDonnel Douglas Aircraft Company (MD), made the statement while testifying on behalf of the ECAT at a hearing of the subcommittee on trade of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee beginning this afternoon. He also said that all the 60 ECAT members "strongly support the continuation of MFN trade status for China, which is a requisite for U.S. participation in the explosive growth in China's economy." Williams said that MD and the rest ECAT members are large U.S. firms with substantial overseas operations, which are among the country's largest exporters and employers. Worldwide annual sales of ECAT members are nearly one trillion U.S. dollars and ECAT members employ about five million workers, he said. "Increasing numbers of ECAT member companies are establishing business relations in China. It is a market of huge potential and prospective huge benefits for U.S. firms and workers," he said. He urged the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress to review the Jackson-Vanik Amendment enacted 20 years ago as part of the trade pact of 1974, which links trade with human rights in socialist countries. "For several years ECAT has recommended in testimony to Congress that the Jackson-Vanik Amendment be reviewed for the purpose of either eliminating it altogether or amending it to provide authority for long-term extensions of MFN trade status for periods of up to five years," he said. "Annual reviews of MFN create uncertainty for prospective investors." "Annual debates over MFN for China are increasingly contentious and pose serious long-term risks for American investors," he stressed. After recalling MD's cooperation with China, Williams said that "the withdrawal of MFN for China would fundamentally alter the U.S. economic and political position in China. There would be very substantial diminution in bilateral trade and in existing and future U.S. investments in China." He said American businesses "need the cooperation of our government" in meeting and beating global economic challenges." "Denying us the opportunity to play a meaningful role in competing for the enormous business opportunities in China will very much redound to the disadvantage of the United States," he said.
