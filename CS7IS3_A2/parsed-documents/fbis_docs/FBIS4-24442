Well-known economist Gao Shangquan, the institute's president, talked about the society's five major research topics for the future as he reviewed the actual conditions of the development of economic reform. --The way to properly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability. This is a problem which is very complicated and covers an extensive area. Correct decisions will be made only after systematic study by various quarters, careful comparisons, and the consideration of advantages and disadvantages. --The way to expedite the reform of state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. This is a weak link in China's economic reform, as well as a problem which must be earnestly solved as reform enters the current stage. --The way to further develop and cultivate the market system, especially sensitive markets, such as the securities market, the property rights market, the futures market, and the real estate market. Not only are there different concepts and understandings, but there is also a certain degree of risk, and, if this work is not done properly, the system can become a venue where some people engage in purely speculative activities. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out thorough research on how to unswervingly, healthily, and systematically develop the market economy. --The way to properly carry out reform of the wage and social insurance systems. Reform in this area involves the immediate interests of millions of people and has a great degree of difficulty and risk; therefore, it is necessary to adopt active and prudent principles, win popular understanding and a consensus, then promote them step by step in a planned manner. --The way to promote the smooth implementation of the macroeconomic reform measures that have been announced for this year and to achieve the transformation of government functions as soon as possible. The Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System has been in existence for 11 years. The members of the executive committee of the society include a large number of experienced economists and officials in charge of economic matters. The current annual meeting in Haikou, the first meeting of the third executive committee of the society, will elect a new group of executive committee members. Li Tieying and Wang Shiyuan, minister and vice minister respectively of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; An Shiwen, president of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System, and Zhou Taihe and Tong Dalin, the two vice presidents of the society; Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu and Hainan Deputy Party Secretary Du Qinglin, attended the meeting along with approximately 180 experts and officials.
