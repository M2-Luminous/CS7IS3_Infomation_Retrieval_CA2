This ceremony followed a different pattern. For instance, this was the first time President Carlos Salinas did not attend the ceremony. In addition, photographs of the incumbent president as the first PRI member of Mexico or other PRI founders were not displayed at the site of the ceremony as was done previously at commemorations of this type. The only photograph of President Salinas was displayed on a building next to the Monument to the Revolution -- the PRI Regional Movement Building. Except for Health Secretary Jesus Cumate and some undersecretaries, no cabinet members attended the ceremony. Colosio arrived with PRI President Fernando Ortiz Arana. There was no preamble prior to Colosio's arrival, which even surprised PRI members. Colosio was the only one on the stage and waited only for the introduction by the master of ceremonies to begin his speech. In his speech, Colosio referred to the relationship between the PRI and the government. He said that in light of the elections, the PRI only asks for impartiality from the government. He emphasized that the times of political competition in the country have ended any presumptions regarding the presence of a state party. [Colosio] "When the government has sought to monopolize political initiative, it has weakened the PRI. This is why today, in light of the elections, the PRI only demands from the government impartiality and firmness in the application of the law. We do not want concessions that are not based on votes or votes outside the law. [applause] Let us not seek to replace the responsibilities of the government, but let us not seek either to have the government fulfill the duties that only concern the PRI as a party. Today we are facing a genuine contest. The government will not give us the victory. It will only be the product of our work, our effort, and our dedication." Later, Colosio pointed out that it would be very difficult to explain modern-day Mexico without considering the PRI's contributions. That is why, he said, those who argue that Mexico's democratic transformation demands the PRI's disappearance are mistaken. [Colosio] "We offer change with direction, responsibility, peace, and tranquility. Those who believe that Mexico's democratic transformation demands the PRI's disappearance are wrong. Indeed we have made our mistakes, but it would be very difficult to explain modern-day Mexico without considering the PRI's contributions. This is why, despite our defamers and the criticism of our adversaries, we are proud to be PRI members." Continuing with the electoral topic, Colosio said that the PRI will participate in the 21 August elections with total respect for Mexico's multiparty system. He stressed that there will only be one winner that day, and added that only the clear and unobjectionable victory of the Mexican people will be acceptable. [Colosio] "For the Mexican people to obtain a victory on 21 August, all political parties will have to abide by the law, without advantages granted to anyone, prepotency, abuse, or arbitrary actions. That is why, and in accordance with my demand for a democratic election, I hope Congress will implement the necessary electoral reforms based as always on the agreements parties have achieved within the framework of the Agreement for Peace, Justice, and Democracy signed on 27 January." Luis Donaldo Colosio commented on the participation of observers in the elections. He said one must not look at them with fear. [Colosio] "The election belongs to society. For that reason, it cannot be a closed matter. Its pristine nature demands the participation of observers and does not preclude our citizens and visitors from abroad from giving a very thorough account of it. There is no reason at all to look with fear at those who wish to become acquainted with the nature of our democratic processes. Our elections -- and I am saying this with full conviction -- will have nothing shameful to hide." Referring to the topic of Chiapas in his speech, Colosio said this situation appeals to the conscience of all Mexicans. He noted, however, that this proposal for change is not limited to Chiapas but covers all Mexicans. [Colosio] "We want to keep our promises to Chiapas residents and also to Mexicans in Laguasteca, La Laguna, the mountains in Guerrero State, the northern mountain range in Puebla State, [name indistinct] and Alvaro Obrergon's Barranca, the Federal District, Ciudad Juarez's (Anapra) Port in Chihuahua State, Guadalajara's Insurgentes Neighborhood in Jalisco State, and Monterrey's Bernabe area in Nuevo Leon State." The candidate commended the Mexican Army. [Colosio] "Our institution proved its legitimacy and efficiency, emerging stronger from the solution to the conflict. From this dais I convey my words of praise to the Mexican Army for its patriotism, loyalty, and selflessness in defending national interests and unity." Colosio criticized the attitude of PRI members regarding the Chiapas conflict. [Colosio] "PRI members must reflect on Chiapas. As the party of stability and social justice, it shames us to feel we were not sensitive to the major demands of our communities, we were not next to them in their aspirations, we were not up to the commitment they expected from us." To conclude, the PRI candidate stressed that the main thing he is proposing with change is change with responsibility, where no area of the country's life is forgotten. He reaffirmed his commitment to head the new phase of change in Mexico. [Colosio] "With firmness, conviction, and full confidence I say: I want to be president of Mexico to head this new phase of change in Mexico!" [applause]
