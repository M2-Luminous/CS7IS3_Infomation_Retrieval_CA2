No army bases are being closed in the coming year, but the rapid reaction force will be cut by at least half, severely reducing South Africa's ability to project force in a crisis or extend help in the form of foreign peace-keeping missions, say defence force spokesmen. Training programmes are being shrunk and annual large-scale conventional battle exercises may be cancelled this year. An across-the-board decision to put a hold on major equipment- development programmes short of commitment to orders will hit the already stressed defence industry. In addition to the R650-million contribution, the SANDF is expected to provide a further "in kind" donation to the RDP in the form of engineering equipment and training resources worth about R350-million. Discussions on these provisions began in May, but were postponed because the government could not identify specific requirements. The funding cut defied a defence headquarters bottom-line spelt out in a crisp policy document issued before the Budget, "that a further reduction in defence spending is not feasible". The reduction is a clear signal to hawks that they can expect their wings to be clipped still further in line with public expectations and world trends. In the document, defence force chief General Georg Meiring outlines reduced armoured vehicle and unacceptable anti-aircraft capabilities, halted production of the G6 cannon and drastic cuts in air power were already undermining the SANDF's ability to ensure the country's defence. Acknowledging that the absence of a foreseeable threat within five years only demands low force levels, the SANDF's final word is that "defence spending will have to increase in future years." With plans to increase RDP allocations progressively from departmental savings coupled to expected integration costs remaining at least R1-billion until 1997 and the still-to-be-calculated costs of retrenchments at senior level, it is difficult to see where the generals expect extra money to be found. Lieutenant-General B.S. Raubenheimer, SANDF Chief of Staff, Finances, says the funding cuts of 50 percent over the past six years have reduced the military to an "affordable force".
