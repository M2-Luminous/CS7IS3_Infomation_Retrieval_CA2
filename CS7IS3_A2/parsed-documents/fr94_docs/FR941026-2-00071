Title: Voluntary Customer Survey to Implement Executive Order (E.O.) 12862. OMB approval number: 1006&hyph;**** Abstract: On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued E.O. 12862. Among the directives of the E.O. was the requirement that agencies ``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing services.'' As expressed in this E.O., customer satisfaction is seen as the ultimate performance indicator for the Federal Government because it shows how well our customers are being served and what we must do to close the ``gap'' between what we provide our customers and what they want. Plans are to use a variety of voluntary ``survey instruments'' that will include both quantitative and qualitative written surveys, telephone exchanges, point-of-contact questionnaires, focus groups, etc. Bureau form number: None. Frequency: Ongoing. Description of respondents: Individuals from the related water and electrical service utilities, i.e., Federal, State, and local entities, Native Americans, universities, the press, environmental groups, the legal community, consultants, and the general public. Estimated completion time: 1/2 hour. Annual response: 5,000. Annual burden hours: 2,500. Bureau clearance officer: Marilyn Rehfeld, 236&hyph;6769 extension 259. Dated: September 13, 1994.
