Kuchma, currently leading the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Businessmen, met during his one week tour of the United States with Vice-President Albert Gore, the Commerce Secretary's Assistant Andrew Summers, and a number of eminent senators. "This trip has changed my attitude to U.S. lawmakers," Kuchma said. In his words, American Administration officials regard Ukraine as a state rather than single out any Ukrainian leader. He said that during his meeting with the International Monetary Fund's President Camdessus, the IMF leader made it clear that the Foundation will not help Ukraine unless it sees a leadership that means business rather than words there. "If people in East and West alike see positive processes underway, they will rally around them," said Kuchma, who is a registered candidate to the Ukrainian presidency. Presidential elections in Ukraine will take place on 26 June.
