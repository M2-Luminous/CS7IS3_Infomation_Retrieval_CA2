Delegations from the two sides were supposed to meet early Tuesday at the west Kabul headquarters of the Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat faction, but a spokesman there told AFP Hekmatyar had insisted on the attendance of representatives of his ex-communist ally, Uzbek General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. "Rabbani's people refuse to sit down with any one from Dostam," said the Wahdat official. Dostam was allied to Rabbani until January this year, when he launched a failed coup attempt against the president, supported by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction. Inconclusive fighting has raged in Kabul for nearly six months since. Jalil Shams, the deputy foreign minister and special peace mediator, went Tuesday to Hekmatyars's Chahar Asiab headquarters outside Kabul to try and persuade the prime minister to change his stance over Dostam, the Wahdat official said. But, the Wahdat official said that to ignore the Junbish party of Dostam was "to kill any chance for a successful solution" to the problems in Afghanistan. "Junbish is a real power in Afghanistan and must be included in peace talks," he said. The hoped-for Kabul talks between Rabbani and Hekmatyar are described as a "preliminary" session to a larger conference proposed by Sham's peace mission in the western provincial capital Herat, to which all faction leaders -- except Dostam -- have been invited. The idea of the Herat conference is to set up an interim government to run the country after the end of June, when Hekmatyar and others expect Rabbani's presidency to end. But Rabbani's followers steadfastly refuse to admit that the president must resign at the end of June. At the Intercontinental Hotel Tuesday Rabbani attended a special conference of supporters who insisted the president only hand over power to a national assembly or Loya Jirga. "We demand the president remain in power until the convening of a grand national assembly," declared Ahmad Hashmi, chief of the Islamic Brotherhood and Reconciliation Front. "Only by this way can we avoid a power vacuum," Hashmi said. "Leaving the country without a president, even for one day, is total madness," said another speaker. Rabbani himself, in a half-hour speech, ignored the subject of his resignation but declared his support for the Herat talks on the condition that all factions were represented. However, the president stressed that the faction leaders should not monopolise power but allow the Afghan people to decide their future -- presumably a call for an immediate national assembly without a preliminary interim government as proposed by the Herat peace commission.
