Indeed, violent demonstrations were organized by people armed with cutlasses, knives, sticks, cutting and thrusting weapons, and even (?pistols). This occurred at a time when an authorized rally of opposition parties grouped within an undeclared body -- the coordinating committee of the democratic forces -- was taking place [words indistinct] when the said demonstrations started in several areas of the city [words indistinct]. This rally, which was also attended by officials and members of [words indistinct] which is neither declared nor registered, and therefore an illegal movement, was an opportunity for the organizers to incite people to the violence that marked the events we witnessed yesterday afternoon in the central part of Dakar and its suburb. The security forces, the police, the gendarmerie, and the National Army, with the support of the fire department, demonstrated courage and determination to restore and maintain public order, which was under serious challenge, and to ensure the safety of goods and property [words indistinct]. The balance sheet of the demonstrations is [words indistinct]. The demonstrators showed their desire to destroy everything in their way. As I speak to you, several seriously injured persons have been admitted to various hospitals in Dakar. They are all members of the public security forces. On behalf of the president of the Republic, the government, and all of you, I pay my respects to those who died in carrying out their sacred duty, that of ensuring our security and our tranquillity. The head of state has decided that they should be decorated as knights of the national Order of the Lion. They are: Moustapha Diane, warrant officer; Ibrahima Said, policeman; Dauda Ndour, police sergeant; and Abou Han, policeman; and El Hadj Soubou Tek, warrant officer. On behalf of the head of state and the government, I would like to (?state) that the families of these policemen who died on active service will not be forgotten. One demonstrator who has yet to be identified is also [words indistinct]. More than 30 demonstrators were arrested and are being interrogated. The initial results of these investigations have shown precisely who were the instigators and the perpetrators of these criminal acts of vandalism which the government has already condemned. Indeed, it was a plan cleverly designed to sow terror, demoralize the security forces, destroy property acquired by peaceful citizens, and, in culmination, try to destabilize the democratic institutions which the Senegalese people [words indistinct]. This is why we have every reason to consider the instigators of this plan and those who have carried it out as the declared adversaries of the democratic and law-abiding state, which guarantees liberties and human rights. The instigators and perpetrators of the criminal acts that occurred yesterday afternoon have decided to engage in trying to destroy the time-consuming work patiently done by the Senegalese people, particularly the democratic forces which they make up and which are symbolized today by a democratic and secular republic. What I would like to say this evening on behalf of the government, first of all to the instigators and perpetrators of the disturbances, is that their plan is henceforth known (?at least by the security forces), who have been ordered to continue to carry out their sacred mission with the greatest firmness and unflinching determination. The government will spare no efforts in strengthening the means of action, intervention, and search of our security forces, whose courage and patriotism should be (?lauded). Thus, they will continue to carry out their duty at the service of the nation with all necessary efficiency. I also solemnly reaffirm to you, dear compatriots, and to each family the government's determination to assume all its responsibilities, by ensuring your individual and collective security as well as the free movement of people and the protection of (?property). To this end, all the appropriate measures were taken yesterday evening -- I mean during the night -- (?to consolidate) [words indistinct] banning all activities throughout the country of the illicit and illegal movement of (Mushashidin Wal Mushashidadi). [words indistinct]. Instructions have been given to the administrative authorities to close immediately all (?centers) usually used by this movement for meetings [words indistinct] which are banned throughout the country, pending the result of the legal action initiated against its (?members). Other similar measures will certainly be taken in the coming hours to render harmless those who seek to undermine the foundation of our political system, which is the collective work of the democrats and those who profoundly believe in the values of tolerance and peace. Together, that is the people and each of (?you) -- you who only aspire to live in peace in a united country, profoundly committed to freedom -- and the authorities, we will act, as societies with democratic political systems know how to do, by trusting our institutions. Finally and on behalf of the government, I would like to reaffirm our desire and our resolute determination to have the state's authority respected. This state will assume all its functions with more firmness and vigor, particularly the security of people and goods, of which it is the guarantor. In this regard, I am convinced that the state can count on the patriotic mobilization and commitment of citizens yearning for peace, justice, and freedom so that Senegal, our country, remains the democratic country respected by the world -- a country whose legal character is symbolized by the law-abiding state that we have built within the framework of a strong nation of solidarity. I thank you for your kind attention.
