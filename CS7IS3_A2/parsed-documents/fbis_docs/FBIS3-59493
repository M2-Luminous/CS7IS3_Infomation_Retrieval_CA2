As of 1 January 1994 and for a period of five years, he will be the Center's director general. The 51-year-old British professor succeeds Italian Carlo Rubbia as the head of the European particle physics laboratory. Smith, who is chief of Oxford University's Physics Department, has always been closely involved with developments in particle accelerator physics, a science which investigates the smallest elements of matter. He was one of the advocates of the Hamburg-based HERA electron-proton collider and contributed to the definition of research priorities through the CERN's Scientific Directions Committee.
