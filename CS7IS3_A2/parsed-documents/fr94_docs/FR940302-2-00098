FR940302-2-00098 FR940302-2-00071 [CGD02&hyph;94&hyph;008] Special Local Regulations; Annual Marine Events Within the Second Coast Guard District AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is announcing the exact dates, times and locations for those annual marine events that will occur in the Second Coast Guard District in 1994. The Coast Guard has previously published a list of marine events which occur annually in the Second Coast Guard District, which were codified at 33 CFR 100.201. However, because the exact dates, times and locations of these events change from year to year, 33 CFR 100.201 contains only approximate dates and locations. ADDRESSES: For additional information about any of the events listed in the table below, or to be placed on a mailing list for notices about annual marine events within the Second Coast Guard District, write to Commander (oan), Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63103&hyph;2832. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LTJG D.R. Dean, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri, 63103&hyph;2832. The telephone number is (314) 539&hyph;3971. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Various public and private organizations sponsor marine events, which are scheduled to occur on an annual basis, on navigable waters of the United States within the Second Coast Guard District. However, the exact date, time and location of each event varies from year to year. The table below gives the exact dates, times and locations for those annual marine events, scheduled to occur in 1994, which are listed in 33 CFR 100.201. It should be noted that this list is not a complete list of all marine events that will occur in the Second Coast Guard District. It does not include events which the District Commander has determined do not require establishment of regulations for the safety of life and property on or adjacent to navigable waters. It also does not include non-annual events or events which have been scheduled in time for this publication. The events listed in Table One include slow-moving boat parades, raft races, high-speed hydroplane races, steamboat races, fireworks displays, and other water-related events. The nature of each event is such that special local regulations are deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life and property on and adjacent to navigable waters during the events. During these events the river may be closed during portions of the effective periods to all vessel traffic except participants, official regatta vessels and patrol craft. Actual river closures will not exceed three hours in duration at any one time for events that last longer than four hours. Sponsors requiring more than three hours for their event will provide a suitable break for vessel traffic to transit the regulated area. Mariners will be afforded enough time between closure periods to transit the area. Table One 1.
