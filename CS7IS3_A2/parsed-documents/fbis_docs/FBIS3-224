About 80 percent of the force went on strike on Tuesday, and many left the base because they did not receive the top scale for their rank as promised earlier. A force spokesman said many of the deserters have returned. He said every day lost could have a disruptive effect since it was affecting the training of the troops, which was now in its final stages.
