The deteriorated "dual political power" crisis, involving the pro-radical-reform government and the rebel parliament, was culminated in a bloody October incident in Moscow and the Moscow authorities were totally taken aback by the outcome of the new parliamentary elections in mid-December. President Boris Yeltsin came to the conclusion a week ago that all the people have again come to see how complicated and contradictory the situation is in this country. On the surface, the bloody incident in October seemed to be the result of the white-hot dispute on power distribution between the parliament and the president. In essence, it reflected the profound and irreconcilable differences existing in the society in general regarding economic reform, the state political system and the state foreign policy. Although the use of armed force brought an end to the "dual political power," it cannot in any way resolve the piled-up social problems. The December 12 referendum and the results of the ensuing parliamentary elections indicated that while Yeltsin's supporters, the so-called "reformers," have been somewhat weakened due to the surfacing of their internal bickering, the opposition has gained some strength, and the resentment among the people is growing. President Yeltsin himself admitted that "people have to a large extent lost their forbearance." The new state constitution, designed to affirm presidential rule, has been adopted, but the supporting rate of the voters for the president has declined from 42.7 percent of the registered voters in the presidential election in June 1991, to the 37.7 percent in the April national referendum and further down to a mere 30 percent in the vote on the new constitution. Although a new parliament has emerged, it is not at all the one the president hoped for. In the race for seats in the State Duma among various political parties, the Liberal Democrats led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy obtained 22.79 percent of the votes, while the so-called "presidential party," "Russia's Choice," garnered a mere 15.38 percent. Noteworthy is the fact that as many as one third of military servicemen reportedly supported the Liberal Democrats. The parliamentary election results showed that the three opposition parties -- the Russian Communist Party, the Agrarian Party and the Liberal Democratic Party -- reaped a total of 43.04 percent of the votes, while the three factions of the ruling "democratic reformers" won only 29.97 percent. People might differ over the reasons for the defeat of the reformers, but one can hardly deny the fact that the election results represented an objective reaction of the voters to the existing internal and external policies. First, the majority of voters are not in favor of the radical economic reform, the "shock therapy." in the April referendum, 50.2 percent of the voters backed the president and the government's reform policy. But in the December parliamentary elections, only 15.38 percent of the voters sided with "Russia's Choice" led by Yegor Gaydar, a typical representative of the radical reformers, and backed by President Yeltsin. Second, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union over two years ago, Russia has pursued a foreign policy of "assimilating to Western civilized society" and "returning to Europe," which many Russians accuse of having resulted in "loss of national dignity" and "damage to national interests." Calls for an independent foreign policy in relations with the West are growing in Russia and this helped the Liberal Democrats pick up a considerable number of additional votes in the parliamentary elections as they explicitly pointed to the urgent need to safeguard Russia's national interests. Third, the psychological impact the bloody October incident had on the Russians and the varied attitudes of the people toward the incident were also accordingly reflected in the results of the elections. On how the situation in Russia will develop in the future, the pro-government newspaper, "IZVESTIYA," on December 22, had this to say, "The post-election political reality is more worrying than the passage of the new constitution." The "ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI" added on December 24 that the election results "have virtually crushed the illusion about the possible alleviation of Russia's political tension," and "serve as the basis for prediction of confrontation between the new parliament and the executive branch of the state power." In face of the post-election new situation, President Yeltsin has pledged to stabilize the situation in general, promote reform, carry out partial readjustment and make changes accordingly in organization and in personnel. Meanwhile, he has also expressed his readiness to cooperate with all the parties that have been elected into the parliament within the framework of the new constitution. Observers here predict complicated and delicate relations between the president and the new parliament in the new year. It is widely believed that the key to stability in the country lies in a substantial improvement of the economy -- the emergence of a realistic government economic policy, the restoration and development of production and an early apparent improvement in people's life.
