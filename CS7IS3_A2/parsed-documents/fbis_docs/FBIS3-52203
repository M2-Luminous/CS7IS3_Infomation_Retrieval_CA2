But other analysts, who look deeper into issues, believe that despite such an agreement still no clear outlook can be seen in the U.S.-North Korean relations and no end can be seen to the crisis in the Korean peninsula. Those analysts believe that the strain in ties between America and North Korea does not end with the issues of the inspection of the North Korean nuclear installations and ending of the U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers. The problem is that America, within the framework of the theory of the new world order, does not want any country but those which support U.S. interests to have access to nuclear arms. At the same time, North Korea believes that this American strategy is against its security and national interests. A more worrying point is that there are still a number of the so-called minor differences that could expand into bigger differences in the two countries' relations at any moment. Pyongyang is concerned that after the inspection of the North Korean nuclear installations, Washington will continue its hostile policies to bring North Korea in line with U.S. policies, as it has done in the case of many other countries. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly inspected Iranian nuclear installations and has assessed its inspections as positive and believes that Iran is using nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. Yet at the same time, America has repeatedly accused Iran of using it for military purposes. Pessimism over the agreements reached between Washington and Pyongyang became more evident when North Korean President Kim Il-sung yesterday announced that even though such agreements can solve the existing differences on North Korean nuclear plans to a certain extent, any kind of pressure or intimidation by America can end in disaster. Such a warning is a reply to developments that may take place during the agreement or afterward. This comes at a time when Sam Nunn, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, announced during a recent television interview that if North Korea insists on keeping its nuclear weapons America will put North Korea in such political and military isolation that after a time all its economy and regime will collapse. Such an announcement, even as a mere threat, shows how the existence of a socialist country with an anti-American nature cannot be easily tolerated by Washington. In any case, the insistence of the two sides on keeping their positions has so far prevented the achievement of a final solution to the existing differences, and as long as America does not respond positively to requests made by North Korea, it seems unlikely that an agreement can be easily reached, particularly as during the nine months of crisis in the relations between America and North Korea relations, Pyongyang has shown the necessary flexibility.
