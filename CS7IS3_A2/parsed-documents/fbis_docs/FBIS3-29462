However, foreign currency remittance from abroad, a "major financial source" for Secretary Kim Chong-il, stopped recently and rumors have it that "something unusual" has happened to him. In addition, it is observed that his power as heir apparent to President Kim Il-song has waned. Since the beginning of this year, South Korean firms and Korean firms affiliated with the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], that have been engaged in trade with North Korea, have revealed that foreign currency remittances from abroad to Secretary Kim Chong-il have stopped. According to a source in Seoul, the "No. 39 Office" of the Financial Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, which handles Secretary Kim Chong-il's personal finance, has been closed recently. There is an unconfirmed report that Choe Su-kil, chief of the office, president of the Taesung Bank, and a confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il, has been dismissed. The "No. 39 Office," a secret organ more usually referred to as the "party Central Committee No. 39 office," was a personal safe for Secretary Kim Chong-il. The office collected and managed proceeds from the exports of weapons and "loyal contributions" made by North Korea's overseas organizations, including the Chongnyon and North Korean diplomats posted to foreign nations. The office managed funds with the Taesung Bank (in Pyongyang) and the Kumsong Bank (in Vienna) under its financial control. The office, which controlled the "party economy" independent of the government, was a source of financial power for Secretary Kim to help him solidify the foundation of his succession as president. South Korean firms are believed to have contacted Choe Su-kil, chief of the "No. 39 Office," and other officials with its Beijing office, to prepare for future business deals with North Korea. Some take the view that the closure of the "No. 39 Office" is connected to the recent downfall of former Deputy Premier and State Planning Committee Chairman Kim Tal-hyun, who operated as a contact point with South Korean firms as a confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il. Over the past few years bribery has been pervasive and the corruption conspicuous among officials in charge of handling foreign currency. In addition, whistle-blowing heightened distrust among these officials while other officials close to Secretary Kim were subject to disciplinary action. All of this action is seen as responsible for the closure of "No. 39 Office." President Kim Il-song, father of Secretary Kim, was the only person in North Korea who could close the office. This kind of "reprimand" of Secretary Kim can be seen as part of moves by President Kim Il-song to govern North Korea by himself. Meanwhile there has been a change in the North Korean leadership, with Kim Yong-chu, a member of the Political Bureau and younger brother of President Kim Il-song, being reinstated as deputy president last year after 18 years of obscurity. In this way, the Kim family has been mobilized to keep the North Korean system in place. President Kim Il-song is said to have made no mention of Secretary Kim during a meeting with the Rev. Billy Graham, creating the impression that Secretary Kim's power has waned. North Korea hailed its decision to pull out of the nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) last March as a "decision by Secretary Kim." But President Kim Il-song now appears to be trying to deal personally with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development.
