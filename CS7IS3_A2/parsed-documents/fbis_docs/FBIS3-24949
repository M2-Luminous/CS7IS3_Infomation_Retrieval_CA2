Writing in his Innes Labour Brief, Innes argues that COSATU would have 20 of its leaders occupying seats in parliament and at least one, Jay Naidoo, in a key ministerial post. "For this reason alone, labour relations will not be the same after elections as they were before. From being an anti-establishment force under apartheid, COSATU is about to become part of the new establishment," he writes. Being part of the establishment can be a mixed blessing for a radical organisation such as COSATU. "On one hand, it does confer certain clear advantages on the union movement, but it also brings with it responsibilities which might not be so palatable to the union's constituency," Innes says. Among the key advantages COSATU would derive from being part of the establishment is that instead of having to fight from a largely defensive position in the policy arena, it would now be in a position to make policy proposals for the country. He says the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme -- a crucial part of its development strategy -- was co-ordinated by Jay Naidoo. Alex Erwin of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa played a major role in the drafting of the programme. "The unions are no longer on the outside; they're on the inside of state policy formulation," Innes observes. Going hand in hand with the advantages will be disadvantages. "The ANC will be inheriting a country that has been ravaged by a lengthy and damaging recession, isolated from world trends, torn apart by political strife and bedevilled by social disorder and crime. Governing such a country is no easy task, especially people who have no experience of government. Consequently, the ANC government will find itself under massive pressures once it assumes power, and it will look to its allies for support," Innes says. Other difficulties would be that a person such as Jay Naidoo -- "the Minister of Reconstruction" -- would be asked by the Cabinet to secure union support for policies designed to keep the public sector wage bill under control. In caucus meetings, the COSATU MPs would be asked to use their influence to curb militant strike action among workers in the interests of promoting stability and order so as to attract foreign and local investment, Innes says.
