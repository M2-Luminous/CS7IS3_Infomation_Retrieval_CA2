FR940429-0-00235 FR940429-0-00015 The commenter who felt that a third-party servicer should not have to justify expenditure of its fee income is correct. Section 668.116(d) only requires proof that Title IV HEA program funds were properly expended. With respect to the comments on altering the time periods for submission of documentation by institutions, the Secretary notes that the purpose of this rulemaking it to make existing regulations applicable to third-party servicers and not to extensively modify the hearing procedures. The Secretary believes that the present procedures are consistent with an institution's record-keeping and fiduciary obligations; institution's complying with these obligations should have, and have had, no difficulty in meeting established deadlines. Further, requiring submission of documentation with a request for review allows cases to be resolved without hearing. With respect to the comment that hearing transcripts need only be provided to the hearing participants, the Secretary agrees. Further since the records of these proceedings are generally available under the Freedom of Information Act, the Secretary agrees that reference to availability under that act is unnecessary. Those who are not parties to the proceedings can request the transcript pursuant to that act, subject to any applicable exceptions to release of the requested information. Changes: Section 668.116(g)(2) is revise to require that the hearing transcript be sent only to the parties to the proceeding and eliminate the reference to the Freedom of Information Act. Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan Programs Subpart D_Guaranty Agency Programs Section 682.401␣Basic Program Agreement Comments: Several commenters suggested that the provision in this section relating to contract submissions be modified so that a third-party servicer would not be required to submit a copy of its contract to the Secretary unless so requested by the Secretary. Discussion: The Secretary understands the commenters concerns that the copy of a third-party servicer's contract with a guaranty agency contains proprietary information that the servicer does not wish to be made public. Many of the commenters were concerned that a copy of a third-party servicer's contract would be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Secretary wishes to assure third-party servicers that trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information is not releasable under FOIA. Parties concerned over possible release should, however, take appropriate precautions by marking submitted contracts as confidential. This provision is intended only to facilitate oversight and make the Secretary aware of all the services the third-party servicer has contracted to provide. Although many commenters believed that a third-party servicer could accomplish this by summarizing the services it has contracted to provide. In order to verify this information, the Secretary would need a copy of the actual contract. Therefore, the Secretary has decided to retain this requirement in the final rule. Changes: None. Section 682.413␣Remedial Actions Comments: Several commenters objected to a third-party servicer being held jointly and severally liable for any interest benefits and special allowance its client received on its FFELP loan portfolio when the servicer may not have been responsible for billing the Department for such monies. Some commenters believed that clarification to this provision is necessary to ensure that a third-party servicer is not held jointly or severally liable for any violations which it did not commit. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a third-party servicer should not be held responsible for any program violations it did not commit. The regulations do not hold a third-party servicer jointly or severally liable for any interest benefits or special allowance received by a lender for which the lender was not eligible if that servicer complied with program regulations. However, a third-party servicer that is not responsible for billing the Department for interest benefits and special allowance may be responsible for the lender receiving interest benefits and special allowance for which the lender is not eligible because the servicer has violated other program requirements. The Secretary believes that a third-party servicer should be responsible for its actions and that holding a third-party servicer potentially liable for Federal monies expended because it has committed program violations helps accomplish this. The Secretary also believes that holding lenders and servicers jointly and severally liable is the best way to protect the Federal fiscal interest. See prior discussion on this issue under §668.25 and in the February 17, 1994 NPRM. The Secretary is sensitive that this provision makes a significant change in how responsibility for liabilities may be covered in contracts that servicers enter with lenders. Therefore, the Secretary has established an order in which he will attempt to collect such liabilities. The Secretary will first attempt to collect such liabilities from the lender and, if necessary, offset the lender's first future claim to the Secretary for interest benefits and special allowance for the amount of the liability. The Secretary believes that this is the most effective and efficient means to collect a liability and that he will be successful in collecting from the lender in most cases. However, the situation may arise when the Secretary is not able to collect these monies from a lender because the lender chooses not to submit further claims, discontinues its participation in the FFEL programs, or becomes insolvent and is taken over by banking regulators. Because such circumstances may arise, the Secretary retains the option of holding a third-party servicer jointly and severally liable with a lender for such liabilities. However, the Secretary intends to exercise his authority to collect a liability from a third-party servicer under this provision only when he is unable to collect such monies from the lender. Changes: The Secretary has revised this provision so that the Secretary will not attempt to collect interest benefits or special allowance from a third-party servicer unless the Secretary is unable to collect from the lender with which the servicer has contracted. Comments: Several commenters asked the Secretary to clarify this section to specify when the 30-day period begins that determines when a lender must repay or make satisfactory arrangements to repay a liability resulting from a third-party servicer's action before the Secretary will attempt to collect from the servicer. Several commenters also suggested that the Secretary should attempt to collect such monies by offsetting a lender's claim for interest benefits and special allowance. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters that clarification is needed. The Secretary also agrees with the commenters that offsetting a lender's bill for interest benefits and special allowance for the amount of the liability may prove to be an effective means to collect the liability from the lender. The Secretary will exercise this option to collect such liabilities from a lender whenever he believes this method is in the best interests of the FFEL programs and the Federal fiscal interest.
