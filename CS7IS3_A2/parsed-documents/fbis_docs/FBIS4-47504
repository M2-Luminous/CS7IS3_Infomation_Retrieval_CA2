Nakhmanson under the ``Signal Processing'' rubric; received Dec 20,1991; UDC 621.396.96] [Abstract] The objective of the work was to analyze the effect of time scale transformation (TST) of envelopes of signals reflected off moving targets on detection characteristics when target velocities and bases of sounding signals increase. An expression for determining losses of the probability of correct detection due to not taking into account the TST coefficient of envelopes of detected signals relative to the probability of correct detection in the case of optimum processing is derived. As expected, when TSTs of detected signals are not taken into account detection characteristics deteriorate. The derived results make it possible to determine the relationship between deterioration of moving target detection characteristics when of detected signals of envelopes of detected signals are not taken into account during processing on signal compression factors and target velocities.
