There would seem to be few alternatives, but the choice is by no means evident. I will not undertake to list all the causes which reflect and imply weakness and instability in respect of the democratic process, but I would like to draw attention to a few. First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that the democratic process has not yet harnessed to itself all those people who are notable for their autonomous position, merit, stable view of life, and their advanced abilities to evaluate something in terms of deeds, rather than words. By dint of their very being, these people -- let's call them "critically reasoning figures" -- have always been pushed aside from power and the solution of social problems by an authoritarian bureaucracy, as they did not acknowledge the rules of the political game being proposed. But even now, and moreover on the very same grounds, many of them have still not become respected or even equal components of the democratic process. Once again they have proved unacceptable because from the very start of democratic reforms they argued the need for a balanced and serious approach, gradualness, and rational and systematic actions, for gearing oneself toward the interests of the majority of people, for a differentiated and honest approach to the past, both distant and recent, for morality in politics, and many other significant social values. People of this mold have long warned of the danger of "accelerated" changes without due account of their social consequences, the unacceptability of rushing headlong across the entire "front line," and the impossibility of relying on false stereotypes, such as the claim that "it is necessary to create rich people, and then the rich people will make the whole country rich." But few heard them, and they were ever more frequently accused of conservatism, backwardness, a failure to understand the processes and...they were cast out from democracy. So it is that many of them remained in the wings. To the detriment of democracy. Moreover, it is impossible not to see that to this day the democratic process is somewhat cautiously and timidly based on science. It "trusts" only certain, staid elements, who were always geared toward power and prepared to serve any system for the sake of obtaining a portfolio. It is with equal success that they praised socialism, as indeed they reject it today. Suspicion is aroused by the fact that during the election campaign, for instance, the staid elements of one and the same branch of knowledge "split" into dozens of blocs, as if there can exist dozens of truths in one and the same science, on one and the same subject. Hence the selective nature of the approach to proposed recommendations, the tendency to select from the them only that which is politically "beneficial" to somebody, and the orientation toward certain one-sided postulates. As a result, in the policy and practise of state administration there is much in the way of subjectivist improvisation, actions geared to the moment and not to the future, "flitting" from one side to the other, servility in the face of some foreign model or other, a solicitation of "advice" from one visiting authority after another without due consideration of the fact that he represents the interests and views of that structure which sent him. Naturally, all this impacts on the country's development and it does not in fact advance reforms. And if we are talking about the latest election campaign "performances," scientific know-how in the sphere of social psychology was employed by the democrats according to the principle of "whatever it says, do the opposite." After actions like that, were the results of the Federal Assembly elections really so surprising? And there is yet another aspect which abruptly catches the eye as a consequence of the foregoing factors: The depressing incompetence and aggressive ignorance of many of those who were swept into the offices of power on the wave of democratic reforms and who now set themselves up as a buttress of democracy. Instead of studying, trying to get to grips with the science, art, and experience of administration, closely watching what and how experienced people in other countries of the world do it, honestly analyzing the consequences of their deeds, decisions, and actions, such people found nothing better to do than to get drunk on power, to engage in their own pet development projects, and to organize "battles" for the most influential positions. It is their fault that a converse situation has arisen whereby state power is often used not to resolve the country's major problems, but to satisfy the ambitious aspirations of those who have acceded to power. Moreover, this type of thing is already done quite openly, in the public eye -- they do not shy away from it, nor do they fear it, but, on the contrary, they are proud of it. Does this mean that it is "permissible"? But given that incompetence makes itself known, and that sooner or later it becomes obvious -- thanks, in fact, to the failure to resolve vital problems -- the incompetent periodically "seek out" culprits responsible for their own lack of talent, be this in the form of the apparatus which is allegedly putting the brakes on reforms, or in the form of former partyocrats apparently distorting reforms, or the regional elite which pursues its own mercenary interests, or nationalist forces which do not understand the advantages of an integral state, or the director, or the farmer, or whoever. In the years of Soviet power, indeed prior to the revolution even, a great deal of "experience" had accumulated in respect of the quest for enemies, so there is no need to devise anything new here, it is sufficient to recall famous times gone by. In brief, there are many symptoms which give rise to alarm over the fate of the democratic path toward the development of the fatherland. No doubt it is time to take something of a new look at the bases and capacities of the democratic process, and not only to strengthen the substance and efficiency of the reforms under way, but also to update significantly the basic lineup of reformers, and to bring into it those professionally trained, morally pure people who for whatever reason are still "in obscurity." Not because they oppose the democratic process: They do support it, but they will not accept those methods, means, and forms via which this process is unfurling. There was a time when the October cause was saved by the involvement therein of so-called bourgeois elements. Something like this needs to be done now: It is necessary to draw into the democratic process all those who value Russia and hold it close to their heart. The development and appearance of infamous trends shows that the main thrust of the battle for democracy lies not in the past but in the future, when the incompetence and irresponsibility of many who have latched onto democracy will have to be paid for. It is worth preparing for this future today by reinforcing and expanding the democratic process.
