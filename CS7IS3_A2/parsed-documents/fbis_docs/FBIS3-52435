The FLN submitted a clarification of its proposals and the aspects of its disagreement with the proposals. In a letter addressed yesterday to the NDC chairman, a copy of which the radio received, the FLN pointed out that it disagreed with the NDC over three essential issues. The first is the major amendment of the constitution. The FLN opposed amending the constitution and considered it a basic reference point which should be applied during the transitional period. The second issue is the alternative bodies. The FLN announced that it was not interested in the bodies which would succeed the Higher State Council [HSC] and the management of the transitional period. The FLN expressed its readiness to contribute to solving the problems when a real authority is established, at the end of the HSC's term of office, which would actually be committed to solving the problems. The third issue is the transitional period. The FLN opposed extending the transitional period in accordance with the proposed basis [by the NDC]. The FLN reiterated its stance that the comprehensive and deep national dialogue would remain the only way to get the country out of the crisis.
