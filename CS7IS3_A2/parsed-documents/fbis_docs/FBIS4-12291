The sources said that Syria has expressed willingness to return to the Arab-Israeli negotiating table and that there is serious coordination with the Arab states concerned with these negotiations. The foreign ministers of these states are expected to hold a coordination meeting after Christopher's visit to Damascus to set a date for the resumption of the negotiations in Washington. The Syrian sources added that the UN Security Council's recent resolution on the Hebron massacre offered a reasonable impetus for the resumption of the Washington negotiations, provided the Arab states involved in the peace negotiations get new U.S. assurances of Israeli commitment to the basis of peace, for only that can spare the peace process the difficult possibilities. The responsible sources added that Israel is still adopting its same known position on the peace process, rejecting the basis, trying to prevent fulfillment of the peace requirements, seeking to keep the peace process at point zero, and placing obstacles in the way of any U.S. or international efforts to reactivate the process and ensure progress. The sources also said: In anticipation of any U.S. move to iron out obstacles standing in the way of the peace process, Israel always makes provocative statements or creates explosive situations in order to contain such a move and prevent it from achieving its objective of boosting the peace process and driving it toward a just and comprehensive peace. The Syrian sources added that Israel is now repeating the same practices before Christopher comes to the region, pursuing a calculated escalation of its policy of aggression and repression in southern Lebanon and in the occupied Arab territories, demonstrating more Israeli intransigence in the face of any constructive proposals the U.S. secretary of state might carry with him to the region with a view to extricating the peace process from the vicious circle it was thrown into by Israel through its intransigence. The sources pointed out that the United States is requested to act firmly and to throw all its weight behind the peace process and to put the necessary pressure on Israel to compel it to change its anti-peace policy and commit it to the principles and basis of the peace process as specified in the Madrid formula and in the UN resolutions, particularly the land-for-peace principle. The Syrian sources expressed the fear that the peace process might be in danger of collapse if the current Israeli policy continues, and that is why Syria believes that it is now Washington's responsibility to rescue the process by taking a firm stand based on committing Israel to full withdrawal and full recognition of Palestinian rights to prevent the peace process from moving toward the point of complete failure and the point of no return. Washington should remedy this situation before its foreign secretary goes to the region because the positions of the Arab states are clear and there are no problems for the U.S. secretary to discuss with them.
