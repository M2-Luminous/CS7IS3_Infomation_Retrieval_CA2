The Third Meeting of the Presidium of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC today adopted a bill on changing the name of the committee submitted by the NPC Environmental Protection Committee, and a draft decision on the bill submitted by the secretariat of the session. Both the bill and the draft decision will be submitted to NPC delegations for deliberation. In the bill, the environmental protection committee said that, since its establishment, many government departments and people have regarded it as being engaged primarily in environmental protection, thus paying little attention to the committee's work aimed at protecting natural resources. The bill says China now faces serious problems in terms of natural resources, including shortages of water resources, insufficient farmland resources, vegetation damage, soil erosion, desertification and a decrease in the number of wildlife. The bill describes the damage and waste of resources as a major factor causing environmental pollution. That is why it is necessary to combine legislation and supervision in the field of resources protection with those in the field of pollution control to make sure that the Environmental Protection Committee will be able to better perform its duties and functions, the bill says.
