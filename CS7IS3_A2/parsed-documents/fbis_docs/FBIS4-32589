[Iliescu] Thank you. [Stoianovici] Likewise, I would like to mention that the meeting with you means for us encouragement and an extremely great moral support but, at the same time, it also shows your concern for us, the Romanians living beyond Romania's borders. [Iliescu] Now more than ever. Because for a long time this issue was ignored in our country and no attention was paid to it. You who live in Vojvodina have had a somewhat privileged situation. I visited you in Novi Sad when I was still working in the area of "water management." In Vojvodina you succeeded in establishing a center for actions aimed at preserving interest in Romanian culture, Romanian language, and literary works in the Romanian language, while the Vlachs, for example, who are living in the Timok Valley, are more oppressed. They did not have many opportunities in the past either. As far as I know, they are not really recognized as an ethnic group today either, and therefore their situation and their position is much worse than yours. We have to find ways to help them as well. [Stoianovici] The Romanian minority living in the Yugoslav Banat region is well preserved, and therefore we make great efforts to continue to preserve our minority even in this current period of great crisis. If you will allow me, I will start asking you some questions now. [Iliescu] I'll answer you with pleasure. [Stoianovici] Thank you. My first question is the following: As a result of the December 1989 revolution, Romania had resolutely started off on the path of democracy and market economy. This path is quite hard in the new geopolitical and economic situation that emerged after the downfall of communism in East European countries. How do you view the results obtained in this confrontation with the difficulties of transition? [Iliescu] One can talk about two different aspects here. In the political sphere, things have progressed better. I would not say in an easier way, but definitely faster, because political systems can cope with such situations. Revolutions happen generally in the field of political relations in society. One power is eliminated and replaced by another one. This can be achieved in the way it happened in Romania, that is, through a sudden crash, with a revolutionary elan, through people's revolt. The old state structures were eliminated, demolished, and new provisional structures have been established, which, later through free elections -- we had two rounds of elections, in 1990 and in 1992 -- established the appropriate framework for the endorsement of the new constitution. The judicial bases and the structures of the new institutions of the rule-of-law state were also established. Thus, I believe that in the area of political relations in our society, these four years have marked radical changes in the physiognomy of the Romanian society. We have moved from the monopoly of a single party to the multiparty system and from a party-state toward a rule-of-law state, with separation of powers, and with the democratic system of electing state bodies and establishing all necessary institutions. Certainly, this is a process that will continue mainly in the field of properly organizing the society, that is, the civilian society. Thus, in this respect, things have progressed. Things are progressing a little bit slower in the area of economy because the economic system is a more inertial system. In this case, accumulations require time. Certainly, many things have changed. First of all, as a result of changes in the political field, a collapse of economic structures took place. We used to have a super-centralized, state-run economy. As early as the beginning of 1990, the central structures were dismantled and a rapid decentralization process took place in the economy. We took measures to ensure the liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and liberalization of prices and salaries. We made efforts to achieve the convertibility of our national currency, the leu, a process that only this year has reached a certain stabilization. Thus, many changes have taken place in the field of economy, but economy is a much more delicate issue. Certainly, these changes also meant certain disruptions, because the structure of the centralized, rigid economy, as it used to be, had its own internal rules. The moment this structure broke, its internal rules also broke, without having been replaced with something else, without a market economy with all its specific structures and institutions having been established. This brought about disorder and disruptions at the level of national economy. One can also add to this the international situation, the collapse of the international system in which we had been integrated, namely the CEMA. Thus, some markets disappeared altogether or became rather limited and we lost traditional partners. We could feel this situation in our entire economy. In practical terms, currently our industry is working at half of its potential. Likewise, in agriculture we also encountered great difficulties as a result of the dissolution of cooperative structures. The economy is coping with difficulty with this situation. Revival is a much more difficult process. However, I believe that we have overcome the most difficult times. At a macroeconomic level, 1993 was the most difficult year for us, because, on the one hand, we felt the effects of this decline in economic activity and because it was the year when the most difficult economic measures were taken such as cut of subsidies and introduction of value-added tax and of some financial discipline measures which were aimed at halting the quite high pace of inflation. Last year, the inflation rate reached 300 percent and this was our peak. Certainly, this does not impress you in Yugoslavia because... [Stoianovici] Yes, inflation is much higher there. [Iliescu] But for our situation it is very high. And this caused great difficulties. Among other things, one of the effects of the high inflation rate was the lack of capital for enterprises and economic companies, which started off with insufficient capital due to the old mechanisms of centralized economy. According to the plan, they received only half of the necessary financial resources. The rest was obtained from bank loans, as an element of additional control exercised on them. When the plan disappeared, the major source of ensuring financial resources also disappeared and all companies became dependent only on banks which also had less than sufficient resources. Inflation and increase of interest rate led to a situation in which enterprises found themselves completely without capital and an economic-financial blockage emerged that we are still experiencing today. Currently, the year 1994 is marked mainly by this big problem of financial blockage. However, we hope that things will slowly, slowly stabilize at a macroeconomic level. This year one can already notice a drop in the rate of inflation. Last year production marked a zero increase. Thus, the decline of industrial production was halted. However, today we are facing the task of reviving industrial production and ensuring its increase. Agriculture also shows signs of revival. Foreign trade, mainly exports, also started to show some improvement. Thus, there are premises that will turn 1994 into a year of revival and improvement of the economic activity. However, as far as people's living conditions are concerned, it is still a difficult year. There is still a big difference between people's income and prices. We have a large number of unemployed people, that is, 1.2 million. Thus, from the viewpoint of the microeconomy and people's standard of living, 1994 still remains a difficult year. However, with the premises that I was talking about earlier, there are great chances that at least next year hopefully we will mark a perceptible improvement in people's lives. [Stoianovici] If you will allow me, I am going to ask you the second question. By being accepted into the European democratic structures, Romania has demonstrated that it is attached to the democratic values that are promoted in the world. I would like to ask you to mention a few more important elements that enabled and ensured this opening to the world. [Iliescu] As I was saying before, all these changes that have taken place mainly in the country's political life were record events for us, which enabled us to join European bodies. There were certain prejudices toward Romania and the countries located in this geographical area in general, but particularly against Romania. This was also caused by a very strong anti-Romanian lobby that sprang up from Romania itself. The internal political struggle was reflected in an unhealthy way in the international arena and this caused some reservations toward our country in connection with the establishment of democratic structures, although everything spoke in favor of it. Romania experienced the most acute revolution, because of the people's uprising that dissolved old structures at one push. Only five months after the people's uprising of December 1989, we held the first elections in the presence of a large number of parties that emerged in this period. Nobody contested the validity of those elections. Parliament was elected, which was also a constituent assembly at the same time. We worked for one and a half years to draft the constitution, an exclusively democratic constitution, which is in line with all international standards of such fundamental documents and which was appreciated as such. On the basis of the new constitution, we organized local elections and general elections in 1992. Thus, the whole unfolding of political life was a proof of a constant progress, without any reservation and with no chance of returning to the old regime. As a mater of fact, it is aberrant even to question whether a revival of the old structures in the political sphere or economic area is possible. The idea itself is aberrant. The political struggle is carried out by people and groups of people. One cannot conceive of building a democratic society on the basis of the same rules that governed the totalitarian regime. In fact, the exclusion of a group of people from the normal life, from social life, from political life was the rule of those who were playing the role of "champions of democracy." They were excluding groups of people from the country's political life. According to what criteria? According to their subjective criteria. Thus, if a former [communist] party member became a member of a right-wing formation, he was "clean" as far as his past is concerned. If a former member of the Communist Party remained a left-wing supporter, this was unacceptable from the very beginning! What I mean is that these are subjective rules and subjective judgments that have nothing to do with democratic principles which are governing society. We all have to change this society and we all have to be valuable members of this society, and each of us should contribute with all our might to our progress. However, I believe that in the international arena we have overcome this stage. Thus, there was this period of reticence and reservations toward us. However, currently, I believe that things are regarded with much greater understanding and realism, and this understanding should characterize the political thinking in general. Last year we marked a few events: association, with full rights, to the Council of Europe; association to the European Union, initially to the NATO Cooperation Council; and now we have signed the Partnership for Peace document. Recently we have been accepted into the Western European Union with a status of associate partner. Thus, now one can clearly talk about openings that prove these tendencies that refer not only to the internal processes in the countries in our region, but also to a new way of political thinking in Europe and throughout the world in general. [Stoianovici] My next question refers to relations with Yugoslavia. Currently, Yugoslavia is going though maybe its worst times in its troubled history. Yugoslavia has always had traditional ties of good neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation with Romania. What can you tell us about the current stage of these relations, certainly also viewed from the perspective of the lifting of sanctions? [Iliescu] Our relations have always been and have remained good, even in conditions of this tragic period for the peoples of Yugoslavia. We are nurturing absolutely the same feelings of friendship and solidarity with the peoples of Yugoslavia and with the Serb people, with whom we have always had relations of good neighborliness. We have never had conflicts throughout history. Therefore, we have followed with great concern these dramatic events in the Yugoslav state, this dissolution of the federation, and mainly the outbreak of conflicts that have brought about so much tragedy. In these circumstances we tried to preserve open relations and contacts on the one had with all the sides involved in the conflicts and, on the other hand, with all the new state formations that have been established. I believe that we have good relations not only with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro, but also with Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and Bosnia. What matters is that this state of strife, maximum tension, and conflict should be overcome. We have hailed all efforts made in the world to assist on the one hand the actions aimed at halting the conflict and state of war, and, on the other hand, efforts made to find political, reasonable, and adequate solutions for all sides involved. Thus, we pleaded for a realistic attitude and for encouraging contacts and dialogue, and for finding adequate solutions at the negotiation table. We knew that it was not easy, especially after military conflicts opened. This type of conflict aggravates the situation even more, increases tension, and makes more difficult the reestablishment of normal contacts and of a logical and realistic approach to all issues. However, the more so, we believe that the major mission of the international community is not to take unilateral and partial positions but to try and facilitate political contacts and eliminate sources of conflict. Likewise, we have hailed all more recent efforts, including recent meetings in Geneva. Although I realize that the disputed issues are still very serious, nevertheless, I believe that the path of dialogue is the only possible way for progress. To continue on the path of military conflict means to aggravate things even more. [Stoianovici] I believe that my next question is the longest one. One of the major goals of the revolution is to change the attitude toward Romanians who live beyond the country's borders, contrary to the previous position of ignoring their existence. As far as we are concerned, the new policy that is being promoted has proved to be constructive. Currently, we are all confronted with a very serious economic situation in Yugoslavia. To what extent can Romania, the mother country, assist the Romanian minority in Yugoslavia in its efforts to preserve and cultivate their Romanian language and culture? [Iliescu] You have remarked it correctly, the former attitude was a mistake of the Romanian state. Regardless of the structure of a state, it cannot ignore its own citizens or fellow nationals who live in other areas. And this was one of Ceausescu's big mistakes and stupidities, to treat the Romanian diaspora with hostility and regard all those Romanians who left the country to live in various other places as traitors. Even Romanians who for hundreds of years have lived in the Balkan region and in neighboring countries were ignored. After the Romanian revolution, we adopted an open position. We considered that all Romanians, regardless of the place where they live, essentially are bound to the motherland and cannot ignore what is going on in the country. Cultural connections with the motherland, with the national culture, and with the mother tongue are normal for every person. And our duty is to remain open and reach out with a helping hand to all Romanians, regardless of the place where they live, closer or farther from our country. We have proclaimed this as a policy of the Romanian state. In a way, I am familiar with the activity of the Romanians in Vojvodina. I visited Novi Sad a few times, your publishing house and the radio and television stations. I held meetings with representatives of the Romanian community. I think that the Romanians in Vojvodina, generally speaking, have had a good situation. They have enjoyed a certain recognition and it is also their merit that they knew how to assert their existence, their being, culture, and language. They became artisans and their cultural work became part of the present Romanian cultural heritage. There have been good relations between our writers as well. I believe that other Romanians in the same area, such as the Vlachs in the Timoc River Valley, have a more difficult situation. I recently heard somebody's theory that the nationality of the Vlachs should not be recognized. Tara Romaneasca [southern part of Romania, former province of Wallachia] formerly was called Wallachia. The name Wallachia comes from the Serb term for Romanians, that is Vlachs or Wallachs. Thus the Vlachs are Romanians. That is the term that Slavs used for Romanians, Vlachs or Wallachs. Thus, the Vlachs in the Timoc Valley are Romanians, just as much Romanians as the Romanians in Vojvodina or Romanians in Romania. However, they had a much more bitter situation because they were completely isolated from Romania. I believe that it is the common duty of Romania and of the Serbian Yugoslav state to assist these Romanians to regain their dignity and their right to exist, to assert themselves, and to assert their national culture. As a matter of fact, we promote a policy that I believe is correct, honest, and open toward all countries that have Romanian minorities. We regard our minorities not as Romania's agents on the territory of other countries but as fellow nationals. But, as citizens of another country, they have to be loyal to the state whose citizens they are, just as we regard all citizens of Romania with the same openness, and grant them equal rights with Romanians, regardless of their nationality. All ethnic minorities in our country are treated by the Romanian state, in the current new democratic situation, with understanding. We grant them all our support. On this basis, I believe we can forge relations of good neighborliness with all countries and with our co-nationals. Thus, we believe that it is our duty to preserve these cultural relations and grant all the support we can to preserve the Romanian being and culture. [Stoianovici] At the end of this interview, if you will allow me, I would like to ask you one more question: Do you have any message for the Romanians in Vojvodina? [Iliescu] I wish both the Romanians as well as the Serb people and the Yugoslav peoples to overcome first of all these difficult times and the present state of conflict in the Yugoslav area and to reinstate a normal situation. On this basis, I wish for the resumption of normal, natural neighborly relations and of economic relations between our countries that have been affected very much. The embargo is not only directed against Yugoslavia, it is also against Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the other neighboring countries. We all suffer because of it. Thus, first of all we wish that a normal situation be reestablished and, on this basis, cultural life, a full intellectual life, with complete use of creative capacities our nations should be able to develop.
