FR940907-2-00106 FR940907-2-00077 A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;7) that requested permanent approval of the Service. For the month ending July 31, 1994, the Service reflected the market making positions of 398 NASD member firms displaying quotations/indications of interest in approximately 5,082 OTC Equities. During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR issues will remain indicative. In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under Section 4 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with Rule 15c2&hyph;11 under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly Section 17B of the Act. 4 The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny stocks.'' 4 On November 24, 1992, the NASD filed an application with the Commission for interim designation of the Service as an automated quotation system pursuant to Section 17B(b) of the Act. On December 30, 1992, the Commission granted Qualifying Electronic Quotation System (``QEQS'') status for the Service for purposes of certain penny stock rules that became effective on January 1, 1993. On August 26, 1993, the Commission granted the NASD's request for an extension of QEQS status until such time as the OTCBB meets the statutory requirements of Section 17B(b)(2). Finally, on May 13, 1994, the NASD filed an application with the Commission for permanent designation of the Service as an automated quotations system for penny stocks pursuant to Section 17B(b). 2. Statutory Basis The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and Section 17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations, preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations. Finally, Section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed. The NASD believes that extension of the Service through October 3, 1994, is fully consistent with the foregoing provisions of the Act. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III.
