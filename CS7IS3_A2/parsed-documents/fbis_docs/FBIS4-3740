Located in Qingpu County of Shanghai City, the town is planned to occupy 2.13 hectares. Wu Wenying, president of the China National Textile Council, said here today that the construction of the town is a new exploration and will serve as a guide for technological progress and readjustment of the structure of the textile industry in the country. She said that the textile industry is one of the traditional industries in China. At present, its output value accounts for 14.4 percent of the total output value in the country. But, she noted, China's textile industry is also facing development difficulties. The construction of the textile town is aimed at setting up an international commodity-oriented industrial town with new and high technology. Now the town has signed contracts with its counterparts in Germany, the United States and the Republic of Korea for projects with a total investment of 180 million U.S. dollars.
