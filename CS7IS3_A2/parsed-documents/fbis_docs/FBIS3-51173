The cabinet decision, which appears to be directly linked to the president's concerns, was announced by Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, who said that, among other measures, it has been decided to create eight management offices to create jobs and monitor Social Plan funds. The labor minister did not want to discuss the measures adopted by Menem and his security cabinet regarding possible guerrilla actions in the provinces experiencing a social crisis by saying: "It is not good to make predictions." He also downplayed the fact that the Armed Forces commanders were summoned by the president by saying that such an issue "must not be considered exceptional because it exists in all the democratic countries I know." Caro Figueroa said the government "is not indifferent" to the decision of the General Labor Confederation (CGT) to hold a general strike on a yet undetermined date, "although we will continue prioritizing a dialogue" in an attempt to make union leaders change their mind. Media Secretary Raul Burzaco said the other subjects discussed during the security cabinet meeting were the implementation of the Social Plan by the health and social action minister, a briefing by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella about the possibility of granting Argentine citizenship to the children of Argentines residing abroad, and other reports read by [National Tourism Agency Director] Francisco Mayorga and [Natural Resources and Environment Secretary] Maria Julia Alsogaray. Caro Figueroa said he first informed the cabinet members of the state of negotiations with the CGT and the business organizations. Among other points already known by the public, the labor minister informed the cabinet about the labor unions' demands to make the government responsible for the labor unions' previous debts in keeping with the a law that has not been applied yet. "We will comply with this legal obligation," Caro Figueroa said. The security cabinet created on 12 January by Menem will follow up the social situation in the provinces, on the lookout for eventual social revolts, Caro Figueroa said. He added: "It is necessary to adopt different measures because the labor situation is not the same in all the provinces." That is why he announced the decision, which was approved by the cabinet, to create eight management offices to promote employment and follow up the distribution of social aid funds in each of the country's northern provinces. These management offices "must not only guarantee the efficiency of the social expenses but also support the decentralization and reconversion process" implemented by the central government. He said the reconversion policy in the provinces undergoing a serious social crisis "must be carried out with the least social cost possible," adding that "it is possible to implement these changes in an untraumatic manner." When discussing the official decision to place the intelligence services on alert, Caro Figueroa said: "They are measures to guarantee internal security, and they must not be considered exceptional issues because they exist in all the democratic countries I know." He added that it is not an isolated fact within the government "since all the policies, the economic policy and the social policy, go together hand in hand." He denied that the concern over the alleged reappearance of a guerrilla group "came up just by chance," as well as the concern over the need to implement social policies in the troubled provinces, given that "the government has been concerned about the situation in the northern provinces for more than a year."
