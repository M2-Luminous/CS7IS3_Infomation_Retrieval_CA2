Mori told a press conference that he has no intention of asking Watanabe to become LDP vice president to meet calls for such a move within the party to strengthen the party leadership. "I don't think the leadership is so weak as to need reinforcement," Mori said, rejecting a charge from an intraparty group that the leadership is weak in fighting the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Mori criticized moves by some party members to have Watanabe promoted to the vice presidency, saying it could lead to an intraparty struggle.
