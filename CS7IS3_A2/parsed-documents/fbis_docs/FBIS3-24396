[Churkin] I believe that this initiative was born somewhere between Yeltsin and Kozyrev on Saturday, 12 February. I was in Geneva and was about to leave for Moscow. I suddenly received a call from Sergey Lavrov (deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia-- D.M.), and, citing the president, he conveyed instructions that I fly to Belgrade to discuss the situation that had taken shape following the ultimatum with the Serbian president. I flew to Belgrade that same day and was speaking with Milosevic in the evening. Then came Skopje, Zagreb, and Sarajevo and meetings with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic. Following the news conference in Zagreb, I was approached by our ambassador in Croatia, who said that I had to fly to Belgrade--I would be told why on arrival. In Belgrade I was connected with Kozyrev by HF from the embassy bunker, and he directed me for the first time: work this option through with the Serbs--at Russia's request they put their arms under UN control, and we commit our contingent to Sarajevo. I said immediately that this was a brilliant idea. I took it to Milosevic, he summoned Karadzic, and the three of us talked together. The main task was to invest this initiative with the most precise form possible. The Serbs had to be convinced that our battalion would be in Sarajevo in timely fashion, and our aims had to be explained precisely to the world community. I spoke by telephone with Grachev, Ryurikov, Lavrov, and Kolesnikov. With Pavel Sergeyevich (Grachev--D.M.) the conversation took just two minutes: He assured me immediately that tomorrow he would give the order for preparation for action. But I still had to receive the text of Yeltsin's actual message to Milosevic. Incidentally, up to the decisive moment I had not told the latter that this would be a letter signed by Boris Nikolayevich. This was my final trump card. And when, on Thursday morning, I went to the president of Serbia with a message signed by the president of Russia, Milosevic put a high value on this. But this was not the end of the matter. It should be remembered that, granted all the authority of Milosevic and Karadzic, obtaining their "go-ahead" was only half the matter. The Bosnian Serbs are a law unto themselves, as they say, and would never do anything that was even to the least extent contrary to their interests (as was the case with the Vance-Owen plan, incidentally, when the Serbs said a firm "no"). So that even after the conversation with the president of Serbia, I was not wholly confident of success. This was why we went to Pale, where we met with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs, and only then did I understand that the mission could be considered accomplished. [Molchanov] Yes, this truly was a breakthrough. But should things have reached the phase where this breakthrough was necessary? [Churkin] It would have been better had they not, of course. We had been conducting the process so as to ensure that a crisis over Sarajevo not arise. Back at the end of January we had proposed a two-tier plan for a settlement of the conflict: convening a session of the UN Security Council at foreign minister level with an invitation to the representatives of the belligerents in order to seek a political solution. The second proposal amounted to a reinforcement of the conditions of the security zone--we had in mind Sarajevo primarily, of course. But these proposals were not accepted. On 6 February, following the explosion in Sarajevo's market square, I called Milosevic and said: "Mr. President, the question of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo must be settled now. The parties will be meeting this week in Geneva, and this simply must not be 'one further successful round of negotiations,' the issue must be settled." Milosevic agreed. We went to Geneva. Late in the evening I turned on the television in the hotel room and heard Clinton's statement and, immediately after this, the news conference given by Woerner (NATO secretary general--D.M.)--the ultimatum. It was immediately clear that continuing the negotiations was futile because the participants were looking more at the skies than at their partners. Incidentally--the NATO people prefer to forget about this now-- the decision on the transfer of heavy arms to UN control had been adopted by the Serbs and Muslims with the mediation of General Rose, commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, several hours before the announcement of the ultimatum. Thus NATO issued the ultimatum after the decision had already been made. And I, naturally, have the impression that the most important thing for NATO was not the lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo but striking a blow at the Serbs. Many people would like to change the political situation by means of such actions, but this would have very serious consequences. [Molchanov] What is the explanation for the strange position of the UN secretary general, who farmed out the adoption of the decision on a bombing assault to the NATO command? [Churkin] I would not want to criticize Butrus-Ghali but my personal opinion is that he was being subjected to colossal pressure on the part of a number of NATO countries, which very much wanted to bring matters to the point of an ultimatum. Being subjected to pressure is the essence of the work of the secretary general, come to that. I would merely like the UN secretary general to cooperate more with the UN Security Council than the NATO Council. We cannot agree with a situation where the right to interpret Security Council decisions is given over to another organization. And NATO, in interpreting these decisions, even attempted to dictate to the United Nations what should be done. This is why those who maintain that Russia has seized the propaganda initiative and that everything would have been o.k. according to the NATO ultimatum in any case are wrong. No, our role was, in fact, pivotal. Take just the following fact: Despite the agreement between the Serbs and the Muslims, the intensive withdrawal of artillery only began following the commitment of the Russian soldiers. We asked the Serbs why. They replied: The public would not allow us! Women and children would gather and stand in the way of the equipment. But when we told them that a Russian battalion was coming, this was another matter.... To be honest, when I was working on this problem, the main thing that I tried to prevent was Russia's national humiliation. Not a further escalation in Bosnia--although I did not want this, of course, and my instructions here were clear--but humiliation of Russia. For if on this occasion also everything was handled without us, if we allowed ourselves to be brushed off this time also, the consequences, despite our present dispirited self-awareness, could have been more onerous for us than the Bosnians. [Molchanov] Truly, for the first time in the entire post-Soviet period we permitted ourselves our own say in the world. What brought about this change? [Churkin] There was a transition from quantity to quality. Earlier the line had been as follows: If we do not like something or other, we shall not say "no" immediately, but shall attempt to find a common language with our partners. But in time our reluctance to get into a confrontation came to be perceived by some people as spinelessness. And we said: Enough! All the "i's" need to be dotted. As Yeltsin did in conversation with Major: "We will not permit it without Russia!..." [Molchanov] I was recently talking with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma's International Affairs Committee. He commented quite sharply on the American position in respect to Russia. "One quickly becomes accustomed to pleasant things," he said, "and America had very quickly become accustomed to us agreeing with Washington on just about everything." Today we have begun to speak with our own voice, and we have immediately been accused of neo-imperialism.... [Churkin] Well, first, I would say that these charges are not the official position of the United States, they are not Clinton and not Christopher. These statements belong more to the opposition. After all, the present president of the United States has set serious store, the main store, perhaps, in his foreign policy by Russia. But there are symptoms of attempts being made to take us for simpletons (at some forum or another, say: What do you mean by opposing me, we are partners, accept my draft!). But we are increasingly seldom affording pretexts for people to talk to us in this way. [Molchanov] That is, the transitional period is coming to an end? [Churkin] Yes, unequivocally. We have drawn the line, I believe. And this line was drawn in Bosnia. [Molchanov] We are restoring to ourselves great-power status, in other words? [Churkin] Yes, we are moving along this path. Of course, this is impossible without a certain reinforcement--as in Sarajevo. Had we not had this battalion, what then? It is clear to everyone that there cannot be a great power without strong armed forces capable of accomplishing the mission entrusted to them at the modern level. And this work is under way. Our new military doctrine corresponds to these requirements in full. [Molchanov] All this is well and good, but it seems to me that these goals are unattainable until the national self-awareness of the Russian people has been revived. But what is to happen when even such concepts as "patriotism" and "love for the motherland," have just about been given over to the opposition? [Churkin] I believe that this was the democrats' biggest mistake when they began to use the word "patriot," albeit in quotation marks, in a disparaging sense. The word "patriot" is not enclosed in quotation marks, in the same way that the word "Motherland" is written with a capital letter. When people say "patriot," I consider that this is addressed to me, just as the democrats should have considered it addressed to them. [Molchanov] The result is that the word "democrat" is now enclosed in quotation marks. [Churkin] Yes, I believe that the losses on account of this have been very serious. We should have learned to equate the concepts "democracy" and "patriotism." Another, not mistake even, but tragedy, has been the fact that our democrats imagine the concept of "democracy" to be inseparable from the idea of the disintegration of the state. We are still dealing with the consequences of this delusion. [Molchanov] Vitaliy Ivanovich, how, in your opinion, will events develop in the former Yugoslavia? [Churkin] I have convinced myself repeatedly that to be an optimist in Yugoslav matters is to be a fool. One thing I can say: Our initiative prevented the intervention of the armed forces of NATO in the conflict, and this would have done no good. Aside from all else, in the event of our diplomatic failure, there would have been here, in Russia, a reassessment of our relations with the West, but no longer on the basis about which we have spoken--partnership with precise emphases--but closer to a position of strength. As far as a forecast is concerned.... In any event, peace there is impossible without the consent of Russia, America, and Europe. Perhaps we will succeed in arriving at some arrangements in the coming weeks. But the main thing, I believe, is that the worst is behind us.
