In November last year, President Clinton hosted a meeting of all but one of the 15 heads of government from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. On December 15, the latest round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed. On New Year's Day 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico came into being. Then, six weeks later trade negotiations between Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to issue even a Zen resolution to try harder in future. So, should the scoreboard be counted as three losses and one win for retaining national controls? No. All four need to be seen as part of a different game. Far from aiming at so-called freer trade, the quartet of tussles shared the single goal of re-establishing the dominance of US conglomerates across global markets. That is the reality behind the misnomer "free trade". The failure of the Clinton-Hosokawa talks highlighted the substance and the limitations of APEC, GATT and NAFTA. To achieve dominance for US corporations, Washington needs to switch between seemingly contradictory approaches -- multilateralism through GATT, regionalism in NAFTA and bilateralism with Japan. The rhetoric behind GATT is that only multi-lateral trade deals are acceptable since regionalism and bilateral arrangements limit access to markets. US negotiators interpret that objective as applying only to regions and deals in which US firms are not the principal player. Yet even US politicians can suffer from a surfeit of hypocrisy. Hence, instead of calling the body to replace GATT the multi-lateral trade organisation, Washington insisted on it being named the World Trade Organisation. That preference signalled how US trade negotiators do not intend to be limited to multilateralism. Throughout these deals, deceits and disputes, the Australian Government kept investing its rhetoric in APEC. Yet, if Japan and the US can't agree between themselves, what chance is there that they and 13 others will come up with a workable trading community? Our interests would have been better served had Keating joined Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir in a boycott of APEC. The accusation of "recalcitrant" should have been aimed at the US administration. Mendacity about the virtues of multilateralism was only one of the whoppers generated by those four commercial battles. The other big lie was the quantified benefits that were supposed to depend upon the successful conclusion of GATT and NAFTA. When a writer on Britain's GUARDIAN newspaper looked back over those estimates, he discovered that GATT's first success had been a growth in its own promised benefits. A year before the compromise agreement, the boost to world output from a successful outcome had been put at $US100 billion ($140 billion). Then, as GATT looked as if it would fail, the figure for expected growth in world economic activity began to inflate. It peaked at $US269 billion to be attained by the year 2002. What caused this expansion? The answer was the urgency to stimulate public pressure upon recalcitrant governments. Similar propaganda needs accounted for the figures given out about NAFTA. The chief economic adviser to the secretary general of GATT said that the NAFTA numbers were being made up. One creative economist admitted that his model depended on guesswork about how much capital would flow into Mexico. Making up the numbers runs counter to the assumption in "free-trade" dogma that markets cannot be managed by governments because they are unpredictable. One critic of the NAFTA numbers racket observed that if economists could predict labour market outcomes seven years in advance, the centrally planned economies of the former Soviet bloc need never have imploded. Are there to be no losers from GATT? Yes, but the only one listed was sub-Saharan Africa, marked to drop $US2.6 billion. However, the fine print did contain a warning which applies to the alleged winners as well. Estimates of increased growth took no account of the social costs that must flow from global corporations gaining greater power over national economies. For example, Australia is supposed to make $US1 billion extra in export returns from improved access to world markets for our agricultural products. This alleged gain had to be balanced against the costs of unemployment after the closure of food plants in our country towns because of increased processed imports. Nor were environmental costs part of the GATT guesstimates. Hence, even if the numbers concocted for GATT and NAFTA were, by some fluke, to turn out to be accurate, they still would offer no indication about the prices to be paid in achieving that growth.
