A working meeting of delegations from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Kazakh Republic Ministry of Defense was held in Almaty on 16 February. The delegation to the negotiations was headed by: On the Ukrainian side--deputy defense minister and armed forces armament chief Colonel General Ivan Oleynik, and from the Kazakh side--chief of Air Force Main Staff Major General Alibek Kasymov. The problems of widening military cooperation and implementing agreements signed at the level of government delegations of the countries in early 1994 were discussed during the negotiations. A joint communique was signed on the basis of the results of the meeting in Almaty. In it, the sides note their great interest in widening contacts between the military departments of the two countries on a broad range of issues. The principles of mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual advantage were laid at the basis of development of such relations. The Ukrainian side expressed its readiness for military, technical and scientific cooperation in developing new forms of equipment and modernizing armament already in existence. Mutual understanding of Ukraine and Kazakhstan in this area will make it possible to carry out this work less expensively and more effectively. Interaction in development of the missile and space possibilities of the two countries is promising. The Kazakh delegation displayed interest in more intensive use of Ukraine's repair base on behalf of the armed forces of Kazakhstan. The nature of mutual settlements will be refined and determined more specifically in the immediate future, and the possibility for quickly paying off existing debts is being studied. Both sides made note of the extensive possibilities for mutually advantageous cooperation between the military departments of Kazakhstan and Ukraine in the areas of troop rear support, military education and other areas of military development. Such bilateral contacts are in keeping with international obligations adopted through treaties, and they meet the aspirations of Ukraine and the Kazakh Republic without infringing upon the interests of any third countries. Hastening the efforts by the Kazakh Republic and Ukraine to draft a treaty on military cooperation was deemed suitable in the course of the negotiations. On the same day the Ukrainian military delegation left Almaty for Tashkent, where it is to meet with Uzbek colleagues.
