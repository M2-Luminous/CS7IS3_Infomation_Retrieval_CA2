The Ministry of the Interior will provide safe escort for your group from the office to Pochentong Airport. You, however, must inform the Ministry at least one day before your departure. Beyond the above deadline, the Ministry of the Interior will not be held responsible for your security. Please, accept our high regards. Phnom Penh, 17 June 1994 [Signed] His Excellency Sar Kheng, His Excellency Yu Hokkri, ministers of the interior
