Indeed, the press in general devotes little attention to the problem of the possible possession of nuclear weapons by these states. And yet it has a very serious character. [passage omitted] Fears are now increasing all the time in the world that nuclear weapons could be launched in this region, since relations between India and Pakistan are extremely tense, and several times have deteriorated to the point of open military operations. But both these states are ostentatiously disregarding the opinion of other countries. Pakistan will not renounce its "nuclear option" until all vexed questions with India are settled, including the problem of Kashmir, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali stated in a speech to parliament. He ruled out the possibility of a compromise with the United States on the nuclear question; the latter is offering to supply Islamabad with 38 F-16 fighter bombers in exchange for winding down its nuclear program. The minister also stated that his country will not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty until Delhi agrees to accede to this international document. As for India, it is giving extremely contradictory signals. First Delhi claims that nuclear weapons arsenals must be destroyed worldwide, then it says that it reserves the right to choose whether to develop its own nuclear bomb or not. At the same time, it refuses to talk about signing up to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, declaring it "discriminatory." Thus a kind of vicious circle is arising. Both Pakistan and India are continuing their research programs, with all the latent danger of a nuclear arms race and the danger of the use of those weapons. And no arguments have any effect on either country. There are many factors here. The principal ones, of course, are the failure to resolve the numerous and long-standing problems in Indo-Pakistani relations. But perhaps not the least role here is played by the double standards practiced by so influential a state as the United States with regard to countries which refuse to submit to the international nuclear nonproliferation regime. Whereas, for instance, the DPRK is being subjected to real ostracism, only reproaches or expressions of regret are leveled at Pakistan. Next year an international conference is due to be held with a view to extending the term of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is expected that the treaty will become indefinite and universal, that is to say, if not all the states in the world, then the overwhelming majority will be participants in the treaty. And it goes without saying that the requirements on all countries, whether the DPRK or Iraq, Israel or Japan, India or Pakistan, should be the same. All mankind is vitally interested in such a solution to the nonproliferation problem.
