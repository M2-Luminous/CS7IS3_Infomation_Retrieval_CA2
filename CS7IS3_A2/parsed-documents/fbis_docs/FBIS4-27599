FBIS4-27599 "dreas106_d_94036" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 31 May 1994 South Korea DLP To Accept Lawmakers To Counter Growth DLP To Accept Lawmakers To Counter Growth SK3105054194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0512 GMT 31 May 94 SK3105054194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) is wooing independent lawmakers in a bid to impede the emergence of a new party large enough to become a negotiating body, DLP officials said Tuesday. They said several independent lawmakers have expressed interest in joining the ruling party, suggesting that the DLP is currently selecting some for membership. Two splinter parties -- the United People's Party (UPP) and the New Political Reform Party (NPRP) -- announced Monday they would merge and possibly become a third negotiating body in the National Assembly if they win over seven or more lawmakers. Rep. Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the DLP, said, "some nonpartisan lawmakers expressed the intention to enter our party long ago, but we cannot accept all of them." He hinted that the DLP may select just enough independent lawmakers to deter the newly merged party from becoming a negotiating body. He named Reps. Kim Chung-nam, Pyon Chong-il, Chong Mong-chun, Chong Tae-yong, Kim Chin-yong and Chong Chu-il as those who might be joining the DLP. At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and the New Party for Political Reform has one. If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between the ruling DLP and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP).
