FR940727-1-00054 FR940727-1-00015 Wednesday July 27, 1994 Part V Federal Emergency Management Agency 44 CFR Part 354 Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 143␣/␣Wednesday, July 27, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 354 RIN 3067&hyph;AC10 Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Under its appropriation for fiscal year (FY) 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389), FEMA was authorized to assess and collect fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees to recover approximately, but not less than, 100 per centum of the amounts anticipated by FEMA to be obligated for its Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program. This appropriations act further provided for the Director of FEMA to promulgate, through rulemaking, a schedule of fees applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. Public Law 102&hyph;389 provided the authority for these user fees to be assessed and collected for fiscal year 1993 services only. FEMA's appropriation for FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124) continued the user fee provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;389, and FEMA anticipates that the Congress will provide such authority again in FEMA's appropriation for FY 1995. If such authority is provided, FEMA proposes to revise its existing interim rule to change for FY 1995 the methodology used to assess the user fees. One advantage of the proposed change in methodology would be the ability to issue user fee bills during the first quarter of the fiscal year. This proposed rule is being published at this time in order to publish the resulting revised rule in time to meet the FY 1995 billing schedule, as well as to notify all potentially affected parties of this proposed change and to invite and request comments on the proposed revised methodology. DATES: Comments from the public on this proposed rule are encouraged and invited on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, room 840, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472; (facsimile) (202) 646&hyph;4536. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda H. Vasta, Chief, Regulatory Services Coordination Unit, Preparedness, Training, and Exercises Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;4570. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 6, 1991, FEMA published in the Federal Register (56 FR 9452&hyph;9459) the final rule, 44 CFR part 353, that established a structure for assessing and collecting user fees from NRC licensees. Under 44 CFR part 353, REP services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors were reimbursable only if these services were site-specific in nature and directly contributed to the fulfillment of emergency preparedness requirements needed for licensing by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Although FEMA is proposing a new approach for the assessment and collection of fees from licensees for FY 1995, part 353 remains in effect and will apply in any subsequent fiscal year for which FEMA is not authorized to collect user fees for generic services. Public Law 102&hyph;389, October 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1571&hyph;1619, expanded reimbursable REP Program activities by authorizing FEMA to charge licensees of commercial nuclear power plants fees to recover the full amount of the funds budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1993. On July 1, 1993, FEMA published in the Federal Register (58 FR 35770&hyph;35775) an interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, to establish and set forth the policies and administrative basis for assessing and collecting these fees. FEMA reserved the option of applying, reissuing, or amending part 354 for other fiscal years provided that appropriate authority was enacted. Public Law 103&hyph;124, September 23, 1993, 107 Stat. 1297, directed FEMA to continue assessing and collecting fees to recover the full amount of the funds budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1994. In addition, the Administration has proposed assessing such fees for subsequent fiscal years.
