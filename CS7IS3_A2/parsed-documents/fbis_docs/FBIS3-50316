This change is evidenced by a more flexible form given to the "Partnership for Peace" programme. During a press conference for Polish journalists on Tuesday Minister Olechowski said that his talks with Strobe Talbott designated as deputy secretary of state focused on the situation in Russia while his meeting with head of the National Security Council Anthony Lake centred on the "Partnership for Peace" programme which Poland accepted two weeks ago. Olechowski informed the Polish newsmen that at the end of this week a NATO mission will leave Brussels for Poland to discuss the military, technical and financial details of the "Partnership for Peace". Warsaw will be the first central European capital to be visited by the mission, the minister stressed. "We have explained (to the American side) that we may not have the financial resources to fund our military participation in the programme. Therefore, joint excercises and other improvement efforts should be an object of common financial care," Olechowski said. On the same day, Olechowski met with a representative of the National Security Council Jane Walker to discuss the possible European regional initiatives that the United States would be interested in. He also held talks with leader of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL- CIO) Lane Kirkland. On Monday evening, the Polish foreign minister attended a dinner given in his honour by the Breton Woods Institute and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. In a speech delivered on the occasion Olechowski favourably assessed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative but stressed that Poland considered it to be just the first stage leading to NATO membership. "The Partnership for Peace obviously increases our security. It opens the North Atlantic alliance to the East which makes more realistic our hopes for joining the Western security structures," he said. He also stressed that the programme imposed a stronger obligation on partner-countries to protect democratic societies and their freedoms. Simultaneously, Olechowski pointed out that countries such as Poland which are determined to enter NATO, should be presented with concrete criteria of joining the alliance as well as with a timetable of the admission process. Referring to the statements by President Bill Clinton and Vice- President Al Gore that the security of the central European region is directly important for the security of the United States, Olechowski declared: "We expect the United States to fulfil this obligation and ensure that Poland and other countries of the Visegrad group become actively engaged in the partnership for peace which should systematically and quickly bring them closer to NATO membership." "The Americans understand the fears of Poland and the neighbouring states much better than the Europeans who are self- assured but lack a vision, Olechowski also declared. Minister Olechowski also met in Washington on Tuesday with two influential members of the U.S. Congress, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski and Senator Sam Nunn. Rostenkowski is to present to President Bill Clinton the Polish foreign minister's suggestions concerning Poland's participation in the "Partnership for Peace." Nunn who heads the Senate Armed Forces Committee promised in his conversation with Olechowski to see to it that means for the "Partnership for Peace" programme be found in the American defence budget.
