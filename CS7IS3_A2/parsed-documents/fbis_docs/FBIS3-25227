But at no time were any threats made regarding RPT supporters, nor was there any violence used on RPT supporters anywhere. It is not in the CAR's interest at all to provoke incidents in electoral constituency where it is poised to win at least 60 percent of votes in the second round, with the help of other parties of the democratic opposition. Second, the CAR was informed that acts of provocation were going to be committed by RPT militiamen, disguised as supporters of the democratic opposition, in order to set off repression, which would frighten away voters in favor of change in electoral constituencies where the RPT is neck and neck with opposition candidates. Furthermore, plans reportedly have been hatched to assassinate some democratic opposition leaders, in order to decapitate the democratic forces before the second round of polls. Third, in his communique, the minister of territorial administration and security does not give any proof of his allegations. He rather displays his partiality by designating the CAR by name, whereas a few days earlier, he declined to blame a party which was responsible for the serious incidents which occurred at Agou, although he knows the culprits quite well. Do we have to remind the minister of the acts of intimidation and corruption exerted on the traditional chiefs of the northern region, which prevented free expression by the voters of that region? Is the minister's communique not actually meant to prepare people's mind for the acts of violence planned by the RPT? The CAR launches an urgent appeal to the head of state and the authorities to assume their responsibilities, to the International Monitoring Committee to intervene so that military and civilian observers are deployed as a matter of priority to the 11 electoral constituencies where the opposition is facing the RPT. The CAR once again affirms its irrevocable option for non- violence and calls on the people to remain vigilant and not to give in to provocations and intimidations.
