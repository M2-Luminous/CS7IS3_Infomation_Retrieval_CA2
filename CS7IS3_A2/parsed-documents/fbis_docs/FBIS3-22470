Giving the statistics recently, Dr. Benoit Karambire said that the high AIDS prevalence was due to the area's proximity with Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. According to Dr. Salimata Sissoko, who is in charge of Sikasso Hospital's laboratory, about 10 percent of blood donors had tested positive with HIV. Dr. Sissoko said Sikasso has turned into a place where HIV-infected Malians living in neighboring countries come to pass their last days. When the infected widows of the exiles return home, they are generally inherited by their brothers in law, thus propagating the disease to worrying levels among the region's 1.5 million people.
