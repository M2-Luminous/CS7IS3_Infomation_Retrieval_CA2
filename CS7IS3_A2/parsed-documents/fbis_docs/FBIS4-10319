In his commentary, Cotayo says that nine years after its creation, this radio station has become a sort of convention of chirping crickets hatching political plots. He also mentions the tight control exerted on this station by the most reactionary Miami circles headed by Jorge Mas Canosa. The article adds that the U.S. Congress this year agreed to finance the station with $19 million of the U.S. taxpayers' money. But at the same time, it decided to withhold part of those funds until an advisory panel reviews Radio Marti activities and issues recommendations on the matter. The manipulated objective of this anti-Cuban station is no secret to anyone. Moreover, Florida Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart has said this station plays an important role in U.S. policy on Cuba. In conclusion, Cotayo states that the validity or lack of validity of the role played by the radio station will be established by a working group of the U.S. Information Agency, but headed by the ultraconservative satellite, Jorge Mas Canosa.
