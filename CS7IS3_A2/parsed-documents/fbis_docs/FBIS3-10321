The survey, conducted by the firm CID-Gallup, has shown that during the first round of elections, Calderon will obtain 32 percent of the votes, while Ruben Zamora, candidate for the leftist coalition Democratic Convergence, which includes the former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] guerrilla organization, will obtain only 16 percent. Fidel Chavez Mena, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC) candidate, will finish third with 10 percent of the votes, while Roberto Escobar, of the National Conciliation Party (PCN), will be fourth with two percent, according to the survey. To win the Salvadoran Presidency during the first round of elections a candidate must obtain 50 percent plus one of the votes; otherwise, there will be a second round of elections, according to the electoral law. According to the survey, during which 2,100 people were interviewed throughout the country from 18 to 25 February, 40 percent of the voters are still undecided on which candidate they will support. Should there be a second round of elections between Calderon and Zamora, 37 percent would chose the official candidate, while 22 percent would vote for his opponent, and 41 percent are still undecided, according to the survey. In case the second round of elections is between Calderon Sol and Chavez Mena, the preferences would be 36 percent against 20 percent, in favor of the Arena candidate. CID-Gallup Executive Director Olda Maria Acuna has said at a news conference out of the 40 percent of undecided voters, four percent chose Arena, 2 percent the leftist coalition, and another 2 percent the PDC [figures as received]. Acuna has said the high percentage of undecided voters could be the "decisive factor" of the 20 March elections, and she did not rule out the possibility there could be a "surprise." More than 2 million Salvadorans will elect a new president and vice president, as well as 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 262 municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament (Parlacen). The electoral law prohibits the publication of surveys two weeks before the elections.
