FR941117-0-00218 FR941117-0-00014 C. Disclosure of Unrated Securities The Commission also published for comment a requirement to disclose, if applicable, that certain debt securities have not been rated by an NRSRO. 55 The proposal excluded government securities defined under Section 3(a)(42) (A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, 56 but requested specific comment on whether other securities should be excluded from this disclosure. 57 In addition, specific comment was requested whether the MSRB should implement the disclosure requirement with respect to municipal securities, rather than the Commission. 58 55 See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12770. 56 Securities exempt from the proposed rating disclosure would include (1) securities that are direct obligations of the U.S., or in which the U.S. has guaranteed the principal or interest; or (2) securities which are issued or guaranteed by corporations in which the U.S. has a direct or indirect interest and which the Secretary of Treasury has designated for exemption. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42)(A) and (B). 57 Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12770. 58 Id. Of the 43 commenters that addressed this disclosure proposal, 24 supported the proposal. 59 Some commenters believed that the disclosure requirement did not go far enough and indicated that specific ratings also should be disclosed on the confirmation. 60 In particular, commenters believed that the confirmation should bear all ratings of securities, particularly those rated below investment grade. 61 59 See, e.g., Letters from A.B. Krongard, Chief Executive Officer, Alex. Brown & Sons, Incorporated (July 14, 1994); David C, Clapp, Chairman, MSRB (June 15, 1994); and Douglas L. Kelly, Director, Law and Compliance, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. (June 13, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. Alex. Brown & Sons, Incorporated sought clarification that a bond rated by a single NRSRO, but not necessarily other NRSROs, nonetheless would be excluded from the disclosure requirement. (Letter from A.B. Krongard, Chief Executive Officer, Alex. Brown, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 14, 1994), at p.6). The rule language states that a broker-dealer would be required to disclose when a security was not rated by an NRSRO. Accordingly, if a single NRSRO has rated a security, then it follows that no disclosure would be required. 60 See, e.g., Letters from Grant T. Callery, Vice President/General Counsel, NASD (July 26, 1994); and Robert Reeves, Sr. Vice President, Ferris Baker Watts, Incorporated (June 14, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 61 One commenter argued that disclosure of ratings, and in particular ratings below investment grade, would better assist investors in comparing an unrated security that may be of a high credit quality with one that, while rated, may be of lesser credit quality. See Letter from James H. Morgan, President/Chief Operating Officer, Interstate/Johnson Lane, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 14, 1994). The Commission will revisit the issue of whether Rule 10b-10 should require the disclosure of ratings for corporate debt securities once commenters have responded to a recent Commission proposal addressing the feasibility of disclosing ratings in a prospectus. See Securities Act Release No. 7086, (Aug. 31, 1994), 59 FR 46304. Ten commenters opposed the disclosure requirement on the grounds that requiring this disclosure may be unhelpful to investors. They argued that such disclosure may cause investors to believe that unrated securities are inferior to rated securities, when the unrated security may pose less risk than a rated security, particularly a security rated below investment grade. 62 They noted that such disclosure does not explain the reasons why a security may not have a credit rating_notably that smaller, but no less sound, issuers may not wish to bear the expense of obtaining a credit rating. 63 Commenters also questioned why the Commission excluded from the disclosure requirement only government securities defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act. 64 In particular, Freddie Mac argued that securities issued by government sponsored enterprises (``GSEs''), including those issued by Freddie Mac, also should be excluded from the disclosure requirement. Freddie Mac argued that, because of the market's assessment of the creditworthiness of GSEs, it makes little economic sense for a GSE to bolster its creditworthiness with an independent rating. 65 Finally, some commenters believed that the MSRB should adopt any rule affecting the municipal securities market; other commenters were neutral whether the Commission or the MSRB implemented rulemaking. 62 See, e.g., Letters from Sullivan & Cromwell (July 15, 1994); R. Fenn Putman, Chairman, PSA (June 20, 1994); and Jon S. Corzine, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (June 15, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 63 One commenter noted that rural issuers would be harmed by the disclosure requirement because the size of a rural issue makes bearing the expense of obtaining a rating economically impractical. See Letter from Ian B. Davidson, Chairman, and Kreg A. Jones, Chief Operating Officer, D.A. Davidson & Co., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 14, 1994). 64 See, e.g., Letter from Mitchell Delk, Vice President/Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994). 65 Freddie Mac also described the anomalous situation in which, on the one hand, GSE securities would be subject to the disclosure requirement, but on the other hand, rated private label asset-backed securities would not, even though the underlying securities were GSE securities and primarily responsible for the rating. See Letter from Mitchell Delk, Vice President/Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994), at pp. 2&hyph;3. After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 requiring disclosure if a debt security, other than a government security, has not been rated by an NRSRO. Such disclosure would be more meaningful to the investor if it is made together with the description of the security. As noted in the Proposing Release, this disclosure is not intended to suggest that an unrated security is inherently riskier than a rated security. 66 Rather, the disclosure is intended to alert customers that they may wish to obtain further information or clarification from their broker-dealers. In most cases, this disclosure should verify information that was disclosed to the investor prior to the transaction. If a customer was not previously informed of the security's unrated status, then confirmation disclosure may prompt a dialogue between the customer and broker-dealer. 66 Nevertheless unrated municipal bonds, which make up approximately 33% of the market, in the aggregate have a higher default rate than do rated bonds. See Municipal Bond Defaults_The 1980's Decade in Review 1&hyph;2, at 1, J.J. Kenny Co., Inc. (1993). According to this study on default rates between January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1991, 628 unrated issues defaulted compared with 98 rated issues. According to data provided by the Securities Data Company, unrated debt defaults make up approximately 75% of all defaults. See also Public Securities Association, An Examination of Non-Rated Municipal Defaults 1986&hyph;1991 4 (Jan. 8, 1993). The Commission agrees with commenters that all ``government securities'' should be excluded from the unrated debt disclosure requirement, not just those defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act. 67 Therefore, government securities meeting the definition under sub-paragraphs (C) and (D) of Section 3(a)(42), which includes securities issued by GSEs, will be exempt from the disclosure requirement. The Commission, however, does not intend to expand the class of securities subject to the exclusion beyond those defined as government securities in Section 3(a)(42). 67 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42).
