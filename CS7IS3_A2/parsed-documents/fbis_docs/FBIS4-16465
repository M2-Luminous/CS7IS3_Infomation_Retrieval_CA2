The fuel and energy complex will, in his words, be developed by supporting big integrated companies and by encouraging investment in viable oil and gas, coal, and energy enterprises. In his opinion, the Russian government's major achievement has been its policy to consolidate the Russian fuel and energy complex's positions world wide and its promotion of economic cooperation with the neighboring states." He recalled in this connection that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to turn the Lisichan oil refinery in Ukraine into a joint-stock company with Russia to share up to 60 percent of its stock. He also recalled that Russia and Belarus had agreed to share the stock of the Mozyrskiy oil refinery. Russian oil companies will take part in oil and gas projects in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. One of the biggest Russian oil companies Lookoil has signed with the Azerbaijani government an agreement on a 10 percent participation of the company in a major international project to develop the Azeri and Charak deposits. Besides, Lookoil and Ajip of Italy intend to boost oil extraction in Tunisia. According to Lookoil experts, oil gushed out of the first well drilled by Russian specialists in Tunisia. Russian specialists will also prospect for oil and develop oil fields in Nigeria. Shafranik described as a contract of strategic importance the agreement signed by Russia, Kazakhstan, Oman and the American Chevron company to set up a Caspian pipe-line consortium. Such a consortium has come into being and has worked out a project to lay a long-distance oil pipe line from Tengiz to Novorossiysk via Komsomolskaya and Tikhoretsk to transport up to 62 million tonnes of oil a year. The plan also provides for building an oil terminal at Novorosiysk with an annual capacity of 15 million tonnes. "This is the only project to ship oil from Kazakhstan within the coming 20-30 years. Quite autonomous terminals of our industry have already provided for 25 percent of export there. We have also managed to keep and stabilize oil extraction in Vietnam. We have secured an agreement on a Sakhalin-2 tender, have sped up work on Sakhalin-1, have made Sakhalin-3 and Sakhalin-4 tenders possible, which is a tremendous success since a bonus to the tender sponsors alone will fetch $130 million," Shafranik reported.
