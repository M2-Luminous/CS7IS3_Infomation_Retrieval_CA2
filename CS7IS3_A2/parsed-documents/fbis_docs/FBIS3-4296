But the present situation is that the efforts for solution through dialogue have run up against a wall, as inter-Korean dialogue broke down and the dialogue between North Korea and the United States is suspended. In this connection, please tell us whether specific discussion was made on the issue of China playing the role of mediator to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. In addition, you said that you would decide the time when the Team Spirit exercise will be resumed after your visit to Japan and China. What is your plan on this? [President Kim] The one-on-one summit I had with President Jiang Zemin which lasted for one hour and 20 minutes was entirely devoted to the North Korean nuclear issue. Only in the expanded summit talks did we discuss economic cooperation. I think the talks were very serious and beneficial. However, it is difficult to disclose all the conversation between the presidents here. Nevertheless, I told you that the presidents intensively discussed the North Korean nuclear issue. Although much discussion is being made on such matters as the Team Spirit exercise and the Patriot missiles, we never discussed the Team Spirit exercise or the Patriot missile in the talks. My statement that I would decide on the matter of the Team Spirit exercise after my visit to Japan and China is still valid. I am now staying in China. Therefore, I have time before making the decision I promised to make, you will understand this. [KBS reporter Kim Hong] I would like to ask you about the Team Spirit exercise. You said you would decide on the issue of the Team Spirit exercise after your visits. Do you think that the results of your visits will affect the issue of the Team Spirit exercise in any way? [President Kim] As I have emphasized whenever there was an opportunity to do so, the Team Spirit exercise is an exercise for defensive purposes, not an offensive exercise. This is the point that should be taken into account. This concept remains unchanged if I leave the ROK or if I visit Japan and China. [SEOUL SINMUN's Beijing-based correspondent Che Chu-sang] As was noted in the first question, the North Korean nuclear problem does not show any signs of solution. Please tell us whether you have any plan to conduct inter-Korean economic cooperation or to make an active effort for inter-Korean summit talks to bring a breakthrough in this situation. [President Kim] There is no change in my position regarding the inter-Korean summit talks. That is, I am prepared to come to the talks if it helps resolve the nuclear issue. I think that this helps create an atmosphere for economic cooperation as well. [XINHUA reporter] Your excellency has previously said that the economic and trade relations between the ROK and China have been pushed ahead without a hitch. However, for instance, China last year recorded a $2 billion trade deficit with the ROK. As far as we know, the ROK imposes unfair controlled tariffs on some Chinese agricultural products. Do you have any plan to abolish such tariffs for the rectification of the trade imbalance? [President Kim] I think there is a difference in the method of calculating the trade volume between the ROK and China. You said China's trade deficit amounted to $2 billion last year, however that is not true. I guess it resulted from the difference in the calculation. The ROK is now paving the way for easing all the regulations and opening our markets further and will endeavor to have these things handled autonomously to the maximum. In addition, the ROK will direct all possible efforts to balance ROK-China trade. [KYODO News Agency reporter Kotawa] Mr. President, in your address before the Japanese Diet, you looked back upon the past one hundred years of Korea's modern history and expressed a resolve that the ROK will not repeat past failures. In light of this, what kind of role do you think the ROK should assume in the Asia-Pacific region toward the 21st Century? [President Kim] In connection with this question, I firmly believe that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] will become the epicenter of the economy of the 21st Century. In this connection, what I desperately felt during my visit to Japan and China was the necessity for the ROK, Japan, and China to cooperate. An APEC meeting was once held in Seattle. I think we should further enhance the role of the APEC and effectively operate the APEC summit which is slated to be held in Indonesia in January. [HANGUK ILBO Beijing correspondent Yi Kyong-won] I would like to ask you once again about the nuclear issue. The president visited China, which is expected to play a decisive role in the North Korean nuclear issue, at a time when the issue is virtually in a deadlock. Were you aware of the stance China would assume toward North Korea's nuclear issue before your visit? Is there any change in your stance toward the nuclear issue in the wake of your visit? [President Kim] I have already touched on that issue. I had a comfortable conversation with President Jiang Zemin since this was my second summit with him. I met with him several times at the APEC summit. I think it is very important for people to meet often because this will give an opportunity for the people to share their opinions frankly. I think it is not appropriate to reveal all the conversation exchanged in the summit. However what I can say is that there is no change in China's position and my position on the nuclear issue in the wake of my visit. The two sides reaffirmed a joint stance. President Jiang Zemin and I concurred that nuclear weapons should not exist on the Korean peninsula. I also think this issue must not hinder economic development in this region. [CNN reporter Mike Chinoy, in English] Mike Chinoy from CNN. Mr. President, the Chinese have made very clear in the last few days they are strongly opposed to the use of pressure on North Korea, that they are strongly opposed to bringing the issue to the United Nations, that they are strongly opposed to the use of sanctions. Are you at all disappointed with the way the Chinese put forward their position on this issue? In view of what the Chinese have said publicly or privately to you, where does this lead the process of dealing with the nuclear issue which is now under discussion at the UN Security Council? Does this slow it or does this clear any difficulties for moving through the United Nations into trying to exert pressure on the North to open up its nuclear facilities? Thank you. [President Kim] You have asked questions in a very complicated way. I know China has its own views, of course. However, our two countries reached an agreement that the ROK and China will closely cooperate with each other with regard to the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the two countries will hold close consultations on how to deal with this issue in the United Nations and any other places. Of course, how the North Korean nuclear issue will proceed -- I sent the ROK foreign minister to the United States this morning. He will hold consultations with the U.S. leaders and ambassadors at the United Nations. He will also visit Japan on his way back home and meet the Japanese leaders. We will hold close consultations with the United States, Japan, and China. We are also holding consultations with Russia, an important country in our neighborhood, on various channels. I am planning to send our foreign minister to Russia early next month. We will hold consultations with the four powers. I believe every issue can be satisfactorily resolved at the United Nations and other places. [pause for translation into Chinese] Let us conclude today's news conference at this point. Thank you.
