Kan Kato was commenting on a decision by the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to slash income and other taxes worth 5.85 trillion yen as part of an economic stimulative package and to discuss how to fund the cuts in a consultative body to be created within the coalition government. "We now have a system whereby we can solve the issue of revenues," he told reporters. "In a wide sense, we have managed to come through with putting the tax reduction together with a tax increase." Kato said he will keep a keen eye on discussions to be made in the consulting body. "We have put off deciding on the revenues, but we must come to a conclusion by the end of the year. The Tax Commission will keep participating in the struggle," he said.
