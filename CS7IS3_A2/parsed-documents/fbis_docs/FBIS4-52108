FBIS4-52108 "dreas088_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 South Korea Yen Rise Boosts Heavy, Chemical Industry Export Yen Rise Boosts Heavy, Chemical Industry Export SK0605034994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0243 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605034994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The continued strength of the Japanese yen is helping boost exports by the Korean heavy and chemical industries, sources said Friday. In the semiconductor area, Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar Electronics Co. and Hyundai Electronics Co. are engaged in full operation to meet rising demand for the third quarter. As for home electronic appliances, the companies are moving to meet strong demand from Southeast Asia and are busy increasing their competitiveness against Japanese goods. A Goldstar official said, "in the first quarter exports rose 25 percent from the same period last year and sales in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand jumped more than 100 percent. Exports are their most active since 1988." Production of such electronic parts as cathode-ray tubes and refrigerator compressors is insufficient to satisfy surging demand from abroad and Goldstar has expanded its video cassette recorder production lines. Korean automakers plan to raise prices in the United States, Europe and Latin America because their Japanese rivals will inevitably have to hike prices due to the yen's strength. The shipbuilding industry recovered vigor in April and the petrochemical industry is in contact with Southeast Asian buyers who are snubbing Japanese products due to rising prices. But the machinery industry here must import some important parts from Japan, causing it to suffer from the strong yen, the Korea Association of Machinery Industry said.
