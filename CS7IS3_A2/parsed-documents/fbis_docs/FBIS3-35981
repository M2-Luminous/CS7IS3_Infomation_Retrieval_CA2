"In their current form, the inter-bank and inter-governmental agreements will undoubtedly inflict colossal economic damage on Russia, spur inflation, and sharply bring down the Russian citizens' living standards," says the faction's statement circulated on Monday. The document says, however, that Russia's Choice favors Russia's economic integration with Belarus and other former Soviet republics on clear-cut terms. The terms on which the two states' monetary systems might be united are as follows: 1. The unification of the budget, taxing, crediting, financial, customs, foreign-trade and monetary legislation; 2. The levelling of the two states' economic indices, above all the budget deficit, and the rates of credit emission and inflation; 3. The Belarusian national currency shall be exchanged for the ruble at a rate fixed on the free currency market; 4. Credits and cash shall come strictly from one emission center. Only on these terms will integration be equitable and mutually advantageous for the states concerned, says Russia's Choice.
