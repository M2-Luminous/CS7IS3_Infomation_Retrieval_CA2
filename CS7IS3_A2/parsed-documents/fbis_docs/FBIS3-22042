These individuals received the benefit of a "no cause" verdict on Friday, 14 January. The new "evidence" reportedly was turned over to the prosecutor this Thursday morning, during a visit to the DNCD headquarters, where a meeting was held with high officials of the antidrug agency. The content of the report said to have been prepared by the DNCD legal office was not explained. However, the statement was made that, "it is consistent to keep those benefiting from the `no cause' verdict in prison, and to take them to the criminal court." Those who benefited from the release order of the Santo Domingo Classification Chamber are Roberto Antonio Tonos Mauad, Ramon Emeregildo Abreu Diaz, Guillermo Enrique Torchio Hernandez, Manuel Orlando Barrcus, Julio de Jesus Sanchez, Tirson Cesar de Leon Reyes, Julia Rosina Oneyda de la Cruz, Carlos Juan Robles Sosa, Benito Rodriguez Nunez, Anibal Alcantara de los Santos, Julio Valentin Alcantara Rosario, Francisco Valdez Garcia, Benjamin Valdez Jaquez, and Sergio Tulio Fontana. The attorney general of the Republic, Efrain Reyes Duluc, and the prosecutor of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals, Jose Leonardo Duran Fajardo, investigated to learn whether there were any anomalies in the release order that benefited the accused. Dr. Duran Fajardo claimed that the investigation had been ordered because of "charges and information" to the effect that this decision had been handed down improperly. The judges who issued the "no cause" verdict are Jose Ramon Lantigua, of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals; Danilo Diaz Diaz, of the National District's Ninth Chamber of Criminal Proceedings; and Juan Ubaldo Castillo, of the Monte Plata court. The notice of the Classification Chamber's decision was given to the National District prosecutor's office on Monday, 17 January, through the Criminal Department. Prosecutor Gonzalez Hardy began studying the case records on Tuesday, 18 January, and, on Wednesday, the 19th, announced that he would sign the release order if no new charges were submitted to him against the accused. The official said that he would take note of Dr. Duran Fajardo's statements regarding the investigation of the Classification Chamber's decision. The procedure has been established whereby, after the Classification Chamber's "no cause" verdict is officially announced, the Public Prosecutor's Office has 48 hours to order the release of those benefiting from the decision, if no new charges are brought to reopen the case.
