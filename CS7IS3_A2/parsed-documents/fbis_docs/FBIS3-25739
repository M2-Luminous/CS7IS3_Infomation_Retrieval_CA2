[Begin Santos recording] I would like to express my gratitude for the warm reception my team and I have been given. Our visit is in keeping with the excellent relations of friendship and cooperation our countries enjoy. This time, we have taken advantage of our stay in France to discuss bilateral relations and certain specific issues, notably those pertaining to the Angolan peace talks and economic relations. This means that we are leaving France quite happy with the positive results we have achieved. (?It is natural) that journalists should try to learn whether the arms embargo issue was raised and whether Angola asked for French military support. I shall tell you immediately that we did not do so. We came here principally to discuss bilateral relations, issues relating to economic cooperation, and how France could intervene indirectly in southern and central Africa to help create a climate that will favor negotiation and permit the successful implementation of an eventual accord between the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, in Lusaka. I was also privileged to receive distinguished French figures -- notably businessmen -- in my apartment. I am talking about the chairmen of Total, Elf Aquitaine, and Aerospatiale companies, all of which have special relations with Angola, because they have mutually advantageous relations with Angolan companies. In general terms, I can say that the representatives of those companies have felt comfortable in our country and have enjoyed our hospitality, which has allowed them to live and operate in relative stability despite the war. I took advantage of my contacts with French Government officials and with the chairmen of commercial companies to explain the guidelines of the Economic Stabilization Program that the Angolan Government now plans to implement. They saw that it is the Angolan Government's desire to create the necessary macroeconomic and security conditions that will permit stabler economic activity, thereby allowing French cooperation in developing the Angolan economy. The Angolan foreign debt issue also received particular attention during our visit. We discussed it with the French authorities, but not so much in terms of rescheduling or paying it. Rather, we asked France to use its influence with international organizations in general, and with the IMF in particular, to [words indistinct] such an agreement would allow our country and its creditors in the Paris Club to analyze and discuss a plan to have Angola's foreign debt rescheduled. I am aware that you, the journalists, tried to report on the situation in Angola, the work being done by my government, and bilateral relations during my stay in France. I must tell you that we were disappointed to see that reporting on my country and on my government's work was, in many instances, quite distorted. Be that as it may, we have not come here to issue any formal denial. We want to satisfy the curiosity of the reporters present here. Nonetheless, I must tell you that many of the reports were unfounded. [end recording]
