The petition was signed by LDP lawmaker Yuji Tsushima and 305 other House of Representatives legislators, or more than half of the 511 lower house members. The new electoral system combining 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats has yet to be implemented pending passage of a bill defining the electoral districts. Hata told Tsushima and other petitioners that he fully agrees with the thrust of their petition, officials said. He called on proponents of the new electoral system to work together in their respective capacities to see it realized. Tsushima, deputy chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council, paid calls later in the day on leaders of the Social Democratic Party, New Party Sakigake, the Democratic Socialist Party and Komeito, as well as lower house Speaker Takako Doi.
