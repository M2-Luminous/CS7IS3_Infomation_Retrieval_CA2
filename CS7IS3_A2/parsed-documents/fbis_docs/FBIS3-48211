The Korea Labor Institute (KLI) has recommended the step and Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui has approved it, KLI President Kim Tae-mo said Tuesday. President Kim Yong-sam ordered humane treatment of illegal foreign workers Jan. 13, when the Labor Ministry reported on its new year agenda, and Nam instructed KLI to study the matter, Kim said. The recommendation is based on Article 5 of the Labor Standard Law, which says that a foreign worker in the country and with a contract, even if it is illegal, cannot be treated unfairly on the basis of nationality or religion. There are some 56,000 illegal alien workers in the country and most work for small- and medium-sized industrial companies. It is KLI's argument that the government tacitly approved their contracts by overlooking their illegal presence and employment and it must therefore take the responsibility. Before the Ministry can take any action, it must discuss the matter with the Justice Ministry, which opposes labor rights for illegal aliens under Article 15 of the Immigration Control Law, which says foreigners without residential qualifications as stated by the president may not be employed.
