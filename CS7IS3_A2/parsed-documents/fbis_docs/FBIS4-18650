Rog.: "Defense Imports and Exports: Deregulation Imminent"] [Text] ROME--Even weapons are the target of administrative simplification. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi kept his repeated commitment to companies of this sector: for imports, exports, and transportation of weapons and weapon technologies of a strategic nature, the government approval process will be quicker and more streamlined. In short, this is like a gust of innovation to reduce bureaucracy. This is especially true with regard to the use of the "silent agreement" for continued contractual negotiations involving the import and export of armaments. This type of deregulation is being launched with a regulation for implementing a law related to state holding companies drafted last week by the prime minister and currently being examined in parliament. However, the simplified approval process is not yet operative. Before the Council of Ministers can apply its final seal of approval, the two houses of parliament will have to express their opinion on the measure. An opinion that, in view of the elections, should not be delayed. At least that is what the Palazzo Chigi [the Prime Minister's office] hopes. Quick approval of the regulation governing weapons transactions is also eagerly awaited by the defense sector. The foundation on which the simplified approval process rests is the silent agreement. Companies will still have to advise the Foreign Ministry when they begin negotiations regarding the import, export or movement of weapons or their replacement parts. But if the ministry does not inform the party concerned that the request has been denied within 60 days of receiving it, negotiations can proceed to a conclusion. Moreover, this two-month time limit is reduced to 30 days in situations where negotiations "involve transactions from or to NATO countries or the WEU." Under this procedure the maximum time limit for granting approval for weapons transactions is 60 days from presentation of the request. Thus, the government is trying to speed up the slow, disorganized administrative machine. The 20-day period allocated to the Foreign Ministry for approving transactions with its own permit (not that of the Defense Ministry as is most often the case) is further evidence of this. This accelerated procedure covers replacement parts for arms maintenance and repair, weapons training, and defense equipment which has "already been approved" for temporary export or import. And if the temporary imports or exports are the result of participation in fairs or exhibits, the approval or denial must be issued by the Defense Ministry within 15 days of the request. A separate chapter is also devoted to companies that fall under the so-called general authorization system when importing or exporting. To untangle the intricate administrative web, the regulation introduces a package of ad hoc measures for setting up a special list for interested companies at the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Applications included on the National Register made up of companies in this category would also fall under the accelerated bureaucratic approval process (at least on paper). These applications must be processed by the Defense Ministry within 30 days of the request and have a validity of 3 years. Best of all, control of these procedures has been greatly facilitated. Those involved in these transactions must provide "proof" to the Ministry of Foreign Trade that the goods shipped actually arrived in the destination country, and within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter, they must provide information on all shipments made.
