All other FY 1995 policy changes are included. 2This column only shows the percentage change in payments resulting from decisions of the MGCRB for FY 1995. All other FY 1995 policy changes are included in both simulation models. Table II shows the changes in payments per case for all FY 1995 reclassified and nonreclassified hospitals in urban and rural locations for each of the three reclassification categories (standardized amount only, wage index only, or both). It illustrates that the large impact for reclassified rural hospitals is due to reclassifications for both the standardized amount and the wage index. These hospitals receive a 16.6 percent increase. In addition, rural hospitals reclassified for the wage index only receive an 8.7 percent payment increase. The overall impact on reclassified hospitals would be to increase their payments per case by an average of 4.2 percent for FY 1995. The reclassification of hospitals primarily affects payment to nonreclassified hospitals through changes in the wage index and the geographic reclassification budget neutrality adjustment required by section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act. Among hospitals that were not reclassified, the overall impact of hospital reclassifications would be an average decrease in payments per case of about 0.6 percent, approximately the geographic reclassification budget neutrality factor. Rural nonreclassified hospitals decrease slightly less, experiencing a 0.5 percent decrease. This occurs because the wage index values in some rural areas increase after reclassified hospitals are excluded from the calculation of those index values. The number of reclassifications for the standardized amount have not declined from FY 1994. This is surprising because, with the elimination of the separate rural amount, rural hospitals would seem to have less to gain from reclassifying for the standardized amount. Of course, some of them are hospitals reclassifying for the large urban amount, thereby receiving a payment rate even higher than they would receive from the other national amount. Rural hospitals also may wish to reclassify for the standardized amount even though they are only eligible to reclassify to an other urban area in order to either meet the lower eligibility requirements for DSH payments, or to receive higher DSH payments. The payment impact upon hospitals reclassified for the standardized amount only, however, is significantly lower than it is for hospitals reclassifying for either the wage index alone, or for both the wage index and the standardized amount. The foregoing analysis was based on MGCRB and HCFA Administrator decisions made by March 30 of this year. As previously noted, there will be changes to some MGCRB decisions through the appeals and review process. The outcome of these cases may affect the final results of our analysis, which we will present in the final rule. G. Outlier Changes (Column 6)
