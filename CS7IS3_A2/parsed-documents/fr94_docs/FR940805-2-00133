FR940805-2-00133 FR940805-2-00069 (1) ASTSWMO and others to comment on ``the effect of RSPA [preemption] activities upon States' ability to appropriately regulate transporters of hazardous waste under RCRA''; (2) NYDEC to advise RSPA of the current status of the proposed revisions to the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements, including the proposed repeal of many of the requirements challenged by CWTI; (3) All interested parties to provide further information on whether requirements proposed to be repealed by NYDEC have been or are being applied and enforced at this time; and (4) NYDEC and other parties to comment further on the meaning of the phrases ``store incidental to transport'' and ``transfer incidental to transport'' contained in 6 NYCRR 372.3(a)(6) and (7), respectively, and whether the definitions set forth in 6 NYCRR 364.1(c)(12) and (14) apply to these phrases. On July 5, 1994, President Clinton signed Public Law 103&hyph;272 which extensively revised, codified and enacted without substantive change numerous laws related to transportation. The former Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq., has been repealed and replaced by 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51, ``Transportation of Hazardous Material,'' except as to ``proceedings that were begun before'' July 5, 1994. Accordingly, the preemption provisions in former 49 App. U.S.C. 1804 and 1811 remain applicable to CWTI's application. At the same time, since Congress made no substantive change in passing 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51, RSPA's determination in this matter will cite to the preemption criteria as set forth in 49 U.S.C. 5125. II. Reopening of Comment Period For the reasons set forth above, the period for public comments on CWTI's application is being reopened. Comments may be submitted through August 31, 1994, and may discuss all issues relating to CWTI's application including those contained in comments previously submitted. Rebuttal comments may be submitted through September 23, 1994, and may discuss only those issues raised in comments submitted during the reopened comment period; rebuttal comments may not raise new issues. As previously stated in the October 15, 1993, December 13, 1993, and January 31, 1994 notices, all comments should be limited to the issue of whether the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements are preempted by the HMTA, and all comments should: specifically address (a) the preemption criteria (``substantively the same,'' ``dual compliance,'' and ``obstacle'') described in Part I of the October 15, 1993 Public Notice, and (b) whether the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements are ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' Persons intending to comment should review the standards and procedures governing RSPA's consideration of applications for preemption determinations, set forth at 49 CFR 107.201&hyph;107.211. Issued in Washington, D.C. on July 29, 1994. Alan I. Roberts, Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety.
