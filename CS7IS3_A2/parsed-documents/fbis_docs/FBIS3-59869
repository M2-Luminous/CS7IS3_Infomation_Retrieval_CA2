The United States desire to contain China is being perceived here as a possible reason for its exploiting the Kashmir dispute to further its own national interests. It is being said in influential circles here that the U.S. is not as much interested in India, Pakistan or Kashmir directly as it is in using the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) region to gain direct access to Tibet, sit at the doorstep of China and needle China on human rights violations in Tibet. A second U.S. objective is to compel India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The Kashmir dispute comes handy to the U.S. in trying to achieve this other objective also. The "China factor" is important as the U.S. never reconciled itself to Pakistan ceding certain areas in the northern territory of PoK to China in 1962. This made possible the Karakoram highway and gave a motorable road to China leading to Karachi and the waters of the Arabian Sea. As it happened, Sardar Swaran Singh was India's foreign minister then and leading a delegation to hold the first of five rounds of talks with Pakistan. Some of the senior members of the delegation, including Mr G. Parthasarthy, India's high commissioner to Pakistan, were in favour of calling off the talks in protest against Pakistan's act of ceding territory to China which did not belong to Pakistan. However, Mr Swaran Singh, after gathering a second opinion from other delegates and also those who were not part of the delegation, like Mr Pran Chopra, felt it more prudent to continue with the talks as walking out in protest would be portrayed as India having wriggled out of a situation. During the Indo-Pak talks then, India lodged its protest with Pakistan over its ceding of this territory to China. When China conveyed its displeasure over the Indian stand, it was stated that the agreement provided that what was subsequently to be done with the ceded territory depended on the settlement reached. The view of a leading American journalist, Mr Tom Brady, then was that it was a clever move by China to get Pakistan to cede a territory that gave it access to the Arabian Sea and the Gulf region. As things stand, that territory is still with China and it rankles not only India but the U.S. also. It is possible that in this backdrop, the U.S. could be floating the idea of a "unified independent Kashmir" through various Kashmiri groups. There is no hard evidence for this inference but considering that an independent Kashmir might be more amenable to U.S. influence than to that of India or Pakistan, it would be logically desirable from the U.S. viewpoint to cultivate this proposition, more so because of the unforeseeable kind of problems that might arise in the Central Asian region and in Pakistan in the not too distant future. Put simply, an independent Kashmir serves U.S. interests better. It is known that the U.S. policy on China is to contain it and continue to involve China in the world mainstream so that it could convert itself into a democracy at some point of time. Its first major approach to China, incidentally, was through Pakistan when Dr Henry Kissinger paved the way for the President, Mr Richard Nixon, to visit Beijing in the full glare of international publicity. Although U.S. regards Tibet as an autonomous region of China, it continues to use Tibet as an important stick to beat China with on the issue of human rights violations in Tibet. If only the U.S. can get to play a role in sorting out the Kashmir dispute, it feels, it can increase the pressure on China by focussing more sharply on human rights violations in Tibet. In this context, when Ms Robin Raphel spoke of Kashmir being disputed, the U.S. interest in the PoK part therefore cannot be lost sight of by Indian policy makers. It is that part of Kashmir, more than the part with India, that gives direct access to Tibet and China and serves U.S. interests better. There is a strong view among Kashmiri groups also that neither the U.S. nor the European Parliament should be allowed to play the broker in resolving the Kashmir issue. Despite that, if the U.S. does get to play a role because India and Pakistan cannot solve the problem through bilateral talks, the the U.S. could well use that influence, after resolving the Kashmir problem, to force India and Pakistan to sign on the NPT [Nuclear Proliferation Treaty]. Unfortunately, there is no Policy Planning Group in the external affairs ministry today. Such a think tank existed during the days of Mrs Indira Gandhi's prime ministership and was led by Mr G. Parthasarthy. There is a view that such a group needs to be set up now to provide valuable inputs and help avoid the impression that government's responses were of a knee-jerk type. Apart from experts, strategists and academicians, it could also have articulate businessmen who can play an important role in lobbying abroad for India. As far back as 1988, a former foreign secretary had recommended to the government to employ Mr Mark Siegel as a lobbyist for India in the U.S. Taking into consideration that the Israeli ambassador to India has backed India on the cordon around Hazratbal shrine issue, India could build on it and involve the powerful and influential Israeli-Jewish lobby to which Mr Siegel belongs to serve indian interests. At a time when Pakistan is going all out to befriend and convert U.S. Senators and British MPs [Member of Parliament] to support its weak case on Kashmir, observers feel it would be prudent for India to get its act together and make the best of its strong case on Kashmir which might otherwise go by default. Also interesting is the fact that relations between Israel and China are warming up as are Sino-Indian relations. Sources say it is perhaps time for a New Delhi-Beijing-Tel Aviv axis to swing into operation to thwart evil designs on Kashmir.
