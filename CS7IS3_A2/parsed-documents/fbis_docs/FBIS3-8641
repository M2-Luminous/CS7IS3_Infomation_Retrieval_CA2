Our correspondent Mirjana Rakic is on the phone from Vienna. Good evening, colleague Rakic. We waited for 10 days. What has actually happened now? [Rakic] Statements, that is, an agreement has been reached. Nothing has been signed in Vienna. The signatures will be put down only in Washington, as Charles Redman said, at the end of this week, that is, around Friday the 18th--the date that was mentioned yesterday. The agreement on the draft constitution of the federation has been reached. This is an agreement in principle on the issues which were not disputed in the beginning--a confederal union. What remains to be solved now are details of measures in the interim period, that is, from now until the establishment of the future federation, which implies the parallel functioning of the existing authorities and interim bodies until the constitutional assembly and new elections are held. [passage omitted] We have not been able to obtain the draft constitution which has 52 pages. Charles Redman said that the draft will be ready tomorrow because it simply needs to be printed. His statement leads one to believe that a great compromise has been reached because, according to him, both the president and the government have great authority. We can see what is whose specific competence only when we obtain the document. [passage omitted]
