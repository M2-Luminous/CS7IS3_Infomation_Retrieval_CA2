I wish to thank you for the pleasant welcome and warm hospitality extended to me. Mr. President, we have held negotiations that tomorrow will be crowned with the signing of the basic treaty between our two countries. This treaty is going to bring our relations to where I consider that they should be, that is, to the level of states that not only demonstrate their natural mutual interests and respect for each other, but, first of all, have decided to move on to the path of effort and intensive work, which should bring them to where their rightful place is, that is, among the developed countries of Europe, because our states respect the same values and nurture the same ideals. These feelings are strongly rooted in the traditions of the European cultural space. Talking about this cultural space, I cannot help recalling that what inextricably binds Romania, its culture and history, to this space is the work of certain creative Romanian personalities such as Eugen Ionesco, Tristan Tzara, Mircea Elide, Constantin Bancusi, and others. In the 19th and 20th century, first of all it was Prague that meant the magic city for them, with an irresistible force of attraction. Prague was visited by [Mihai] Eminescu, the greatest Romanian poet. Constantin Brancusi exhibited his work here before World War I. In the twenties Lucian Blaga came here, and Nicolae Iorga worked hard for Czech-Romanian relations. Allow me also to recall some more painful elements that are preserved in our minds. We recently laid wreaths in (?Klovcie) in Moravia at the monument that commemorates Romanian soldiers who fell in battles 50 years ago, fighting for the liberation of our country. I have realized how close our countries can be. Thousands of soldiers lost their lives in our homeland, fighting far from their homes to free us from the chains of slavery that they themselves had to endure for several years. We never want to forget these ties. Mr. President, certainly we are all aware that our countries, just as in the past, are still connected by a series of historical, cultural, and economic relations. Romania and the Czech Republic represent an image of history and of ancient cultures to which our countries have been host. The traces of this common cultural history can be found everywhere in our countries. And this is not the only thing that attracts us here. Your country is a place with a lot of beauties highly valued by all those who have had the chance to become acquainted with them and I believe this to be essential. Mr. President, I followed with deep emotion the struggle of the Romanians against dictatorship, under whose yoke they were suffering. This dictatorship had very special dimensions and also special consequences. Unlike our struggle, yours could not avoid victims, which seriously marked contemporary Romanian history. Similarly, we have been close witnesses of the stormy events that followed your revolution, and those events made a great impression on us. That is how I got to understand even better how difficult it is for a country to move from dictatorship to a normal, functional democracy. I understood that serious work awaits us, which, in order to be crowned with success, cannot tolerate any delay. Mr. President, it is my wish that our countries should be side by side with other countries in Europe, which will no longer know borders in the traditional sense of the word. There will no longer be borders of misunderstanding and other types of separation but rather borders of frankness and sincere cooperation. Allow me on this occasion to propose a toast for a future full of promises of relations between our countries, to the increasing intensity of these relations, not determined by geographic proximity but rather by the aspirations and joint goals toward which we are advancing together. I am also convinced that our current talks and negotiations will represent a new small brick among those with which we will be building on the certainly very complicated road that leads to the achievement of our goals. I propose a toast to your health, Mr. President, and the health of all our dear hosts, to the health and happy future of Romania's citizens, with whom I am confident that we will always be connected in the future through lasting and friendly relations.
