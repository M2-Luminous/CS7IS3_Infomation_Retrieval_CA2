According to this act, Lithuania has the right to take part in all the events and projects of the Partnership for Peace program. Lithuania has become the second Eastern European state to join this NATO program. The documents of Partnership for Peace were signed by the Romanian foreign minister yesterday. Brazauskas arrived in Brussels today from Holland, together with Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Minister of National Defense Linas Linkevicius. At noon Lithuanian time, he was welcomed at the entrance to the NATO headquarters in Brussels by Ambassador Amadeo de Franchis, acting NATO general secretary, and Adolfas Venckus, Lithuanian ambassador at the European Union. After a brief conversation with de Franchis, Brazauskas went to the oval NATO hall, where 16 NATO members were waiting. In his welcoming speech, de Franchis said that NATO was pleased at this decision by Lithuania and stressed that Article 8 of the Partnership for Peace provides that, if there is a threat to the state taking part in the Partnership for Peace program, to the security and independence of that state, NATO would begin intensive consultations with that state. Active participation by Lithuania in the Partnership for Peace program would step up its rapprochement to NATO. The ambassador of Belgium--which represents Lithuania's interests in NATO--(?Gering) said that the idea that Lithuania should come closer to NATO emerged in this organization as early as September of 1992, after a speech by Vytautas Landsbergis at the North Atlantic Assembly. The Danish ambassador stressed that the Partnership for Peace has been created, not in place of NATO membership, but as a direct path to it. NATO, for its part, will do everything to see that this process develops successfully. In a reply speech, delivered in English, Brazauskas stressed that Lithuania's security is indivisible from European security. It is best ensured by joining European structures--above all, the European Union and NATO. Lithuania will strive to become a member of these organizations. Lithuania welcomes the Partnership for Peace program, but Brazauskas thought that it did not satisfy the requirements of states striving to become NATO members. This is a compromise solution oriented toward the future. He stressed that Lithuania, as already stated in a letter to Manfred Woerner, is striving to become a full NATO member. Lithuania supports common aims by the Baltic states to integrate in Europe and will do everything for the further integration of the Baltic states. Brazauskas also stressed that Lithuania, according to international standards, demands a complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Russian Army from the Baltic states. Russia's statements about the near abroad and about its rights to maintain peace on the former Soviet Union's territory have nothing in common with the international law and the Partnership for Peace program. Brazauskas expressed his belief, in conclusion, that a day will come when the Lithuanian president will sign in this hall a document stating that Lithuania has become a full NATO member.
