The budget is austere, and its defense by the parliamentary majority was flaccid and unconvincing, Ivan Kostov declared on behalf of the parliamentary group of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces]. He added -- I quote his words: It is so because it is not proposed by a responsible political force and a stable executive power with clear economic policies. The budget is connected with an increase in the tax burden, which is not a gesture toward private business and the population. [no reference to close of quotation as heard] According to Nora Ananieva, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] parliamentary group, the budget, in its adopted interim form, contains a number of chances both for various social strata in the country and for Bulgaria to obtain foreign financing. Stefan Bozhilov of the New Alliance for Democracy declared that the imperfections in the budget are due to the legacy of communist rule. The Rights and Freedoms Movement positively assessed the budget, despite the failure of the privatization process so far. The final adoption of the budget is tied up with many demands relating to the structural reform, the social sphere, and science and education.
