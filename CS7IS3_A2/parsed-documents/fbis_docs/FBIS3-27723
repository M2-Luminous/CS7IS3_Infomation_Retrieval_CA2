"We agreed to resolve this issue in this manner in consideration of the state and the people," Hosokawa said at a joint news conference with Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). "I am filled with deep emotion," Hosokawa said about the way legislation had been concluded, after signing a 10-point agreement on the final shape of the four-bill package. Kono, who signed the accord after Hosokawa, said they confirmed that the two are responsible for tackling international and domestic challenges now that the conclusion of the debate on long-delayed political reform is assured. "We could not have reached the agreement without the spirit of concession," he said. "I am happy that we reached the accord." Hosokawa and Kono negotiated for nearly six hours with only brief breaks from Friday night to early Saturday, the final day of the current extraordinary Diet session. Hosokawa had staked his political future on enactment by Saturday of necessary measures to revamp Japan's corrupt political system through electoral changes and tighter curbs on campaign funding. The agreement calls for replacing the present 511 multiseat constituencies for the House of Representatives with a mix of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats. The accord also provides one fund-raising group for each politician to receive donations from businesses and organizations. The government's political reform bills will win parliamentary clearance on Saturday, but will be revised in the next regular Diet session, according to the compromise deal. Hosokawa, who heads the seven-party coalition government, revealed he will hold another round of talks with Kono early next week to discuss the languishing Japanese economy and the Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and other issues of national concern. Hosokawa noted that he had to make some painful decisions against the largest force in the coalition, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], in his talks with Kono. While acknowledging that the revision amounts to a retreat from the government's original package, the premier noted the amended legislation would make the flow of corporate and organizational donations to individual politicians "more transparent, at least than under the current law." The SDPJ had demanded that individual legislators be prohibited from receiving such money, which is seen as a root cause of rampant graft in Japanese politics. Asked if the joint appearance before the press with his political archrival Kono will affect the framework of the ruling coalition, Hosokawa said, "honestly, I cannot make any prediction." Kono said a number of national challenges, including the bilateral trade talks with the United States and the sluggish economy, are critical to the quality of life in Japan, and he expressed the LDP's readiness to supply the coalition government with its expertise and manpower. The LDP held the reins of government for 38 years until last August, when Hosokawa's coalition knocked the party from power. Hosokawa said he and Kono concurred that there are numerous issues that cannot be resolved without making a "political truce" between the two factions.
