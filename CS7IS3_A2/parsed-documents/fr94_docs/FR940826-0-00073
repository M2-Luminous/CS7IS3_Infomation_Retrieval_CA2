FR940826-0-00073 FR940826-0-00016 51. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other small business applicant, may sell a larger portion of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements for small businesses. Specifically, the gross revenues and net worth of all investors holding more than 25 percent of the company's passive equity (as defined to include 15 percent or more of the voting stock) will be attributed toward the $40 million cap and the $40 million personal net worth standard. In this event, the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting stock. 52. De Facto Control Issues. We shall codify in our rules a provision explaining more explicitly the term ``control,'' so that applicants will have clear guidance concerning the requirement that a control group maintains de facto as well as de jure control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for narrowband PCS. For this purpose, we shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small business. These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in which an entity might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, and thus provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA rules, our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1 percent of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure de facto control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the Second Report and Order, designated entities must be prepared to demonstrate that they are in control of the enterprise. 92 92 Second Report and Order at Â¶278, citing Intermountain Microwave, 24 Rad. Reg. 983, 984 (1963). 53. In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order, we concluded that designated entities might be permitted to receive benefits based on their participation in consortium on a service specific basis, but believed generally that such a consortium should not be entitled to qualify for measures designed specifically for designated entities. As a general matter, we shall continue to adhere to that principle. We think, however, that in the narrowband PCS service, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate in auctions and to become strong narrowband PCS competitors. Because of the exceptionally large capital requirements associated with acquiring a license in this service, we agree with the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy that, so long as individual members of the consortium satisfy the definition of a small business, the congressional objective of ensuring opportunities for small businesses will be fully met. Individual small entities that join to form consortia, as distinguished from a single entity with gross revenues in excess of $40 million, still are likely to encounter capital access problems and, thus, should qualify for measures aimed at small businesses. We do not believe however, that this congressional goal will be satisfied if special measures are allowed for consortia that are ``predominantly'' or ``significantly'' owned and/or controlled by small businesses. This would have the effect of eviscerating our small business definition criteria and would not further the ability of bona fide small businesses to participate in PCS services. 54. Financial Benefits. To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional requirements. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock and at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority- and women-owned businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members. In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of the corporation, the control group members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock in his or her possession, subject, of course, to any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution of equity. 55. Partnerships and other non-corporate entities will be subject to similar requirements. Indicia of ownership that we will consider in non-corporate cases include (but are not limited to) (a) the right to share in the profits and losses, and receive assets or liabilities upon liquidation, of the enterprise pro rata in relationship to the designated entity's ownership percentage and (b) the absence of opportunities to dilute the interest of the designated entity (through capital calls or otherwise) in the venture. As with corporations, our concern is ensuring that the economic opportunities and benefits provided through these rules flow to designated entities, as Congress directed.
