Our people is leading a true ideological life in a socialist society centred on the popular masses, the article says, and goes on: Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of man first of all because it makes all the members of society live and develop as true human beings with independent ideology. An ideological life assumes a class nature in all societies. Socialism ensures the popular masses an ideological life suited to the nature of the social man. In the socialist society where the social and economic basis breeding outdated idea has been destroyed and a class confrontation removed, the ideological life of the people is based on the revolutionary idea of the working class. The ideological basis of our socialism is the chuche idea, the greatest guiding idea of our era, and there is a revolutionary ideological education system established by the party in our country. So all the working people in our country are being firmly prepared to be true people with independent ideology and they fully enjoy a worthy life as master of their destiny and the master of the state and society. Today our people accept the chuche idea as their faith out of their vital demand and devote all their energy and wisdom to the consolidation and development of our style socialism, closely united around the party and the leader. And the whole society is overflowing with the noble communist trait of sharing the destiny and bitters and sweets helping and leading each other forward. Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of the social man also because it is a precious life which makes all the people truly glorify the noblest political integrity. Man has socio-political life as well as physical life. Physical life is a life of man as the organism of living thing whereas the socio-political life is the life of man as a social being. Man, a social being, holds socio-political life dearer than physical life, and the true dignity and value of man lie in having and glorifying socio-political life. A man can live a life worthy of humanity with socio-political life only when he shares destiny with the socio-political collective united organisationally and ideologically as its member. Ours is a socialist society of singlehearted unity in which the leader, the party and the masses are linked together as a socio-political organism sharing life and death. It is the true look of the ideological life in our society that the entire people absorb the idea of the leader as the nutriments of political integrity and maintain blood ties with the socio-political organism centering around the leader, embraced in a political organisation. Our socialism is vigorously advancing, flying high the banner victory in the grim ordeals of history, because the whole society is definitely swayed by the noble revolutionary consciousness and indomitable fighting spirit with which the people never give up their political faith ind principle under any circumstances and conditions but share the destiny with the party and the leader, which way the wind may blow.
