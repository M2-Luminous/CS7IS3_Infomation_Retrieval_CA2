According to this document, the State Duma forms its committees "on the basis of proportional representativeness of deputy associations." The State Duma determines the number of each committee, "which should be not less than 12 and not more than 35 deputies." The provision says that every deputy, except the chairman, his deputies, and leaders of deputy associations and deputy-members of the government, should be in one of the Duma's committees. A committee's session is considered valid if more than half of the total number of its members are attending the session. Decisions are adopted by simple majority of votes given the number of deputies attending the session.
