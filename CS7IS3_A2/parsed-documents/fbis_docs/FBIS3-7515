The DP has had to change part of its North Korean policy after a Pyongyang official threatened to turn Seoul into "a sea of fire" last week. The party had insisted on a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. The party used to stress an "independent" diplomacy, calling for talks among the three concerned parties--South and North Korea and the United States. But signs of changes in the DP's stance on the North Korean issue have been increasingly conspicuous since last week. Some DP lawmakers have carefully raised the opinion that the government should refer the nuclear problem to two-way talks between Pyongyang and Washington. They insist that exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea should not be a precondition to the IAEA's full-scale inspection of the North's nuclear facilities. "Instead, the government has to concentrate on closer economic exchange with the North," a senior DP official said. "The principle of independent diplomacy should be changed, depending on the circumstances," he said. DP leaders have rushed to plan a strategy to cope with the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Members of the DP Supreme Council have met every day since last week to decide the party's official position toward the ongoing crisis in the inter-Korean relations. However, they have failed to reach consensus so far because of sharply dissenting views among them. The DP leaders complained that the Seoul government is largely responsible for both the deadlock in the nuclear problem and the rupture of the inter-Korean talks. "Our security-related authorities lack consistent North Korean policies. They have vacillated between tough and moderate lines," a Supreme Council member said. Despite some signs of change, the DP remains unchanged in its stance toward the North Korean problem in many areas.
