The Economic Cabinet met with IMF representatives last night at the Central Bank of Honduras offices to compare figures, in what would be a preamble to the letter of intent that will be signed in March. On 7 February, the Economic Cabinet announced it would immediately eliminate all investment, transfer, and current expenses to reduce the fiscal deficit. IMF representatives argue, however, this is not enough and that it is necessary, among other measures, to eliminate transportation and kerosene subsidies which the government is absorbing. The IMF also says tolls should be permanently established to collect revenues, and the National Enterprise for Electric Power (ENEE) and the National Autonomous Water and Sewage Service (SANAA) should increase their rates. In this give and take situation, the government has said it would rather seek other revenue sources than to eliminate transportation subsidies because the people would suffer the most by having to pay more than one lempira in transportation fares if these demands were met. Certain businessmen and economists also believe it is not appropriate to increase public service rates such as electricity, first of all because ENEE does not even have the capacity to meet current energy demands. In fact, electricity is rationed because of the very low water levels at its main source of energy, the "Francisco Morazan" or "El Cajon" Hydroelectric Project. Regarding the international credit organization's demands, perhaps the only feasible one right now is that of establishing tolls.
