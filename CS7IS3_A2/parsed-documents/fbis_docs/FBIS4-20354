This article analyzes the background in the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the current economic and trade situation between China and the NAFTA countries and the impact of NAFTA on China's economy. It also proposes a development strategy that China should adopt. [passage omitted] II. Establishment of NAFTA and Its Impact on China's Economy Due to the fact that North America has always been a key district in which China carries out its economic and trading activities and makes investments, our nation has maintained fine relations and close contacts with the United States, Canada and Mexico for a long time. From Table I, we can see that the share of China's imports and exports in this district ranks third, only next to Hong Kong, Macao and Japan. Furthermore it also has a fairly high rate of growth. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table I.

This will produce a direct or indirect impact on China's economy and its enterprises. We can see this impact from three different angles: A. On Sino-U.S. Trade 1. China's trading pattern to the United States is basically unilateral. From Table II, we can see that the total amount of China's exports to the United States has continuously increased in recent years. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table II Share of China's Exports to the United States | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |1989 |1990 |1991 | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nation | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |USA |338176 (7.1) |439101 (8.3) |517946 (8.3) |615851 (8.5) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |World |4751584 (100)|5253809 (100)|6209141 (100)|7184254 (100/| | | | | |) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: 1991 Yearbook of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The aforementioned percentage will be even greater if transit trade is also taken into consideration. Moreover, the annual rate of growth of China's exports to the United States exceeds that of China's total amount of exports. It has reached 20 percent, 4 percent higher than the average figure. In addition, most of China's exports depend on the U.S. market. For example, the rate of dependence for the service trade reaches 20.14 percent, that for toys 12.42 percent and that of cotton textile 8.13 percent. However, the average tariffs among the United States, Canada and Mexico will drop and the volume of trade within the free trade zone increase after the signing of NAFTA. Particularly in Mexico where there are plenty of raw materials and minerals, NAFTA will further reduce production costs and help these three NAFTA nations enjoy comparative advantage within the free trade zone. As seen from the execution of the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada, which went into effect in 1989, the volume of trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico will definitely grow. Relatively speaking, the volume of trade outside the free trade zone is expected to drop. This is particularly true for the supply and demand of primary products. The share of Chinese products in the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets is expected to decline. 2. The United States remains the main resource from which China attracts its foreign investments. Table III shows that except for Hong Kong, Macao and Japan, the United States ranks top among all other countries and districts. What is more, its rate of growth ranks top among all the nations, exceeding Hong Kong, Macao and Japan. It accounts for 13.31 percent of the negotiated foreign investments in China. However, after the signing of NAFTA, investments from any country outside the free trade zone in the other two NAFTA countries will enjoy the national treatment [of the third NAFTA country]. In addition, the NAFTA nations will make more direct investments in each other's territories. Especially Mexico needs a large amount of construction funds. It also shares a long boundary line with the United States. This will attract more U.S. factories and businessmen to make investments and run factories in Mexico, causing a shift of investments and eventually affecting China's attraction of foreign investments. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table III.

B. On Sino-Mexican Economic Relations and Trading 1. As seen from the trade pattern, the main exports from Mexico to the United States include fish, fruits, coffee, petroleum, chemicals, products made of metallic materials, clothing, electronic parts and transport equipment. This kind of export mix is similar to China's export mix to the United States. It is mainly composed of labor-intensive products. The signing of NAFTA is of great disadvantage to China's exports. Let us take cotton textile and clothing as an example in the following table: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table IV. Cotton Textile and Clothing Exported From China to World's Major C-| |ountries and Districts () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Year |Hong Kong |Japan |NAFTA |Others | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cotton Text-|1990 |24.92 |11.99 |15.71 |47.38 | |iles | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |36.33 |14.67 |15.87 |33.13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Clothing |1990 |31.09 |18.31 |22.98 |27.62 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |39.05 |16.98 |19.62 |24.35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Same as Table II | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From this table, we can see that the share of China's cotton textiles and clothing exported to the North American Free Trade Zone is 15.87 percent and 19.62 percent respectively which are considerably large. After the signing of NAFTA, some of China's share on the North American market will be replaced by NAFTA nations (particularly Mexico). Moreover, it is not likely that China will be able to shift its export of cotton textiles and clothing to other markets due to limitation of the tariffs and the quota system. Therefore, China will face a fierce challenge. Furthermore, Mexico is located at the center of the North American market. It has maintained traditional ties with the United States. It is a country with a strong industrial foundation with which foreign investors often attain higher profits from their investments. As a NAFTA nation, Mexico enjoys preferential treatments which make its products much more competitive. 2. Due to the fact that NAFTA nations ordinarily enjoy national treatment in making direct investments in each other's territory, they may shift their investments in non-NAFTA nations to NAFTA nations. This is of disadvantage to China's attraction of foreign investments and its opening-up policy. 3. Because of the signing of NAFTA, various countries (particularly the third world nations) will make investments to run factories in Mexico in the hope to enter the two major markets in the United States and Canada through Mexico. This will become a strong external barrier to China's enterprises in entering the Mexican market and the U.S. market via Mexico. C. On Sino-Canadian Economic and Trade Relations Canada is the largest trade partner of the United States. However, Canada's exports have already reached 18 percent of the total volume of U.S. imports. Moreover, the average of tariff rate between the two countries is only 3.5 percent, while some of the products are already duty-free on the basis of the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement which went into effect in 1989. Therefore, it is not likely that people would favor Canadian products more because of the elimination or further reduction of tariffs. Thus, there will be little effect on any third nation to take action for "trade diversion." On the other hand, by comparing what China exports to the United States with Canadian products, we can see that China's exports to the United States are mainly composed of clothing, woodwork, rubber products, shoes, porcelain and other labor-intensive products, while Canadian exports to the United States are mainly composed of auto-parts, foodstuff, raw materials and automobiles. The comparative earnings of the Canadian exports are on automobiles, auto-parts and its abundant natural resources. Therefore, there are not much products exported by China to the United States that are duplicating Canadian exports. Thus the impact of the NAFTA is not so sharp on China as far as Canada is concerned. III. Development Strategy That China Should Adopt On the basis of the aforementioned analysis, China should adopt the following development strategy to promote its export business, trade and overseas investments in light of the establishment of NAFTA: 1. Due to the fact that the United States has always been China's major trade partner for a long time, China should continue to expand its export market in the United States, promote its trade whenever possible and avoid shifting its investments. Many people blame China's difficulties in expanding its exports to the United States on U.S. trade protectionism. This view is subjective and unfair. If we judge the situation on the basis of the indexes such as the average tariff rate, the percentage of import restrictions and the rate of market penetration by imports, U.S. trade protectionism is still not so severe among the developed countries, particularly in its trade with the developing nations. Although the United States practices trade protectionism in automobile, textile and shoe industries, it is quite common that some quotas have not been fully used up for some of the products now placed under protection. Meantime, the U.S. market is the largest one in the world. During the 1980's it has absorbed about 40 percent of the products turned out by developing countries, about one-fifth of the total exports of these countries. At the same time, we should carry out multilateral cooperation with U.S. transnational companies at different levels, and encourage such companies to make direct investments in China to manufacture products which we must produce with high marginal costs or buy import substitutes at all times. While letting such companies have access to a part of our market, we must strive to gain access to their U.S. sales channels and use their influence to increase the volume of our exports to the United States. 2. As seen from the situation in Canada, our enterprises should energetically increase their exports to Canada. According to statistics compiled by a department concerned, Canada has always had a trade surplus with China. We may try to increase our exports to Canada through bilateral trade talks between the two countries. Naturally we must also make sure that our own enterprises understand what the Canadian consumers need and turn out more products that cater to the needs of the Canadian people. 3. In addition to increasing our exports to the United States and Canada, we should also make use of our available high technology to make direct investments in the United States and Canada. We may invest in the United States and Canada to manufacture high-tech products and those products that are not so easy to copy or imitate. We may also manufacture, in Mexico, those products that we will be able to produce by using the local cheap labor such as clothing, shoes and light industrial products. The main objective is to acquire high technology and avoid tariff barriers. It is quite difficult for an investment enterprise to acquire high technology on the market, because high technology is often protected by intellectual property rights. By making direct investments, it is relatively easy for any investment enterprise to acquire such technology. Our experience shows that the proceeds of such investment are often higher than the actual investment cost. Also, direct investment is a more effective method to avoid paying high customs duties. By making direct investments in the United States and Canada, we will increase our ability in "market penetration." Once we gain a strong hold in these two countries, it will be quite easy to export our products to Mexico and other Latin American countries through the North American Free Trade Zone. Naturally the production costs are high in these two areas. Therefore, we must select high-tech industries to make our investments. 4. In addition, we cannot pay attention to the United States and Canada only. We should also realize that Mexico will become China's new trading partner. With the establishment of NAFTA, Mexico will become a place contested by the strategists from all the countries in the world. The entrepreneurs in China should seize this favorable opportunity as soon as possible to build their own base areas in Mexico as a springboard to enter the United States and Canada. Considering the actual situation among our enterprises and the characteristics of the North American Free Trade Zone, we can see that there are two types of enterprises which will become our main force in entering the North American Free Trade Zone. One type of enterprises comprises large and medium-sized industrial enterprises or enterprise groups in the manufacturing industry and the textile industry. After accumulating experiences and absorbing imported technology for the past several years, most of these enterprises and enterprise groups have become large in size and advanced in technology. However, their further development is restricted by the saturated domestic market and the dwindling natural resources. All this forces them to compete with other countries on the international market. Another type of enterprises comprises large and medium-sized enterprises in trading and service trades including trading companies of all kinds of specialties. They have been doing import and export businesses for a long time, and they are predominant in handling business transactions and making full use of their financial resources. If they are given preferential treatments by the government, they can quickly enter the United States, Mexico and Canada on a large scale. They may also enter Mexico in the form of joint ventures or cooperative enterprises, because the economies in China and Mexico are complementary to a greater extent, and there are many opportunities to cooperate with each other. Furthermore, Mexico does not demand very high standards for engineering goods. It is also comparatively flexible in conducting performance and quality tests. Its standards are similar to those of China for its export products. This will provide Chinese products and enterprises an excellent opportunity to enter the Mexican market. 5. When China's multinational enterprises select the Mexican market as a springboard to enter the U.S. and Canadian markets, they should pay attention to the following issues. One is the issue on the point of origin. In an effort to prevent any third country from using Mexico as a "springboard" to sell its goods in the United States, America has joined Mexico and Canada in formulating strict rules and regulations on the place of origin to guard against the import of such goods. As for those sensitive goods such as textile products, the United States may possibly limit their imports by imposing a certain quota. According to the NAFTA provisions, foreign products are duty free only when more than 50 percent of the production cost of such foreign goods are from U.S. and Canadian sources. Another issue is that we cannot regard the Mexican market as a springboard for transit trade. Nor should we concentrate all our efforts in transit trade only. This will prevent us from improving our production quality and increasing varieties. We should regard the Mexican market as our major market and the needs of the U.S. and Canadian markets as our guidance to manufacture our products to satisfy the needs of the consumers there. We should also provide better services before, during and after the sales. Only by doing so will it be possible for us to open up the U.S. and Canadian markets. 6. When attempts are being made to set up factories in the North American Free Trade Zone, the Chinese government should energetically support the banking industry to establish branches there to directly serve Chinese multinational corporations. The government should also provide long-term low-interest loans to support large- and medium-sized enterprises to make investments there. It must help these enterprises in various ways to understand the local investment climate and political geography as well as the local policies, laws, taxes and cultural background. It should promptly supply them with various business information and forecasts and make things convenient for the staff members of the multinational corporations to go abroad on business trips. 7. Regional economic integration has become a trend of world development. While seeking to join multilateral trade organizations such as the GATT, China must energetically help develop the regional economy or organize its own regional trade group. Recently some people put forward the concept of "economic China." This merits our attention. That is aimed at combining the production factors of Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao such as the mainland's science and technology and cheap labor, Taiwan's financial resources and technology, and the experiences of Hong Kong and Macao in banking, service trade and market economy; reducing man-made obstacles among the three sectors; and enhancing mutual understanding and trust to work hard for the economic interests of all the Chinese and contend with the world's various major regional blocs.
