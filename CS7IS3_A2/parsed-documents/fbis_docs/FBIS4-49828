Li Ruihuan said that China and Sweden are far away from each other, and have no conflict of basic interests. He said that there is great potential for economic cooperation because the economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. Li said China is carrying out large scale economic development and Swedish advanced technology and management experience could be very useful. Bildt spoke highly of China's great achievements in economic reform, saying that it is important not only for China but also for Eastern Asia and the world economy. The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years. He also expressed Swedish support for China's reentry into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). Sweden is the second stop on Li's five-European-nation tour which has already taken him to Finland and includes Norway, Denmark and Belgium.
