E. Balanandan, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), had this to say: No one on earth matches the strength of Korea that has achieved a steel-like singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the people. It is entirely thanks to the wise guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il with iron will and grit that the Korean people have maintained independence even under the difficult and complicated circumstances where their country remains still divided and they are in direct confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. Mozambican educational figure Salvador Miguel Fondo said: The Korean people firmly believe in, hold in high esteem and follow Comrade Kim Chong-il as their eternal mental pillar, a symbol of happiness and future and a benefactor. He has given all blessings to the Korean people. He is the saviour of the Korean people. The matchless grit, iron will and faith of Comrade Kim Chong-il are unparalleled and infinite. Korea, led by Comrade Kim Chong-il, is always strong. Chester Ndoro, administrator of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, noted: Comrade Kim Chong-il has mastered the outstanding military idea, theories and war tactics of President Kim Il-song in his early years and has the virtues befitting an iron-willed brilliant commander. The anti-socialist campaign of the imperialists is being intensified as never before, but the Korean people under the wise guidance of General Kim Chong-il are vigorously advancing. The Bulgarian paper TRIBUNA said: Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of rare wisdom and iron faith has frustrated and destroyed the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaign of the imperialists and reactionaries by countering their counterrevolutionary offensive with revolutionary offensive, with his swift and bold strategy and tactics. He firmly defended the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation by shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK moves of the international reactionaries with his clairvoyant wisdom and rare commanding art.
