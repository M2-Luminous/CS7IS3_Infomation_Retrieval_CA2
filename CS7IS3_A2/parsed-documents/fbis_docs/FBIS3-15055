Yeltsin stated that the television channel whose influence extends to the CIS countries and to several East European countries should remain state-owned. The name of the channel was not given. We approached Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy leader of the Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, asking him to clarify the issue in question. [Lazutkin] I welcomed this statement by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin with great enthusiasm and hope. Finally, a real opportunity emerges to resolve in a dignified and coherent manner the questions of preserving and consolidating the positions of Russian national television. Ostankino's first channel is a button which is hotter than the nuclear button. In my opinion, the president's address to deputies evinced an understanding of this fact and an awareness of high responsibility. The first channel is working for the long term, for the life and development of the CIS countries and the unification of their economic, information, and cultural areas. [Vystorobets] At the same time Ostankino's corridors are awash with rumors about the company's imminent flotation. [Lazutkin] I would not call the idea of floating Ostankino a brilliant one. There are more intentions here than realistically calculated possibilities. At any rate, I do not know of a single existing model of flotation capable of satisfying the civic and public requirement for a national television channel and ensuring its high-quality and uninterrupted operation. And when all is said and done, the debate over the flotation of the federal channel is contrived and artificial. But it is infectious and dangerous. Imagine, if someone had the idea of floating missile complexes or tank troops. Ridiculous! But the strategic significance of federal television as the most powerful factor in Russia's information and cultural influence is immeasurable. [Vystorobets] Does this mean that the president's address reflected certain views held by the leadership of the Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting? [Lazutkin] I am happy that our views coincide. [Vystorobets] Don't you consider the existence in Russia of two state television and radio broadcasting companies as strange? [Lazutkin] When I speak of the opportunity for a coherent and dignified resolution of the questions of Russian state television, I primarily have this problem in mind. Its solution is quite simple, and, most importantly, expedient. The possibility for the normal development of federalwide television and radio broadcasting, for the normal function of the 90-plus regional state television broadcasting companies will thereby be attained.
