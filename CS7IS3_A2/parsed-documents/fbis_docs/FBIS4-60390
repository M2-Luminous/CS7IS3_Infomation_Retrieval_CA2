"I appeal to all the parties to stop the war and end the Kurdish bloodshed," Barzani said in a statement received by AFP in Ankara Friday. The Patriotic Union, led by Jalal Talabani, and the Democratic Party have both rejected responsibility for the outbreak of fighting Wednesday and Thursday which broke a ceasefire agreement signed May 8. Northern Iraq has been under the control of the two movements since an uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army at the end of the Gulf War in February 1991. Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to the Iraqi leader, Thursday accused the Patriotic Union of breaching the previous ceasefire agreement. Barzani called for joint efforts with the Iraqi National Congress to normalise the relationship. The May 8 agreement, brokered by the Iraqi National Congress, came after two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people were killed.
