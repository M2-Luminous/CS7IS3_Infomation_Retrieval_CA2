The gross agricultural output value is expected to reach 31 billion yuan this year, an increase of 5.8 percent over last year, and farmers' net income will average 1,142 yuan per capita, up 16 percent. The province harvested nine billion kg of grain on two million ha of farmland, up 105 kg per ha. Thanks to expansion of the areas under cash crops, Fujian harvested 1.35 million tons of fruits, 230,000 tons of edible fungus and 1.8 million tons of aquatic products this year. The province's 540,000 rural industrial enterprises generated a total output value surpassing 100 billion yuan and exported 19 billion yuan-worth of goods this year -- both double last year's figures. The governor attributed the good result to the provincial government's focus on rural development. According to the governor, the province is striving to make sure that next year's output of grain, aquatic products, fruit, meat, poultry, eggs, milk and vegetables will be similar to that of this year.
