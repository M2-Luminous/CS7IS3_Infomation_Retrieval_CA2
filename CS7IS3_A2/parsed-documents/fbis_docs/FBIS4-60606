[passage omitted] The president referred to two confidential reports in his remarks. One was about the discovery of "bugging" devices at the Iranian Embassy in London and the other about foreign debts. If he had considered the press to be trustworthy, the best thing to do would have been to call in the press and explain things. His reference to coordination with Western countries should be viewed within this context. In other words, all the lie disseminators and mass media in the West know everything, while no one in Iran does. Our press always gets its major news from others, so the press has no alternative but to refer to foreign news and mass media among its other news sources. If the officials of the country are not aware of this, then they should be; and if they are aware of this and still do not give information to the press, then they should expect such reactions. The president also said coordination of some of the items published in our press with foreign radios that later reported them was negative in value. It is all right if the foreign press cites millions of words uttered by our officials, but when one sentence that we write is cited by a foreign publication or mass media -- and possibly by the counterrevolution -- this is considered to be coordination and cooperation with the counterrevolution. More important still, should the press, which complains about high prices and inflation, be subsidized? Does this not actually mean that if the press is able to overcome its problems, it will cease to report about high prices and inflation? If this ever happens, then the press will distance itself from the people and the people will sever their links with the press because they will clearly realize that since it is subsidized, the press will no longer protest against high prices and the absence of correct economic planning. Has the press not carried numerous articles about economic issues? Has anyone read these articles? Or have these economic views been buried in politicking? As many economic articles have been published over the past four years as in the whole previous history of Iran. But who listens to such analyses? Unfortunately it is apparent that some of the economic analyses have been completely ignored simply because they would have benefited the opposing faction. Theories on how to increase the strength of the national currency have been put forward. But unfortunately the Central Bank, which should undertake this task, has itself become a major factor in devaluing the national currency. As for the esteemed president's remarks that each publication should become an economic analyst and study the situation, this has been done. But it has not yielded any results. Of course it is hoped that gradually, when the problems of some of the theories are clarified, there will at least be a willingness to accept criticism. And this might help us to turn away from the wrong path that is being tread and to chose the correct path--even if only for the sake of the people.
