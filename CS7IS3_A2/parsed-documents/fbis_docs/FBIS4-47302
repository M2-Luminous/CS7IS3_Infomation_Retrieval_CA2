The essential requirements are: field of view ranging from tenths of angular minutes to several angular degrees, angular resolution ranging from fractions of a minute to tenths of minutes, spectral range from 2 �m to beyond 100 �m and thus beyond the window in the earth's atmosphere, diameter of lens or mirror ranging from 100 mm to 1000 mm, photosensitivity within the 10-0.1 aW/cm[.sup]2[/] range, number of objects detectable during one observation ranging from a hundred to a million, usability for an observation time ranging from tens of a minute to one year, and 10-90� width of Sun, Earth, Moon containing sectors. As far as photodetectors for such infrared telescopes are concerned, the design problems have already been thoroughly analyzed and completely solved. One of them is selection of semiconductor materials for the photoresistors which will ensure minimum generation-recombination noise at specific wavelengths of incident radiation: Ge:Hg for 13 �m, Si:Ga for 16 �m, Si:As or Ge:Cd for 22 �m, Si:B for 30 �m. The topology of such low-noise photodetectors and the dimension of their ``elongated'' elements contribute to high accuracy of angle and radiation measurements. The optoelectronic devices for infrared telescopes must be cooled to various appropriate temperature levels within the 4-77 K range, so as to minimize the heat load at those levels. The cryogenic IKON infrared telescope for the ``IK-Obzor'' (IR Field of View) experiment operates with its objective at � 30 K and its radiation receivers at � 16 K. The objective, 150 mm in diameter, has a 5 foot field of view and a 2 inch or 3 inch angular resolution. The telescope has 128 sensitive elements, all 150 �m large, for operation within three respectively 7 �m, 11 �m, 14 �m wide spectral bands. The storage time is 0.1 and the mean-square error of angle measurements is 20 inches. One problem not yet solved is adequate protection against contaminants such as condensates of surrounding gases.
