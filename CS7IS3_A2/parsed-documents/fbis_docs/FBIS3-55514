The prosecution is studiously silent about the defendants' real "guilt" -- their participation in the protection of polling places in Chisinau during the March 1991 USSR referendum banned by the local authorities. In the two years they have been kept in custody these three officers and one private have been punished worse than for murder. They have been kept in Chisinau detention centers in health-endangering conditions. On 6 June 1993 they were even put before the court with traces of beatings on their faces. During his imprisonment Major Vladimir Teterin has lost 20 kg and has caught tuberculosis in its open form; several times he has coughed up blood. The effects of the skull and brain injury and contusion he received in Afghanistan are manifesting themselves in Captain Vladimir Gram, the other paratrooper; he is plagued by terrible headaches. The health of Major Sergey Cherkasov and Private Andrey Khorkov has been wrecked. It would be a mistake to think that the slow killing of Russian officers and soldiers was carried out only at a time when their fate did not attract public attention. In June the court cynically refused to allow Chisinau's N. Pirogov Association of Medical Workers to carry out an independent medical examination of the detainees. Instead of stopping the beatings and giving treatment for tuberculosis and the effects of contusion they were sent for psychiatric observation, which culminated in a finding as to their sanity. As regards Teterin, the detention center doctor issued a piece of paper saying that he is healthy and that it is apparently only a question of "residual fluctuations in the lungs after a previous bout of tuberculosis," as though what was staring him in the face was not a man virtually on the brink of death. No appeals to the law are of assistance. When asked 23 December by the judge whether he had any complaints or statements to register, Maj. Cherkasov replied in the negative: "No. Complaints are useless because they don't give a damn about them here." Representatives of public human rights organizations continue to be amazed by the cynicism of the people staging this court spectacle. First, for some reason a military tribunal is trying people who have never served in the Moldovan Army. Second, the judge, Captain Vladimir Timofti, is clearly trying to drag out the court examination. On 22 December the court session was canceled on a humorous pretext: The judge deemed the tribunal's corridors too narrow to allow such dangerous criminals as the alleged car thieves to be led along them. The next day the corridors evidently seemed wider to the judge, but the defendants -- each of them -- were brought under an escort of two men armed with submachine guns and dogs. The entrance to the tribunal was guarded by an entire platoon with assault rifles. Who was the judge trying to impress? At the session Maj. Teterin refused to give evidence, demanding medical aid. The court's aim, Maj. Cherkasov stated, is to discredit the Russian Army and portray the Russian military as criminals. He bluntly accused the court of carrying out the government's orders and refused to recognize it. Capt. Gram expressed his solidarity with Cherkasov. He demanded that an expert medical examination be made and accused the detention center organs of treating the defendants brutally. Every time I make statements the court does not like, he said, I am transferred to conditions fit only for cattle, to a cellar, to a cell in which 30 instead of 10 people are kept. Citing his grave state of health, the captain refused to give evidence to the court. It is hard to think of the military prosecutor as a person who has not been initiated into the covert essence of the "case," but having seen the defendants even he echoed the defense's demand for them to be medically examined. The judge refused on this occasion too, placing the attorneys in a state of disarray. Viktor Magnushev, a Russian jurist and representative of the Congress of Russian Communities, expressed doubt about the advisability of his participating in the trial given such an attitude by the court toward the defense's arguments. The Chisinau press is full of tearful bleating about the trial in Tiraspol of a group of Moldovan Ministry of National Security terrorists which killed two Dniester region politicians. In two years no information about Moldovan Justice's outrage against the persons of Russian military personnel has found its way onto the pages of local newspapers. The Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian judicial organs, not to mention the Foreign Ministry, are apparently concerned only with searching for a reason to cast four Russian soldiers to the mercy of fate and Chisinau officialdom. The Dniester region press has already expressed the suspicion that the Chisinau leadership regards S.A. Cherkasov, V.Ye. Teterin, A.M. Khorkov, and V.A. Gram as hostages, intending to exchange them for the murderers convicted in Tiraspol. No denials from Moldova have been forthcoming. "Anything goes in relation to Russians! The West will approve of everything we are going to do against Russians!" These slogans, which for five years now have been quietly voiced in editions of pro-Romanian newspapers and sometimes in local corridors of power, can be read between the false lines of the indictments and the admissions obtained by the investigation by recourse to threats and violence. Only a firm word from Moscow can stop what are in many respects reprisals which have already been carried out against Russian military personnel. Are the Russian power structures capable of doing this? The Russian soldiers in the Chisinau torture chamber continue to hope so.
