Speaking on Friday, he told the leaders of West Siberian trade unions, which threaten a strike over pay delays, to consider the workers' demands when developing a new social and economic policy. At the same time, Chernomyrdin made it clear he would not bow to the threat of strikes and would take "unpopular measures" if need be. He called for defaults to be negotiated between consumers, producers and the unions by way of agreements on prices, tariffs and wages, saying the government had no money to oblige their demands. Leader of the trade unions federation of the Kuznetsk coal-mining region Anatoliy Chekis said he was dissatisfied with the outcome of talks with the prime minister who had failed to give a coherent answer to the questions in hand. However, he suggested Chernomyrdin may not have been informed "about our demands though we sent them before." If wages are not paid in time, "there will be a social explosion," he said. Employment Minister Gennadiy Melikyan and union activists are to hold more talks on Saturday.
