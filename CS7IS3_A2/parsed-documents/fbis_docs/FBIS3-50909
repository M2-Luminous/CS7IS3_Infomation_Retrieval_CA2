The Mexican state, one of the most powerful in Latin America, has enough operational and military instruments to resolve this situation without having to resort to scorched earth or ethnic cleansing policies, according to Chilean Juan de Dios Parra, executive secretary of the ALDHU. The expression scorched earth refers to the use of intense military bombings to eliminate all traces of human, animal, and plant life in a specific area. Ethnic cleansing refers to the elimination of a certain race. Parra also added that the peasant rebellion of the past six days in Mexico is doomed to failure and that more than 500 people have been killed, most of them innocent civilians. According to ALDHU spokesman Cesar Mosquera, the figure of 500 dead was obtained by the organization after telephone conversations with Mexican human rights organizations. Official figures from Mexico have only reported the killing of 102 people even though Catholic Church sources in Mexico estimate the number of people killed could reach 400. Clashes between the Mexican Army and peasants from the so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army have been going on since 1 January.
