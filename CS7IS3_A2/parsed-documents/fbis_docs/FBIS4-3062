She said that there are all sorts of rumors about her father's health overseas, which they had got quite used to, and would sometimes joke about. Each day, my father follows his routine practice and completes his set work as before, including a lot of reading. He continues to go for a stroll every day, and we even played bridge together the evening before last. The State Council Information Office called a news conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Media Hotel today, and Chen Yaoban, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, and Deng Nan, vice minister of State Science and Technology Commission were invited to brief reporters on the white paper, "China's Agenda 21-- Population, Environment, and Development of China in the 21st Century," and answer their questions. One after the other, several foreign reporters asked Deng Nan about Deng Xiaoping's health. Deng Nan answered: I quite understand your concern for my father's health. There are often all sorts of rumors about my father's health, which we have gotten quite used to. Sometimes, we joke about them. My father is in pretty good health, and is very much concerned with China's construction, including the entire implementation of the targets set forth in "China's Agenda 21." At the news conference, Deng Nan said: Everyone is equal before Chinese law. Deng Nan made that point when answering foreign reporters' questions on the sons and daughters of some cadres in China abusing their power. Deng Nan said: You have all learned recently that Li Xiaoshi, a former vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. To my knowledge, Li Xiaoshi is also from a senior cadre family background. To my mind, anyone, either the man on the street or the son of a senior cadre, so long as he violates the Chinese law, will be meted out due legal sanction.
