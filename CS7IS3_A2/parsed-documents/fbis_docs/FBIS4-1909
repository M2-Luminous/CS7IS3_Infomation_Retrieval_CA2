Shao Mingyun, director of Shenzhen's Taxation Bureau, speaking after a seminar on China's new taxation system yesterday, said this year's revenue would surge to even greater heights. "Last year, the Shenzhen government contributed to the central government a total of 1.1 billion yuan," he said. "The amount will grow by at least three times this year," he said. China's new taxation system, which came into effect on 1 January, introduced new taxes and various administrative changes throughout the country. Among these, most concern was voiced about value-added tax, business tax and consumption tax. Local manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers have shown great concern about the implementation of value-added tax, seeing themselves as the major targets. However, some of the new taxes might not actually be levied during the current year, according to Liu Xiaoguang, vice director of the planning commission for Beijing's Municipal Government. "For example, the new capital-gains tax on land will not be coming into force in Beijing this year," Mr Liu said. While denying the new capital-gains tax was being ignored by regional governments keen on attracting foreign property investors, Mr Liu said the lack of detailed plans from the central government was behind the non-implementation so far. He claimed the Beijing government's directorate had been followed by the municipal governments of Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Nevertheless, Mr Liu acknowledged that Beijing's property development would benefit from any delay in implementation. Nationally, meanwhile, industrial and commercial taxes brought in 40.7 billion yuan in the seven weeks up to 20 February, up by 27.3 percent on the same period last year. Industrial production in January increased 33.2 percent compared with the same month last year, proof that the new tax system has so far not had an affect on productivity, according to some Chinese officials. But some misunderstanding had arisen as some merchants added new value-added taxes to prices which already incorporated taxes under the old system.
