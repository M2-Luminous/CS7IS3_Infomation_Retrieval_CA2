The two delegations agreed to review the prevailing situation in our country and to adopt an official position on questions that are of interest to them, with the aim of clarifying the statements which had led to divergent interpretations in the past. The two delegations hope that this initial joint communique will serve to clarify all the dark spots and dissipate once and for all the doubts that might still subsist in the minds of some people. 1. Concerning their relations, the CAR expresses regret for any positions it adopted that might have disturbed its partners in the UTD. The UTD, which took an active part in the democratic struggle, solemnly reaffirms its unequivocal adherence to the parliamentary majority. The CAR reaffirms its desire to treat the UTD as a full partner, without which there would be no parliamentary majority, and is determined not to undertake anything on issues of common interest without prior consultation. The UTD is determined to work in collaboration with CAR for the triumph of democratic ideals, in line with the wishes expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February legislative elections. 2. Concerning the leadership of the institutions, the UTD confirms the terms of the 23 March letter, in which it affirmed that the management of the people's victory must be done by consensus, notably when there is a question of choosing government and parliamentary posts. The UTD reaffirms that it has no intention of vying for any of these posts without reaching a prior understanding and consensus agreement with the CAR. Consequently the two sides agree to clarify those points which might have led to divergent interpretations: A. The CAR has officially chosen the post of prime minister. The UTD rallies around this choice; B. Concerning the name of the CAR activist who is to occupy this post, official consultations have been held today between the two parties, a name has been proposed, and the UTD sees no inconvenience about this and accepts this choice; C. Concerning the other posts, the same delegation will continue with their consultations; D. The two delegation have agreed to have more contacts in order to harmonize their viewpoints on a permanent basis in line with the wishes of the people; E. The two delegations pledge to eschew their war of communiques, media, and press attacks, either directly or through the offices of a third party. Issued, in Lome on 26 March. Signed, for the CAR by Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, and for the UTD by Mr. Edem Kodjo.
