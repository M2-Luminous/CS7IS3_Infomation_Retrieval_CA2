This is the radical conclusion arrived at by Yeltsin, having signed the edict "On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises." Will this edict work? There are no particular doubts about this, insofar as the bankruptcy mechanism, which is in the hands of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State Property] and which, in point of fact, represents the last chance for Chubays and the entire Gaydar wing to triumph in the extremely difficult battle for real reforms in the economy, has been thought out precisely enough. In line with the edict, debtor enterprises, having admitted bankruptcy, transfer to the Federal Administration for Insolvency Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo. In doing so, the question of dismissing the enterprise manager as being unsuited to the post occupied by him is fundamentally resolved. Such a severe measure will, undoubtedly, discourage directors from "dragging their feet" on privatization, selling off plant property, awarding themselves huge salaries while the enterprise heads for complete collapse, and senselessly forcing up prices for their own output by including therein unbelievably inflated outlays. Taking the big picture, there is no nonpayments problem in our economy -- there is the problem of the inefficient state sector bequeathed to us from the communist past, and which, owing to political machinations, has yet to be eradicated once and for all. Now, it seems, the time has come to untie the hands of the reformists completely. Such a drastic turnabout in the president's fairly cautious and flexible strategy in economic reform is attributable to at least three important circumstances: First, Russian industry is charging full steam ahead toward the Ukrainian version of total collapse. Second, the voucher-based privatization and the titanic efforts made by Chubays were not, for all that, in vain -- there are now so many joint-stock enterprises that market-oriented directors with the skill to stay afloat under the new conditions have begun to outnumber antimarket ones, who can quite simply be ousted now -- and not just from their jobs, but from the political arena too. Third, the "goundwork" of capitalist reform -- the stage of the primary accumulation of capital -- is nearing an end in Russia. Enormous sums of money deposited in commercial banks are ready to pour into our industrial sector, but on the basis of private business. The presidential edict is opening these financial floodgates, and, to all appearances, a new era which should soon enter the stage of industrial boom is beginning in the economy.
