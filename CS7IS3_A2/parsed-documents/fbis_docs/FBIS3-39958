Sixteen other countries, including Norway, have also been approached. And, 11 Swedes are receiving intensive training in Serbo-Croatian in order to serve as interpreters in the Nordic UN battalion in Bosnia. They are to replace Swedish interpreters of Yugoslavian origin who, it is feared, run the risk of being considered biased by Bosnia's ethnic groups on the grounds of their accents or family names.
