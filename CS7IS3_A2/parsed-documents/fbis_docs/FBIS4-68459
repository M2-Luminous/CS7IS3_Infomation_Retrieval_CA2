Even though the main struggle in Kharkiv took place between the Left and the coalition of the "money bags" gathered around the Kuchma-Grynyov bloc, the former were fatally short of money. Since businessmen made use of their unlimited financial resources and cornered all the mass media, the Left, lacking funds as well as brilliant personalities, fell back on unabashed populism. In the first round, this move was successful: the slogan "there was enough food and drink under the Communists" worked and allowed them to put through their candidates in 10 of the 14 local districts. Adding to this two representatives of the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, we have the complete list of opponents of the Kuchma-Grynyov clan, which in the first round had a 100 percent success rate in the region. The runoff election was preceded by several noisy scandals. For instance, People's Deputy Filenko sued the trade union newspaper SOLIDARNIST for publishing calumnious information which allegedly influenced the outcome of the first round of voting. It was to no avail: he lost the runoff to First Secretary of the CPU obkom Kashlyakov. People's Deputy Meshcheryakov withdrew his candidacy in protest against what he called dirty methods of conducting the election campaign by his fellow-Reform Bloc member Grynyov. His detractors maintain that in reality Meshcheryakov did not have the means to fight a financial battle against the respected Volodymyr Borysovych on an equal footing. Speaking of funds: Socialist Party candidate Milyukha declared on television that the money which the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc spent on the election campaign would have been sufficient to feed the population of Kharkiv for a period of one year. He also added that with that kind of money he would undertake to put his cat in parliament. As no one gave him that money, neither his cat nor Comrade Milyukha himself won a seat in parliament. The Kuchma-Grynyov people wound up their campaign by holding a rock party at the central square of the city, complete with fireworks and local and foreign stars, in order to attract young people. (Garik Sukachev was brought over from Moscow.) It did not work: young people looked at the spectacle but did not bother to vote. The runoff election in Kharkiv marked the victory of the material (funds) over the ideal (even though it was the world's most progressive ideology). The Kuchma-Grynyov group won 5 seats, the Communists 2 seats and the Socialists and Meshcheryakov followers 1 seat each. One more seat went to an independent candidate. On the countryside, the political landscape was slightly different. There, the contest between the Left and the ruling party ended with the score of 8-5 in favor of the latter. One seat was won by an independent candidate. Among those who were elected from the ruling party we find People's Deputies Bandurko and Karasyk, the advisor to Prime Minister Suslov. There were no particular surprises here, except for the Chuguivskyy district No. 385 which elected a Communist, Raykovskyy, surprising even the local nomenklatura. The runoff also produced a scandal, perhaps the loudest of all. Running and apparently winning in the Sovetskyy election district No. 376 was a noted democrat, liberal, etc., etc., etc., Volodymyr Grynyov. Let us not talk about the astronomical sums spent on his campaign: they could not be added up by the KRU, the CIA and the Central Bank of Ukraine working together. There were many other violations, the main of which was the fact that without the permission of the Central Election Commission the polls were kept open beyond 8 p.m. Thanks to this, a needed number was achieved to declare the election valid. But since this did not escaped the notice of the perturbed public, we should expect a flood of letters and complaints to the Central Election Commission. God alone knows how it will end, but it offers a good opportunity to investigate whether indeed our elections were truly democratic and not falsified. Nonetheless, the most important outcome of the election was that there is no Red Dawn in Kharkiv. Neither the Left nor the ruling party passed in the city. Their base remains on the countryside, in villages where even today the collective farm chairman and the head of the village council lord over the population. But this is their legacy: only time will free the countryside from this plague.
