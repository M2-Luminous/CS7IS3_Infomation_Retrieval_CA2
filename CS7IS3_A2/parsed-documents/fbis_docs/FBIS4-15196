As for the instruction of the Russian head of state, according to the explanations, a technical error crept into its text. We remind you that this error provoked a loud reaction in Riga. Latvian officials have accused Moscow of imperial ambitions. Meanwhile, according to an Interfax report, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who came to Pskov today, has stated that the circumstances of the appearance of the said instruction of the president were strongly reminiscent of the so-called version No. 1. Kozyrev gives the assurance that neither he nor Defense Minister Grachev know from whence the instruction was taken or who agreed it with whom. In the foreign minister's opinion, it is an attempt to set the president, government, Foreign Ministry, and Defense Ministry at loggerheads.
