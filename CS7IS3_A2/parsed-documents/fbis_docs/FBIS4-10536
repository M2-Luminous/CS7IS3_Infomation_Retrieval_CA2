Niehaus made this acknowledgment while awarding the Juan Mora Fernandez Order, the highest award given by Costa Rica to a foreign representative, to Chilean Ambassador Benjamin Maluenda, who is ending his diplomatic term in Costa Rica. Niehaus underscored "Chile's will to further its close and constant cooperation with Costa Rica and, especially, the sense of honor with which it has conducted its foreign policy regarding our country." The foreign minister reviewed the deep roots of friendship that unite both nations "since the dawn of our independence in 1821." He recalled Costa Rica's debt to Chile in the fields of health, culture, and education. Many Costa Rican nationals have gone to Chile to study, and, "today, they serve our country with the knowledge they acquired in that great nation." Niehaus acknowledged the benefits obtained by Costa Rica "when thousands of Chilean exiles came to give us their knowledge in universities, the theater, and other fields of culture. We also render homage to the Chile that has been returned to its sons, the Chile that has always been democratic and independent, the Chile of the quiet heroes who held their heads upright when they faced despotism, the Chile that gives its word and keeps it, the Chile that shakes your hand and keeps it firm," the foreign minister stated. The Chilean ambassador expressed gratitude for the distinction and said it marked the wonderful relations between both countries, which "continually grow stronger to our mutual benefit." Chile and Costa Rica march on different roads, but toward a similar destiny of prosperity, democracy, solidarity, understanding, and firm friendship, the South American diplomat stated.
