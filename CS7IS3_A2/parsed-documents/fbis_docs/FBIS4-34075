That is not the wise thing. The people of Ecuador need an answer," Marcel Laniado, the president of the National Modernization Council (CONAM), has said. Laniado has announced radical changes in this sector so that those insured "will have basic choices, with guaranteed future pensions and medical care for themselves and their families when they are ill." In a lengthy discussion with the publishers, editors, and reporters of HOY, Laniado defined the six major priorities in the launching of the reorganization in the state sector. They pertain to social security, telecommunications, airports, customs, the Civil Registry, and maritime ports. At the same time, he announced that both public and private activity will be demonopolized. To this end, a code is being drafted to provide these two sectors with a body that will provide them with adequate service and will denounce any irregularities or abuses. The Six Priorities -- Emphasizing the social security issue, the president of the CONAM indicated that the accusations made about the quality of care in social security indicate that those who are managing this sector do not value life. "What social security has done to us is unforgivable. The workers are contributing 23 percent, but they are not receiving any benefits. Even the widows cannot obtain aid funds promptly," he stressed. After noting that the social security institution is totally disorganized and has had no accounting system for the past 10 years, Laniado announced that plans have been made to establish a parallel system. With this system, the members will know what is guaranteed them, how much they will receive per month, where they and their families can go for medical care, how much it will cost them, and what they will be able to save for their retirement. He said, the system is not so simple, however. This is because it requires a decision on the part of the insured party as to where he wants to deposit his funds, his contributions, in order to obtain the best guarantees and insurance. "I do not know if a project like this can be launched in just two, three, or four months." -- On the telecommunications issue, the president of the CONAM said the entity in charge of this sector is one of the most backward. "This is a corrupt sector, as a result of tremendous disorganization. We do not have adequate technology, and there is an insufficient number of lines." With a view to structural change, finding the best possible solutions, and putting the chaos behind us, bids will be solicited from consulting firms. Concessions for providing services will be granted to international enterprises, and they will bring in new capital and technology. Laniado hopes that this will enable Ecuador to enter the world of technology and telecommunications within a short time. For the modernization and management of the airports in Quito and Guayaquil, similar bids will be solicited, and specialized firms will execute this project in association with domestic groups, using the current infrastructure. "Glorified projects are not required in order to provide decent service," this official emphasized. Maritime port services will also be given concessions. What is wanted is for the vessels to have "an adequate system, one that is not corrupt, as is the case now." According to the president of the CONAM, the ports in Ecuador, and that in Guayaquil, in particular, are not competitive with the ports in the neighboring countries. The vessels arriving at ports in Ecuador face fees that are higher than normal. "There is theft, carelessness, and delay in unloading goods." "There will be a veritable shakeup in the customs service so as to change the current smuggling system, which is one of the speediest paths to illegal enrichment." Marcel Laniado announced that four internationally known enterprises established in the country will be responsible for certifying the invoicing of all the products imported into Ecuador. Each importer will be able to sign a contract with one of these enterprises, which will be paid one percent of the total value of the goods imported. The importer's invoice will have to show certification by this firm, which will calculate the taxes and pay the amount owed into any bank. This mechanism will eliminate import permits, as well as the 22 steps that must currently be completed in order to effect an import. At the same time, it will make it possible for the release of goods from customs within four hours of their arrival in the country. The president of the CONAM warned that any irregularities for which the importer is responsible will entail serious criminal penalties. At the same time, the customs appraisers and assessors, and any possibility of bribery, will be eliminated. "This is a way of making the system honest. The country will benefit from the income generated by the customs duties collected on imported goods." The same procedure will be applied for exports. Prior to the reorganization of the Civil Registry structure, a study was undertaken. Now complete, the study reveals the critical situation in this sector. Laniado announced that as of 31 May, a call for bids will be issued, after which certain enterprises will be allowed to manage the issuance of identity cards and other certificates on a concession basis. It is possible that notaries will continue to provide the certified copies of birth and marriage certificates. To this end, standard offices managed by businessmen interested in providing this service will be established. This, however, will entail an increase in the fee paid from the laughable sum of five sucres currently being charged for a birth certificate to some 5,000 or 6,000 sucres. The system will be automated so as to make it possible for citizens to obtain identity cards in any part of the country. The computer center will be located in Quito, and it will have three sections, with their respective officials -- the Civil Registry, the Supreme Electoral Board, and an internationally qualified auditing department. Defining Modernization The concepts of modernization and privatization are being confused, Marcel Laniado, the head of the CONAM, says. Most people think that modernization means privatization. He said what is to be privatized is all of the enterprises that fail to serve a social function, and those in which the state has no involvement -- the cement enterprises, for example. This would involve initiating the disinvestment process, which is being pursued by the National Financing Corporation (CFN) and the National Development Bank. The state is selling all of its shares in the enterprises in whose activities it has no involvement. Where the other sectors are concerned, this official emphasized that their activities will be parceled out on a concession basis. For example, the Paute hydroelectric plant will not be sold, but will be entrusted as a concession to an enterprise that will manage it and guarantee its maintenance. Similar steps will be taken in the communications, oil, airport, and other sectors. Laniado explained that modernization does not in any way mean unemployment. When efficient private enterprises take the responsibility for providing services, these services will expand, and more manpower will therefore be needed. In the telephone sector, for example, a larger number of lines will be made available, and the number of workers needed to install them will increase. In Laniado's opinion, the private sector could offer better service and management than the state institutions, which have no channels for filing claims. According to this official, there is talk of modernization in the country because there is backwardness in every respect. The lag does not just exist in comparison to other industrialized countries, but in comparison to the country's neighbors, as well. "Our educational system is disastrously behind the times. It cannot even be compared with the educational systems in other parts of Latin America. Thus the situation needs to be changed," he explained. There is also a lag in the technology sector, but the problem here can be resolved more quickly with the influx of foreign investment the country is expecting, which will be accompanied by technological renewal.
