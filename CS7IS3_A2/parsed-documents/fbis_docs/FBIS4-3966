During his three-day tour in the city, the vice premier said that great importance must be attached to the development of occupational education while institutions of higher learning have to achieve both the highest educational quality and the highest social and economic gains. Speaking of the reform in education, Li said that education has a positive bearing on the nation's quality, on the country's prosperity and on development now and in the 21st century. Li, also a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, said that China's educational agenda should include basic education, adult and professional education and higher education, as well as special education such as education for the disabled. In basic education, he said, emphasis should be placed on the spreading of the nine-year compulsory schooling in areas including 85 percent of the nation's population, and on the elimination of illiteracy in areas covering 90 percent of the total population. To achieve greater, faster, better and more economic results in running occupational schools, the official said that professional education should be divided into three stages. He said that students should be given such education in primary, middle and high schools, respectively, to meet the demands of a socialist market economy. Talking about teaching quality and the social gains of higher education, he pointed out that efforts should be made to create new educational patterns for colleges and universities, by way of intercollege cooperation and resource sharing. The vice premier noted that all of society must respect teachers. Officials at all levels should "show respect to teachers." Greater attention should be paid to the work and life of teachers, he added. Li was accompanied by local officials on visits to many universities and high schools in Tianjin.
