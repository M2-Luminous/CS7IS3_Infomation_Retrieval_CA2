FBIS4-44883 "jpjst028__l94019" JPRS-JST-94-028L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 21 February 1994 Technology Transfer Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. To Provide Garbage Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. To Provide Garbage Burning Technology to Chinese Company 943FE0607E Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 Feb 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 943FE0607E Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. (president: Mr. Jiro Hoshino) will provide a garbage incineration technology to China's leading can manufacturing equipment maker, Qingdao Commonly-Used Machine Factory (factory head: Mr. Zhou Aimin, Qingdao City). It is a fluid-bed type which uses sand as a combustion medium. Recently, an agreement was signed with Chinese [Gikishinshutsu] Company (President: Mr. Zhang Han Chen, Beijing City) serving as a contract agent. This is the first time that Japan is providing China with a garbage incinerator. This is in response to China's new awareness of environmental problems, which is gathering momentum, especially in cities. Taking this opportunity, Mitsui is ready to provide technical support in other environmental areas, such as treatment of sewage, plant waste water and flue gases, as well. To Provide Active Support in Sewage/Gas Exhaust Treatment The main point of the contract is that Mitsui is to provide all necessary technologies related to the fluid-bed type garbage incineration facilities, ranging from design, manufacturing, construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as know-how. Also covered by the contract is the implementation of training programs, including those to be conducted in Japan for Chinese trainees. Although the matter of constructing facilities is not specified at present, if it should surface, engineers/technicians also will be sent from Japan. The term of the stipulations is 10 years, during which period, China will have the exclusive right of its enforcement in Mainland China. The Quigdao Commonly-used Machine Factory to which the technologies will be provided, is a manufacturer of pressure vessels and switch exchangers. Since the company has the ability of supplying the various components of the garbage incineration facilities on its own, what it will be receiving from Mitsubishi is technical support in the overall process design. Currently, Mitsubishi Engineering and Shipbuilding is in the process of putting together a design package containing technical materials required in design work and data for analysis. It will take about 6 months before it can complete the transfer of the technologies to the Chinese company. The fluid-bed method garbage incineration is a technology designed to use sand heated at high temperature as a medium for burning garbage. It can deal with all types of garbage, ranging from high-water-content low-calorie garbage to a high calorie one containing a large quantity of plastics. Moreover, it is characterized by high combustion efficiency, leaving very little which remains unburned. Since 1982, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding has delivered over 20 incineration systems mostly to self-governing bodies. Last year, the company delivered a system facility with a daily treatment capacity of 100 tons to Korea, the first time its product was delivered to overseas. As for delivery to China, although there is an instance of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' delivery of a mechanical type city garbage incineration equipment, insofar as the fluid-bed type system is concerned, this is the first time it will be done. China's city garbage is more like what we consider raw garbage, and for this reason, a high demand exists for the fluid bed-type offering high combustion efficiency. Moreover, today, when the protection of environments on a global scale is intensely pursued, the need for treatment of wastes other than garbage, namely, sewage, factory waste water, and exhaust gases, is becoming urgent. Mitsubish wants to provide support to activities in these areas as well.
