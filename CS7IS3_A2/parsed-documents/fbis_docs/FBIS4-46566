[Vaynberg] That is a very complex and painful issue. Mil helicopters are being series produced today at plants in Kazan, Rostov and Ulan-Ude. Some 25,000 helicopters have been produced over all this time, of which 15,000 are in service. Five thousand helicopters have been supplied to 60 countries around the world. Mil helicopters provided 30--50 percent of the currency receipts from all aviation exports of the USSR. The Moscow firm consists of the KB [design bureau] itself, where the development of the helicopters right through to the creation of working drawings takes place, production, where the experimental prototypes are manufactured, the flight-test complex and the test beds, where testing to determine the service life of the item and its systems and assemblies is performed. The documentation is refined and passed along to the series-production plants after the performance of the testing and customer acceptance of the helicopter. The firm had its own branches of various sizes at each series-production plant. The largest was at the Kazan plant, which reached 1,000 people in size. The branches adapt our documentation to the specific features of the actual plant. Those branches have become independent design organizations today, but strategically they depend on the Moscow KB, which heads an association of the developers of Mil helicopters. I repeat that the branches are economically independent, but are subordinate to the Moscow KB on questions of technical policy. The series-production plants may put out only Mil type helicopters under these conditions. This question is painful because after the collapse of the USSR, various types of commercial structures were formed, with the aid of which the former republics have begun to sell helicopters without any preliminary technical expert evaluations and technical preparation, and moreover at very low prices, at dumping prices. Not only selling, but also leasing. The facets of reliability and safety have been lost. The situation needs to be regulated. We have been forced to seek a way out of this situation. I appealed to the Prime Minister of Russia, I wrote that this is a very complex issue; the discussion concerns billions of dollars, but nothing has come of it. The Mi-8MT or Mi-17 helicopters that are series produced in Russia are objectively worth 4--5 million dollars, but various structures are selling them for 500,000 dollars. This leads to the fact that the series-production plants are forced to sell them for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. the losses reach four million dollars per helicopter. The Kazan Aircraft Plant puts out about 200 helicopters a year, and the losses for that plant alone are about 800 million dollars a year. We have been forced to take severe measures. The firm has announced that the name Mil will be removed from helicopters that have not been sold through our own expert evaluation. The owners of helicopters without the observance of our requirements do not have the right to sell the helicopters under the name of Mil. The KB is declining all responsibility for those helicopters. This has been (or is being) reported in all countries with Mil helicopters, and is being stated at press conferences and international meetings. Another problem arises as a result of the separation of the firm of Mil, the series-production plants and the repair and operational organizations. Government organizations have ceased to engage in the coordination of enterprise operations. Each enterprise has to survive on its own today. I have sent all of the series-production plants a proposal to conclude contracts. The firm of Mil assumes all of the obligations of assisting in the sale of the helicopters, performing market research and certifying and upgrading helicopters apropos of the requirements of the international market. The plants should pay the firm a certain share from each craft sold. We intend to conclude a similar agreement with the operational organizations as well. It is very important to conduct an active technical and marketing policy. Our country has to wage a very tough fight against other nations, especially the United States, in the international market for military products. I do not rule it out that the bizarre conversion that is taking place here has not arisen without the involvement of the United States. The correct attitude has only recently begun to be felt of just what our VPK [military-industrial complex] is, and what role it can play in lifting up the country's economy. We will hope that the IDEX-93 exhibition in Abu Dhabi will prove to be a positive move on this issue. Russia will be selling cheaper than other countries to restore its lost position and win new ones in the international arms market. This is advantageous for the country and for the Russian defense industry all the same. Some of the currency received from the sale of weapons must be invested in our military industry, so as to raise the market competitiveness of its products in the international market and carry out genuine conversion in the country. [VPK] The KB used to work principally on orders from the Ministry of Defense. What is the situation today? [Vaynberg] All of the fundamental projects are being carried out under orders from the military. Refinements under orders from the Ministry of Civil Aviation are made for civilian purposes. This makes up at best about 20 percent of the overall financing. Orders from the Ministry of Defense of Russia and direct budgetary work within the context of the state program for the development of civil aviation constitute about half of the required financing today. [VPK] Almost all enterprises in the VPK today are in a difficult economic position. How do matters stand with your firm? [Vaynberg] The times we are living in are difficult, but unusually interesting for people who do not think dogmatically and can approach their work creatively. There are many situations that require non-standard solutions. We still have to adapt to today's conditions. Several joint structures have been created at the enterprises--we have been able to make their work more active. The firm earned a solid amount of money over October-December 1992 as a result. We are engaged in engineering and making use of know-how. Our teams of specialists often go out to study and organize the repair of helicopters on site. All of this has made it possible to stabilize the economic situation of the enterprise, and elicit interest in the work among our colleagues. The drain of specialists has slowed. The average wage at the enterprise is not high, but it is no worse than others. To this should be added free medical care, and food subsidies for the cafeteria. The children's institutions and rest homes for the workers that the KB had have been preserved. I fell that we still have to preserve a firm that is a national treasure of Russia. [VPK] How do you evaluate Mil helicopters compared to foreign ones? [Vaynberg] We are beyond competition in heavy helicopters. The Mi-26 helicopter, for instance, transports 20 tonnes, and there are no other such craft in the world. We are at the same level as Western firms in helicopters in the medium class. The Western light helicopters are better than ours. We were not occupied with that class at all for a long time, since we had no orders for them. Light helicopters are often procured for personal needs, like a passenger car, in the West, after all. We are now developing the Mi-34 light helicopter, and will launch it immediately at two series-production plants. A second light helicopter is under development, and we are planning to send it up in August of 1994. A heavier helicopter, with a mass of about two tonnes, is planned to be put out in roughly three years. A helicopter with a mass of 4--5 tonnes is also starting to be developed. This area has begun at the KB, but it requires greater efforts, because we have little experience in the development of the light craft. [VPK] What relationship do you have with the Kamov firm? [Vaynberg] They are our competitors, and that is a normal phenomenon. Roughly 95 percent of the helicopters produced in the country today are Mil, and only five percent are Kamov. [VPK] It was reported on the radio that your firm is being privatized, and 85 percent of the shares of stock will be under the ownership of the your workforce. Is that so? [Vaynberg] The situation is actually as follows. Fifty percent of the shares of stock, of which 25 percent will be non-voting, will be held by the firm. Fifteen percent will be sold to major investors, and 35 percent will be sold at auction. Our task is to buy the maximum number of shares from that portion, and to see that they do not go to unscrupulous dealers. I feel that it would be proper for a controlling block of shares to remain with the state, since the firm of Mil is a national treasure of Russia, and the state should protect its treasures. But we have not been given that option; either a state or a private firm. [VPK] Military reform is underway in Russia, along with the formation of mobile forces. What will be the place of your helicopters in this, and don't helicopters of a different type hold the advantage here? [Vaynberg] I submitted a report to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation at the beginning of 1992. I wrote that since the armed forces of the country would be cut back substantially, it would be advisable to create a new branch of the troops--mobile forces--and that it needed to be done immediately and with the least possible expenditures. I proposed that the Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters that were in service with the troops--and there are thousands of them--be upgraded and provided to the mobile forces in the next five years. The upgrading should provide for the operation of the helicopters at any time of day and in bad weather conditions, i.e. under all of the natural and weather conditions in which the armed forces operate. Our firm could carry out that upgrading quickly and relatively cheaply. It would be expedient to create special helicopters and flying infantry fighting vehicles in the future that would not only carry an assault force, but also would be able to provide fire support for the subunits landing from them. The helicopters should thus be equipped with missile and other high-precision weaponry. Both the helicopter crew and the assault personnel should be well trained as professionals. It seems to me that the mobile forces should be equipped specifically with helicopters and not other types of aircraft. A helicopter, as opposed to those others, can hover in the air and over a spot, can go up quickly and hide quickly behind some obstacle, and can move almost along the ground. Other types of aircraft do not possess those traits. A dirigible is difficult hold over a spot in strong winds, and is moreover very noticeable and easily defeated by anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as requiring ground equipment for servicing and vital support. I thus feel that helicopters best satisfy the requirements of the mobile forces. The organization of those forces is underway in the Ministry of Defense today, as far as I know, and I hope that my report played some role in it. I thus feel that our firm has a good future, and its products will be needed by the armed forces of Russia, as well as perform many tasks for the national economy.
