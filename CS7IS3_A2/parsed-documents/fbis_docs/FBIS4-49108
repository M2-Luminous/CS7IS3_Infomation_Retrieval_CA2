FBIS4-49108 "drchi085_o_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-085 Daily Report 12 Mar 1994 REGIONAL AFFAIRS East Region `Excerpts' of Zhejiang Court Work Report `Excerpts' of Zhejiang Court Work Report OW0205142194 Hangzhou ZHEJIANG RIBAO in Chinese 12 Mar 94 p 8 OW0205142194 Hangzhou ZHEJIANG RIBAO Chinese BFN [Excerpts from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Higher Court's work report delivered by Xia Zhonglie, president of the higher court, to the Second Session of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on 2 March 1994] [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of party committees at various levels and under the supervision and guidance of people's congresses at various levels and their standing committees as well as the Supreme People's Court, people's courts at various levels in the province seriously implemented the resolution of the First Session of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on the provincial people's higher court's work report, centered their work on promoting economic construction, carried out various adjudicatory work, enforced law in a strict manner, strengthened the ranks of judicial workers, and made progress in various tasks. During the whole year, various people's courts concluded the trials of 137,983 cases of various types, a 4.7 percent increase over the previous year, and the number of cases not yet concluded was 18.2 percent less than those in the previous year. They gave full play to the functions of judicial organs and played quite a good role in safeguarding social and political stability, in promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction, and in intensifying the anticorruption struggle. In the past year, we took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guiding ideology; considered the implementation of the party's basic line of "one central task and two basic points" as the fundamental task; based ourselves on emancipating our minds and seeking truth from facts in carrying out judicial work; enforced law in a strict and serious manner; correctly handled relations between adjudication and service, between striking at law offenders and adjusting various policies, and between handling various cases according to the law and being "conducive to the three causes, namely conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the people's living standards;" raised the level of judicial work; and strived to protect reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, and to provide legal services. In our work arrangements, we concentrated on the three major things put forward by the party Central Committee, namely strengthening macrocontrol of the economy, opposing corruption, and safeguarding social stability. We actively unfolded adjudicatory work; placed the struggle and "hitting hard" against law offenders and the trial of major and serious cases, especial major economic crimes, in the first place; and ensured the smooth implementation of major policy decisions by the central authorities. While doing a good job in adjudicatory work, we paid attention to the building of judicial workers, conducted a massive investigation on law enforcement and discipline against corruption, consciously accepted the evaluation and judgment of our work by the people's congresses, conscientiously improved our work, constantly promoted the purity and enhanced the fighting ability of judicial workers, and guaranteed the accomplishment of our adjudicatory work. In the past year, people's courts at various levels in the province have strengthened leadership in accordance with the above-mentioned general ideology and arrangements, adopted various measures, and stressed the following tasks: 1. Strengthened the Intensity of Dealing Blows to Serious Criminal Law Offenders, Safeguarded Social Stability The good or bad public order in society directly influences the overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic construction. To safeguard stability in the society, people's courts in the whole province adhered to the policy of "dealing heavy blows to crimes," and punished criminal law offenders who killed people or committed crimes of robbery, rape, hooligan activities, and explosion, and crime groups with Mafia-like tendencies. In the whole year, various people's courts concluded the trial of 18,857 cases of the first instance, increasing by 16 percent as compared with the previous year. Those who were sentenced from five years' fixed-term imprisonment to life imprisonment or death accounted for 50.3 percent, increasing by 2 percent as compared with the previous year. Last May, the provincial party committee launched a campaign to crack down hard on gangs of criminals, the abduction of women and children, and "train and road bandits," and strictly enforce the ban on prostitution. The provincial court promptly worked out special plans in regard to the targets, methods, steps, and specific measures of the crackdown. Courts at all levels swung into immediate action; some courts set up special leading groups and 47 courts appointed 162 additional judges to reinforce their manpower. The broad ranks of cadres and policemen worked overtime to handle the numerous indictments resulting from the drive against crimes. In regard to vicious cases that pose a great harm to society and which the people detest most, the courts concerned moved them up and assigned personnel to try them quickly, render severe sentences, and give them wide publicity, thus effectively curbing the arrogance of criminals. 2. Severely Punish Serious Economic Crimes and Implement the Anticorruption Drive. Courts in Zhejiang underwent two phases in their handling of economic crimes last year. In contrary with the rampant economic crimes in society, the number of economic crime cases in the first half of 1993 dropped by 42.3 percent from the same 1992 period. In the second half, pursuant with a directive of the CPC Central Committee calling for stepped-up efforts in investigating and prosecuting a number of major cases, courts and procuratorial and judicial organs in the province redoubled efforts in trying economic crime cases. A meeting of presidents of intermediate courts sponsored by the provincial court last August called for cracking down particularly hard on state functionaries in party and government organs, judicial organs, law-enforcing administrative departments, and departments in charge of economic administration who take advantage of their positions to embezzle, take bribes, and misappropriate public funds. The meeting also called for firmly cracking down on crimes such as production and sale of fake and shoddy goods, smuggling, sale of contraband goods, fraud, tax evasion, and refusal to pay tax. The meeting urged leadership of courts at all levels to take personal charge of trials involving major cases, step up supervision and guidance, and establish a system of recording and reporting major cases. On two occasions in September and November, the provincial court outlined plans for speeding up trials involving embezzlement and bribery, notifying the courts concerned about cases already indicted or soon to be indicted by the procuratorial organs. Courts throughout the province earnestly implemented the meeting's guidelines . Many courts also set up collegial panels or designated backbone cadres to take exclusive charge of the trials. By the end of last year, the province completed proceedings at first instance of 2,602 cases; of them, the number of cases completed and criminals sentenced in the second half of 1993 rose 55.4 and 42.5 percent, respectively, over the first half. From the economic criminals tried last year, we can see that there were several characteristics: First, state workers of party, government, judicial, administrative, and law enforcement organs--354 in total--accounted for 10 percent of these criminals, which is quite high. Second, many cases involved large amounts of money--198 criminals had illegal gains of more than 30,000 yuan, of which 71 gained more than 100,000 yuan--and some cases were the first ones of their kind in Zhejiang. Third, cases involving manufacturing and selling fake and shoddy products and counterfeiting trade marks increased--84 persons were sentenced for committing such crimes. Fourth, criminals given heavy sentences increased--279 persons, 22.9 percent more than the previous year, were sentenced to 10 years or more in prison, of which 13 were sentenced to death and 28 were given a temporary suspension of their death sentences. The severe punishment for serious economic criminals indicates the party and state's firm determination to fight corruption; it helped maintain the economic order and lift people's spirits. 3. Forcefully Stepped Up Economic Trial To Improve Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and To Advance the Market Economy Last year, the number of cases involving economic disputes increased sharply. There were many cases in which lawsuits involved several million yuan or tens of millions of yuan, and in which enterprises involved were on the verge of bankruptcy because they were unable to collect due payments. Cases involving disputes over purchase and marketing contracts increased noticeably, and cases with new characteristics also increased. To meet the needs of developing the market economy, courts across the province regarded the trial of economic cases as important work--they strengthened leadership, adjusted trial personnel, enhanced their trying capabilities, made trial process more regularized, and strived to improve the quality and efficiency of case handling. Last year, we handled and closed 42,902 cases involving economic disputes after the first trial and settled disputes involving a total of 2.9 billion yuan, respectively 23.2 percent and 151.5 percent more than the previous year. Courts at all levels conducted trials of economic cases, closely revolving around strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, deepening reform of the economic system, and developing the socialist market economy. In addition to handling more cases properly and efficiently, they endeavored to expand their services and offered to serve economic construction and to solve problems for enterprises. They took positive measures to support efforts to straighten out the financial order and offered to collect overdue loans for creditors. They went to financial departments to understand the actual situations and then drew up appropriate measures--writing letters to urge debtors to pay or sending people to debtors to persuade them to pay--to collect overdue loans. By taking these measures, they collected 563 million yuan of overdue loans, relaxing some financial department's shortages of funds. They also provided more services to help enterprises free themselves from predicaments. Many courts did not wait for cases to be referred to them; instead, they took the initiative in understanding enterprises' operations through economic judicial liaison officers or by sending someone to enterprises concerned. They did their best to provide legal assistance to enterprises with difficulties. Courts at all levels also established economic disputes mediation centers. According to the guidelines of the 16th national conference of court presidents, eight intermediate courts and 59 grass-roots courts in the province established economic disputes mediation centers. Following the principle of being "voluntary, fair, legal, and efficient," these mediation centers settled 4,145 economic disputes cases and settled disputes involving 330 million yuan. It took an average of 13 days to settle a case--some cases were settled on the same day--keeping pace with the quick step of market economic development and winning concerned parties' welcome. While the old system is being transformed into a new one, cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, credit cards, futures trade, and other new problems continued to crop up. Sometimes there were no laws for trying such cases or the laws are not specific enough, making trial work very difficult. Courts handling such cases insisted on the principle of seeking truth from facts, boldly sought new ways of practice, and conducted trial work prudently and in accordance with the civil procedural law, enabling them to achieve good social results. 4. Carried Out Various Judicial Work in an All-Round Manner and Gave Full Play to the Regulatory Function of the Law. The trials of civil lawsuits are closely related to the production and lives of the masses. Civil litigations surpass all other lawsuits in terms of the number of cases, number of categories, and scope of work. Following the continual deepening of reform and opening up to the outside world, civil contacts have become increasingly extensive, giving rise to a constant increase in new kinds of civil lawsuits directly linked to the market economy such as labor disputes and labor remuneration and copyright cases. Last year we accepted and heard 575 cases under these three categories. The vast number of judicial personnel handling civil cases persisted in doing meticulous work, emphasizing mediation, and properly handling cases, regardless of whether they belonged to the major categories of marriage, debts, and compensatory damages, or to the new categories. Last year we concluded 63,634 civil cases during their first trial, 49.6 percent of which were settled through mediation, playing an active role in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons in accordance with the law, maintaining social stability and unity, and promoting spiritual and material civilization. Last year, under the situation of a decreasing number of administrative cases closed and growing difficulty in trying cases, courts at all levels overcame the fear for difficulty, held off various interferences, and persisted in handling cases in accordance with the law to settle 1,270 administrative cases. Administrative organs' punitive decisions were upheld in 354 cases, or 27.9 percent of the total, and annulled or revised in 220 cases, or 17.3 percent; nolle prosequi took place in 602 cases, or 47.4 percent; the suitor's claim was rejected and the trial terminated in 94 cases, or 7.4 percent. As such, we not only protected the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations in accordance with the law, but also supported administrative organs in exercising their functions and powers. In our work, we laid stress on administrative cases involving infringement upon enterprises' property rights and operational and management powers, land, and urban planning, concluding a total of 306 cases under these four categories. Through the administration of justice in accordance with the law, we promoted the transformation of enterprise operating mechanisms and safeguarded the smooth progress of old town reconstructions and development zone constructions at various localities. In the first year after its establishment, the Ningbo Admiralty Court developed the spirit of building an undertaking through arduous effort, made bold attempts, and enthusiastically carried out judicial work. It accepted and heard 103 maritime cases of various kinds, and concluded 78 of them. It put an end to the history that maritime cases taking place in the Zhejiang waters had to be referred to courts outside the province, and is playing an active role in helping develop our maritime transportation, fishery production, and foreign trade. Over the past year, courts in Zhejiang at all levels actively participated in the overall improvement of public security and order through conducting trials. In focusing on open trials to promote the awareness of the legal system, the courts held 504 public sentencing meetings at which 3,441 people were given sentences. To achieve a better effect, the courts used the media to explain the laws involved in each case. A total of 2,075 people were given probation, but their behavior was routinely checked to enforce their disciplinary control. We actively launched a suggestion campaign. A total of 1,058 suggestions concerning judicial affairs were passed to the relevant departments. Of these, 70 percent were adopted. As a result, we achieved fairly good social effects. We attached great importance to out-of-court settlements and succeeded in preventing from happening more than 1,700 possible suicides, murders, and fighting caused by civil disputes. 5. Uphold the Principle of Tightening Law Enforcement and Increasing the Level of Judicial Work Tightening law enforcement is the state's fundamental requirement for judicial work. It is also a matter of great concern for the people. In their trial work, courts at all levels persisted in handling their affairs strictly in accordance with the law, and they strived to improve the quality of their case handling. The courts tried to improve the quality, efficiency, and social effects of their work. First, they persisted in holding public trials and in improving the quality of trial work. They paid great attention to three important links in trial work: investigation, cross- examination, and debate. They attached importance to evidence provided by the parties concerned and brought into full play the role of the collegial bench. Second, they strengthened trial supervision and work guidance. If appeals were rational, trial corrections were rendered in a timely fashion. Last year, 272 past legal cases were given retrials. A total of 84 cases appealed by procuratorial organizations were handled. Of these, 27 cases were given a retrial. Third, they began to experiment with a system in which persons responsible for wrong cases should be uncovered and punished. Four intermediate courts and 44 grass-roots courts have already established such a system. Cadres and police who were responsible for wrong cases were given suitable punishments. This measure helped judges to foster a serious and conscientious trial work style and to enhance their sense of responsibility. Fourth, the courts explored ways to improve trial work. In conducting trials of economic and civil cases, the courts emphasized the relevant parties' responsibility for providing evidence. The courts introduced a standardized trial system in which all cases will be handled promptly. After summing up trial experiences gained by localities, the provincial people's courts have already formulated standardized regulations concerning the trials for economic cases. Such regulations--which concern standards of quality, trial procedures, detailed regulations for convening a court, and evidence provided by the parties concerned--played a fairly important role in improving the level of trials. Second, they strengthened the training of cadres and took steps to improve the professional skills of trial personnel. In recent years, new laws and regulations have been promulgated one after another, and new developments and problems have popped up in trials. In addition, some comrades who became court presidents following last year's expiration of terms were unfamiliar with the practice of their professional work. In light of this, courts at all levels stepped up their training, held seminars to familiarize them with their jobs, and sponsored meetings to exchange trial experience. Provincial courts sponsored training classes for presiding judges of criminal, civil, and appeal courts and organized two-month-long in-service training sessions for 25 grass-roots court presidents. These training and job-related activities have helped improve the ability of key members of the trial cadres to resolve problems and have played a positive role in raising judicial standards and ensuring good qualities in handling cases. Third, they earnestly carried out the struggle against corruption. Emphasis was placed on court leaders' taking the lead in maintaining honesty and exercising self-discipline and on establishing a system for leading cadres to take responsibility in building party style. At the same time, vigorous efforts were made to carry out the following two tasks. First, efforts were made to resolutely stop the unhealthy practice of using judicial authority to wantonly collect fees under all sorts of names. Court offices which caused confusion in terms of judicial and administrative powers were abrogated. Second, a general inspection on law and discipline enforcement, with a special emphasis on corruption, was launched. Various methods were adopted--including internal investigations, soliciting views from the departments concerned, and studying cases with a clear objective in mind--to find out whether there were abuses of power for personal gain and unfair verdicts. The general inspection showed that the overwhelming majority of cadres and police officers had faithfully enforced the law. The courts concerned dealt sternly with 27 cases of the violation of law and discipline discovered in the course of inspections. The courts used these violations as negative examples to educate cadres and police officers and as warning to them. This has promoted honest and clean government. There were still many problems and difficulties in our work during the past year. The main problems and difficulties were as follows: First, the thinking and awareness of the cadres and police officers fell behind political and economic developments. A few of them were not very conscientious about serving economic construction. Old ideas formed over a long period in a planned economy still exerted influences to varying degrees. There were still instances of approaching cases in isolation without paying attention to their social effect. Second, there were still instances of a failure to enforce the law strictly. A small number of cases were handled poorly, and some cases were not handled strictly according to legal procedures. Some cases were not handled within the prescribed time, and some major cases were not handled promptly. As a result, the social effects of these cases were decreased. There were also instances of a lack of strong measures against serious criminal elements in trial procedures. Third, the environment for law enforcement was not quite satisfactory. Some cadres were partial to and pleaded for mercy for one party. Some even used their authority to override the law and interfere in trials. Because of strong local protectionism, cases involving people outside the locality were difficult to handle; and the execution of court judgments was even more difficult. Little progress was made in the trial of administrative cases; the number of cases concluded dropped 11 percent compared to the previous year. Fourth, there were too many cases and very few personnel to handle them. Equipment was obsolete, and many courts experienced shortages of funds to handle cases. This affected the smooth progress of trials. The provincial court lacked the in-depth investigation and study of new developments and characteristics emerging in the new situation. It also failed to give prompt guidance and to exercise effective supervision over trials. It lacked solutions to certain problems. We are adopting measures to vigorous solve all these problems and difficulties, and we have asked the provincial people's congress and its standing committee to give us their support and to urge the departments concerned to help solve them. The execution of court judgments is an important part of strictly enforcing the law. To effectively protect citizens' lawful rights and to maintain the authority of court verdicts and the solemn nature of the law, people's courts at various levels paid attention to executing court verdicts. They overcame and resisted local protectionism and made efforts to execute court verdicts in a civilized manner in various ways by integrating routine efforts with special efforts to carry out court orders and by entrusting the departments concerned to execute court verdicts. During the past year, various people's courts executed a total of 43,123 cases of verdicts of various types, and the number of cases not yet executed decreased by 11.4 percent compared to the previous year. To solve the problem of "difficulties in executing court orders," the provincial higher court seriously studied and formulated "opinions on solving some specific problems in the execution of court verdicts," "rules for the implementation of court verdicts," and "opinions on how to reach desired goals in executing court verdicts" to guide and promote the execution of court decisions by people's courts at the lower level. In the second half of last year, people's courts at various levels adopted a serious attitude in voluntarily accepting evaluations and comments from people's deputies in accordance with the circular issued by the standing committee of the provincial people's congress on evaluating judicial work. Various people's courts made full preparations beforehand for accepting evaluations from people's deputies. While carrying out self-checks, various people's courts heard opinions and suggestions on court work from peoples from various circles of society by visiting people or by inviting people to express their opinions and suggestions. Fifty-two people's courts sent letters to solicit opinions from 9,359 people's deputies at various levels; 61 people's courts invited 4,248 people's deputies and supervisors of the honesty of government work and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to take part in discussions at courts; and 74 people's courts went deep into villages and towns to solicit opinions. Concerned courts conducted investigations one by one on opinions and criticisms made by people's deputies and seriously studied ways to make improvements. Through these activities, the broad masses of cadres and judicial policemen of various courts have further understood that commenting on and evaluating judicial work is an effective way for the courts to accept supervision from the people's congresses and also an important way to gain the understanding of people's deputies and to ensure the strict enforcement of the law. 6. Lay Stress on Opposing Corruption and Advocating Honesty in Performing Official Duties, Strengthen the Building of People's Courts Over the past year, people's courts at various levels paid attention to the building of judicial workers while attaching importance to adjudicatory work. People's courts strived to raise the political and professional quality of judicial workers to guarantee the accomplishment of various adjudicatory tasks. First, various people's courts have attached importance to study and education for judicial cadres and policemen to raise their political quality. In light of the problem of ideological understanding in the transitional period from the old system to the new system and the change of relations concerning material interests in the new period, various people's courts have strengthened education and guidance for cadres and policemen. Judicial cadres and policemen were organized to study the basic theory of Marxism, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The people's courts armed cadres and policemen with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to raise their consciousness of implementing the party's basic line. Various courts also conducted education on ideals, moral principles, and discipline, and they encouraged cadres and policemen to carry forward the spirit of dedication. The overwhelming majority of cadres and policemen have been honest in performing their official duties and have strived to make improvements. A large number of advanced units and individuals who adhere to principles and who enforce the law justly have emerged. In 1993, 71 collectives and 153 individuals won praise and received awards. Of these, the Zhouquan People's Court in Tongxiang city was accorded a collective merit first class by the Supreme People's Court, and Deputy Presiding Judge Dong Youquan of the economic affairs court of the Shaoxing County People's Court and staff member Li Yuanqing of the Jinhua Intermediate People's Court archives were named national models for court workers. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed to preliminarily establish the socialist market economy by the end of this century. This is a crucial year for pushing through overall progress and attaining key breakthroughs in economic restructuring. Now we are faced with arduous tasks in maintaining public security. As the state's judicial organ, the people's courts will shoulder heavier tasks and greater responsibilities. In accordance with the guidelines of the ninth provincial party congress and the national conference of higher court presidents, the guiding ideology for judicial work throughout the province this year is:To use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as a guide; to hold court trials comprehensively and uphold the principle of striking severely at large and major crimes; to vigorously use judicial means to regulate relations between various economic sectors; to strengthen self-construction; to uphold strict and just law enforcement; to strive to improve judicial standards; as well as to provide legal support and services to the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability."Thus, we will focus on carrying out the following work: First, it is necessary to strengthen the functions of dictatorship, to punish resolutely and strictly in accordance with the law criminals who endanger national security, and to uphold the principle of punishing serious criminal offenders severely and promptly.To further carry on last year's work in strictly cracking down on crimes, it is necessary to strike at the crimes of murder, robbery, rape, gangsterism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping and selling women and children, particularly the crimes of secret gangster organizations. Further, we must crack down on prominent crimes in accordance with the characteristics of localities. Courts should actively coordinate with the relevant departments to effectively curb and rectify special crimes. It is necessary to quicken the pace of case handling, trials, and handing down sentences to uphold the courts' authority in curbing crimes and to widen the social effects of the courts' work. While striking severely at crimes, it is necessary to actively participate in the comprehensive rectification of public order, as well as to bring into further play the courts' role in holding public trials, offering suggestions in judicial matters, publicizing the legal system, and offering guidance and arbitration. Second, it is necessary to continue to crack down severely on serious economic crimes to promote a clean government. We must do a good job of holding trials for major economic crimes. We must strictly crack down on state personnel who use their powers for corruption, bribery, and to embezzle public funds. We must resolutely curb the crimes of smuggling, swindling, producing and selling fake and inferior-quality goods, and tax evasion. Court leaders must personally handle major cases uncovered during the anticorruption struggle and attend to them seriously once trials are held. It is necessary to be determined, careful, and accurate in handing down strict punishments in accordance with the law. We must resolutely mete out heavy or death sentences when essential. It is necessary to publicize typical cases that generally concern and affect society by holding open trials, passing sentences in public, or holding news conferences to widen the social effects of cases' handling by the courts. Third, We Should Further Consolidate and Regulate Courts' Functions To Advance the Development of the Socialist Market Economy.This year, the reform of the economic system will accelerate; therefore, all courts should make full use of judicial means to help nurture and develop the market system. We should seriously enforce the "Economic Contract Law," the "Company Law," the "Law on Protecting Consumers' Rights and Interests," and the "Law on Unfair Competition," to ensure open, fair, and orderly competition and to prohibit unfair competition. We should enthusiastically handle and properly settle cases involving financial management, resources exploitation, tax levying and management, and price management, to ensure that reform is carried out smoothly. By trying cases involving problems coming up in the course of transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms, we should safeguard enterprises' rights to operate and manage their own operations and should uphold enterprises' internal contract responsibility system on business management so that enterprises can truly be independent economic entities and be major players in market competition. We should properly try cases involving village and town enterprises' contract disputes over production and business operation matters to advance the development of village and town enterprises. At the same time, we should try carefully and properly cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, futures trading, and other new problems which come up while reform is being deepened, as well as cases involving matters concerning foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, in order to create a good legal environment for deepening reform and opening up to the outside world. Fourth, We Should Tighten Supervision Over Trial Cases To Uphold the Dignity of the Law.Currently, courts' trial work is quite seriously disturbed by regional and departmental protectionism--trials in a small number of cases have dragged on, and court rulings were unfair. So, we must further emphasize the need to strictly enforce the law, to tighten supervision over trial work, and to enhance trial discipline. In addition to carrying out education in adhering to the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people and to stepping up vocational training, we should improve the supervision and inhibition mechanisms, continue on a trial basis the system of investigating wrongly ruled cases, and affix administrative and legal responsibility for persons handling cases illegally. We should decidedly correct unfair rulings and wrongful law enforcement. At the same time, we should further strengthen law enforcement, reinforce and better equip our law-enforcement personnel, decidedly get over the disturbance of regional protectionism, emphasize enforcing the law in a civilized manner, and uphold the seriousness of the law. Fifth, We Should Deepen Court Reform and Improve Court Work. First, we should step up the study of political theory, especially Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further emancipate our minds; change the way we think; and enhance our resolution and self-consciousness in carrying out the party's basic line and the policy of developing a socialist market economy. Second, we should carry out the anticorruption struggle in depth and make constant efforts to promote administrative honesty, in order to enable cadres and policemen to withstand the trials and pounding of the commodity economy. Third, we should build up our leading bodies, improve administrative work, and strictly manage the courts. At the same time, we should actively seek ways to reform our trial procedures--in trying civil and economic cases, we should emphasize the concerned parties' responsibility in testifying. We also should improve courts' trial capabilities, improve case-handling efficiency, ensure that all cases are handled properly, and continue to build up the civil and economic divisions and to improve these divisions' material conditions, in order to carry out heavy trial work. Sixth, We Should Be More Party-Minded and Should Self-Consciously Subject Ourselves to the Supervision of the People's Congresses.Relying closely on the party's leadership and the masses and self-consciously subjecting ourselves to the supervision of the people's congresses are the fundamental assurance for the people's courts to properly conduct their trial work. Courts at all levels should voluntarily and in a timely manner submit reports to the party committee and the people's congress in charge concerning their work plans and new situations and problems in their work, and they should suggest ways to deal with these new situations and problems. They should follow the party committees' instructions and subject themselves to the supervision of their people's congress. They should resolutely carry out relevant resolutions adopted by their people's congress and its standing committee and handle earnestly and in a responsible manner matters committed to them by their people's congress and its standing committee. At the same time, they should subject themselves to procuratorial organs' legal supervision and the media's supervision so that they can continue to improve their trial work.
