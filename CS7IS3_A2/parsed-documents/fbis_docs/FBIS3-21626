[Begin recording] [Unidentifed reporter] Were you aware that Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Hector Fabio Urdinola would surrender first? [De Greiff] Yes, these are the two people who have appointed lawyers with whom we are advancing the process. You can be sure that I am confident, and the lawyers have said as much, that the process will not be limited to these two people but involve many others who unfortunately have engaged in drug trafficking. [Reporter] Will they be the first ones? [De Greiff] That is correct. [Second unidentified reporter] Are we going to be having announcements as happened in the past with Pablo Escobar? [De Greiff] Pardon me? [Second reporter] Will we be having announcements of surrenders, as happened with Pablo Escobar in the past? [De Greiff] I hope not, because they know and must keep in mind that as long as they do not surrender, we are going to continue pursuing them. Ultimately, they will meet with either Escobar's fate or the fate of those who have surrendered to justice. [end recording]
