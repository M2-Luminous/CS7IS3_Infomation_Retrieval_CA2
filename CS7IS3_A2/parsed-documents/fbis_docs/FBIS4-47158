And according to May's results, the government has every reason to celebrate yet another record--according to data of the Center for Economic Conditions, inflation amounted to only 8.1 percent last month. Such a low indicator has not been seen in Russia since August of 1992. As a consequence of this, the Central Bank has begun to smoothly lower the cost of centralized credits. There is, it would seem, one more happy fact: Retail prices for consumer goods in the first quarter increased by only 45 percent--the lowest indicator for the last two years. But somehow there is no desire to rejoice over this--these victories on the financial front came at too high a price: Industrial enterprises are being shut down, unemployment is increasing, and the purchasing power of the population is dropping. Our correspondent asked Yakov Ginzburg, a candidate of economic sciences and now the vice president of the State Center Bank, to comment on the situation. Before this he was the director of the scientific-consultation and information center of the Association of Siberian and Far Eastern Cities. [Yuryev] Yakov Sadkovich, can the sharp drop in the rate of inflation be considered an indication of approaching economic prosperity? [Ginzburg] No. What is more, this, possibly, is approaching a very grave crisis, when there will be a shortage of both money and commodities. If we are talking about the situation in the country as a whole, then it should be noted that no fundamental changes have occurred yet. The level of inflation has been reduced by artificial methods--the tactic of postponed decisions. As before, the government is making decisions about the issuance of large credits, but those corporations that should receive them are including the promised money in estimates, and, counting on it, they are drawing up programs and plans, and sometimes they even take credits on the basis of expected credits, but once the additional money supply feeding does not occur, although the expenditure mechanism is functioning as before, then the pool gradually begins to dry up. I liked the expression of one of the television commentators: He said that we have been observing the competition between the amount of money and the amount of commodities for a long time--what will come to an end sooner? Now we see: Money was the first to withdraw. But the requirement for money also fell--however strange this may sound. Because the rates for credits in banks were very high: Even our most profitable industry--trade--can no longer take money at 300 percent annual interest. And a paradoxical situation arose. While money was in short supply, a surplus of it developed--there was money in the banks, but they cannot give it to anyone at such a high percent--at such rates, a real return simply will not occur. (According to my data, the rate of unrecoverability has already reached a colossal level--80 percent.) Therefore, in order to hold out in the system of monetary circulation, nothing is left for the banks to do but to make money more accessible; that is, to lower the cost of credit, which is what is occurring now. Incidentally, the situation on the interbank money exchanges is one more indicator that money has become in short supply. Note that the dollar exchange rate is increasing, but the volume of sales is continuously falling. Inasmuch as there is no free money, money is not coming to the currency market, either. [Yuryev] But this situation in the financial sphere has most of all hit not banks, but industrial enterprises--it is they that are shutting down.... [Ginzburg] Yes, the most unfortunate thing is that this situation could lead to a shutdown of industrial production; it cannot live without money. And nothing in the economic situation has occurred that would stimulate the development of production. The system of voucher circulation, which has been talked about so much for so long in the government, did not take root, and it did not become the means of overcoming the crisis of the system of nonpayments for various reasons. [Yuryev] It turns out that the high level of inflation that there was, for example, last year, is a lesser evil in comparison with today's 8-9 percent inflation per month? [Ginzburg] Yes, the spiraling inflation fed production at least through trade. But now even this feeding is disappearing--trade is becoming insolvent, and the volume of supply of goods has become threateningly large--commercial organizations are becoming overloaded with unsold commodities. Therefore, many trade organizations are now beginning to prepare in good time for the approaching crisis, which is forecast for autumn. [Yuryev] How are they preparing? [Ginzburg] They are selling commodities and not buying new ones. I judge this also because commercial banks have lately been receiving more and more proposals from trade enterprises about placing money into long-term deposits. There is no sense in accusing our bankers, including Ginzburg as well, of a reluctance to support collapsing production. As was noted by one Western economist, money is cowardly--it will go only where there is a reliable legislative base, and it is clear what kind--a taxation system, political stability, and the like. But our country, from the standpoint of attractiveness for the investor, according to the assessments of American experts, is somewhere at the 150th place, yielding even to Vietnam. For a resolution of all of these problems that scare off "cowardly" money, obviously, large financial resources are required. Where are they to be gotten? The answer to this question must lie in the state budget. But the budget for this year, it can be said, is already past, and it will not be able to play the role of a main financial plan. Thus, a lowering in the rates of inflation in the first half of the year, which, unquestionably, is an economic success, will have a positive effect only in the event that it is used for systemic reorganizations. Otherwise, the successes of the beginning of the year will turn out to be not more than a short pause in the many years of inflation increases, the consequences of which will be difficult to predict.
