FR940413-1-00016 FR940413-1-00005 HUD is particularly interested in public comment from State and local governments as to what criteria HUD should use in determining whether to sell to State and local governments rather than private investors. II. Other Matters A. Executive Order 12866 This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington DC. B. Environmental Impact In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD, and do not impinge upon the relationship between Federal government and State and local governments. D. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will not affect the ability of small entities, relative to larger entities, to bid for and acquire HUD-held mortgages that HUD determines to sell. F. Regulatory Agenda This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and therefore was submitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 290 Mortgage insurance, Law and moderate-income housing.

Specific provisions, as noted in the regulatory text, apply only to ``rental housing projects'' as defined in ยง290.3, including a HUD-owned rental housing project.
