DPA was told this by Bernd-Olaf Hagedorn, Greens spokesman in the Mainz Landtag, on Sunday. About 50 members of several human rights organizations had been detained in their hotel in the Kurdish town of Batman since Friday. The people in question are well; following an intervention by the German Embassy, they are also permitted to use the telephone again. However, they refuse to leave the hotel. A spokesman of the Bonn Foreign Ministry said: "We made very clear statements to the Foreign Ministry and to the Interior Ministry in Ankara." In addition, an embassy employee talked to the authorities in Batman. The spokesman said that the blockade was due to the nervousness of the authorities in connection with the elections. Security checks are so strict that it is hardly possible to move about freely. The human rights delegations have been in the Kurdish area since 19 March to observe the local elections on Sunday. On Monday they wanted to return to Germany. They are accompanied by six participants from Mainz and Wiesbaden, including Friedel Gruetzmacher, head of the Greens group in the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag.
