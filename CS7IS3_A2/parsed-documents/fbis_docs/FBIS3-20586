The good tendency of agriculture to develop towards an export orientation has improved the objective and subjective situation for starting an export oriented agriculture in Heilongjiang. However, we must understand clearly that there is still a considerable gap compared with more advanced provinces or regions in export oriented agriculture, regardless of whether one means breadth or depth. Major problems demanding conscious resolution are: 1. The current system is unsuitable. It lacks strong organization and leadership, and the responsibilities of departments in charge are unclear. Coordination is weak, so there is no joining forces. In many places, export oriented agriculture is in a state of self-development. Looking at the foreign trade system, state controls are too tight for Heilongjiang's exports of agricultural by-products; some backbone export products remain strictly controlled by an export plan, which dampens enthusiasm for earning foreign currency from exports. For export of some agricultural by-products, there exist such problems as complicated procedures, many official procedures, lack of price transparency, somewhat unreasonable profit sharing, etc. This has forced some agricultural by-products into export channels in other provinces. For example: hua [3323] mushrooms produced in Yanshou County have to be exported through Hainan's foreign trade department. The Shuangcheng Furfural Plant exports furfural through the foreign trade department at 5,700 yuan per ton, but the plant can only get 3,600 yuan; the profit distribution is very unreasonable. 2. Processing and circulation is still the weak link. Although the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the merging of production, processing, and marketing have brought about rapid development from a quantity standpoint, there has not really been much done when it comes to developing an export oriented agriculture, and for leading enterprises like the Shuangcheng Nestle Corporation, Ltd, the results have been even fewer. Many of our leading enterprises are low quality and low level, their products having no market competitiveness, so that the majority of the agricultural by-products we have for export are raw materials. Statistics from the Farm Administrative General Bureau of Heilongjiang, primary products occupy over 90 percent of the annual exports of agricultural by-products, and more than 80 percent for the entire province. A lack of leading enterprises has made some bases very unstable. Some cattle bases are in decline, to the depression of dairy product plants and delays in payment for milk expenditures. In Bing County and Wuchang, there is large-scale raising of beef cattle, but so far there has not been a thorough processing enterprise. 3. The infrastructure is poor. The current shortage of railway and road transport is a serious obstacle to the development of foreign trade. In some border ports which cannot be reached by rail, poor roads makes import and export of goods erratic, seriously countering these ports' advantages. Telecommunications facilities are backward in many areas, which affects shipping information, and restricts commodity circulation and economic development. 4. A shortage of intelligence. After some remote areas became open ports, the quality of personnel in these areas just did not measure up. There is a lack of foreign trade administrators and foreign language talent. 5. Policies have not been implemented completely. There are many official procedures, many complicated steps, and farmers have to obtain licenses to go to the market. Heilongjiang's Farm Administrative General Bureau complain that farms cannot share favorite policies of their localities. People also complain that current economic laws and regulations, especially those involving foreign affairs, are imperfect. In addition, there is a lack of arbitration, making foreign trade disputes difficult to resolve promptly. Looking at the experiences of Heilongjiang's advanced models or that of other provinces, in order to develop export oriented agriculture, Heilongjiang must insist on being led by big international and domestic markets, and make further adjustments in its agricultural mix. Second, it must be vigorous in its operation of export oriented agricultural by-product processing enterprises. Primary agricultural products do not suit the international market well, nor the requirements of the growing domestic market; in intense market competition, economic efficiency is just as hard to attain. In those places in Shandong and Dalian which have been successful at export oriented agriculture, all breakthroughs were first made by leading enterprises. The great and lasting development of Shuangcheng cattle production in Heilongjiang relies chiefly on such export oriented leading enterprises as the Nestle Corporation, Ltd. These processing enterprises have not only opened up export channels for foreign trade, they have also provided the impetus for local agricultural by-products production. Third, we must vigorously develop bases for commodity production. Establishing well-known, excellent, and exceptional bases for the production of agricultural by-products is a precondition of guaranteeing commodity quality, variety, and wholesale supply. So, we must change our scattered, single-family operations into a concentrated, linked, production base having "one trade in one village", "one product in one village", carrying out systematic production, processing, and marketing, integrating trade, industry, and agriculture. These bases should have professional organizations offering full services, including information, production, processing, storage, shipping, and sales. Fourth, we must vigorously absorb capital and technology from other provinces and countries. Bringing in capital and technology from other provinces and countries is a shortcut to developing export oriented agriculture. Not only will this solve the problem of a shortage of capital in the start-up phase, it may also arrange and implement the product market while bringing in capital. Developing export oriented agriculture is a massive systematic project. We should organize professional teams to acquire information from the domestic and international markets. We should both know the current market demand situation and master developing and changing trends in the future. We must reduce export restrictions on agricultural by-products, release a part of the inspection and approval rights to localities, and especially should relax policies on grain exports. The provincial government should release certain exporting rights for agricultural by-products to localities, enterprises, and enterprise groups.
