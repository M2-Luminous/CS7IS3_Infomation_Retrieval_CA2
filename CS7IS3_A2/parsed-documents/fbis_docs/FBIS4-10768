An index to calculate inflation in the new currency, the real, also was created. The rapporteur read his report, the government agreed with it, and the opposition protested. The final report suggests 59 changes to the economic stabilization plan but it did not touch the essential: The minimum salary will stay as it is for the time being. In 30 days, the government will send Congress a proposal to gradually increase the minimum salary. Salaries in URV's [real value units] also will stay as they are for the time being. If after four months of conversion, that is; in July, workers conclude that they would have earned more under the former salary policy, the government will pay for the salary losses on the base date of collective labor contracts. When the new currency is put into circulation, salaries will have additional protection. The Congressional Joint Committee report creates an index to calculate inflation in the real currency: The IPCR [Consumer Price Index in Real]. If this index indicates inflation in the new currency, it will be incorporated into salaries on the base date of each labor category. The report was approved eight votes against one, despite the harsh reaction of the only congressman who voted against it. The provisional measure nonetheless still must be voted on by the Congress plenary before 28 April. [Begin Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero recording] We believe this demonstrates very well that it is being understood that the stabilization is for the benefit of the country and all the Brazilian people.
