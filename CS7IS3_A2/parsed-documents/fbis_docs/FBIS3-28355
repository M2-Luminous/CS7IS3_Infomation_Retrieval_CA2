As you are already aware, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have vigorously attacked and utterly destroyed important DK positions in the Anlung Veng, Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, and Banteay Meanchey regions, and have completely seized the command posts, hospitals, war materiel, and [word indistinct]. In addition, a number of DK officers and rank and file have deserted their ranks and either rallied to the Khmer Royal Armed Forces or returned to the national community, bringing along a significant quantity of documents, armaments, ammunition, and mines. In view of this, the Royal Government of Cambodia wishes once again to appeal to all DK officers and soldiers -- especially those in the Anlung Veng and Preah Vihear regions and in the northwest -- to return quickly to the national community as good Cambodian citizens. You are urged to contact any KRAF unit or the royal administration. You will be enthusiastically welcomed by units and officials at all levels.
