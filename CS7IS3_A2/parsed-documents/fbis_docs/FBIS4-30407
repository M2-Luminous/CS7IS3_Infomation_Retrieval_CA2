Furthermore, I don't think it admirable for the United States to get concessions from its trade partners by threatening them with possible sanctions. From the U.S. standpoint, however, actual results have fallen short of expectations even after 33 negotiations in the past: Japan makes promises, but it fails to follow through. Then, it doesn't seem necessarily wrong [for the United States] to attach great importance to results and to refuse to accept nothing less if such results are not guaranteed. As Japan has an annual trade surplus of 50 billion yen [Y] with one country, and this surplus has been increasing, more, there must exist something that Japan must correct on its own. Not even clarifying its policy to reduce its trade surplus, however, Japan rejects the U.S. demands totally, insisting that its arguments are right. Is this an adult way to maintain a relationship? As economic problems between Japan and the United States affect the world economy to a significant degree, it is important to search for some compromise between the two nations. It is too foolish for Japan to dismiss completely the numerical quotas as managed trade without having any clear idea [of how to reduce its trade surplus]. Also, if one proposes a national welfare tax plan, he's got to have a vision for a welfare system to start with, and then to have debates on how much of an increase in income tax he should be asking the public to bear, after taking into consideration the balance between the burden of tax and that of social welfare. On the contrary, he [Hosokawa] abruptly proposed a 7-percent national welfare tax, without considering these basic issues. Mr. Hosokawa said that the issues had been deliberated by the government's Tax Commission. But, although the Tax Commission is an independent council in form, it is in fact like a spokesman for the government -- the commission's deliberations don't seem to take public interests into consideration. The public cannot acquiesce something that they are told abruptly without prior discussions or visions. Restructuring of the cabinet also lacks a sense of inevitability and vision. If the Hosokawa cabinet continues to employ this kind of political method, it should surely receive strong criticism. Unable To Control the Bureaucracy Not much result has been attained in the area of administrative reform, one of the Hosokawa cabinet's major policy objectives. Although deregulation and decentralization have been advocated, it is doubtful if there has been any progress in these areas. Bureaucrats seem to have become more influential ever since the Hosokawa cabinet came into the scene, failing to control the rise of the bureaucracy. For example, the national welfare tax plan mentioned earlier can also be considered as a measure to secure the source of funds at the time of income tax reduction. To be sure, as the Ministry of Finance [MOF] argues, it is impossible to reduce taxes without having another source of funds. Here, I think we need to acknowledge this argument, for it has its own ground. But, to reduce income tax by 6 trillion yen or so, they are trying to increase taxes by approximately 9 trillion yen in total, including 2.4 trillion yen from a 1-percent increase in consumption tax. I can understand this as the logic of the bureaucracy, but the public won't accept it. I guess the Hosokawa cabinet didn't realize the difficulty of tax reform. Things are not that easy. If they [the cabinet] wanted to reduce income tax as part of their economic stimulus package, they should have dealt with it separately from the increase in consumption tax. In any event, if the bureaucracy tries to bring up a self-serving logic, somebody has to contain it; being able to do so is the true ability of a politician. The Hosokawa cabinet, however, didn't have this ability. How, then, can the cabinet order the bureaucracy to delegate more power to local governments, or to loosen up regulations? At present, 82 items of deregulation are on the list. But, how many of these have real substance? Now, how about the progress on reform of the economic system, another important agenda for Japan? This is also a difficult task. The Japanese economy today is not at a stage where a few improvement measures would suffice. Rather, it is at a stage where we need to plunge a scalpel into the very system of the economy. Japan will be looked upon by foreign countries as a disturbing factor for the world economy if it continues its economic activities based on the ideas of mass production, mass merchandising, and mass market share. If Japan continues to record a one-sided trade surplus, the world economy will not be able to sustain itself. How to reduce a surplus, or how to utilize the surpluses accumulated within the nation in order to improve the lives of citizens -- if an overall plan based on this kind of questioning doesn't exist, economic plans themselves won't develop. What Mr. Hosokawa has come up with so far are makeshift measures to stimulate the economy. I believe he should increase the budget for public works projects from the planned amount of 430 trillion yen. Although reform of our election system is said to have gained a firm footing, it is just a small step toward political reform. Redrawing voting districts, preventing corruptions, and so on -- all this being considered, we are still somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of the height of the mountain to climb. [passage omitted] Responsibility Also Lies With the Antireformist LDP Yet, the support ratings for the cabinet are still inexplicably high. Although they declined somewhat to 50 percent, compared to 70 percent around the time when the new government was installed. But, they are still high. Frankly, I think they show the flip side of the public dissatisfaction over many years of Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] reign. Responsibility lies with our party, because even though the support ratings for the Hosokawa cabinet declined, those for the LDP haven't improved. A political party that is or will be in charge of the government must maintain support ratings of 50 percent or so all the time. The LDP in the old days did so. But, the party is now one-fourth the size it used to be, receiving support ratings of around 25 percent. Once the coalition government is considered ineffective, the LDP with its rich experience and human resources ought to regain public confidence. But it hasn't. As it didn't carry out self-reform for its rebirth, it has been unable to erase the disappointment [felt by the public]. People are disappointed with the coalition government and remain disappointed with the LDP. I believe this is a crisis situation for Japanese politics that has never before been experienced. Therefore, the most important thing for the LDP to do now is to reform the party to be reborn. The LDP must clarify its ideas on how to deal with new types of changes here and abroad and how to cleanse itself of various stains it accumulated over the years. This unfinished business is the agenda for party President Kono. The reason I recommended Mr. Yohei Kono for the party presidency is that I believed he would be the person to enable the party to win the next election and regain its political power. But Mr. Kono is now fettered by complex movements within the party so that he is unable to flex his muscles. Unless he overcomes this, the LDP will not be able to regain public confidence or to win the election. Because he is not a head of any faction, he cannot use the tactics of cooperating with other factions, unable to exercise his leadership. The current situation is still transitional, and although the factions within the party are on their way to disintegration, we still have to use these factions to get things done. We must find our way out from this situation and organize ourselves around the party apparatus. Yet, we haven't come to this point, and therefore I believe President Kono is having a rough time. We should not be distracted by various movements in the leading coalition parties and within our party. Regrettably, however, everyone seems to be vacillating. Need To Strengthen Anticorruption Measures Four related bills have been passed, and we are on the threshold of political reform. As stated earlier, I want to rate highly the Hosokawa administration's efforts to accomplish this much. However, the recent revision of law is a means toward reform, not the end. The fundamental goal is to activate parliamentary democracy. In other words, having two opposing major political powers and thus maintaining political tension, we will occasionally have a change of administration. By creating this kind of political system, the two parties will try to solve political problems responsibly for the public. This is how the system should be. For example, we need to further strengthen anticorruption measures. The case of general contractors' bribery of Mr. Kishiro Nakamura is currently being tried. But, it contains some difficult legal issues. I don't know how the trial will develop, but I think it natural for the public, whose annual income is around 6 million yen to 7 million yen, to give a harsh look at the political world, where a single voice can mobilize 10 million yen. The public certainly thinks that money moves politics. As anticorruption measures that would lessen any further public distrust in politics, we need to strengthen the regulation holding a candidate jointly responsible for election fraud and to expedite trials for election law violations. A trial in Japan takes too long. I don't understand why no one has suggested reform in this area. Also, there is room for improvement in how political contributions by corporations should be made. However, as Japan is a corporate society, it has no tradition of contributions by individuals. Nevertheless, there is a riskier side to individual contributions. In some instances, I ask my secretary to return such individual contributions, because I don't know if they are pure political contributions or if they accompany some ulterior motives. Even if corporate contributions are banned, there will always be some loopholes. Although individual contributions are the norm in the United States, corporations are actually making contributions to particular politicians through political action committees. For example, a corporation pays extra wages to its employees, and then makes the employees contribute the extra amount in their names. As such contributions are made for the benefit of the stockholders to politicians who have some business-related political clout, they are definitely considered as a bribe in Japan. Judging from this, anticorruption measures, however strict they may be, have some loopholes. Therefore, the issue rests on the attitude of each individual politician. Still, we need to plug obvious loopholes and to create a law that will make it difficult to find loopholes. The issue of [how to apportion] voting districts still remains, as does reform of the upper house and the electoral system for local assemblies. As stated earlier, if the Hosokawa cabinet thinks that political reform is already complete, I would say that's gross ignorance. Doubt About Komeito's Participation in the Government How will the political situation develop from now on? The key to this question is when the next election for the lower house will take place. Will it take place at the end of this year, or next year? If the Diet is dissolved before then, the election will be conducted according to the existing system. Considering the significance of having reformed the electoral system, it seems reasonable to employ the new system in the next election. How will each party carry out its election campaign according to the new system? As it is a single-seat electoral system combined with some proportional representation, the new system will generate complex actions on the part of individual politicians vying for nomination in particular districts or trying to obtain candidacy in a block for proportional representation. At the same time, there will also be some breakups and mergers among political parties. It is difficult to make a clear and accurate prediction of a convergence [of parties] at this point in time. But, if I venture to guess, I think there will remain at the end about three political powers plus the Japanese Communist Party [JCP]. The ideal situation is to have two major parties. But, some additional parties tend to appear in the middle, as in England and Germany. In the case of Japan, I don't know if a party in the middle will be a small one as in England and Germany. It is possible to have a situation where the party in the middle has the largest power and the other parties on both ends of the spectrum are small. In any event, the middle party always tends to belong to the leading party. I can't make a definite statement, but I believe that Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] without the extreme left wing will join together. Although the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is a bit different from these two parties, it is highly likely that it may join them, considering its relationship with the Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation. Adding to this a conservative power centered on the LDP and another conservative power on Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], therefore, it is possible to see three power centers. Komeito and the JCP are alike in a sense, and their participation in political administration will be strongly resisted, I believe. They share the same kind of character, if somebody orders the others to turn right, everybody turns right, and everybody tends to say the same thing. Komeito has Mr. Takeiri and Mr. Yano, both of whom are nice people to talk with on a personal level. But, looking at it as a political party, there are many problems. Recently, Komeito has been saying that it doesn't mind dissolving itself. Making its origin ambiguous by doing so can be a strategy to gain influence on one of the conservative powers. This may not work, however, because a candidate supported by the Soka Gakkai [Komeito's major support base] tends to lose votes from constituents of other parties. I think many people see it as problematic to have this kind of candidate participate in the administration. True Motives Behind the Alliance Between the Japan New Party and Shinseito Realignment centering on the idea of combining the Japan New Party and Shinseito is currently underway within the leading coalition parties. Stating my conclusion first, I believe breakups and mergers of political parties will continue until the end of this century. There remain only seven years or so in this century; that means there will be only two or three general elections. The realignment currently underway is aimed at the next election. After the election, another realignment will take place for gaining power, based on the number of seats each party wins. The Japan New Party is like a reformist group among the conservatives. By nature, therefore, it should associate itself with Sakigake. On the other hand, Shinseito is a group formed by the people from the LDP's Takeshita faction, and Komeito is a party based on religion -- they are different in character. So, it is difficult to understand when the Japan New Party acts in concert with Shinseito and Komeito, rather than with Sakigake. Nonetheless, the Japan New Party tries to cooperate with Shinseito. It does so to maintain its political power. Putting myself in Mr. Hosokawa's shoes, I think he wants to maintain his political power for even a day longer. From Mr. Ozawa's standpoint, he wants to build a larger power base than the LDP for the next election. The cooperation is based on nothing but these motives. As far as Takemura is concerned, he seems to have spoken too much as a cabinet secretary during the upheavals relating to the National Welfare Tax and restructuring of the cabinet. But he is a rare politician. He holds up an ideal in his political activities and keeps chasing after the ideal. But he doesn't get discouraged when he can't reach that ideal; he has a practical side, too. In this sense, he is different from ordinary politicians. Hosokawa and Takemura share the same national sentiment. Therefore, the Japan New Party was supposed to ally itself with Sakigake. But, Hosokawa allies himself with Ozawa. Here lies the difficulty of realignment. Opposing Ozawa's Theory of the Nation Then, how does the national sentiment of Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Takemura differ from that of Mr. Ozawa? Ozawa says that Japan should become a "normal nation." Behind this thought is an assumption that Japan today is abnormal. In today's international community, it is not normal for Japan to pursue only economic activities without carrying out its international responsibility; if requested by the United Nations, Japan should use its armed forces abroad; if necessary, we should revise our Constitution; and if you don't want to revise the Constitution, we should interpret it in broader terms, say, Japan can do such and such to some extent so as to be a normal nation. This is Ozawa's view. I think Ozawa has his own political philosophy, and that he is a politician with strong power of execution -- he has his own point of view. But, Takemura has a different view. I do, too, and so does Hosokawa, I believe. What will it be like if Japan uses its armed forces abroad in this violently changing international situation by going beyond the line it has kept up until now? Considering its current economic power, I see a risk that Japan may turn to supernationalism and hegemonic ambitions, moving on to the strengthening of its military power. Then, what will happen to Japan? The United States may welcome this as long as Japan is under its control. But, Japan may become isolated in Asia. For example, the United States and China are now in conflict over the human rights issue. But once they find a mutual interest, they will join together readily. On the other hand, if Japan starts building up its armaments and entertains its hegemonic ambitions, its relationship with China will break down decisively, and the situation in Asia will become tense immediately. Therefore, I can't agree with the idea of Japan becoming a normal nation. As natural rights as an independent nation, Japan should have some military capability for its citizens to defend themselves from foreign aggressions. Also, since nuclear weapons exist in the world, it is all right as an option for Japan to remain under the U.S. nuclear umbrella pursuant to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty so as to defend its citizens from nuclear attack. In any event, Japan should keep its principle of not using military forces abroad. Instead of using military forces, Japan should make positive contributions to the international community in the areas of peace and public welfare. I don't believe the use of military forces is the only way to contribute to the international community. The world is moving away at least from confrontation among nuclear powers to a global society where nuclear weapons are unnecessary. Regional conflicts may remain, but the world as a whole is moving toward peace. What kinds of needs and meanings are there for Japan to strengthen its military power and to entertain hegemonic ambitions under the name of the United Nations, pursuing a super power status along with the United States? Tribal conflicts and religious disputes are going on in various parts of the world. It will not be known for the next five to 10 years how the world will come to rest. In these circumstances, how can we be so foolish to divide public opinion into two on the issue of our Constitution? It would be all right to debate this issue five or 10 years from now, but I don't think we should have a political showdown that would divide public opinion at this time.
