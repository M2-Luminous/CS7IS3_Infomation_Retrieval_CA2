[Trutzer] Amendment 3 to the report on Romania's application for admission to the Council of Europe recommends the implementation of a law on ethnic minorities and education in the shortest time possible. In connection with the law on ethnic minorities, I can say that there is a draft law on minorities dated 7 December 1993 that was sent to the government authorities of the Council members for their remarks and amendments, and the text is to be submitted to the government to formulate the final draft law. By mid-April it will be forwarded to Parliament. In connection with the educational law, I can say that the draft law has been passed by the Commission for Education of the Chamber of Deputies and is to be put on the agenda of the meetings. Henceforth, everything depends on Parliament. [Trepcea] What has been done in connection with the European Charter for Local Autonomy and with the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages -- Amendments 4 and 5? [Trutzer] The text reads as follows: "It is recommended that it be signed as soon as possible." So far, this charter for regional languages has been ratified by a only one state, Norway, which did so in November 1993. In our country, this legal instrument will be examined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because it involves things that have to be studied carefully, while reservations have to be formulated accurately. The same applies to the European Charter on Local Autonomy. The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romanian [UDMR] energetically demands that these two European charters be ratified. In my opinion, discussions and preparations on the Charter for Local Autonomy may begin in accordance with Romania's Constitution, which, in Article 119, stipulates that public management in territorial-administrative units is based on the principles of local autonomy and decentralized public services. [Trepcea] What can you tell us about the creation and operation of religious schools with a special emphasis on teaching children of minority groups in their mother tongue? [Trutzer] This is also included in the UDMR draft law and in that of the Council for Ethnic Minorities. It has to be the subject of a special law. It is a comprehensive issue that requires time. [Trepcea] In your view, has Romania done enough to abide by its pledges? [Trutzer] The majority of the issues are under discussion, which is in a positive stage, and one can say that, even if the pledges have not been honored yet, we are in the process of honoring them. I think that we are in a good position. Regarding the law on minorities, for instance, "formulating" such a law in Switzerland took 20 years, and in Hungary three years. Our draft law was ready within six months. On the other hand, the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe have not come in order to scare us. We have to see things positively. Romania is going through a phase of serious economic difficulties. I think that parliamentary activity is much more important in such areas as economic and fiscal ones. Insofar as the minorities are concerned, we have made steps forward. The activity carried out by the Council for Ethnic Minorities in close cooperation with ethnic minority groups proves this. We have to cooperate. If one side pulls to the right and the other to the left, there is no possibility of moving forward. I think that the visit by the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe augurs well for Romania and we are not at all scared of them. Certainly, we will not be able to say that we have done what we have not yet done. What is important, however, is not to involve politics in minority problems. And there is another thing that should not be forgotten: The problem of minorities does not exist only in Romania; it is a European problem. It would be good if we were the first to solve it, but we cannot make any pledges in this respect.
