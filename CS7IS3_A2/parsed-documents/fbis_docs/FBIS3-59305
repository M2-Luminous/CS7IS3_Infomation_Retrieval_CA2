In addition, over one-half of the residents agreed that the governor should submit his political reform proposals to the Legislative Council by the middle of October. The Hong Kong University Social Sciences Research Center announced yesterday the results of a public opinion survey it conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday [28, 29 Sep] this week. The survey was based on telephone interviews completed with 516 respondents in a random sample, with a completion rate of 53.8 percent. The survey revealed that three-fourths of the interviewees agreed the governor should disclose the content of the Sino-British talks in his legislative proposal, while only one-tenth disagreed. One-half of those interviewed agreed that a cutoff date should be set for the Sino-British talks, while three-tenths disagreed. Among those who agreed to set a time limit, 34 percent thought the cutoff date should be as early as possible, 20 percent clearly hoped the cutoff date would be before the end of this year, and 21 percent considered more than one year should be allowed before ending the talks. When asked whether they agreed that the governor should submit his political reform proposals to the Legislative Council by mid-October, over one-half of the sample agreed, but 27.6 percent disagreed. A somewhat larger than one-third of the interviewees felt that the political reform proposals the governor submitted last year should be completely revised, but 28 percent thought they should be turned over to and decided at the Sino-British talks; only 11 percent felt that the political reform proposals should be submitted without change.
