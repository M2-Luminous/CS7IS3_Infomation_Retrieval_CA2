Narasimha Rao, today underlined the need for a proper balance between development and environment, reports PTI. Presiding over the first meeting of the National Environment Council (NEC) here, Mr Rao reiterated government's commitment to alleviate poverty through development but cautioned that the race for development should not be at the cost of damaging the nature. The Prime Minister stressed for a proper blend of technological advances with the ancient wisdom to ensure that one could live in harmony with nature. "We must look for our own innovation to meet the pollution control requirements," he said, adding that the choice of methods should be limited to least pollution ones. The 112-member body was constituted recently by the government to function as a "think-tank" on important environment policy matters and to advise the ministry of environment and forests. The Prime Minister is the chairman with minister for environment and forests as the vice chairman. The council includes all state and Union territory ministers for environment, secretaries of several ministries and departments of Central government, heads of national institutions and representatives from commerce and industry, eminent environmentalists, journalists and activists. The Prime Minister said that the role of the ministry to control pollution and promote balanced growth through environmental impact assessment should not be considered as an impediment in development. It should be viewed as an enabling one, he said. Calling for greater efforts towards afforestation, he expressed his happiness that the scheme has started bearing fruits as shown by satellite imagery. He recalled that the late prime minister, Ms Indira Gandhi, was the only head of government in 1972 to focus the world attention on environment which has caught the attention of the whole world today. Saying that co-operation at international level was the only way for survival, the Prime Minister said the developed world has the technology to deal with the situation while the developing countries like India have the traditional ethos and "there the two have to supplement each other." Welcoming the delegates, the minister of state for environment and forests, Mr Kamal Nath said the NEC has been constituted as the protection of environment was not the sole preserve of a single ministry. He said it was not even within the exclusive capability of the government system as a whole, whether at the Centre or the states. Mr Kamal Nath said that there is a feeling that his ministry should present an environment survey of the country to Parliament every year, parallel to the economic survey. This survey should project the extent of nature of the "environmental deficit" together with the strategy to reduce it.
