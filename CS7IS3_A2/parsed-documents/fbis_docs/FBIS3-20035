If they do, we must rely on the United States. That is the only alternative, writes Associate Professor Bengt Sundelius in a debate piece on our future security policy. Together with Iceland, Norway, and perhaps Finland, Sweden could develop into a U.S. stronghold on the edge of what in security policy terms is an increasingly independent Europe, Sundelius believes. He himself believes that the safest thing for Sweden is joining the EU. But what if that does not happen? What do we do then? This is an issue that has so far been advanced in the EU debate. Bengt Sundelius, a political scientist living in Stockholm, is the first one to construct a detailed argument about this alternative. It is an exciting piece in the booklet "Sveriges sakerhetspolitiska vagval" ["Sweden's Security Policy Choice"] published by FOLK OCH FORSVAR. Sweden has become smaller and weaker in relation to its neighbors, Sundelius points out. Even during the 1960's, Sweden was one of the major states in Europe. We had a big, strong economy and a powerful defense force that acted as a stabilizer in northern Europe. Since then we have turned from a North European superpower into one small state among [many] others. It is just as well for us to acknowledge that. Our economy looks the way it acts. Nor, for that reason, is it likely that we will be able to pay for a defense force that can deter the rest of the world. Border State If we end up outside the EU, we will become a border state, EU supporters contend. No, quite the opposite, we will become a happy island, say those who say no to the EU in the debate. But both sides are conducting too superficial a debate, Sundelius says. In fact, Swedish isolation in the future is completely unrealistic. But who can we really cooperate with in our security policy? Perhaps with a newly democratic Russia? No, that is not likely. The Russian mess is too great. And above all, we lack a basic community of values with Russia's leader and people, Sundelius says. If we say no to cooperation with Europe, the only thing remaining is to link up with our old connection across the North Atlantic. And if Sweden says no to the EU, Finland will do the same. We should be able to achieve something similar to the Scandinavian defense union that Sweden tried to implement during 1948-49. And this union, which, in addition to Sweden, consists of Finland, Norway, and Iceland, would serve as a link to NATO. Sundelius believes it is conceivable that the United States as well could see the benefits of such a North European security arrangement. No least owing to fears of an ever more independent EU. Few Alternatives Many Swedes would prefer security policy cooperation with the United States, which has proven to be a tested ally in difficult situations, Sundelius believes. On the other hand, he does not believe that opponents of the EU within the Social Democratic and Left Parties and the environmental movement will like a linkage with the remaining superpower, the United States. But what else is there if going into the year 2000 we are sitting outside the EU and have a Russia that might pose a threat and is revanchist as a neighbor? Ranged against Sundelus in the brochure are all of our most familiar security debaters. And the ingenuity [applied] was great when it came to finding terms of abuse for the old Swedish policy of neutrality. There is talk of a neutrality liturgy, long-term hysteria, and hidebound neutralists. There are jokes about Sweden as a once moral superpower. A title that would have fit the contents might also have been "After Neutrality" had it not been for Par Granstedt (Center Party) and Anders Ferm (Social Democratic Party), who both warn against too rapid a revision of Swedish policy. Ferm's essay accomplishes its purpose very well. In the haze, you decrease your speed and navigate slowly and cautiously. The security policy milieu is hazy and uncertain, and the government is not navigating with sufficient caution, his thesis runs. An Obvious Asset Generally speaking, all of the contributors believe that Swedish EU membership is an obvious asset for Swedish security. But several of them criticize the mumbling of politicians on this point. Where security policy is concerned, there is a democratic deficit. The biggest change in our policy in modern times has been initiated without reports and debate, Wilhelm Agrell, for example, believes. And together with him, many in the brochure call for clear answers in such processes. So the stage is set for continued debate -- unless the politicians persevere in the "conspiracy of silence" of which they have been accused.
