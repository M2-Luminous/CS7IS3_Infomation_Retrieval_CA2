In exclusive statements he made to MENA this morning prior to his departure for Tanzania via Germany, he said that his visit to Egypt was to participate in the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. [passage omitted] In reply to a question, he said that he discussed with President Mubarak the question of raising South Korea's diplomatic representation in Cairo to the ambassadorial level. He added that President Mubarak showed an understanding of the situation and this issue will be discussed at the proper time. [passage omitted] On Korea's aid to the Gaza-Jericho area, he said that his country has allocated around $12 million to help rebuild and develop this area's infrastructure in addition to another $200,000 allocated for preparing and equipping the Palestinian police. On the situation in the Korean peninsula and the possibility of war in the region, the South Korean envoy said that North Korea will achieve a gain for itself and the region if it accepts nuclear inspection but will lose if it rejects this inspection. He added: North Korea has to balance between gain and loss and on the basis of this formula, the outbreak of war in the peninsula seems impossible, especially as North Korea is officially saying that it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, does not have the capability to develop them, and has no intention of going to war. But if it rejects inspection, then this will create a major problem.
