On the other hand, companies are wrapping up development of 1&mgr;m processes; and in contrast to the DRAM, which is shifting to a generational co-existence market structure, significant changes are being incorporated into the ASIC based on customer demand. Lower Power Consumption, Higher Speed In the past, LSI technology has driven the development of the DRAM in the Japanese semiconductor industry--two to three years after DRAM mass production has started using the most advanced ultrafine fabrication technology, the same generation technology has been applied to production of the ASIC. However, production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC is already about to begin, even though production of the 16M DRAM started during 1992-93. Fujitsu, which began production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC without delay, is expanding production lines at its Aizu Wakamatsu factory. Toshiba has also begun expansion at its Iwate facility and is preparing a trial production line in the United States. NEC recently announced that it will produce a 0.5&mgr;m cell-based IC in Yamaguchi, following on the heels of the gate array produced in 1992. In contrast to the DRAM market, which has experienced a slow-forming market, NEC reported that ``demand will grow relatively quickly'' for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, in conjunction with demand for low power consumption and fast operating speed in portable type equipment. Toshiba reports that the momentum will make 0.5&mgr;m products the mainstay in terms of quality, by 1995. At first, in order to comply with requirements for personal computer and multimedia applications chiefly in the United States and create a market for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, it was necessary to upgrade the level of system technologies. This was because if the level of integration was raised using ultrafine fabrication technologies, it would take more effort than even before to design one product, and from the user's viewpoint design improvement was reaching its upper limit. New Development on 1&mgr;m Products Being Wrapped Up Therefore, companies involved in device production are quickly abandoning the design of older generation products in order to focus engineering efforts. In particular, NEC and Fujitsu have discontinued taking new orders for products using 1&mgr;m and older technologies. Toshiba is also devoting night-and-day efforts toward the development of submicron products. Of course, as always, the production of 2&mgr;m devices will continue as before. however, if the engineering shift and demand structure match, it appears that the production scale of ASICs using 1&mgr;m and older technology will shrink faster than that of the 1M, which used 1&mgr;m technology and experienced strong demand.
