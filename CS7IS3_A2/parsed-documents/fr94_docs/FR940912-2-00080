(collectively, the ``Parties''). Premises Whereas, on May 1, 1994, Roche entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger with Syntex Corporation (``Syntex'') to acquire all the voting stock of Syntex (hereinafter ``Acquisition''); and Whereas, Syntex with its principal office and place of business located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304, manufacturers and markets through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, the Syva Company, among other things, drugs of abuse reagent products; and Whereas, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Roche, with its principal office and place of business located at 340 Kingsland Street, Nutley, New Jersey 07110, through its subsidiary Roche Diagnostic Systems, Inc., manufacturers and markets, among other things, drugs of abuse reagent products; and Whereas, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine whether it would violate any of the statutes enforced by the Commission; and Whereas, if the Commission accepts the Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), the Commission must place it on the public record for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of ยง2.34 of the Commission's Rules; and Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the status quo ante of the Syva Business as defined in paragraph I. of the Consent Order during the period prior to the final acceptance of the Consent Order by the Commission (after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's ability to require the divestiture of the Syva Business and the Commission's right to have the Syva Business continue as a viable competitor; and Whereas, the purpose of the Hold Separate and the Consent Order is: 1. to preserve the Syva Business as a viable, independent business pending its divestiture as a viable and ongoing enterprise, 2. to remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition, and 3. to preserve the Syva Business as an ongoing and competitive entity engaged in the same business in which it is presently employed until divestiture is achieved; and
