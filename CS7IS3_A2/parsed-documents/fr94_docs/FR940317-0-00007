FR940317-0-00007 FR940317-0-00002 This action will not impose additional costs on handlers because the previously established assessment rates are not being changed. Further, the increased expenses should benefit the industry by assisting in marketing a record-large crop. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this final rule amendment are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to conduct a more aggressive advertising and promotional program to market the largest crop in the industry's history; (2) the marketing season is well underway and further delays in authorizing this increase in expenditures would reduce the program's effectiveness; (3) handlers are aware of this action and need no additional time to comply because the assessment rates are not being changed; (4) no comments were received during the rulemaking proceeding to establish the assessment rates for the current fiscal year which remain unchanged by this action; and (5) no useful purpose would be served by delaying this action.
