In the first reaction by the South, 'Abd al-Rahaman al-Jafri, the vice president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen as declared in the South, said that Sanaa's fifth declared cease-fire "is a new lie to the international community at a time when the U.S. Administration has announced its clear position vis-a-vis the continued bombardment of Aden." In an exclusive interview to KUNA, Al-Jafri said that the South is awaiting the decisions of the international community to save it from annihilation by the North. He added, however, "if the international community and particularly the Security Council proves to be incapable, then the South has the capability of dealing a decisive and strong response to destroy northern areas so that 'Ali Abdallah Salim will realise the meaning of shelling Aden and killing its children and women." [passage omitted] The city is in total darkness because electricity power supplies have been cut as a result of the northern forces' shelling today which hit the main electricity generation station as well as the radio station.
