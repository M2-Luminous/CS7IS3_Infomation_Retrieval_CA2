FR940202-1-00033 FR940202-1-00012 TWRA contends that the word ``combination'' is vague and substantially more inclusive than ``association,'' a term, it claims, has distinct legal meaning and consequences. It states that all associations are combinations, but not all combinations are associations. TWRA advises that both incorporated and unincorporated associations have legal status, obligations, and rights among the members and also in relation to third parties. A ``combination'' is said to have no legal definition similar to an association and to create no definitive similar to an association and to create no definitive rights or obligations. Noting that the Proposed Rule does not require a written document forming a shippers' association, only an ``agreement,'' TWRA takes the position that such an association would have no permanence, structure, or articles of association to establish control of the association and its nonprofit status. In this regard, TWRA points out that the definition of ``shippers' association'' is an almost verbatim restatement of a term used in the Interstate Commerce Act for many years. TWRA advises that the ICC requirements for a shippers' association are: (1) That there be an association; (2) That it consolidate or distribute freight on behalf of its members; and (3) That it have a formal, continuing structure that shows it is a nonprofit association controlled by its members. Discussion Upon review of the comments in this proceeding and a reevaluation of the concerns that prompted this proposal, the Commission has concluded that no final rule is warranted. The legal objections to the Proposed Rule have presented close and difficult questions. These questions need not be resolved at this time, however, because there are practical and policy concerns that counsel against additional regulations affecting service contract negotiations between carriers and shippers' associations. As indicated in the Report of Commissioner Ming C. Hsu, the investigative Officer in Fact Finding Investigation No. 20, Service Contract Negotiations with Shippers' Associations and Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers, issued September 21, 1993, the service contract system appears to be working reasonably well as a general matter. In addition, under the present regulations that merely restate the statutory definition of ``shippers' association,'' shippers have been able to form shippers' associations without apparent undue difficulties. If such an association meets the brief statutory definition, it is free to operate unimpeded by any additional regulatory requirements. By contrast, it appears that the Proposed Rule could create confusion where none presently exists. We note, for example, that even some of the supporting comments opposed specific provisions of the Proposed Rule on the ground that they might be counterproductive or unnecessarily burdensome. Discontinuation of this proceeding without imposing regulations will maintain the status quo in the area of service contract oversight, while allowing the Commission to address specific situations as they arise on an ad hoc basis. We are, accordingly, discontinuing this proceeding without issuing a final rule. Therefore, it is ordered, That this proceeding is discontinued. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary.
