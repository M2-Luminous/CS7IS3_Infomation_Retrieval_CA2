Low-level ozone -- caused by sunlight acting on nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by cars and, to a far lesser extent, industry -- has doubled in Britain this century, the report shows. High concentrations of ozone have been shown to damage the lungs in people who take heavy exercise. Ten per cent of the population are extra sensitive to ozone, and in them the pollution may trigger respiratory diseases. Scientists say that ozone at these levels is likely to cause billions of pounds of damage to paint and building materials, disease in trees and plants and crop damage of more than Â£34 million a year. The report, which shows that peak levels of ozone pollution reach the same levels in the south of England as in smog-ridden Los Angeles, will inevitably add to pressure for tougher curbs on car emissions. Prof David Fowler of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's laboratory near Edinburgh said that ozone pollution -- half of which is drawn in from the Continent -- was "a European problem." The first maps of ozone exposure to be compiled by the Photochemicals Oxidants Review Group show that parts of England and Wales are exposed to harmful levels of ozone for up to 800 hours each year. Levels of exposure either exceed or are very close to safe limits, thought to be 60 parts per billion for humans and 40 parts per billion for plants and crops. The study also shows that levels of nitrogen oxides, produced by cars and power stations, are now double the level of sulphur pollution in Britain. Britain exports 75 per cent of its nitrogen oxides to the Continent. Professor Fowler said that present reductions in pollution from cars expected as a result of new standards for cars in 1996 "will not be sufficient" to improve air quality after the year 2,000.
