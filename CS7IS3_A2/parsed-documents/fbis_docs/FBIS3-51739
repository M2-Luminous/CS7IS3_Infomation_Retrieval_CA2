In exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, Robaina described these reports as clumsy, ill-intended maneuvers. Cuba fully respects the negotiations that are under way between the Angolan Government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Lusaka, Zambia, in the search for a peaceful solution to the Angolan conflict, Robaina emphasized. The Cuban delegation is very much aware of the absurd nature of this maneuver. The issue was discussed from the beginning, and our position of nonintervention was clearly established. Our stand, however, is being distorted precisely at the place where the talks are being held. The foreign minister noted the fact that the topic was discussed with the Angolans themselves, and the fact that Havana clearly established its position of nonintervention in their internal affairs should attract the attention of many people. Cuba maintains full respect for the inter-Angolan dialogue and this position was even stated to President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, he concluded. Robaina began a two-week tour that included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia on 9 January.
