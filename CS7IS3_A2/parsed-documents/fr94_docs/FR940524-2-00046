FR940524-2-00046 FR940524-2-00028 Fiber Size Classification and Measurement: Meeting The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the following meeting. Name: Fiber Size Classification and Measurement. Time and Date: 1 p.m.&hyph;3 p.m., June 7, 1994. Place: Alice Hamilton Laboratory, Conference Room C, NIOSH, CDC, 5555 Ridge Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45213. Status: Open to the public, limited only by the space available. Purpose: The purpose is to conduct an open meeting for the peer review of a NIOSH project entitled ``Fiber Size Classification and Measurement.'' This project concerns the evaluation and improvement of a fiber length classification instrument. This instrument operates by dielectrophoresis, a process that creates a gradient electric field which aligns the fibers and causes their migration toward a cylinder. Because the fibers migrate at a velocity which is proportional to the square of their length (longer fibers migrate at a faster rate than shorter ones), the researcher can select various lengths of fibers by manipulating the voltage that directs the migration of the fibers. The first part of the project will involve improvement and evaluation of the instrument's operational parameters. Fibers classified by length will subsequently be used in a variety of laboratory applications including: (1) Measurement of fiber deposition in respiratory system using a lung model; (2) measurement of fiber penetration through respirator filters; and (3) development of a size-selective fiber sampler for use in collecting personal breathing zone samples. Viewpoints and suggestions from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited. Contact Person for Additional Information: Paul A. Baron, Ph.D., NIOSH, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R7, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, telephone 513/841&hyph;4241. Dated: May 17, 1994. William H. Gimson, Acting Associate Director for Policy Coordination, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12597 Filed 5&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4163&hyph;19&hyph;M
