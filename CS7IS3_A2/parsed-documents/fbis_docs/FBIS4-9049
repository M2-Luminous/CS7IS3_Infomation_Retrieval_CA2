The meeting during Horn's stay in Dunajska Streda was requested by the Slovaks. Horn told MTI, "I explained what the Hungarian Socialists mean by historic reconciliation, how old grievances are to be set aside and history should be for historians rather than politicians. I told the prime minister that we want to take confidence-building steps in this direction." "A basic treaty is vital for relations. If the MSZP enters government after the May elections, Hungary would still sign the treaty. Moravcik spoke of some fear among Slovaks. They hope the basic treaty will fix the inviolabity of borders," Horn said. The MSZP chairman said the basic treaty could eliminate fear. "Of course, all this is closely connected with what the basic treaty should declare on national minorities. I told the prime minister that the Hungarian nation's sense of solidarity with ethnic Hungarians beyond the border is natural. Hungary's efforts for a European agreement protecting national minorities to be signed is also understandable," Horn said. "It is part of the basic treaty that Hungary would promote the economic prosperity of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, and welcome their cultural and administrative autonomy. Of course, reality should always be kept in view," Horn said.
