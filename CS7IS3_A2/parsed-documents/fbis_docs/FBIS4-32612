The preelection declarations of the Hungarian Socialists and liberals, as well as their election programs, signaled a substantially different policy toward the surrounding countries, different from that of the Antall and Boross government, under the tutorship of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). The Socialist and liberals, instead of making complicated maneuvers around the problem of the borders, as interpreted by the MDF, have sufficiently clearly formulated their standpoint rejecting any revision of the existing borders in Central Europe. The future coalition partners, both of them, have simultaneously distanced themselves from the so-called Antall doctrine, according to which the problem of the Hungarian minorities was more important than organizing and developing relations with the neighboring countries. Its implementation has reduced Hungary's interstate relations in Central Europe almost exclusively to the problem of minorities, which obviously complicated bilateral and multilateral contacts in the entire region. Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are building on the idea that the best way to support the Hungarian minorities abroad is to improve relations with the neighboring countries and thus create an atmosphere of mutual trust between them and Hungary. This would mean that a turnabout toward better relations may take place even in Slovak-Hungarian relations, including the signing of a basic treaty between the two countries. However, it would be erroneous to expect that this will be a simple process without problems. On the contrary. We have to examine and evaluate attentively, rationally, and without unnecessary emotions all of the obstacles that the normalization of interstate relations between Slovakia and Hungary might encounter. Even though it is possible to expect that the "proportionalization" of the Hungarian minorities problem (that is, reduce its inflated proportions compared with other goals), in addition to cleansing it of irredentist nostalgia, will become one of the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy, it is more than likely that, in the understanding of this problem, there will be differences between Hungary on one side and Slovakia or Romania on the other. The Socialists, who are most likely to take over the Foreign Ministry in the coalition government, have based their election program on the fact that the basic treaties with the neighboring states, as well as the principle of the inviolability of existing borders, should also contain mutual obligations regarding securing the ethnic minorities' rights in line with European standards and international documents on safeguarding the rights of ethnic minorities. Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are building on the equality of individual and collective rights of minorities, which will certainly not meet with great understanding on the part of their future partners. The search for mutually acceptable ways out and formulations regarding the problems of minorities' rights will be greatly complicated, above all, by the fact that both new government parties consider the right to autonomy to be a decisive part and parcel of collective rights. In their program, the Socialists have elaborated their autonomy concept in very minute detail. They consider several forms of autonomy, starting with cultural autonomy and ending with territorial autonomy, while the process of its establishment is understood as a process that should go through several stages. Most essential is the fact, however, that both the Socialists and liberal democrats have pledged to push for the demand of autonomy for Hungarian minorities as for right corresponding to European standards. Even today it has become obvious that this will be one of the most complicated points in future talks between the new Hungarian Government and its Central European partners because their negative stance on autonomy (above all, territorial autonomy) is generally known. The new Hungarian Government, when discussing basic treaties with Slovakia and other neighbors, will also have to count on a very cautious attitude of most West European countries and European international organizations toward the problem of the collective rights of minorities. Their definition is contained neither in the Vienna Declaration of the Council of Europe nor in the document from the Stability Pact initial conference, which was also signed by Hungary. The negotiating position of Hungary will not be so easy. MSZP and SZDSZ representatives have several times expressed their willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue with Hungary's neighbors. Today, the first signs of a positive change taking place in the atmosphere of Slovak-Hungarian relations have begun to appear. This is an important prerequisite for searching for a mutually acceptable compromise in such a complicated problem as minorities and securing their rights. However, the way to this compromise will certainly be neither easy nor short.
