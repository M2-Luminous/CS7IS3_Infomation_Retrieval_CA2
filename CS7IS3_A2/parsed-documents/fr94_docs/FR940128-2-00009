FR940128-2-00009 FR940128-2-00005 [A&hyph;557&hyph;807] Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Welded Stainless Steel Pipe From Malaysia AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pamela Ward or Shawn Thompson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1174 or (202) 482&hyph;3965, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that welded stainless steel pipe from Malaysia is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47120), the following events have occurred. On September 7, 1993, the sole respondent in this investigation, Kanzen Tetsu Sdn. Bhd. (KT), requested a postponement of the final determination. We granted this request, and on September 9, 1993, we postponed the final determination until not later than January 21, 1994 (58 FR 48849, September 20, 1993). On September 13, 1993, KT submitted a response to the Department's cost of production (COP) questionnaire. On September 27, 1993, we issued a supplemental COP questionnaire to KT. We received the response to this questionnaire on October 25, 1993. From November 8 through November 12, 1993, we conducted our verification in Malaysia of KT's responses to the Department's sales questionnaires. On November 8, 1993, petitioners submitted a letter requesting that the Department reject KT's October 25, 1993, COP response because KT failed to report product-specific production costs, as requested in the cost questionnaire. On November 10, 1993, KT responded to petitioners' November 8, 1993, submission. Also on November 10 we informed KT that we had determined that the cost of manufacture (COM) information contained in the October 25, 1993, submission was not adequately product-specific to meet the Department's requirements, and that, accordingly, we would not verify that portion of the October 25, 1993, submission. From November 22 through November 25, 1993, we conducted our verification in Malaysia of KT's response to the Department's September 13, 1993, COP questionnaire. Both petitioners and respondent filed case briefs on December 20, 1993, and rebuttal briefs on December 28, 1993.
