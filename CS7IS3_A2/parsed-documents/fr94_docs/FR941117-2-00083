FR941117-2-00083 FR941117-2-00054 The essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere.'' Jefferson Parish Hospital v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12, 104 S. Ct., 1551, 1558, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984). A tying arrangement violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act if it is shown to restrain competition unreasonably or is illegal per se. Fortner Enterprises v. U.S. Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 498&hyph;500, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 1256&hyph;1257, 22 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969). The prerequisites of per se illegality are: (1) separate products, the purchase of one (tying product) being conditioned on purchase of the other (tied product); (2) sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to restrain competition appreciably in the tied product; and (3) an effect upon a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product. Id. What is required in a per section case is not power over the whole market for the tying product, but only a ``type of market power [that] has sometimes been referred to as leverage *␣*␣* defined here as a supplier's ability to induce his customers for one product to buy a second product from him that would not be purchased solely on the merit of that second product.'' Id. at 1559 n.20 quoting V.P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, 1134 at 202 (1980). Courts have condemned tying arrangements ``when the seller has `market power' to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market.'' Id. at 1241. Id. at citing United States v. Loew's, Inc., 371 U.S. At 45, 83 S. Ct. at 102. Microsoft not only has sufficient power, it has a monopoly in the MS-DOS/tying product market, that clearly enables it in combination with its licensees to restrict competition in the tied product. Id. at 1345. ``[T]he mere presence of competing substitutes is insufficient to destroy the legal, and indeed the economic, distinctiveness of the copyrighted product.'' United States v. Loew's, Inc., 371 U.S. At 49, 83 S. Cit. at 104. Id. at 1341. In Digidyne v. Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) and Telerate Systems, Inc. v. Caro., 689 F. Supp. 221, 237 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). ( Id. at 808) the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the District Court for the Southern District of New York found software and CPUs, to be ``separate products,'' for purposes of finding tie-ins. Digidyne v. Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) involved litigation between rival computer manufacturers. Data General, the defendant, manufactured a computer system called NOVA, consisting of a central processing unit (``CPU'') and a disk operating system called RDOS. The operating system contained the basic commands for operating the system. Data General refused to license the RDOS to all except the purchasers of its NOVA hardware. The Ninth Circuit held that defendant's refusal to license its computer operating system software except to purchasers of central processing units of its computer system was an unlawful tying arrangement. Stating that tying agreements served hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition. The Court found that conditions such as existed in Digidyne successfully curbed competition on the merits with respect to the tied product,'' by denying competitors free access to the market for the tied product, not because the party imposing the tying requirements has a better product or a lower price, but because of his power or leverage in another market. At the same time buyers are forced to forego their free choice between competing product.'' Id. at 807. Since it is the use of ``power or leverage in another market'' which the antitrust laws proscribe, the Court reasoned that tie-ins are `unreasonable in and of themselves whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product and a `not insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce is affected.'' ``If each of the products may be purchased separately in a competitive market, one seller's decision to sell the two in a single package imposes no unreasonable restraint on either market particularly if competing suppliers are free to sell either the entire package or its several parts. Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. At 12. Microsoft's anticompetitive licenses prevent sellers from doing just that. Licenses specifically restrict the sale of MS-DOS to circumstances where it is tied to an accompanying hardware system.
