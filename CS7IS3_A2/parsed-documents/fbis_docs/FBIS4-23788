The massacre Monday in Bugabira, in the northern province of Kirundo, was initially reported to have been carried out by Rwandan Hutu militants on Tutsi refugees. But UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] envoy here Shelly Peterman said there were signs that the victims of the slaughter were Hutus. Other aid officials allege the killings were carried out by members of the Tutsi-led Burundi army. Peterman said UNHCR staff had attended the arrival at Bugabira of some 500 Rwandan refugees fleeing their own country. The following day the staff returned to find 100 of them dead, he said. He declined to speculate who was responsible, saying that was for the official investigation to determine. Military authorities meanwhile reported clashes between armed gangs at Kayanza in northern Burundi, with about 20 people dead in the last few days. Some observers dispute the figure, saying the toll was higher. Clashes were also reported in the hills to the east of Bujumbura, where armed forces are fighting Hutu extremists chased out of the suburb of Kamenge about two months ago.
