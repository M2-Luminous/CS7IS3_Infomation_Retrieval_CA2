The renewed Export Administration Act, according to Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, represented a "very, very important effort" and was "the first comprehensive effort to reform export control licensing in 15 years." "The legislation strikes the critical balance that is much needed between (nuclear) nonproliferation concerns and economic interests in our export control regime," Brown told a press conference. Among the regulatory changes, officials disclosed, are to decontrol computers to most Western countries up to 1,000 million theoretical operations per second (mtops), which include most of the desktop office machines. For the countries which U.S. said it has nuclear proliferation concerns, the decontrol was moved up to 500 mtops, and for the few countries facing U.S. trade embargo, the decontrol of computers will be allowed to 260 mtops. Last September, as part of the national export strategy, the Multi-agency Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) agreed to a substantial increase from the computers at the level of 12.5 mtops, which is an old Apple Macintosh computer. The new regulation for supercomputers was also raised from 195 mtops, to 1,500 mtops. "This is part of the effort to get rid of obsolete Cold War controls that had no effect on proliferation," said Barry Carter, undersecretary of commerce for export administration. The computer decontrol announced last September is expected to generate 30 billion U.S. dollars of exports a year for the U.S. Trade in computer and telecommunications sources said. The administration officials, meanwhile, stressed that "we're halfway to home now," saying that they are going to consult with congress and the business community for "even more constructive changes." In the new legislation, the administration stressed to use multilateral efforts in export control, improve the U.S. ability to prevent nuclear proliferation, and streamline export control system. The proposed act, which is a combined effort of the commerce department, the defense department and the state department, also stressed to harmonize U.S. sanction laws against the countries with missiles and missile parts, chemical and biological weapons.
