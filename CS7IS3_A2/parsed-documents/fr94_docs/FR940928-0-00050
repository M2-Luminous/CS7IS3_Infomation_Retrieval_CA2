FR940928-0-00050 FR940928-0-00019 The test procedure for incandescent reflector lamps (Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982) is a method for determining the luminous output of incandescent reflector lamps based upon measurement. Two methods are described in LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982, one using an integrating sphere, and the other using intensity distribution measurements. The Department of Energy test procedures incorporate only the intensity distribution measurement procedure because it is more accurate and measurements on similar lamps are more consistent. Requirements for test conditions, equipment, instrumentation, procedures and test report are included. The test procedure for medium base compact fluorescent lamps is a method for measurement of the lumen output of a seasoned lamp (100 hours burn-in) in an integrating sphere or by intensity distribution measurements (Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991). The test procedure requires measurement of the lamp and ballast combination. Therefore, only section 4, reference ballasts, section 5, circuits, and section 6, lamp connections, are incorporated from Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991. Because measurements without a reference ballast may exhibit greater variance in the lumen output and watt input measurements, the Department of Energy invites comments addressing the appropriate confidence bounds and sample size for these lamps. C. Basic Model The Department is including in today's rulemaking definitions of ``basic models'' of general service fluorescent lamp, and general service incandescent lamp in §430.2. These definitions will separate the various types of general service fluorescent lamps by electrical and photometric characteristics, e.g., lamp efficacy, wattage, and color rendering index. General service incandescent lamps are distinguished by their wattage and lamp efficacy. Each unit within a basic model must have the same electrical characteristics. Furthermore, each unit within a given basic model cannot have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption. D. Measures of Energy Consumption The Department of Energy in today's notice is adopting three measures of energy consumption: (a) Estimated annual operating cost, (b) lamp efficacy, and (c) estimated annual energy consumption. These measures are to be included in §430.22(r). The estimated annual operating cost, lamp efficacy, and estimated annual energy consumption will provide the consumer with three means of evaluating the energy efficiency of fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps. The Department has based the calculations of the measures of energy consumption for general service fluorescent lamps on the use of Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM&hyph;9&hyph;1988, for general service incandescent lamps on Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991, for incandescent reflector lamps on Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982 and for medium base compact fluorescent lamps on Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991. •The estimated annual operating cost is expressed in dollars per year. It is the product of the Department of Energy representative unit energy cost for electricity, the input power, and the representative average use cycle.
