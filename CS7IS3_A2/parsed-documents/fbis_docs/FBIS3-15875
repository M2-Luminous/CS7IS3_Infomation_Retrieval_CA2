Zh. Urges That He Be Involved in Legal Action"] [Text] Yesterday marked the end to the 10-day deadline for filing appeals against the ruling by the Shchelkovo court, which deemed the elections in the Shchelkovo electoral district to be invalid. It is well known that Mr. Zhirinovskiy was elected to the State Duma in the district. His lawyer, S. Belyak, said that Zhirinovskiy was not involved in the criminal proceedings either as an interested person or as a plaintiff, hence, he did not have the right to appeal. According to S. Belyak, Vladimir Volfovich learned about the trial only from newspapers. It seems that the case will come to the attention of an oblast court: the district electoral commission, against which the complaint was actually lodged, did file an appeal. V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy] has left a statement at the oblast court objecting to the Shchelkovo city court's ruling and requesting that he be invited to attend the trial as an interested observer. According to S. Belyak, rumors about that have reached Nikolay Ryabov, whose reaction was strongly negative: Zhirinovskiy's lawyer quoted him as saying that "if everyone who failed to enter the State Duma turns to arbitration courts, there will be anarchy in the country!"
