Duran-Ballen said at a news conference at Mariscal Sucre Air Base in Quito that it was decided at the last minute to support President Cesar Gaviria, given the Ecuadoran people's clamor. The president arrived last night in Guayaquil, Ecuador, from Washington, concluding a 16-day tour during which he also visited Tokyo and Beijing. It was not until today that he flew to Quito. He discussed the issue broadly in an attempt to convince the public of the reasons that motivated his sudden change of mind to vote for Colombia -- despite the previous commitment made to support Costa Rica. Duran-Ballen stressed -- visibly annoyed -- that he had not been pressured by the United States to "change" the vote committed to Bernd Niehaus, the Costa Rican foreign minister. He denied local media reports that he had changed his vote after meeting, during his stay in Washington, with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. The president defended the decision as serious Ecuadoran foreign policy and assured that in the OAS elections he made a decision based on "his own criteria and without any external influence." He explained that Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, who according to the opposition should resign for being incompetent, has his trust and will remain in his post, as he is doing a "magnificent job." Duran-Ballen added that in light of Cesar Gaviria's candidacy and the prestige he had gained leading his government "we ended up changing Ecuador's position." The local media and the opposition censured the president and Foreign Minister Diego Paredes for annulling four times its support to Costa Rica before deciding to vote for Colombia, due to alleged U.S. pressure. Duran-Ballen, 72, arrived last night in Ecuador ending a 16-day absence. He was on a working tour to Japan, China, and on a private visit to the United States where he underwent a routine medical checkup. The plane that transported Duran-Ballen and his delegation from the United States was not able to land last night in Quito due to bad weather and was forced to divert to Guayaquil. The president spent the night in Guayaquil and this morning returned to the Ecuadoran capital.
