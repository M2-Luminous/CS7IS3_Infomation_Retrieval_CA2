During the visit, Butrus-Ghali wants to ensure that Germany increases its political, military, and financial contribution to the United Nations. The secretary general wants, for example, a standing rapid deployment force. About 20 states should each supply 2000 troops, which can be placed under UN command within one week. I now welcome Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on the telephone from Bonn. Good morning, Mr. Kinkel. [Kinkel] Good morning, Mr. [name indistinct]. [Correspondent] In a newspaper interview, Butrus-Ghali presented quite detailed ideas. To quote him, he said we will ask Germany for, at most, 1 percent of its armed forces for possible participation in missions. How will you respond to this request? [Kinkel] Well, first we need a constitutional amendment, to which I am sorry to say the Social Democratic Party [SPD] has offered enormous resistance up to now. I am also very interested in how Mr. Scharping will defend this today in Washington in his talks with the president. As long as we have no constitutional amendment--for which we can at present only wait again for a decision from the Federal Constitutional Court, and in April we have a public hearing in Karlsruhe--as long as we have no such decision, we need not and cannot give specific consideration to the requests and ideas of the secretary general. It is obvious that we are interested as a coalition and as a government not only in obtaining our rights within the United Nations, but also in performing our duties to the United Nations in the future--also with regard to the provision of soldiers for UN blue helmet and other missions. We will certainly not leave the secretary general in the lurch on this. I cannot say anything specific to him on this at the moment, however. [Correspondent] What is your view, in principle, of the plan for a rapid intervention force to be placed permanently at the disposal of the UN secretary general? [Kinkel] It is an idea that has been considered for some time, not only by the secretary general himself but also by the United Nations. At present, the situation is that the UN secretary general has to go around to the countries cap-in-hand for every mission and must ask who is willing to participate under very specific conditions. There is, of course, something to be said for this, but there is something against it. I do not think this idea is wrong as such, and we have quite positive views on it, too. I would not like to commit myself now on behalf of the German Government because it is simply too early. We will, as I say, not leave the secretary general in the lurch. [Correspondent] What can Germany's contribution to the United Nations look like in the future? [Kinkel] Well, first of all, we are the third-largest contributor at the moment. Furthermore, the actions of the United Nations do not consist solely of peacekeeping or peacemaking [preceding two words in English] actions, but the United Nations concerns itself with overpopulation, with famine, with the problem of disadvantaged children--UNICEF--and so on. We participate in this in a huge way and are making quite a considerable contribution, so we have not had to hide our light under a bushel up to now. What we have not been able to do up to now is to take part in peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts; that will require an amendment to the Basic Law. [Correspondent] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, the German United Nations Association advised against insisting on a seat for Germany on the Security Council. The reason they gave was that otherwise there is the danger that an expanded Council would become incapable of action. Would the German Government be better advised to drop its wish for a seat in the Security Council? [Kinkel] No. Nor do I understand how such a view came to be expressed there. In all opinion surveys, some 75 percent of the population support the intention of the government and the coalition to seek such a seat, and the figure is rising. By the way, it was not the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] or the Free Democratic Party [FDP], but the SPD that was the first to call for a seat. Beginning in 1995, we want a nonpermanent seat in the Security Council because it is our turn again in the rotation, and we would like [passage indistinct]. It is not a matter of adding only Germany and Japan to the Security Council. That is not the demand at all. The discussion only arose after Third World countries quite rightly said that the current composition of the Security Council does not reflect the world situation but is the result of World War II. The fact is that the German demand is understood and supported wherever you look. [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, yesterday the United Nations carried out air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde for the second time within 24 hours. How strongly does the German Government support these attacks? [Kinkel] Completely. What happened there yesterday and the day before yesterday is based on Security Council Resolution 836 and is thus covered in UN terms, as it were, and is also covered in NATO terms. The fundamental decisions were made last year, the decisions to defend the safe areas laid down by the United Nations by using force against force if necessary, as it were. The measures taken yesterday and the day before yesterday were slightly different. In that case, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] observers were put at risk by Serb shelling; therefore, NATO was called on to help. The measures were right, necessary, and justified. [Correspondent] What will happen if the Serb attacks on Gorazde continue? [Kinkel] If the Serb attacks on Gorazde continue--and I hope they will not because I would like to think that the Serbs must know that the United Nations and NATO will not accept this--but if they should continue, as Mr. Woerner said yesterday, we will have to do something and consider whether an ultimatum will possibly have to be announced in line with what happened in Sarajevo. However, this is not on the agenda at present. Of course, we have to make sure that matters do not escalate. I have always been in favor, and now even more so, of always involving the Russians. [Correspondent] Do you expect Moscow to raise objections to further air strikes carried out by NATO or the United Nations? [Kinkel] Yes, there certainly will be objections. [words indistinct] (?Russia cannot be allowed simply to impose a veto on such actions, which are necessary, which have been decided upon and are covered by law). However, this has nothing to do with.... [pauses] I would like to emphasize this: that everything possible must be done to include the Russians, and this has always been our policy. [words indistinct] [Correspondent] During your meeting with Butrus-Ghali today, will you and Chancellor Kohl also be raising Germany's wish that UN institutions be established in Bonn? [Kinkel] Yes, I will be. I have done this persistently in the past, and I will do it again today. We want appropriate UN institutions to be located in Germany, and particularly in Bonn. The secretary general is familiar with our request. I have talked to him about it on several occasions. Incidentally, this is his third visit to Bonn. We will, of course, again raise the matter of making Hamburg the headquarters of the International Maritime Court. These are our wishes, and I hope that UN institutions of one kind or another will come here to Bonn. [Correspondent] The last question, Mr. Kinkel. You are also the FDP's federal chairman. The presidium yesterday specified that it would form future coalitions with the CDU. Juergen Moellemann, the FDP chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia, said this morning that the FDP federal party conference in Rostock would have to state more precisely its coalition intentions. He said that, on the one hand, key issues should be explained. Second, he said you should opt for a coalition with the CDU only if the election result produces this. Will the FDP leave itself a way out so that it can form a coalition with the SPD after the Bundestag election? [Kinkel] The proposal I made yesterday and the decision made by the FDP were quite clear. We will wait and see what happens at the meeting of the FDP federal executive and the party conference in Rostock. I would not like to comment on this matter beforehand.
