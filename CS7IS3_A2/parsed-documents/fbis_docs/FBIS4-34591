FBIS4-34591 "drlat120_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-120 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 MEXICO Indians, Peasants Refuse To Negotiate With Governor Indians, Peasants Refuse To Negotiate With Governor PA2106194694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 20 Jun 94 p 71 PA2106194694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO Spanish BFN [Report by correspondent Gabriela Coutino] [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Peasant and Indian members of the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [CEOIC] who have been waging a sit-down strike are refusing to put their trust in and open negotiations with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and other representatives of the federal government because, they argue, "we signed a draft agreement with them on 4 April and they failed to comply." Meanwhile, Lopez Moreno has explained to the media that he is not the federal government's commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas: "As governor, it is my duty to coordinate compliance with federal and local agreements intended to strengthen peace." Lopez Moreno convened a news conference to discuss the status of the state. In addition, he maintained that conditions exist for holding elections on 21 August. He indicated that within the past 40 hours, significant progress has been achieved at the five bargaining tables that were set up to establish a more direct dialogue with CEOIC members. He did not, however, give any details, and he would only say "they were discussing" the agenda outlined by the organization. As for the upcoming elections, Lopez Moreno stated: "We are moving on satisfactorily, and we maintain good relations with all political organizations." Tonight, he indicated he will hold a meeting with ranchers and small rural landowners to jointly set up a working agenda -- following the same pattern used with the CEOIC -- and, in turn, respond to complaints made by the ranchers. The peasants, meanwhile, pointed out that the government is still lying and that no substantial progress or results have come from their negotiations. The Emiliano Zapata Proletariat Organization [OPEZ], a member of the CEOIC, noted in a news release: "The government is encouraging ranchers and landowners by claiming that it will act in keeping with the law (land evictions) to recover seized properties." It says that in light of this situation, President Salinas should handle the Chiapas problem himself. Having lost hope, the peasants view "the system as their historic enemy." The news release states that Chiapas is experiencing a class conflict in which the government has ceased to be an arbiter and has become the ally of the rich. The rich put the government in power, and the rich expect to benefit from government policies. This is why Colosio was assassinated, OPEZ adds. Camacho was forced to resign because the government still believes Chiapas will be a deciding factor in the upcoming elections. But now, OPEZ asserts, current circumstances favor us. A unique situation exists, because now there is a Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. "There are no peace agreements," elections are coming, and society has great expectations. If there are no solutions, we "will radicalize" our position by seizing land and carrying out actions to force the government to heed us and answer our demands. Another situation affecting the state stems from discontent in several local mayor's offices. Following six days in jail, four municipal officials from Angel Albino Corzo were freed by peasants who demanded an investigation into the case and the mayor's dismissal. According to the Chiapas Public Prosecutor's Office, the municipal presidency remains closed to prevent any aggression. Proposals From the Chiapas Diocese Tuxtla Gutierrez Bishop Felipe Aguirre Franco said three Chiapas dioceses will present several plans and proposals to the federal government on the armed conflict. Pope John Paul II will give his authorization for this action. Aguirre Franco added that the bishops' proposal has been addressed to the Mexican Government through Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. At this point, Aguirre Franco believes that both the federal and the state governments are making "adjustments," but this does not mean that negotiations are at a standstill but, rather, that the new EZLN proposals are being studied. Aguirre mentioned that on 1-11 July he will be in Rome, where he will meet with the pope. He will submit an in-depth report on the works conducted by his diocese within the past six years to the pope. He will also give his view regarding the armed Indian uprising in the area of the Chiapas highlands and the Lacandona Jungle, and he will give a thorough account of developments since the EZLN's emergence.
