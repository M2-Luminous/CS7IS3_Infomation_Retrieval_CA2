At a grand banquet to welcome visiting Premier Li Peng, President Nazarbayev used this proverb to figuratively and profoundly express aspirations of peoples of the two countries who are willing to be friendly for generations. Situated at the northern foot of the Ili Mountain Range, Almaty City, with flourishing trees lining its streets, faces snow-capped mountains in the south. The national flags of China and Kazakhstan are fluttering in the wind along the city's major streets. It is a city that links Sino-Kazakh friendship. Both the ancient "Silk Road" and today's Eurasian Bridge pass through this vintage city. Premier Li Peng and Kazakh leaders are writing a new chapter of Sino-Kazakh relations together with sincere words including "good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation." In the past few days, Kazakh mass media have been using nice phrases, including "a great country" and "a friendly neighbor," to report on China's situation and Premier Li Peng's visit. FIELD OF VISION PAPER [shi ye bao 6018 6851 1032] hailed China's reform policy, claiming that "proceeding from specific national conditions and refusing to blindly copy other country's models" were an important experience of China's successful reform. KAZAKHSTAN INFORMATION PAPER [xiao xi bao 3194 1873 1032] used the phrase "a new and important phase of Sino-Kazakh cooperation" as a headline to report on Premier Li Peng's visit. The magnificent Kazakh presidential palace was particularly splendid under full view of the sun. However, people were more interested in the talks between Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev and in the agreements reached by both sides. Because of their friendly relationship and the extensive topics under discussion, the two leaders had to extend their talks one hour longer than originally scheduled. Many reporters had come early and had been waiting at the agreement-signing hall. In addition to Chinese and Kazakh reporters, many Russian reporters and colleagues from THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION, and Turkish newspapers were present. A Kazakh Foreign Ministry official told the reporters: The mass media are paying very close attention to Premier Li Peng's visit. It is seldom that so many foreign reporters have come to Almaty to prepare news reports. Naturally, the most important agreement reached by both countries was the border agreement. Around noon, Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev, full of smiles, entered the agreement-signing hall together. While cameras continuously flashed, they raised their pens and signed the Sino-Kazakh border agreement. Both Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev spoke highly of the agreement, saying that "the signing of the agreement has historic significance in Sino-Kazakh relations and is an important indicator of the development of good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries." Kazakh Prime Minister Tereshchenko, who was recuperating in Moscow, hurriedly returned to Almaty solely to welcome visiting Premier Li Peng. With a cane in hand and together with Premier Li Peng, he climbed up to a rostrum in the Almaty Business Center's Conference Lounge. Several hundred Kazakh economic and trade officials and entrepreneurs earnestly listened to Premier Li Peng at the lounge on developing economic and trade relations between China and Central Asia. A coal mine expert said: "We fully agree with Premier Li Peng's speech where he stressed mutually beneficial cooperation. The two countries share 1,700-odd km of common boundaries and have been maintaining traditionally friendly relations. There are natural conditions, including favorable opportunities and locales, for us to carry out economic and trade cooperation." During an interview with the reporters, Kazakh Ambassador to China Auezov indicated: Premier Li Peng's visit is the first visit by a ranking Chinese leader to Kazakhstan since its independence. It is very important politically and economically. A Kazakh friend likened the current Sino-Kazakh relations to a vigorously growing tree of friendship. He said: Under the utmost careful cultivation of leaders and peoples of the two countries, the tree will bear abundant fruit.
