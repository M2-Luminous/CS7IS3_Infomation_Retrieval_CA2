ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend the regulations of the Department of Justice (Department) implementing titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to incorporate, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities as they are revised in the interim rule with request for comments being published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . In so doing, the proposed rule would establish new ADA standards for construction and alterations covered by the Department's title II regulations. (The guidelines set forth in the Access Board's interim rule are effective only as guidance for the Departments of Justice and Transportation; they have no effect on the public and should not be used by the public until such time as the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation adopt them as standards.) The proposed rule would also add new enforcement procedures to subpart F of the title II regulation. DATES: To be assured of consideration, comments must be in writing and must be received on or before August 19, 1994. Comments that are received after the closing date will be considered to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule should be sent to: Merrily A.
