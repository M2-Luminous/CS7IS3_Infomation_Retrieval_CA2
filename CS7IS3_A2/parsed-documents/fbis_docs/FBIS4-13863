This was stated by a responsible source at the Foreign Ministry on the occasion of the first non-racial elections to be held in South Africa on Tuesday. The Egyptian source said that the current stage in which democratic changes are taking place in South Africa demands extreme vigilance because it is difficult to eliminate the legacy of racism and tribalism in a very short time. He added that the elections require the support of all local, regional, and international political forces to thwart the plans of the enemies of democracy. The source affirmed that the democratic changes in South Africa are consistent with the views and will of the international community. He added that attempts to frustrate these changes will fail because they are not in the interest of the South African people.
