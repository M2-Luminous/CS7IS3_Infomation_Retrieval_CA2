However, it is a mere $700 million. [Okonski] The population of the Soviet Union [SU] was almost 290 million people; the population of Russia is approximately 150 million. In line with official data, SU's imports in 1990 totalled $120 billion; Russia's imports in 1992 were approximately $35 billion and, in 1993, dropped by another 27 percent. By limiting imports (including imports from Poland), Russia, undergoing enormous economic difficulties, is trying to protect its active balance of the turnover. It is trying to find money to pay off its foreign debt, which is almost twice as large as Poland's ($82 billion). Until 1990, our trade was conducted in unreal money--transfer rubles. There was not much that could be bought for this currency, and, if anything, it was only used in bilateral trade. Trade was regulated not so much through commercial contracts but through orders issued by the "center." Prices were also shaped administratively to a considerable degree. The coincidence of all of these circumstances: The economic crisis in Russia and the recession in our country, lasting until 1992, new world-level prices, the necessity for real foreign currency for purchases simply had to affect the trade in some way. In relations with some other countries of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance [CEMA], the breakdown was even deeper. We must also remember what constituted most of our exports to SU. We sold mainly machines and devices. The demand for them has in recent years considerably decreased in Russia. [Krauss] There is no chance, then, to increase our exports to Russia in the near future? The West has made a fierce attack on the Russian market, with success, if we take a closer look at the geographic structure of Russia's purchases. As recently as 1990, there was only one Western state among the five greatest trade partners of Russia: Germany. The leading five also included Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Now (in 1992), the first five positions are occupied by Germany, Italy, China, the United States, and France. There is no state belonging to the former CEMA. [Okonski] Russia is a market of huge possibilities; it attracts the attention of all exporters. With the potential of this country, it is to be expected, in the general opinion of experts, that the economic collapse will eventually be stopped, and, in a few years, production growth will begin once again. This will increase the demand for imports and increase export capabilities. At that time, those partners of Russia who are already in that market will have a chance to develop their businesses quite significantly. It will be a chance that is offered to a few markets in the world. Our ambition is not to increase our exports to the Russian market. We would like to see that the import savings do not affect the purchases made in our country. This is our task in the near future. In other words, we would like to maintain exports to Russia on the same level we have so far; we would not like to lose what we already have. [Krauss] What can we offer Russia? In what areas can we be competitive compared to other partners, who are also aspiring to maintain and increase their presence on this market? [Okonski] Traditionally, the goods that are well known on the Russian market and that have a good name are food, highly processed consumer goods such as household appliances, clothing, fabric, shoes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and others. However, this does not exhaust our export capabilities. It must be remembered that we sent huge amounts of investment equipment to the former Soviet market. Polish equipment was used in the construction of hundreds of factories and other production objects. A large number of them were built in Russia. What is needed is service and spare parts. It will also be necessary to modernize many of these: metallurgical enterprises, sulfur-processing enterprises, mines with an element that is very important in the extraction industry--the devices ensuring industrial safety, food-processing enterprises, power plants, etc. If we do not let others push us out, this may become the springboard for developing investment exports once again. Documents submitted to the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, which has approved them, envision increasing exports in this direction by 30 percent by 1997. If we are consistent, it will be quite possible to put this plan into effect. Regarding construction of new objects, the situation is more complex. We may be competitive, but Russia must be able to afford to embark on such investment undertakings. For the time being, the scope of new investment is very limited. However, there are announcements that are very promising to our exporters. I am thinking primarily about the construction of a new natural gas pipeline to Western Europe, part of which--over 500 kilometers--will pass through Poland. Several thousand kilometers of the pipeline will go through Russia. This may be a great "labor front" for us, an opportunity to obtain attractive orders, just like the planned construction of super highways. Polish road-construction machines are of an entirely different technology generation in comparison with what we had 10 years ago. Many of them are already in use in East Asia under American names, and they are proving themselves quite well. We really are not worse than the machine suppliers from Germany, Japan, and other states. [Krauss] However, investment export is rarely conducted in cash; it needs to be supported with credit. Where are the banks in Poland that could afford to conduct operations involving such huge capital? [Okonski] There already are examples of forming consortia for the service of very large exports contracts. For the time being, they do not pertain to the Russian market. They concern the Chinese Consortium of Polish banks, of course, with guarantees of the Bank of China--it opened a credit line of approximately $400 million. However, Russia is currently a particularly high risk market, and, for the time being, this limits the possibility of employing such solutions and also of employing in Russia the resources of the Exports Credits Insurance Corporation (insurance on the political risk, catastrophes, and other difficult-to-predict events), which has been well capitalized recently. [Krauss] The recently announced report of the Central Planning Administration, entitled "The Economic Situation of Poland in 1993 Compared to Other Countries," stresses, among other things, that one of the unsatisfactory results of foreign trade in the countries of our region is the weakness of "systemic and institutional support of exports." [Okonski] We are trying to support the exports to the difficult Russian market. We have submitted to the Russian party a proposal of signing long-term commercial contracts concerning merchandise that is important to both states from a strategic standpoint: raw materials for Poland (oil, natural gas, metals), and for Russia pharmaceuticals, food, and equipment for its key investments. We have already received verbal support and are now awaiting a reply. A "governmental" instrument is also annual commercial protocols that ensure the maintenance of the minimum level of turnover in the main groups of commodities (such a protocol concerning 1992 proved itself; now we want to conclude appropriate protocols for 1994 and 1995), a commercial protocol on the exchange of special equipment (spare parts for military equipment, which both armies will need for a long time--totaling tens of millions of U.S. dollars), and an agreement on military and technological cooperation. Cooperation in the armament industries is not at all a closed chapter. We witnessed a commercialization of the best technologies, so the cooperation of experts of special industries may be very useful. They might cooperate in the area of modernization of our armies and in exporting equipment to third markets. Another area of this cooperation might include the adjustment of production capacities in these industries, which are too high, to civilian needs. [Krauss] You failed to include the settlement of old debts on the list of government activities. [Okonski] This will not happen overnight. It is a very complex issue, and we should leave it to specialists. The past cannot block our present relations. We are concentrating primarily on what can be done to increase the exchange, to increase its extent and intensity. I have discussed government initiatives that are supposed to make it easier for exporters to get access to the Russian market. However, the administration also wants to support the activities of "economic entities" and their associations (economic chambers, business clubs, regional associations, and others), activities that are supposed to help those companies remain on the Russian market. For example, this year our ministry has $10 million to finance various promotional initiatives: participation in exhibitions and fairs, economic missions, seminars. However, at least half of the money needed for these activities must be paid by the companies themselves. We merely partially subsidize such initiatives--if they are reasonable and economically well-founded. Our offices of commercial advisers are also at the disposal of entrepreneurs: They provide information, contacts, etc. [Krauss] And the effect of these activities is a surplus in the economic turnover with Russia? [Okonski] We are not counting on a surplus, even though it would be good to decrease the present deficit, which amounts to approximately $600-700 million a year. What is important is that Russia can supply us with many fundamental materials (oil, natural gas, etc.) at competitive prices and on favorable terms. Even though we do not want to recreate the former full dependence, commercial criteria must be taken into account. We would like to cover essential expenditures by means of our exports to a maximum degree. The limit, however, would be profitability of exports. Another factor that encourages seeking markets for our goods in Russia is that exports increase the number of workplaces, which is quite significant for a country with almost 3 million unemployed people. Even if we do not achieve any surpluses of foreign currencies in our trade with Russia, the employment effect is certainly of some economic-social importance. [Krauss] Thank you for the interview.
