These facilities would include access roads, boat ramps, fishing piers, a ranger station, sanitary facilities, campgrounds, picnic tables and a maintenance and storage area. Additional land is needed to provide adequate access to the lake for fishing, boating, camping, hiking and picnicking. The ``Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact'' (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. The environmental assessment and basic data may be reviewed by contacting Richard N. Duncan. No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until thirty (30) days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register . (This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 10.904_Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.)
