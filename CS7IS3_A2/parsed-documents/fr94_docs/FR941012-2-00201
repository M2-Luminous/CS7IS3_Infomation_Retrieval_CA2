FR941012-2-00201 FR941012-2-00119 Furthermore, Congress included the language in question as an amendment to 49 U.S.C. 47101, which is a statement of the policy of the United States. Congress chose not to include the provision as an amendment to 49 U.S.C. 47107, which specifies practices that airport proprietors must agree to as a condition for receipt of grants. In addition, section 110 of the 1994 Authorization Act stands in marked contrast to sections 112 and 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act, in which Congress directed the Secretary to develop policies and procedures to address the reasonableness of rates and charges imposed on airlines and to define airport revenue diversion. In particular, nowhere in the 1994 Authorization Act is the Secretary explicitly directed to establish standards of reasonableness for nonaeronautical rates and charges or total airport revenue. At the time of enactment, however, the DOT/FAA had already published its proposed policy, and that policy would not have applied to nonaeronautical rates and charges. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that Congress would have included clear and explicit direction to the Secretary to establish standards of reasonableness for nonaeronautical rates and charges just as it did for carrier rates and charges in section 112 had Congress intended to mandate such a result. Finally, DOT/FAA have considered the legislative history of this provision. The Conferees described section 110 of the Authorization Act as ``[r]eaching a middle ground on this aspect of airport finances *␣*␣*'' H.R. Rep. 103&hyph;677 at 68 (August 5, 1994). DOT/FAA consider our approach to be more in keeping with this view of section 110 than would an approach that treated section 110 as mandating a cap on total airport revenue. Section 110 and the modifications to the proposed policy encouraged airport proprietors not to ``seek to create revenue surpluses'' in excess of airport needs. The DOT/FAA recognize that in any given year, surpluses may exceed projections if traffic exceeds forecast levels or costs are held below forecast amounts. The existence of a surplus in any given year is not necessarily evidence that an airport proprietor is not following this policy guidance. However, as is provided in the proposed policy statement, the progressive accumulation of substantial amounts of airport revenues may warrant an FAA inquiry into the airport proprietor's application of revenues to the local airport system.
