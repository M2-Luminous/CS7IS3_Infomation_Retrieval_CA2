What is the explanation for this development? [Prisacaru] As a government party, the PDSR bears, to a great extent, responsibility for the foreign policy promoted by the Government of Romania. However, from this point of view, it is known that one of our priority objectives is connecting to Western democratic values, including those of the French. The development of Romanian-French relations responds not only to the call of history but also to the requirements of the period in which we are living. We are sure that France can give more active support to the reform process and the integration of Romania into the European structures and that our Latin sisters cannot remain indifferent to the enhancement of the role of our country as a factor of stability in our zone. There is no doubt that the state visit which President Ion Iliescu will make to France in April is part of this process. Democratic political groups in both countries can contribute -- through dialogue and cooperation -- to the promotion of fruitful collaboration in a wide variety of fields. [Benga] What political groups did you meet with during your recent visit to France? [Prisacaru] Let me begin with the French Socialist Party which, like the PDSR, ascribes to modern social-democratic values. The discussions with Gerard Fuchs, member of the Executive Bureau, secretary for international affairs of the French Socialist Party, proved the usefulness of this meeting for a better knowledge of the objectives and concerns of the two parties. Of course, the French Socialist Party, which became an opposition party after the recent elections, is especially concerned with defining objectives, both in domestic and international policy, which would permit the recovery of lost political capital and, at the same time, of its electorate. The impressive street demonstration in Paris on 16 February. in support of public and lay education, of which the French Socialist Party was one of the main organizers, proved this. The approaching elections for the European Parliament offer the Socialist Party the opportunity to present the preponderantly European option which it established at the time of the last party congress in November 1993, at which the former prime minister, Michel Rocard, took over the leadership of the party. The hosts demonstrated a special interest in learning about the current political situation and the development of the process of transition in Romania as well as the way in which the PDSR intends to supersede existing difficulties. We also met with Jean Claude Mignon, deputy in the French National Assembly and national secretary for the Eastern Democracies in the Assembly for the Republic Party (RPR), which is currently the governing party. The artisan and president of this party -- Gaullist in essence --is Jacques Chirac, the mayor general of Paris, and the current prime minister of France, Eduard Balladur, belongs to this party. I must confess that I had an extremely pleasant surprise when, during my discussions with the RPR representative, I noted not only a genuine interest in gaining the proper perception of the socio-political situation in Romania but also a great desire to continue the dialogue on the ways to promote a closer Romanian-French collaboration. Finally, the third group with which we had discussions was the Movement of Leftist Radicals (MRS), one of the oldest French political groups, which has parliamentary repesentation, and which gave France a far from negligible number of political personalities. Few people know that the MRS is one of the first parties -- before the appearance of some distinct groups -- to be concerned about ecological issues. Not affiliated with any existing international organization -- neither socialist, nor liberal, nor Christian-Democratic -- the MRS supports the idea of the establishment of a structure of centrist parties which, especially in the northern countries of Europe, enjoy considerable popularity. Both sides expressed a desire to continue to exchange opinions on matters of common interest. [Benga] From what you have said, it appears that you will not limit your contacts in France to the Socialist Party. Is this a more general option for the PDSR? [Prisacaru] Indeed, this is a basic option of our party. Of course, we are assigning the proper importance to the promotion of cooperation with the socialist and social-democratic parties which are members of the Socialist International or are interested in associating with it in one form or another. However, this does not mean that we are not promoting a dialogue with other democratic political groups. The relations which the PDSR has with parties outside the socialist spectrum in Greece, France, Great Britain, Spain, or Italy are proof of this option. In any case, in the eyes of these groups, the PDSR is neither "cryptocommunist" nor "antireformist." On the contrary, they evaluate the PDSR not so much on the basis of such statements, as, in particular, on the basis of its concrete actions which prove its total commitment to expanding the democratic processes, establishing the state of law and the market economy, stopping the decline and, in the future, raising the standard of level of the population. We presented such aspects to our French hosts so that our partners would get to know us better and would have the most accurate picture of Romania. [Benga] Were you invited to the French Communist Party Congress? [Prisacaru] We received an invitation to the congress but our party did not attend. We are awaiting with interest the decisions of the congress regarding the orientation of its program and the principles of organizing the party, keeping in mind the fact that this represents the interests of a certain segment of the French population. Dialogue and cooperation with this leftist French party remain an open possibility. Everything depends on the identification, in the future, of common options which would promote the development of Romanian-French relations and peace and security in the world.
