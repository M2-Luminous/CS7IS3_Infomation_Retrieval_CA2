FR940928-1-00014 FR940928-1-00003 The CARB submitted a 1990 emissions inventory of ozone precursors as required by section 182(a)(1) on November 12, 1992. On November 18, 1993 the CARB submitted a revised 1990 emissions inventory of ozone precursors which EPA found incomplete on April 13, 1994 because the emissions inventory had not gone through an adequate public notice and hearing process. To correct the deficiency, the BAAQMD held a public hearing on July 29, 1994 (which was the maintenance plan 1990 attainment inventory submitted on November 12, 1993) and will submit the appropriate documentation to EPA. Through this document, EPA also proposes to approve the 1990 emissions inventory as required by section 182(a)(1). Currently, the BAAQMD is in the process of amending certain VOC RACT regulations required by sections 182(a)(2)(A) and 182(b)(2) which EPA must fully approve into the SIP prior to final action on the redesignation request and maintenance plan. 2 The following is a list of the deficient VOC RACT regulations: 2 EPA has received all of the VOC RACT rules required by section 182(a), but the rules do not meet all of EPA requirements for full approval. EPA has met extensively with the BAAQMD to discuss specific revisions to correct RACT deficiencies. EPA is unable to make a definitive determination on the approvability of these rules until EPA receives and reviews the formal SIP revision from the CARB. ‚ê£ 1Rule No. 1Rule title 8&hyph;1 General Provisions. 8&hyph;2 Miscellaneous Operations. 8&hyph;4 General Solvent & Surface Coating Operations. 8&hyph;7 Gasoline Dispensing Facilities. 8&hyph;8 Wastewater (Oil-Water) Separators. 8&hyph;11 Metal Container Closure and Coil Coating. 8&hyph;12 Paper, Fabric, and Film Coating. 8&hyph;13 Light and Medium Duty Motor Vehicle Assembly Plants. 8&hyph;14 Surface Coating of Large Appliance and Metal Furniture. 8&hyph;15 Emulsified and Liquid Asphalts. 8&hyph;16 Solvent Cleaning Operations. 8&hyph;19 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products. 8&hyph;20 Graphic Arts Printing and Coating Operations. 8&hyph;22 Valves and Flanges at Chemical Plants. 8&hyph;23 Coating of Flat Wood Paneling and Wood Flat Stock. 8&hyph;24 Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Manufacturing Operations. 8&hyph;25 Pump and Compressor Seals at Petroleum Refineries, Chemical Plants, Bulk Plants, and Bulk Terminals. 8&hyph;28 Pressure Relief Valves at Petroleum Refineries and Chemical Plants. 8&hyph;29 Aerospace Assembly and Component Coating Operations. 8&hyph;30 Semiconductor Manufacturing Operations. 8&hyph;31 Surface Coating of Plastic Parts and Products. 8&hyph;32 Wood Product Coatings. 8&hyph;33 Gasoline Bulk Terminals and Gasoline Delivery Vehicles. 8&hyph;34 Solid Waste Disposal Sites. 8&hyph;35 Coating, Ink, and Adhesive Manufacturing. 8&hyph;38 Flexible and Rigid Disk Manufacturing. 8&hyph;39 Gasoline Bulk Plants and Gasoline Delivery Vehicles. 8&hyph;40 Aeration of Contaminated Soil. 8&hyph;41 Vegetable Oil Manufacturing Operations. 8&hyph;42 Large Commercial Bakeries. 8&hyph;43 Surface Coating of Marine Vessels. 8&hyph;45 Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Coating Operations. 8&hyph;47 Air Stripping and Soil Vapor Extraction Operations. 8&hyph;50 Polyester Resin Operations.
