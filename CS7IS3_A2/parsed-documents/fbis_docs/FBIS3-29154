"I cannot believe the premier and the foreign minister have not strongly conveyed Japan's stance on the yen's appreciation," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. "If Japan-U.S. relations are really mature, they should have talked about how to deal with the yen's surge" with the U.S. side when they visited Washington last week, Mori added. The U.S. currency dropped sharply against the yen in Tokyo on Tuesday, closing at 102.02 yen, down 3.67 yen from Monday's close. The dollar has been under intense downward pressure against the yen since Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed last Friday to strike a deal on a new framework to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus and increase the share of imports in its markets.
