Exports in the first half of 1993 reached only $3.343 billion, an increase of 6.58 percent compared to 1992. In July 1993, Shanghai's exports decreased by 15.5 percent compared to the same period in 1992. As of August 1993, the city's exports not only failed to meet their quota but also became a "bottleneck" and restrictive factor for Shanghai's economic development. Under the leadership of the municipal party committee and the government, with the support of various fronts, and thanks to the hard work of cadres, workers, and staff members of all foreign trade enterprises and individually run export enterprises in the city, Shanghai's exports began to jump in the third quarter and reached $7.382 billion at the end of 1993, thus fulfilling the annual quota of $7.34 billion set by the municipal people's congress and the government. What does this fact show? First, it shows that Shanghai cannot experience the great development of foreign trade without emancipating the mind and exploring new ideas. Despite experiencing a decline in foreign trade in the first six months of last year, Shanghai began to boost its foreign trade in the next six months. The important reason for the increase is: Since the municipal meeting on foreign economic relations and trade held in June 1993, cadres, workers, and staff members of all foreign trade companies began to reconsider their ideologies and ideas formed in the past. They began to free themselves from the ideological shackles of the planned economy and to foster a sense of the importance of market competition, as well as of large-scale foreign trade, trading ports, trading groups, and services. The city's silk products import and export company and its garments import and export company began to change the bureaucratic styles of business often demonstrated in the past by improving their services. As a result, they began to stand firmly in a severely competitive environment. Last year, they became the first- and second-largest exporting companies. In shattering the restrictions on its scope of business, in 1993 the Lansheng Company began to export machinery and electrical appliances for the first time. The Machinery and Electrical Appliances Import and Export Company took drastic measures to restructure its organization by converting 16 departments into 10 constituent companies which assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. As a result, the company earned 13.15 percent more in foreign exchange than in 1992. The fact also proves that major reforms undertaken by Shanghai in foreign economic relations and in trade, operating mechanisms, and management methods are effective. At the municipal meeting on foreign economic relations and trade held in June 1993, Mayor Huang Ju said: It is necessary to take the lead in establishing a new system for foreign economic relations and trade that conforms to international practices, that dovetails with international markets, and that is suited to a socialist market economy. In following this requirement, the city took the nationwide lead in introducing a series of reform measures last year. Among them, the important ones are: Mandatory plans for all kinds of foreign trade companies to export, to earn foreign exchange, and turn it over to the state were abandoned. A plan for reforming distribution methods was introduced, thus enabling wages to increase in line with the net increase of foreign exchange earnings. More enterprises in the import and export sector were given decision-making powers. The business scope of foreign trade enterprises was expanded. Such large-scale reforms, the first in Shanghai's history of foreign trade, have effectively helped the city. As a result, its exports demonstrated a shift from a decrease to an increase. The fact also proves that it is very important to establish a mechanism for building momentum inside the enterprise. A group of enterprises in Shanghai had already paid attention to this problem last year. The Shenda Textile and Garments Company introduced a stimulation mechanism designed to promote exports through wage increases and prizes. As a result, the company took second place for individually run enterprises. According to some experts, Shanghai still has to make great efforts to maintain this year's favorable export momentum. Only by fundamentally solving the deep-seated contradictions created under the planned economy and the problem under which the current system of foreign economic relations and trade is not able to adapt itself to the changed situation can Shanghai overcome two threatening problems in its foreign trade -- a lack of mobility and a lack of sustained momentum.
