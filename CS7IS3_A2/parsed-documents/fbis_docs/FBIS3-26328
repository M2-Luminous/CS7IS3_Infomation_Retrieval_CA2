The CPC Central Committee held a Spring Festival discussion meeting with non-communist party figures at Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, met happily with responsible figures from the various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce [ACFIC], and non-party affiliated figures to discuss state affairs, while ringing out the old and ushering in the new year. In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: The basic principle of our party and state work in 1994 is: Under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy while safeguarding political stability, and promoting all-round social progress. Our overriding task for the current year is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability. Relevant work in various fields must be subordinate to and serve this overriding task. The discussion meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. Hu Jintao, Li Lanqing, Wang Hanbin, We Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, and other leading comrades attended the meeting. Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Lei Jieqiong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; and Wang Guangying, honorary chairman of the ACFIC successively spoke at the meeting. They spoke freely about the brilliant achievements made by China on various fronts under the CPC's leadership last year; they lauded the constant strengthening and development of multi-party cooperation under the CPC leadership. They said: The basic principle for 1994 put forward by the CPC Central Committee is of great importance. Members of various democratic parties and the ACFIC, as well as figures without party affiliation must strive to accomplish the grand objectives set out by the CPC Central Committee, and to perform new meritorious services. In the course of their speeches, they expressed their views and put forward proposals for developing the economy, reform and opening up, building an honest government, the construction of spiritual civilization, and educational work. After the four non-party affiliated friends made their speeches, General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, he expressed sincere appreciation, and extended cordial greetings to all the friends present at the meeting, to comrades and friends from the various democratic parties and the ACFIC, and to figures without party affiliation. Touching on last year's work, Jiang Zemin said: Under our party's leadership, 1993 witnessed people of all nationalities in our country comprehensively implement the guidelines laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress and advance triumphantly along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The CPC Central Committee took the overall situation into consideration, paid special attention to a few major issues, maintained and developed a favorable situation for reform and opening up, and economic construction. To generalize, we mainly paid special attention to major issues in three aspects: First, through deepening reform we strengthened and improved macroeconomic regulation and control; adhered to the principle of promoting both material and spiritual civilization without relaxing efforts to attain either of them; promoted a rapid and sound development of the national economy; and gave an impetus to all-around progress in various social undertakings. The industrial sector maintained rapid growth, economic efficiency among enterprises was enhanced, the rural economy developed further, and construction of key projects was beefed up. We made new progress in propaganda and ideological work, in building spiritual civilization, and the anticorruption drive. Second, we convened the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure"; and, formulated the overall plan and basic framework for establishing a socialist market economic system in our country, which is exerting and will continue to exert a far reaching impact on our efforts to push forward reform and open to the outside world, as well as on our modernization drive. Third, we earnestly organized the publicity and study drive of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and launched activities to mark the birth centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong, thereby further uniting our people of all nationalities under the magnificent banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, we also made new achievements in our party building, defense construction, and foreign affairs. All this has created favorable conditions for our continuous march forward in the new year. After discussing the basic principles and general tasks of the party and government, Jiang Zemin said: The basic principles and general tasks set by the party Central Committee must be implemented in all sectors of society and all aspects of work, but first of all, in the vast countryside and state-owned enterprises. We must pay keen attention to the work in these two key areas in a bid to promote all-around reforms, development, and stability all over the country. Jiang Zemin said: All in all, this year efforts must be focused on the following seven aspects: 1) Maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy and continuing to promote all-around social progress. We must rely on scientific and technological progress and improved quality of the work force to promote economic growth, paying particular attention to readjusting the structure and raising efficiency. We must also develop the rural economy in an all-around way, effectively build up the stamina of state-owned large and medium enterprises, strengthen and improve macroeconomic control and regulation, and go all out to advance educational, scientific, and technological undertakings. 2) Quickening the pace of reform in establishing a socialist market economic structure. We must make ample preparations for launching and implementing various major measures for establishing a sound macroeconomic control and regulation system, continue to change the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, explore effective ways for establishing a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of a socialist market economy, advance price reform in due course, and develop an integrated, open, competitive, and orderly market system. 3) Further improving propaganda and ideological work. We must pay close attention to and make the study and publicity of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping a fundamental task of ideological construction, and must earnestly implement the guidelines of the recent national propaganda and ideological work conference. 4) Actively promoting socialist democracy and the establishment of a legal system. We must persist in and perfect the system of people's congresses, and adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party. We must continue to do a good job in the comprehensive management of public order to ensure social stability. 5) Stepping up the united front work during the current new period. We must, under the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and patriotism, unite forces that can be united. We must bring into play the role of the CPPCC in exercising political consultation and democratic supervision. 6) Striving for an international environment favorable to reforms and construction in China. 7) Stepping up party building and the campaign to build a clean government. We must improve the quality of members of all leading bodies and the work force on all fronts, and enhance their ideological awareness and improve their work style. Jiang Zemin emphasized: A correct understanding and proper handling of the relationships among reforms, development, and stability is vital to the fulfillment of various tasks this year. We have accumulated ample experiences in more than a decade of reform, which is designed to free and develop productive forces. The implementation of various reform measures is aimed at providing better institutional conditions for economic development. Therefore, we must imbue ourselves with an historical sense of urgency, while making solid, meticulous efforts to carry out each and every reform measure to ensure its success. Development is an essential criterion. We must firmly grasp the central task of economic construction at all times, never relaxing efforts nor wavering in the slightest degree. In terms of development, it is necessary to follow a new way of thinking. We must strive not only for an increase in the total volume of supply and demand in the economy but also, more importantly, attach importance to improving economic returns. Higher economic returns should be achieved by readjusting structure, upgrading technology, developing new products, and improving management, not by taking the old road of extensive management characterized by blindly seeking of output value and expansion of the investment scale. Stability is the prerequisite for reforms and development. To deepen reforms, open the country wider to the outside world, and promote all-around economic and social development, we must further maintain and consolidate the political situation marked by stability and unity. Meanwhile, only by persisting in reforms, opening up and developing the economy will it be possible to maintain stability in the long run. Therefore, we must understand correctly the dialectic unity between reform, development, and stability, which can promote one another. Jiang Zemin said: Under the new situation in our efforts to push forward all-around reforms and accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, it is extremely important to continuously carry forward the fine tradition of the party's mass line. No matter whether we make revolution or carry out reform and construction, we must show concern for the masses in every way, rely on the masses in all matters, and do everything for the sake of the masses. Herein lies the fundamental objective and line of work, as well as the distinct characteristics and superior political features of our party. As the times move ever forward and our undertakings develop further, we should all the more show our confidence in, concern for, and reliance on the masses [shi dai yue qian jin shi ye yue fa zhan wo men yue yao xin ren guan xin he yi kao qun zhong 2514 0108 6390 0467 6651 0057 2814 6390 4099 1455 2053 0226 6390 6008 0207 0117 7070 1800 0735 0181 7237 5028 5883]; respect their wishes and pioneering spirit; and detect and solve in good time new problems cropping up on our road of advance so as to properly guide, safeguard, and harness the enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, we can constantly make new achievements in our reform and development, continuously safeguard social and political stability, and continuously push forward our cause of socialist modernization. Jiang Zemin pointed out: Over a long period in the past, comrades and friends of various democratic parties and the ACFIC, along with figures without party affiliation, have made use of their advantages to actively bring into play their role in participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs, and exercising democratic supervision. They have done a host of highly effective work in economic, scientific, and technological consultation, providing intellectual resources to support border and poor areas, establishing contacts abroad, and have served as links for importing foreign capital and technology; thus contributing significantly to propelling our country's reform and opening up policy and modernization drive. We believe in the new year, they will continue to stand alongside us and strive harder to uphold the principles of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, of showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing weal and woe together" while thinking over, discussing, and attending to major issues to make even greater contributions to the motherland's economic construction, reform, and opening up to the outside world. Touching on the great cause of the motherland's reunification, Jiang Zemin said: It is a common desire of the entire people of China, as well as a development trend of the Chinese nation to accomplish the major undertaking of reunifying the motherland. We must continue to unswervingly push for reunification through a peaceful process in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems." As far as the Taiwan issue is concerned, we are resolutely opposed to the concept of "two China's," "one Taiwan, one China" or "one country, two governments" in any form, and we will oppose any utterances and actions that are designed to create "Taiwan independence." With the date for the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland drawing nearer and nearer, our task in this respect will definitely become increasingly more arduous. Whatever situation we may come across hereafter, we will accomplish this sacred mission entrusted to us by history according to schedule. We hope that friends outside our party will continue to carry out their work toward this end through various channels, at various levels, and in various fields and forms; and achieve new results in their efforts to realize the strategic concept of "one country, two systems," thereby accomplishing the great cause of the motherland's reunification. Jiang Zemin stressed: Currently, with the relatively favorable international environment, coupled with essential domestic conditions, and under the guidance of our party's basic line, the Chinese people are continuously advancing from victory to victory along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have full confidence in the glorious future of our socialist motherland. Let us unite more closely, and strive to fulfill the various tasks for 1994.
