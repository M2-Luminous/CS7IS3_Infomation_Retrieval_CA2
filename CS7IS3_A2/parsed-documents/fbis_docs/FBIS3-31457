As we have heard, there was a lot of talk about the role of the Presidential Council. What was so controversial? [Zubak] You see, deputies were unclear about two issues. The first one was whether this abolishes the position of president of the republic. The second was who was to appoint members of the Presidential Council. Both issues have been clarified. The proposed amendment to the fundamental decision on the establishing of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna specifies that the position of president of the republic still exists, but that a new body -- the Presidential Council -- is introduced. Concerning the appointment of president of the republic, it was clearly stated that the Presidential Council appoints the president of the republic, and that the Chamber of Deputies verifies the appointment. [Correspondent] Perhaps we should specify what the status of Mate Boban is now. [Zubak] At a session of the Chamber of Deputies in Livno on 8 February, Mate Boban put his mandate into the hands of the deputies of the Chamber of Deputies. In connection with that, at today's session the Chamber of Deputies decided that there were extraordinary circumstances and that during extraordinary circumstances the Presidential Council takes over the functions of president of the republic. Therefore, the post of president of the republic still exists, and Mate Boban, who has held that post so far, still remains the president of the republic, but with the status that I have just specified.
