FR940425-1-00010 FR940425-1-00003 II. Site Suitability Evaluation A. Public Involvement The Department seeks comments of interested parties on mechanisms and timing for providing input to the Department on the evaluation of site suitability. The Department seeks comments on the type of information the public needs in order to understand the site suitability evaluation, the public's preferences regarding involvement methods such as workshops and public meetings, and any other considerations. B. Adequacy of Guidelines The guidelines referenced above (10 CFR part 960) provide that the Department may consider revision if necessary. The Department periodically reviews the guidelines for that purpose. The Department seeks the views of interested parties regarding the guidelines, and in particular their role in the evaluation of site suitability. The options on which the Department seeks comments include using the guidelines as they stand and conducting a rulemaking to amend the guidelines. DOE also requests comment on the desirability of removing portions of 10 CFR part 960 which have been made obsolete by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987 (Title V of Pub. L. 100&hyph;203) and which may cause confusion because they continue to appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. C. Peer Review of Scientific and Technical Information Site Suitability Evaluations will include the review of scientific and technical information by experts who are recognized as such by their peers in their fields of knowledge. The Department seeks comments on the appropriate use of peer reviews in site suitability evaluations, how to select peer reviewers, the roles of existing expert groups such as the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board and the National Academy of Sciences, and other considerations. D. Other Considerations In addition to the topics mentioned above, the Department seeks other comments regarding the evaluation of site suitability. E.
