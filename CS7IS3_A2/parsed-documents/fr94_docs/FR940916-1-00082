FR940916-1-00082 FR940916-1-00016 V. Electronic Brake Systems Railroad power brake systems are moving into the computer age, and recently, several innovative electronic brake systems have been adopted into train service. These electronic brake systems include blended brakes, locomotive speed limiters, and microprocessor-controlled brakes. Although these braking systems meet present Federal regulations, the regulations may be silent in certain areas that need to be addressed in order to ensure that braking systems which incorporate versions of this new technology maintain the same level of safety as conventional power brakes. In order to determine the type of regulation that might be needed to assure the ``fail-safe'' nature of these types of braking systems FRA requested comments from experienced parties regarding the operation of electronic braking systems, the sensors utilized by the systems, and the maintenance requirements of such systems. See 57 FR 62554. A number of passenger and commuter railroads, one State transit authority, and several freight carriers commented that technology for electronic braking systems is advancing quickly and that performance standards need to be developed to address these types of systems. Several commenters stated that a power failure in these electronic braking types of systems will result in a full service brake application being applied through the entire train, with the emergency brake valve available to initiate an emergency application at any time. The AAR and several railroads discussed the sensors that are, or may be, used with these types of systems. Amtrak felt that the reliability of the sensors is a key issue for these systems because nothing is gained if they fail as often as the equipment being monitored. These parties stated that sensors currently manufactured are fairly reliable, with advertised reliability rates of 14.6 years or failure rates of once every 35&hyph;38 million miles of operation. One commenter stated that sensors have not yet been developed that would indicate when disc brake pads are worn to condemning limits. Commenters also contended that sensors that could be used to assist in brake tests to determine proper piston travel or whether brakes are applied would be very expensive at this time and difficult to install and maintain. One commenter suggested that the only way to monitor whether brakes are applied would be to install a sensor on every brake head, which would be very impractical. Several commenters stated that the computer software used with these systems is designed to continually self-test not only the software controlling the brake system but also the hardware every time it is used. Therefore, the parties contend that there is no need to require daily testing since the system will identify any defects or reduction in performance each time it is used. These commenters also suggested that the need for time based COT&S with these systems is unnecessary since the computer will indicate when attention is needed. Two railroads stated that complete air brake tests should be performed when a system component is replaced, whereas other railroads recommended following the manufacturer's recommended practice or at a minimum running a normal system check to verify the repair. Two manufacturers of brake equipment suggested that whatever regulations are developed they need to allow for technological development. They stated that systems are being developed that will be able to monitor all sorts of things and will eliminate the need for time-based maintenance and cleaning of brake equipment. These parties believed that in the next five years systems will be available that can be self-diagnostic and able to report on their operational capabilities. Expected future capabilities are: advanced train control system (ATCS) compatibility, distributed power, simplicity of design, maintainability, accuracy of pressure control, and adaptability to complete electronic or radio control throughout freight train operation. FRA Conclusions. In order to allow for and encourage the development of new technology, FRA proposes to provide guidelines regarding the tests and procedures required for introducing new brake system technology. These guidelines would require the submission of design and test plans as well as subsequent operational plans for the introduction of new technology. Parties would also be allowed to petition the FRA to convert some of the brake system design and maintenance requirements into performance-based standards to accommodate the use of electronic braking systems. VI. Dynamic Brakes As the result of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company accident at San Bernardino, California on May 25, 1989, the NTSB made the following two recommendations to FRA concerning dynamic brakes: 1. Study, in conjunction with the AAR, the feasibility of developing a positive method to indicate to the operating engineer in the cab of the controlling locomotive unit the condition of the dynamic brakes on all units in the train. 2. Revise regulations to require that if a locomotive unit is equipped with dynamic brakes that the dynamic brakes function. Dynamic brakes were developed as a ``free'' by-product of the diesel-electric drive train. By engaging the dynamic brake, the normally powered traction motors on each axle are changed to generators, and the power generated is dissipated through resistance grids. The effect is similar to that of shifting an automobile to a lower gear when descending a steep grade. The additional hardware needed to outfit a locomotive with dynamic brakes includes the grids and the controls and switches. The primary selling point of dynamic brakes has been to save on freight car brake shoe wear. The dynamic brake is also useful in controlling train slack in lieu of using the locomotive independent brake. Furthermore, use of the dynamic brake in controlling train speed in lieu of power braking, where the train brake is applied with the locomotive under power, is a major factor in fuel savings. Due to these benefits, railroads currently emphasize and encourage the use of dynamic brakes. In order to determine the types of requirements or standards that should be developed regarding the design and use of dynamic brakes, FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding the reliability, testing, and cost of dynamic brakes as well as the types of information that are or could be provided to the engineer regarding the availability and operation of the devices. See 57 FR 62555.
