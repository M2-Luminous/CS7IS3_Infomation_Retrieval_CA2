It is the first time that American brokers here officially urge Korea to expand the foreign stock ownership ceiling. Furthermore, AmCham says Korea no longer needs to require foreign investors to get ID cards as it has already implemented the real-name financial transaction system. Furthermore, it said the ID card requirement is "costly" for international investors. It is also urging Seoul to introduce the "independent' insurance brokerage system and speed up the pace of the pre-announced schedule for the liberalization and opening of the cross-border and reinsurance markets. AmCham also is proposing that Korea give foreign insurance companies operating here greater freedom to develop creative and tailor-made policies and diversify premiums, adding that Korea maintains a "sameness" in its insurance market. An American insurer said, "Korea's Ministry of Finance has implemented many changes since last year but we want to see the (liberalization) pace quicker." He said change is coming and it is good but the pace is slower than I anticipated. Amcham Korea will send its "draft" paper, which is made up of the wish lists of American businessmen and financiers here, to the Korean government, including the Economic Planning Board, next week for comment. It will formally publish the position paper early next month following discussion with the AmCham head office in Washington, sources said. The AmCham draft report also trains proposals from U.S. bankers here who "want to see the expansion of their funding sources, elimination of the remaining barriers in the development of risk-management derivatives products such as swaps, options, and futures as well as combinations of these instruments." It also indicated that foreign bankers want to be freed from their obligation to limit credit extension to five or ten major Korean conglomerates and the mandatory lending ratio for small- and medium-sized companies. An American banker here said, "All of our recommendations are "old issues," adding that "Our wish list becomes thinner and thinner as Korea has made significant progress in liberalizing the financial market in recent years." AmCham also expressed the hope that Korea free foreign enterprises and joint venture companies from paying taxes on what Korea calls excessive retained earnings so that they can recycle much of their earnings into investing and expanding their operations here. Early this year, the Ministry of Finance lowered the so-called excessive earnings tax rate to 15 percent from 25 percent, following a strong request from Washington. The AmCham report contains the hope of American businessmen that Seoul will implement its foreign direct investment promotion policy in a packaged, comprehensive and quick manner, rather than in a gradual and piece-meal way, sources said.
