[Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the purpose of your visit was, above all, to honor the memory of those who fell during the historical event of the Normandy invasion. However, how do you assess the importance of this visit and your meetings with many important politicians from the foreign policy angle? [Kovac] It was an opportunity to establish personal contact with a whole range of state representatives, mainly with those I had not met until now. [passage omitted] Of course, it was also an opportunity to deepen still further those contacts that already exist. I have in mind the meeting with President Bill Clinton. I had the opportunity to listen to their interest in Slovakia. They wanted to know what is happening in Slovakia. They expressed an understanding of our policy. They were interested to see the continuation of the Slovak transformation, of building friendly relations with neighboring states, and they want Slovakia to contribute toward the stability of the Central European region.
