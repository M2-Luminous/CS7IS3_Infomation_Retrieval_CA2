FBIS3-47610 "dreas010_h_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Singapore Government To Review Law on Patents, Bankruptcy BK1301094894 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES in English 12 Jan 94 p 1 BK1301094894 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] A major review of laws will be conducted by the Law Ministry and the Attorney-General's [A-G] Chambers to provide adequate legal infrastructure to support Singapore's drive to go regional. They will, when appropriate, adopt international conventions and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international trade and dispute settlements. In his addendum to the President's Address released yesterday, Law Minister S. Jayakumar said commercial laws will be reviewed and modified where necessary to create a "more predictable legal environment" for businesses to operate. He also cited two priorities in law reform: patents and bankruptcy. New laws will be introduced to upgrade the current patent system and make it more convenient for Singaporeans to obtain patent protection for their inventions. The ministry plans to change the current requirement that Singaporeans must first have patent protection in the United Kingdom before their inventions can be protected here. Singaporeans will instead be allowed to file applications for patents locally. On bankruptcy, laws will be introduced to improve the administration of the affairs of bankrupts, and to protect creditors' interests without stifling entrepreneurship. "We will strike a fair balance between the interests of the debtor, the creditor and society," he said. There will be greater accountability of bankrupts in the administration of their estates on the one hand, and speedier discharges of bankrupts on the other. He said the ministry will review other Acts of Parliament which rely on English law. This follows the enactment of the Application of English Law Act 1993, which makes Singapore's commercial law independent of future legislative changes in the UK. Legislation will also be introduced to abolish all appeals to the Privy Council, a move announced by Chief Justice Yong Pung How on Saturday. The Registry of Land Titles will convert all lands from the common law to the land titles registration system. It will also computerise the Land Titles Register to handle more land transactions and public searches. Finally, the A-G's Chambers will provide better legal advice to ministries and government departments by centralising services in its civil division.
