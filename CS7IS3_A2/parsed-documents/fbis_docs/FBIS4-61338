Its organizers -- the Armenian Ministry of Energy and Fuel along with the U.S. Department of Energy, International Development Agency, and the U.S. energy association. About 400 delegates including representatives of 65 power engineering firms and companies from a number of countries discussed a broad range of problems concerning power saving, power engineering, heating supplies, electrical systems and networks, alternative energy sources and prospecting for fuel deposits. The results of the forum exceeded our expectations, said Sepukh Tashchyan, Armenian state minister. Speaking at a news conference here today, he said 30 proposals had been received from various foreign firms which, with serious development and financing, could produce good results. Susan Olds, director of the Caucasus regional section of the U.S. International Development Agency, said the U.S. Government was prepared to grant Armenia $26 million in aid to be spent on the development of energy saving and raising the efficiency of power usage, on the development of hydro-power, alternative and renewable sources of energy. The European Union is giving Armenia a certain amount of aid. U.S. President Bill Clinton regards as very important the process of democratization in the former republics of the USSR, stated Richard Williamson, representative of the U.S. Department of Energy. Therefore, he said, the U.S. Government supports and encourages the activities of those firms that may be useful to Armenia in carrying out reforms, in implementing the course of democratization. Armenia has all the technical and intellectual potential for our further cooperation in the sphere of power engineering, the U.S. representative stressed.
