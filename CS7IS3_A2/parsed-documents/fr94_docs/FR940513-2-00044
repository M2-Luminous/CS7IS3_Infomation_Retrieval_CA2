SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with the ``Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986'', under which the Environmental Protection Agency is directed to conduct research and disseminate information on all aspects of indoor air quality, this notice announces that the report described below is available for public review. The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment requested that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analyze (quantitatively where possible) the compliance costs and the health and economic benefits of H.R. 3434. Specifically, the Agency was requested to assess the cost of compliance including provisions for smoking lounges; the value of benefits resulting from reduced exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and changes in smoking behavior including the value of lives saved; the value of increased productivity and reduced absenteeism; savings from reduced operation and maintenance costs; and savings in fire related injuries and property damage. The Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993 (H.R. 3434) would require that all residential buildings regularly entered by ten or more persons in the course of a week that bans smoking inside the building or restricts smoking to separately ventilated smoking rooms. The proposed legislation provides for enforcement actions in the United States District Courts by an individual, government or other aggrieved entity and allows for fines of up to $5,000 per day. The report presents EPA's analysis and findings of the costs and benefits of implementing national legislation that would establish policies that would prohibit smoking indoors in specified buildings and/or provide for separately ventilated smoking lounges. Dated: April 19, 1994. Mary D. Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11695 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
