FR940620-2-00051 FR940620-2-00030 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32499] Canadian National Railway Company_Trackage Rights Exemption_Grand Trunk Western Railroad Incorporated, et al. Grand Trunk Western Railroad Incorporated (GTW), successor to Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company, has filed a verified notice under the rail class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) to grant/assign trackage rights to Canadian National Railway Company (CN) over 109.07 miles of line in Michigan. The exemption became effective on May 12, 1994. The transaction was consummated May 31, 1994. 1 1 Under the Commission's rules governing rail class exemptions, the exemption becomes effective 7 days after the verified notice is filed. 49 CFR 1180.4(g)(1). The parties may consummate the underlying transaction on or after the exemption's effective date. At 5 p.m. on May 27, 1994, United Transportation Union and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers filed a petition to revoke the exemption and a motion to stay consummation of the transaction. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. Because the labor organizations' petition was not filed until after regular business hours on Friday, May 27, and because Monday, May 30, was a Federal holiday (Memorial Day), the Commission was unable to act on the stay request before the transaction was consummated on May 31. The arguments of the labor organizations will be addressed in the decision on the petition to revoke the exemption. GTW is granting CN trackage rights over: (1) The 2.07-mile segment of Flint subdivision between the 16th Street rail crossing near the west portal of the Sarnia Port Huron Rail Tunnel and the connection with St. Clair Tunnel Company (SCTC) at milepost 332.2 (Michigan Road), in Port Huron; (2) the 35.9-mile segment of Mt. Clemens subdivision between the connection with SCTC at milepost 40.5 (Kroner Road), at or near Richmond, and the connection with Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) at milepost 4.6 (Milwaukee Junction, accessing Conrail's North Yard), in Detroit; (3) the 3.6-mile line between Milwaukee Junction and the connection with Conrail at milepost 51.2 (Vinewood Junction), in Detroit; (4) the 9.6-mile segment of Shore Line subdivision between Ecorse Junction and FN Interlocking at milepost 37.3, near Trenton; (5) the 6.3-mile segment of River subdivision between the connection with Conrail at milepost 4.8 (Mill) and the crossing and connection with Shore Line subdivision at milepost 11.1 (FN Interlocking); (6) the 6.1-mile segment of River subdivision between FN Interlocking and milepost 17.2 (accessing Flat Rock Yard); (7) the 7.0-mile line between the connection of the Mt. Clemens and Holly subdivisions at Milwaukee Junction and the MOTERM Intermodal Facility at milepost 11.1, in Ferndale; and (8) the 19.2-mile line between MOTERM and milepost 30.3 (West Pontiac), including the Johnson Avenue Yard Facility at Pontiac. GTW is assigning trackage rights to CN over the 15.1-mile SCTC line between the connections with the Mt. Clemens subdivision at milepost 55.6, near Michigan Avenue (Tappan), and milepost 40.5, near Richmond. 2 GTW, Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW), and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), are granting CN trackage rights over the 4.2-mile line between Vinewood Junction and the western connection with Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NS) at milepost 46.9 (Ecorse Junction, or River Rouge). 3 2 By resolution of the SCTC Board of Directors dated April 28, 1994, GTW acquired the right to assign these trackage rights to any responsible third party, subject to GTW's assumption of all third party liability. 3 This line comprises 3.19 miles of NS track between milepost 50.2 (West Detroit) and River Rouge, 0.1 mile of CSXT track at Delray Interlocking about midway between said points, and about 1 mile of GTW track between Vinewood Junction and West Detroit. By separate agreements executed May 17 and 28, 1994, respectively, NW and CSXT have granted CN trackage rights over their respective segments. As a condition to this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected under Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN , 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate , 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 4 4 GTW served the required notice to begin negotiating an implementing agreement with representatives of its employees on May 6, 1994. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. An original and 10 copies of all pleadings, referring to Finance Docket No. 32499, must be filed with the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In addition, a copy of each pleading must be served on Kevin M. Stanko, 1333 Brewery Park Boulevard, Detroit, MI 48207, and on Allan A.
