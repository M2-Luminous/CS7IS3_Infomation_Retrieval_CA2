Berezovskiy, Belarussian State Polytechnic Academy; UDC 662.812] [Abstract] The need to take into account random factors in order to control the peat brick plant dryer operation more effectively prompted the development of a computer simulation technique for analyzing the material balance of the peat brick plant. The model makes it possible to establish the effect of the raw material moisture and ash content variance on the specific peat rate per ton of bricks and identify reserves for saving milling peat. The study also shows that the peat brick plant output can be stabilized by computer-based automation of the dryer operation. The formulae for computing the material balance are derived. The effect of the raw material moisture and ash content on the specific milling peat consumption and the peat moisture content behavior in the Peko dryer are plotted. The raw material, steam, and air consumption in the Peko dryer is summarized. The control algorithm developed for the computer and the devices which control the screw rotation speed and the gate and fan position on the basis of the computer analysis and a DZ-28 microcomputer-based unit used for stabilizing the dryer operation are described. The use of computer simulation makes it possible to lower the peat consumption and increase the plant output while computer-based dryer control improves the product quality, lowers the specific power consumption, and increases the labor productivity. Publication of the article is approved by the editorial board for consideration and implementation in the industry. Figures 3; tables 1.
