This makes it possible to design transformation of a material on the computer with the feeling of doing workmanship in clay. It is now easy to design products with subtle curves for which previously models had to be built. The newly-developed system includes a manipulator maneuvered by a person, a computer, and a monitor that shows virtual space. The manipulator can move lengthwise, sideways, or in height in addition to rotating. It has six degrees of freedom and moves throughout three-dimensional space. The grasp of the manipulator is moved on the screen by the cursor. It can be maneuvered on the screen just like pushing clay with a scoop. The sense of resistance and the transformation of the virtual material can freely be regulated. A rapid calculation algorithm (direct deformation manipulation method or DDM) to directly and smoothly change the place touched by the cursor was developed for transforming the virtual material. It succeeds in reflecting changes on the screen as the manipulator moves. Automotive steering wheel, body and other products are often made with a combination of subtle curves which are finely altered in ways unseen to the eye. They have needed models remade and checked by hand. It has also taken time to design parts such as helicopter rotors which have complex curves. This new system will help simplify this kind of design.
