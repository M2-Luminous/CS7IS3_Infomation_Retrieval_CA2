FR941019-2-00028 FR941019-2-00020 Examples are intended to provide, in an educational manner, illustrations of various approaches to project and emissions analysis permitted within the guidelines. They are not intended to imply any additional directions or restrictions on reporting over and above that provided by the Guidelines. The case studies and examples do, however, suggest to potential reporters different ways in which existing data and resources may be used to develop a report. The illustrated cases thus differ in detail based on the stated purpose of the hypothetical reporter for reporting, and the individual circumstances surrounding the project and the reporter. Consistent with the goal of maximum participation in the program, the flexibility of the reporting program is not bound by any particular case study or example discussion on any issue. Subjective Terminology Comments were made that the use in the guidelines and the supporting materials of certain descriptive terms, relative to a reporter's decisions regarding the data developed and reported, were inappropriate within a voluntary program. The program's flexibility allows reporters to select among various approaches in developing a report. These selections do not encompass comparative value of the reporter's activities. No value judgments are intended by the use of subjective terms in any description of the reporter's choice of approaches. Accordingly, the final guidelines and supporting materials have been revised to minimize use of these terms, and to better reflect that judgments on the quality of the data reported are to be made by the reporter and database user, and not by the reporting program. Where these terms remain in the guidelines and supporting documents, they are intended to reflect differing perspectives of both reporters and database users on choices permitted by the reporting program. D. Changes to Draft Sector-Specific Supporting Documents for Final Sector-Specific Documents Comments were received on all draft sector specific supporting documents. Revisions to the draft guidelines in response to comments on less significant technical, mathematical, or editorial errors in the draft sector specific supporting documents are not individually discussed in this notice, but were considered and addressed where appropriate. Most comments fall into several categories of issues, including those that have been addressed in the final General Guidelines and discussed above in section II.C. of this notice. These categories include: failure to discuss all emissions reduction or carbon sequestration activities applicable to the sector; criticism of the case studies' use of unrealistic circumstances; the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of default tables; and the lack of balance among sector documents indicating differing reporting burdens. The program is expressly intended to provide reporters with the flexibility to report on the achievements of all emissions reduction and carbon sequestration activities. The failure of the draft guidelines and supporting materials to discuss or list any particular activity does not indicate that its achievements are not reportable under the 1605(b) program. In response to comments, the final supporting documents add discussions of some additional emissions reduction and carbon sequestration approaches, and provide more emphasis to some of the approaches discussed in the draft. Nevertheless, the guidelines and supporting documents are not intended to provide an exclusive list of all activities that may be reported. The guidelines could not, for example, provide identification and quantification of achievements from the novel, innovative actions for which the information sharing function of the voluntary reporting program is paramount. As discussed above in C.7., the guidelines and supporting documents use case studies and examples to illustrate the application of concepts and varied approaches to project analysis and reporting. Reporters are not bound by the particulars of any presentation. Rather, the guidelines provide reporters the flexibility needed to adapt project analysis approaches to particular circumstances, including the type of project, the availability of necessary data, and the purpose for reporting. Thus, while revisions have been made in many case studies and examples throughout the documents in response to comments regarding realism, these study examples are not intended to be exhaustive of the range of appropriate approaches that reporters may develop and use to determine the data to report under this program. Significant comments were received on the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of the default tables provided in the supporting documents. Based on DOE's technical judgment on individual comments, errors have been corrected. Responses to these comments on specific sector default tables appear below in the discussion of the relevant sector. In keeping with the flexibility of the program, reporters are encouraged to use and develop data specific to the project being reported to accommodate their individual circumstances. The continued inclusion of default tables is, however, in keeping with the goal of maximum participation, where the wide disparity among potential reporting populations supports the need to provide some ``lookup'' tables for use at the discretion of the reporter.
