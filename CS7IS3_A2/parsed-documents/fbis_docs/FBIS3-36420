At Least No Political Ambitions"; place and date not given] [Text] The well-known lawyer, Professor Aleksandr Yakovlev, has been appointed the Russian Federation president's plenipotentiary representative in the Federal Assembly. In the former parliament the president was represented first by State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis, then State Legal Directorate chief Sergey Shakhray, and finally State Legal Directorate Deputy Chief Anatoliy Sliva. All three did this duty while continuing to work in their regular jobs, failing to achieve any particular success in consolidating the president's cooperation with the Supreme Soviet. How does the president's new envoy envision his role? [Yakovlev] First of all, what is involved is not one representative but the creation of the president's representative institution constantly interacting with the Federal Assembly. In my charge will be a special service with 20 to 30 employees, mainly jurists. Our work will be centered on ensuring the smooth passage of draft laws submitted by the president. We shall not just present them for the parliament's consideration, as was the case before, but supplement them with the requisite comments or organize discussions on them. Furthermore, I hope that with time the service of the plenipotentiary representative will be used by the Federal Assembly as a feedback channel through which deputies will be able to make their proposals or complaints known to the president. To prevent the separation of powers from turning into a new "confrontation of the branches," it is necessary to set up constructive interaction at all working levels, including ours. This is where I see my task. Concrete materialization will always depend on the initiatives which the constitution has granted the president with respect to parliament. [Dikun] Although you are a well-known lawyer, up to now no high posts have been offered to you. Lately, if I am not mistaken, you have been working in the United States. Why did they suddenly remember you in the Kremlin? [Yakovlev] Indeed, recently I have been delivering a course of lectures at Emory University in Atlanta; it was devoted to our domestic affairs: the evolution of Russian constitutionality. Then, presidential administration chief Sergey Filatov offered me this post. It is hard for me to judge the motives, but it is very important that I collaborate with Filatov because we have worked together on the new draft constitution and we are on the same wavelength. [Dikun] Your predecessors in this post, Burbulis and Shakhray, had reputations as being conflict prone. They did not manage to establish good contacts with the parliament. Do you believe in your good luck? [Yakovlev] At any rate, I will try to establish rapport. I am a fairly flexible man and, what is most important, I believe that law serves equally all political forces acting within the framework of the legitimate constitution. Moreover, I have no personal power ambitions or any ulterior political super-task. [Dikun] Your new duties are largely similar to diplomatic ones. You will have to smooth out the rough edges that may emerge in relations between the president and parliament, and sometimes act in the role of the president's advocate.... [Yakovlev] Legally no such duties have been assigned to me and everything here will depend on the president's articulated intention. Only he can empower me for such actions. Of course, whatever I do, I shall proceed from the presumption of constitutionality of the president's actions. It is another matter if I am asked to support a particular initiative or proposal which in my opinion is not justified by constitutional norms: In that event I will immediately tender my resignation and go back to the Institute of State and Law, where I have some very interesting work to do.
