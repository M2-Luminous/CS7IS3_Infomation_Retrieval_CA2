Meciar"] [Text] He appeared in a peculiar way. Most likely he was suggested by the intellectuals from the VPN [Public Against Violence], with Fedor Gal at its head, as a battering ram who would realize their goals. Already at the time when it still appeared that it would work that way, a confrontation took place concerning the language law. On the Slovak National Uprising [SNP] Square in Bratislava, crowded with fanatic nationalists, arrived a procession of brave democrats. They chanted: "Long live Czechoslovakia!," "Long live Havel!," and "Long live Meciar!" It is remarkable that Vladimir Meciar did not take part in this demonstration, in which he was the symbol of the democratic forces. Then the situation developed the way it developed. The battering ram soon got out of hand. He turned against those who thought they would control him. He captivated the citizens. Although he was deftly maneuvered out of executive power, the SNP Square was again crowded with people who again chanted "Long live Meciar!" Most likely, many people shouted this who on the previous occasion booed his name. It is remarkable that, again, Meciar was not present. The crowd was led by Milan Knazko. The doors to the parliament were broken down. Knazko promised on Meciar's behalf that his friend would return. During the negotiations, an extraordinary role was played by Ministers Filkus and Kovac, who surprisingly supported Meciar and joined the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. Where are Knazko and Filkus now? Vladimir Meciar returned in triumph and acted in the same singular manner as before. Again, everything was the way the Prime Minister of the Czech Government, Pithart, used to tell about: "We come to an agreement on everything, then we have a friendly talk about dogs. The next morning I learn, to my consternation, that the Slovak prime minister said something entirely different in Slovakia than what we agreed upon." But, in the second round, Meciar came up against a different adversary. Even so, all of the negotiations showed that Klaus, who has the reputation of being foxy, is a transparent politician compared to Meciar. Meciar's mysterious disappearances for several days at a time, about which many rumors have been circulating, also continued. Again, contradictory statements were made, positions changed from day to day. No one will probably ever find out if the Slovak prime minister knows that he said something different yesterday from what he did today. Even that is one of his secrets, just like whether he really wanted to split up Czechoslovakia. But he did split it up. Vladimir Meciar presents himself as a straight-arrow Janosik [Slovak Robin Hood]. He is, however, more of a deft manipulator. It is another one of his secrets how he forces people to get up from their sickbeds when he needs them, to change their views, to put themselves on the line for him when they clearly do not want to. He does not manipulate publicly but in a kind of "private" way, by personal intimations. Also puzzling are the surprising changes in the expressions on his face. At one time, a kind of militant fervor. Then a change from one day to the next into an expression of the suffering of a persecuted man. The question is whether these are the two faces of Janus or two masks. Mrs. Nagyova, his right hand, who always stands by his side, or, if protocol does not allow it, at least very close to him, should know much about Meciar's secrets. The greatest mystery concerning the Slovak prime minister is, of course, how he manages to stay in office--unless, of course, it happens to be merely part of the much deeper mystery of the Slovak society.
