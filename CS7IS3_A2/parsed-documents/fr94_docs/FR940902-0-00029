FR940902-0-00029 FR940902-0-00010 A few commenters raised the issue that the HHS guidelines include scholarships as income. They expressed concern that individuals who may receive scholarship assistance based on need, but who are otherwise economically disadvantaged, would not be eligible for services if such assistance is counted as family income. In addition, they pointed out that the inclusion of such needs-based assistance would also impact the eligibility of another family member who would otherwise be eligible for services, regardless of whether the individual receiving such assistance applies for JTPA services. The Department finds merit in the comments and is amending the definition of ``family income'' to add ``needs-based scholarship assistance'' to the exclusions from family income. To the extent that existing guidance has been interpreted to require the inclusion of needs-based scholarship assistance as family income, these regulations supersede any such guidance. A few of the commenters noted that the interim final rule appeared to indicate that only use of the poverty level applied in determining eligibility. This conflicts with section 4(8) of the Act, which indicates the use of the higher of the poverty level or 70 percent of the Lower Living Standard Income Level in determining economically disadvantaged status. The Department acknowledges that the preamble language could be misinterpreted. The reference to the use of the HHS poverty guidelines as the standard for determining economic disadvantage pertained to the use of the HHS guidelines to define family income, and not to indicate requirements different from those found at section 4(8) of the Act. The HHS guidelines, with the exceptions noted in the definition of family income, would be used to determine income, and that income figure would apply for the purposes of income eligibility determinations under section 4(8) of the Act. Of the several comments received on the term ``obligations'', most commenters were satisfied with the definition and asked that it not be changed. A few commenters wanted it changed as they believed that, as defined, very little, if any, funds would be reallotted or reallocated. No change is made to the definition, but the issue of reallotment is further treated in the discussion of ยง627.410. One commenter pointed out that the term ``service provider'' was defined by statute in section 301(b)(3) of the Act. The definition in these regulations is amended to conform to the statutory definition. The definition of ``stand-in costs'' is revised, along with the regulation at ยง627.480(f) (which had been paragraph (g) in the interim final regulation), so that both provide the same criteria as to the time when such costs were incurred and the cost category to which they are chargeable. Several other comments were received on the definition of ``vendor'', most of which generally fell into two groups. One group encouraged referencing the definition of this term contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. The other group requested more clarification or examples. A few commenters raised questions of whether vendor goods or services could be customized, or the extent to which they could be altered, and still meet the vendor definition. The Department is applying the standard Federal Government-wide description of the term ``vendor'', as it already exists in the audit requirements and related literature of OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. However, A&hyph;128 does not contain a definition of the term ``vendor'' and the A&hyph;133 definition appears to limit the term to providers of administrative goods and services. For those reasons, and, as explained in the preamble to the interim final rule, the Department draws upon the Questions and Answers developed by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) and OMB for its definition. The PCIE document carries the vendor definition beyond administrative goods and services and provides examples.
