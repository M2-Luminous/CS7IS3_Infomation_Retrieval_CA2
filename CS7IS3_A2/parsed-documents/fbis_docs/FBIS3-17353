Overthrow of Ardzinba Being Prepared"] [Text] Yesterday, Aleksandr Chikvadze, head of the Georgian Foreign Ministry, signed in Brussels an agreement on Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. This is the first time that a country in a state of civil war intends to join it. Besides, the joining of the NATO program takes on a special meaning with the emergence in Abkhazia of a pro-Georgia secret organization. The probability of the countries in conflict reaching an agreement is small despite the recent statements by Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba for the continuation of dialogue. Now the conflict may flare up in Abkhazia itself, where a secret organization "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" (its membership and national composition are unknown) has announced about existence. An appeal to Butros-Ghali, Boris Yeltsin, and Eduard Shevardnadze, circulated yesterday in Tbilisi by members of the underground organization points to their intention "to come out weapons in hand against the Ardzinba regime" if the latter fails to agree with Georgia. Besides, unless the United Nations urgently steps into the conflict, "a genocide of the Georgian population in Abkhazia may lead to irreparable consequences." The way out, in the underground organization members' view, is to bring Russian troops and Georgian police into Abkhazia. In Shevardnadze's opinion, the organization consists of Abkhaz people and is in no way connected with Tbilisi. Information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY from informed sources put in doubt the existence of this organization (most people in Abkhazia are more anti-Georgia than anti-Ardzinba) and gives grounds to believe that the creation of the "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" movement was not done without Tbilisi, which in the standoff in Sukhumi is using the old "fifth column" principle. A conflagration in the autonomous entity would undoubtedly spark a reaction in the world. And in this event, NATO may think it right for it to interfere ahead of the UN "blue helmets" unless the underground appeal first draws a reaction from Moscow, which has repeatedly stated that it is not going to ask for UN permission for peacekeeping every time.
