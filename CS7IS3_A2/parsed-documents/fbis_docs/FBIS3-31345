Following his arrival at Zagreb airport President Tudjman made a brief public statement. Branko Merlin reports. [Merlin] After the ceremonial welcome and meeting high-ranking Croatian officials who welcomed the president and the members of our delegation at the airport, President Tudjman described his visit to Romania as follows: [Begin Tudjman recording] It was a very interesting. Above all, we have become familiar with friendly Romania. We have established personal contacts with the highest-ranking representatives of Romania's state and political life. It is crucial, however, that we made advances in our bilateral relations. It seems to me that it is of equal importance, if not of greater importance, that we agreed on some joint initiatives in paving the way for resolving the international crisis in this part of Europe, in the course of which Romania can play an important role, given its relations with Belgrade. This was a very fruitful visit. [end recording] [Merlin] Prompted by the press, President Tudjman also reflected on his meeting with representatives of a small Croatian community in Romania. He is particularly satisfied with the fact that 12 young Croatians from Romania are already going to school in Zagreb. [passage omitted] [Presenter] Assessing the results of his visit, the Croatian president said that the two state delegations have agreed on the most important problems. In this context he singled out a solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the continuation of forging friendly relations and cooperation between Croatia and Romania in all spheres -- political, economic and cultural -- something that was initiated as early as the time of President Iliescu's visit to Croatia, President Tudjman said. He also pointed out that Romania, as the most important country in south east Europe, could secure an important role in resolving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia on the strength of its good relations with Belgrade as well as its own interest in peace and stability in the region. In reply to a question asking under what circumstances Croatia would accept the lifting of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, President Tudjman said that the precondition for lifting the sanctions is the restoration of peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina and the return of Croatia's UNPROFOR-protected occupied territories under Croatian sovereignty. President Tudjman expressed support for NATO's ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, regarding it as the resolute stand of Europe and the U.S. regarding the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope that air strikes will not take place and that this ultimatum will be an incentive for all three sides to restore peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina through negotiations, he added. Speaking about Croatia's relations with Serbia, while replying to a correspondent of POLITIKA of Belgrade, the Croatian president stressed that Croatia was striving to improve mutual relations, something that is also borne out by a recently signed declaration on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations. The precondition for true normalization is an end to Belgrade's aid to the rebel Serbs in Croatia's occupied territories. As far as Croatia is concerned, President Tudjman said, Croatia is ready to guarantee its Serbs local self-government in the counties where Serbs are in the majority in Croatia and cultural autonomy in whole Croatia. He stressed that it was high time for the Croatians and Serbians to normalize their relations. In this respect he also stressed that this ought to be done on the basis of mutual recognition between the two states. This would result in some sort of Scandinavization of the Balkans and peace and stability in the region, he said. Romanian President Iliescu regarded the Croatian President's visit as very important for better bilateral relations between the two countries. Good relations between Croatia and Romania are an important element of stability in the entire region, he added. President Iliescu lent support to the declaration on the normalization of Serbian-Croatian relations as an important step towards resolving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and as a precondition for an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Pacification of Sarajevo on the basis of action by the international community is an important contribution to the establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Iliescu went on to say. To secure peace at last in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added -- since it can only be secured through negotiations -- it is necessary that there is a political will on all three sides.
