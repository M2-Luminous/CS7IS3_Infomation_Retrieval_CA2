Jorge Enrique Botero has the story: [Begin recording] [Gaviria] The government is more convinced about the possibility of holding a plebiscite. [Botero] Gaviria unexpectedly commented on the decision by the country's highest constitutional organization. [Gaviria] Congress or the people should have discussed, analyzed, and voted on a decision such as this one; it should not have been a court decision. [Botero] Gaviria said he will seek counsel to initiate the plebiscite process. [Gaviria] We will have to decide along with the Electoral Tribunal and the National Civil Registry Office when to hold the plebiscite. [Botero] The president added it is unlikely the consultation will be made during the 29 May presidential elections, but he hinted of a possible plebiscite during the runoff elections, should they be necessary.
