FR941013-2-00124 FR941013-2-00088 OCST recognizes that many other issues are associated with implementation of the financial responsibility and allocation of risk requirements of the Act. The issues presented in this Notice are limited in scope because their resolution will necessarily affect OCST's approach to licensing launch activities and site operators. At the meeting, OCST will welcome any other comments on financial responsibility matters, as time allows. Standards In accordance with the Presidential Decision Directive, NSTC&hyph;4, outlining the National Space Transportation Policy issued August 5, 1994, OCST would like to work with the U.S. commercial space sector to promote the establishment of technical standards for commercial space products and services. OCST solicits industry views on what safety standards should be developed to support this goal, and how they should be implemented. Meeting Schedule Because of time constraints and the need to ensure that each subject area is fully aired, OCST intends that one full meeting day be accorded to licensing issues and one-half day to issues concerning the scope of financial responsibility requirements. Licensing issues will be discussed on October 27, 1994. Financial responsibility issues will be addressed in the morning session on October 28, 1994. If licensing issues are exhausted before the time allotted on October 27th, the meeting will move directly to financial responsibility issues. OCST looks forward to an informative and interactive discussion of the issues among the participants at the meeting, as opposed to a forum for the presentation of prepared statements. However, persons wishing to present prepared remarks at the meeting, whether in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, will be given an opportunity to do so during the afternoon session on October 28, 1994, between 1:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., and may reserve between five and 15 minutes to do so. In addition, OCST plans to reserve an hour at the end of each day to discuss technical standards and other issues of concern to participants that may not be part of the rulemaking activity. Any time remaining on October 28, 1994, may be used for further discussion of the issues related to rulemaking activities. Those who are interested in presenting remarks at the meeting should notify OCST no later than October 17, 1994, to reserve up to 15 minutes of time. If possible, OCST will notify interested persons if additional time is available. DOT officials chairing the meeting may take additional time to ask clarifying questions of the speaker. To reserve speaking time, please telephone Ms. Linda Strine (202) 366&hyph;2980. Issued in Washington, DC, October 6, 1994. Frank C. Weaver, Director, Office of Commercial Space Transportation.
