"It remains somewhat difficult," Japan's Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters after emerging from a three-hour meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Hata said he is not sure whether he and Kantor will return to the negotiating table prior to the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Hata and Kantor resumed the latest round of negotiations, their third since Thursday morning, at 1 A.M. Friday in a bid to break the deadlock in the ongoing trade talks. "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told reporters on arrival at Kantor's office, fanning hopes that an accord could be coming. Hata returned to face the top U.S. trade negotiator after consultations with Hosokawa, who arrived in Washington Thursday evening for the summit meeting with Clinton. Negotiators from the two countries have been trying to hammer out an accord by the time the two leaders sit down for talks at 11:30 A.M. Friday (1:30 A.M. Saturday Japan time.) Japanese officials said the United States insists on working out "objective critieria" -- some kind of measurable goals -- to gauge Japan's progress in opening its markets to foreign products. "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good agreement," U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying in a separate meeting with Hata Thursday evening. Senior Clinton administration officials have warned that Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than "a bad agreement" reached by papering over differences. In between negotiations with Kantor, Hata also took up Japan's case -- Tokyo's commitment to open up its markets and deregulate its economy -- in separate meetings with Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Hata even took time out from a frenzied schedule for an informal dinner meeting with U.S. lawmakers to sound out the mood at Capitol Hill, which has increasingly called for a get-tough U.S. trade policy with Japan. There was no crack in the responses Hata heard from his U.S. hosts. Japanese officials said Gore reiterated the Clinton administration's position that "objective criteria" are essential for measuring trade results. The controversy stems from an agreement reached between Tokyo and Washington last July that provides for the use of "objective criteria, either qualitative or quantitative," to determine whether foreign companies had made headway in penetrating the Japanese market. U.S. officials have argued for a "results-oriented" trade policy with Japan as past trade agreements have failed to dent Japan's global trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars last year, almost half of it with the United States. Christopher, talking to reporters before his meeting with Hata, emphasized that Washington is determined to change the situation. "The United States is determined that we will redress the great imbalance in our trade. We will seek in a determined way access for American business in the Japanese market," Christopher said in a photo-taking session prior to his meeting with Hata. The sharp dispute over "objective criteria" was not the only problem Hata faced in his encounters with key members of the Clinton administration Thursday. Washington also launched a barrage of criticism against the 15 trillion yen tax cut and government spending plan Tokyo announced earlier this week, saying it will be ineffective for stimulating the ailing Japanese economy. Japanese officials said Hata heard the U.S. displeasure in talks with both Bentsen and Gore. Christopher openly criticized the Japanese economic plan in the photo-session with Hata, saying the U.S. is "disappointed" with the program. Along with opening markets, Tokyo also pledged last July to take macroeconomic measures to stimulate the Japanese economy as part of Japan's efforts to reduce its global trade surplus by boosting demand for imports. The shape of the Japanese economy is expected to be high on the agenda at the Friday meeting between Hosokawa and Clinton.
