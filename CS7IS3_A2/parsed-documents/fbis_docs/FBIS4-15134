In essence this move, which came on the second and final day of the 18th round of bilateral negotiations, in Moscow, set talks back to last August, before Russia had proposed a final withdrawal date, the Ministry says in its statement. After last month's round when Russia announced that the already agreed upon final withdrawal date of 31 August 1994 was "no longer current", numerous states and international organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, the Nordic prime ministers and the United States, publicly expressed their support for the Estonian position and urged the Russian Federation to keep the final date. In the wake of this overwhelming support for Estonia, top Russian Federation leaders, including Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, reiterated that 31 August 1994 was still in force. On this background Estonia came to the current round of talks in good faith expecting to initial the withdrawal agreement which was ready to be initialed in last round, the Ministry states. "However, by continuing to link troop withdrawal to additional and irrelevant conditions today, Russia clearly signalled that it did not in fact intend to keep the final withdrawal date," the statement stresses. According to the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Russia linked the final withdrawal to two additional conditions. First, Russia heightened demands on demobilized former Soviet military officers, insisting that "Estonia deem all its relevant legislation null and void," the Ministry says. Second, despite numerous offers of Western aid, the Russian side called on Estonia to pay the Government of Russia 23 million U.S. dollars directly. In addition, the manner and tone of the Russian side suggests that Russia has hardened its position, the Ministry states. For the duration of the round, Russia "presented its positions in a more or less ultimatum style", introducing its own proposals as "non-negotiable", the statement goes on. For instance the Russian side told the Estonian side outright that the final date would reappear in the draft withdrawal agreement as soon as Estonia agreed to alter its legislation on military retirees. Progress in the three remaining baskets of negotiations-economic, border and humanitarian questions-remained stalemated as the Russian side waited for progress in the military group, the Ministry informs. This round marked the second anniversary of Russian-Estonian negotiations. The Estonian side remains hopeful that during the next round, proposed by Estonia for next May in Tallinn, Russia will bring a more constructive approach to the talks and will both signal its clear intention to pull out its troops as well as come to Tallinn prepared to negotiate practical solutions not contradictory to existing Estonian legislation, the statement of Estonian Foreign Ministry concludes.
