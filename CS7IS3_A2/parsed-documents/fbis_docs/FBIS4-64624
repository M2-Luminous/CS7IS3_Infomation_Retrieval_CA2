MEPs [Member of European Parliament] cleared the way to admit Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden at the start of next year after months of threats to scupper the deal because of concessions given to Britain over voting rights. Britain's 45 Labour and 31 Tory Euro-MPs helped make up a massive majority in favour of enlargement. It was the biggest exercise of power in the Parliament's 36-year history. There were slightly different majorities in each of the four separate votes -- 374 for Austria and Norway, 377 for Finland and 380 for Sweden. In each case there were fewer than 24 votes against and about 60 abstentions. A minimum of 259 votes out of a possible 517 were needed to admit the four new members. The outcome followed last minute claims from opposers that the Parliament had capitulated to EU governments without exacting sufficient guarantees of its future involvement in legislation. The size of the majority prompted rousing applause in the packed chamber. Parliament President Egon Klepsch declared: "This is of historic importance. The general public has become aware that this European Parliament has great powers and uses them with a great sense of responsibility." Earlier, the leader of Britain's Labour MEP's, Pauline Green, told the chamber that it was the most important vote in the history of the Parliament. "Probably for the first time, but certainly not for the last time, EU governments are being forced to focus on the importance of Parliament's role," she said. A British Government spokesman in Strasbourg said: "The size of the majority will hopefully send a positive signal to the four countries as they prepare for their referendums." A narrow vote in favour or a rejection would have been seized on by Tory sceptics as more evidence that too much power has been transferred to Brussels and Strasbourg.
