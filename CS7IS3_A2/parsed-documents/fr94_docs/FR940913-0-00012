FR940913-0-00012 FR940913-0-00003 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Parts 916 and 917 [Docket Nos. FV94&hyph;916&hyph;1&hyph;FIR and FV94&hyph;916&hyph;2&hyph;FIR] Nectarines and Peaches Grown in California; Finalize Revised Handling Requirements for Fresh Nectarines and Peaches AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule finalizes without change two interim final rules which revised the handling requirements for California nectarines and peaches by expanding the regulatory periods and by modifying the grade, maturity, size, container, and pack requirements for fresh shipments of these fruits, beginning with 1994 season shipments. This finalization will enable handlers to continue shipping fresh nectarines and peaches meeting consumer needs in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers of these fruits. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Kreaggor, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127; or Terry Vawter, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California, 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order Nos. 916 and 917 [7 CFR Parts 916 and 917] regulating the handling of nectarines and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the orders. The orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
