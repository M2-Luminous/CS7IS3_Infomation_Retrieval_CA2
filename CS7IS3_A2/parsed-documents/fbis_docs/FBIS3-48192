(KNTC) and tourism sources said Friday. Tourism will soon recover to the level of 1992, when Seoul and Taipei severed ties because of Seoul's normalization of ties with Beijing, they said. The opening of the Taiwanese mission means that Taipei wants to increase personnel and material exchanges, they said, so Taiwanese travel agents are likely to start selling package tours to Seoul. Last year, 147,000 Taiwanese nationals visited South Korea, or nearly half of the 296,000 recorded in 1992, and 85,000 Koreans visited Taiwan, compared with 126,000. With severance of ties, the national carriers of both countries cut flights between Seoul and Taipei on Sept. 15, 1992. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines of Korea, and China Airlines and Eva Airlines of Taiwan are negotiating for resumption of flights. Before severance of ties, Korean Air had 16 flights a week between Seoul and Taipei; Asiana, four; China Airlines, nine; and Eva, six. Cathay Pacific Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Thai international Airways, Singapore Airlines and Delta Airlines currently have 34 direct flights a week between Seoul and Taipei. Some travel agents that specialize in Taiwanese tourists have sales promotions. Taiwanese like to visit Korea in the winter for the snow-covered mountains and skiing, which are unavailable in Taiwan.
