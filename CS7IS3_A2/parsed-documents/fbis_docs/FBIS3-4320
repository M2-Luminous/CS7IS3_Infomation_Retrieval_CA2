Since the 1980s more and more of China's rural areas have begun to develop methane, electric, solar, wind and geothermal energy. Electricity is now accessible to 87 percent of China's rural areas, and 5.8 million Chinese households are benefiting from methane, which is clean and easy to use. Hogpens and toilets, which used to breed flies and mosquitoes, have become enclosed methane-generating pits. Offal and waste water from slaughterhouses are also being used to produce methane. While exploiting new forms of energy, farmers have been motivated to save as much energy as possible. At present, 150 million Chinese farmers are using firewood-saving stoves. Statistics show that the energy newly developed and saved in China's rural areas each year is equal to that produced by 80 million tons of standard coal. But experts said there is still a long way to go before the energy problem in rural areas can be solved fundamentally. While 120 million rural people still have no access to electricity, there is also much waste of energy.
