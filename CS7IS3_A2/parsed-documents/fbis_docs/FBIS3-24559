Lisitsyn, K.V. Obrosov, N.N. Pasechnyy and V.A. Stefanov (GosNIIAS, Moscow)] [Abstract] The article examines a method for segmentation and analysis of a class of multidimensional images characterized by a statistical relationship between the observed value of one component and validity of the estimate of the value of another component. Such relationsip is typical for multi-dimensional speckle images formed using remote sensing means. The proposed method makes it possible to use a common approach to the segmentation procedure, regardless of peculiarities of physical processes of formation of analyzed images. A formula for the decision rule for image segmentation based on the maximum a posteriori probability criterion in the case of a normal distribution of parameter estimates is derived. The algorithm output is not only a segmented image, but also characteristics of each identified area, so the algorithm makes it possible to analyze the initial scene. Figures 6, references 16.
