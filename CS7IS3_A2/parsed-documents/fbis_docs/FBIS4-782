FBIS4-782 "drafr073_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 15 Apr South African Press Review for 15 Apr MB1504131794 MB1504131794 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR ANC's Economic Plan -- The financing of the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) "is certainly in the realm of the possible," says a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 15 April. Higher economic growth could provide "at least R(rand)3 billion," and cutting the defense budget "may yield R2 billion -- though many wonder just how much more can be pared from that bone that is needed for policing." However, "hard-nosed local and foreign businessmen may still find the lack of financial detail puzzling; likewise the promises of no tax increases and a tight reign on the deficit. True, overall taxation may not increase but that doesn't exclude juggling around with an increased tax burden on the wealthy while lifting that on the poor." "The ANC's admission that it doesn't yet have all the answers and won't be prescriptive is heartening. So is the softening of the populist rhetoric of the first few RDP drafts. Still, there remains too much emphasis on the role of the State and insufficient recognition of how the market economy works. But much of this could change after the election." SOWETAN Irresponsible To Boycott Elections, Encourage War Talk -- "The dangers facing the holding of elections increase by the day," begins a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 15 April. "No mediation in our view will now solve the problem. What the country needs at this late hour are low profile attempts at bringing the contending parties closer. It is difficult even at individual level to think that one of the option is to sit the whole thing out and do nothing. It is even more irresponsible to encourage war talk." The "black population" is paying for the mistakes of the past "in lives lost every day, a situation that is likely to increase dramatically in the next two weeks. It is for this reason that we are forced to continue trying in whatever way possible to bring about peace." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Election `Issues' -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 15-21 April says in a page-14 editorial "it is worth trying to cut through the agency-created images and slip-off-the tongue slogans and focus attention on the real issues of the election. Among them are: "Who can deliver on the promises of socio-economic reform," peace, human rights, good governance, and gender issues? However, "there are some `issues' one can readily dismiss. The National Party [NP] is trying to make an issue of the ANC's alliance with the SA Communist Party -- old Reds in the bed campaigning that is peripheral to this election. The NP is also trying to make much of its own experience and skills, in contrast to the ANC's lack; but to take this seriously you have to forget that most of the NP's experience is in segregating, repressing, removing houses, destroying education and facilitating corruption. You also have to swallow the fact that if the NP's opposition lacks experience, its because the NP ruthlessly prevented anyone from getting that experience."
