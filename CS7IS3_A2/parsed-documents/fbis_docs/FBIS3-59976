This land development project that has caused such a stir is called the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project. It will be built on 300 rai of land along the superhighway not far from the railroad station. Approximately 10 billion baht will be invested. It has 12 major components, including a 30,000-square-meter department store, a 700-room hotel, an amusement center, a water park, an amusement park, a marketing center, and a commodities market. It will take five years to complete. It would be difficult to find another investor who could match its size in terms of the land alone. [passage omitted] The company behind the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project is the Little Duck Group. And when you talk about this group, you think of ``Sia [Godfather] P. Pet,'' or Thanong Siriprichaphong. This man is well known is many circles, including business and political circles. He is also well known for getting what he wants and for taking risks. There is an aura of great mystery surrounding him. The company's name is Little Duck, but Sia P. Pet [duck] does not resemble a ``little duck.'' He has built his reputation in various ways, and it is difficult to see and understand things. To say that he is a ``wild animal'' or that he is ``without form'' isn't correct. There really isn't very much information about him. It's said that he ``waits'' in dark corners. Most of the things said about him are just rumors about his business background and how he spends his free time. Sia P. Pet rarely gives interviews and he refuses to talk about himself. The best a reporter can hope for is one or two answers to his questions. He was born in Si Chiang Mai District, Nong Khai Province, on 24 February 1952. He earned a liberal arts degree from the University of Honolulu. He came from a middle-class family. After he completed secondary school, his family moved to Nakhon Phanom Province and began exporting and importing forest products and scrap iron from Laos. He got rich by selling various items to American military bases during the period when there were large numbers of American soldiers in Nakhon Phanom. He is married to Pratsarai Siriprichaphong, the former president of the Nakhon Phanom provincial council. Superficially, it appears that the only businesses operated by the Little Duck Group are the three Little Duck hotels in Pathaya and Chiang Rai. The Little Duck Pathaya Hotel, which changed its name from Pathaya Resort Hotel, is home to one of the best-known discos in Pathaya, the Sea Sand Club Resort, opposite Nong Nut Park. And there are two Little Duck hotels in Chiang Rai. But actually, there are 21 companies in this group. The most recent addition to the group is the Little Duck Land Development Company, the owner of the huge project in Chiang Mai. This is a sign that the Little Duck Group is taking the offensive in land development activities. At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group owned 19 companies. One that people have probably heard about and will remember is the Little Duck Travel Agency Ltd., which was granted the right to advertise on Television Channel 9, Communications Authority of Thailand, during the period that Police Captain Chaloem Yubamrung served as minister attached to the Office of the Prime Minister. Later on, problems arose, charges were filed, and the company lost the case in court. In 1986, [the group] purchased the Rin Hotel from Saengduan na Nakhon. Over the course of several years, administration was improved and the hotel was then sold to the Khwoyuha Group of Winnu Khuwanon. Before the Pathaya Resort Hotel become the Little Duck Pathaya Hotel, there were reports that it too had been sold. And there have frequently been rumors that the Little Duck Chiang Rai hotels were going to be sold. People have criticized Sia P. Pet for ``building hotels and then selling them if he can make a good profit.'' And after the hotel business in Chiang Rai went into a slump and prices were slashed, there were rumors that he had offered to sell his hotels to Chatri Sophanaphanit for 800 million baht. But Sia P. Pet is still the owner. When the Welcome Plaza and Welcome Chom Thian Beach hotels of his brother, Rungruang Siriprichaphong are included, the hotels owned by the Little Duck Group have a total of 1,800 rooms. The main asset now held by the Little Duck Group is land. It is estimated that Sia P. Pet owns at least 2,000 rai. Most of it is in excellent locations just waiting to be developed. These sites are located in major cities such as Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Pathaya, Phuket, Samui, Nakhon Phanom, and Bangkok. In Doi Hang Village in Chiang Rai, he owns more than 500 rai. When THAN SETTHAKIT asked P. Pet how much land he owns, he said, ``I can't reveal that.'' But what he did tell THAN SETTHAKIT was that in the future, his group plans to focus mainly on land development because the economy is improving. Besides the large project in Chiang Mai, other projects that will get underway next year include the construction of a large open-air market and bus station in Nakhon Phanom, which will cost 300-400 million baht. There is also the Doi Hang Village land development project in Chiang Rai, which calls for the construction of semi-resort guest houses where visitors can enjoy nature and the atmosphere. Another project is to build a hotel in Phuket. When asked how many projects the group has planned, Sia P. Pet smiled and, as usual, said, ``I don't want to discuss that.'' ``At present, I spend most of my time on politics, particularly visiting people. As for business activities, I am already set. I can move ahead on my own. I have a team and a board of directors that monitors things.'' Besides the Little Duck of Sia P. Pet, which is moving forward at great speed, Rungruang Siriprichaphong is preparing to move ahead, too. Rungruang owns more than 400 rai of land in good locations in Pathaya, Siracha, Laem Chabang, and Ao Udom. The market price of this land is about 8-10 million baht per rai. Rungruang said that he is preparing to develop it and build several housing development projects. He has much experience in this in both Pathaya and Bangkok. The Sin Thani housing development, the first project, will probably be completed by the beginning of 1994. Rungruang thinks that the economic situation is quite favorable. Next year, the economy will certainly pick up. Interest rates have now declined. ``When an opportunity arises, we have to invest in order to improve our cash flow. Having property only is not good. You have to convert some of the property into cash.'' Probably only a few people know that Rungruang made great inroads in Bangkok when he invested jointly with the Imperial Group in the Imperial World Lat Phrao project. Rungruang is both a shareholder and the deputy managing director of the company. This is because the 30 rai on which the project was built belongs to him. But Rungruang modestly said that he doesn't own very many shares. His relations with the Imperial group have led to talks about having the Imperial group open a branch in Chiang Mai in the Little Duck Chiang Mai Square project. Turning back to Sia P. Pet and his political activities, Sia P. Pet, or Peter as he is called in English, has been involved in politics for a long time. He first won a seat in parliament as a member of the Social Action Party in 1983 and was a ``disciple'' of ``Achan Mom.'' [Khukrit Pramot] But in 1986 he changed parties to be with ``Loem Daothiam'' [Chaloem Yubamrung] and ran against General Mana Rattanakoset, the former leader of the People's Party. Sia P. Pet was defeated then. The third time, in the 1988 election, he moved and relied on the prestige of ``Kamnan Po,'' that is, Somchai Khunplum, a well-known figure in the eastern region. He ran in Chonburi but was defeated again. At the beginning of 1992 he ran in Nakhon Phanom. This time, he joined forces with General Mana and ran as a member of the People's Party. He again failed. In the second election of 1992, Sia P. Pet finally managed to win as a member of the Thai Nation Party. That time, General Mana did not run. Sia P. Pet faces another major political battle now that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the leader of the New Aspiration Party, has moved his base from Nonthaburi and plans to run in Nakhon Phanom in the same zone as Sia P. Pet. Many people predict that in the next election, he will lose for the fourth time. But Sia P. Pet has said that he will do his best. He has no plans to leave politics. He is very worried but this is pressuring him to work every harder. ``I am not afraid. I will fight hard. Whether I win or lose is up to the people.'' On the political front, Sia P. Pet faces a very tough challenge. But on the business front, Sia P. Pet, or the Little Duck Group, does not risk defeat. Instead, this is a time when the group is beginning to spread its wings and soar.
