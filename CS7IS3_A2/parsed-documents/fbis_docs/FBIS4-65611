He saw the document as comprehensive and positive and believed it should enable the Ulster peace process to move forward. The onus for creating peace in Northern Ireland was firmly back with Sinn Fein and their IRA allies. Deputy premier Dick Spring said: "I welcome this document -- and Sinn Fein should, too. It has to potential to end the logjam to the peace process thrown up by clarification. "There is a great deal of explanation that should be helpful to Sinn Fein, and others as well. "I would hope that it provides that clarification that was expected, and that the same consideration the British Government gave the issue will now be given by Sinn Fein as quickly as possible." He described the document as "a very serious attempt...to answer the Sinn Fein questions." He went on: "The leadership of Sinn Fein said they wanted matters clarified. That challenge was taken up by the British Government. Matters have now been clarified and that should put at end to that particular debate." Mr Spring stressed the British reply did not amount to a negotation of the peace declaration. A source close to the Reynolds government said: "It is now up to Sinn Fein to decide what to do -- they have a choice. "They can decide to enter into the political process on the basis of the peace declaration -- or continue with the violence." [passage omitted] Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux said there was now no excuse for the IRA to continue its campaign of violence. He said the Government had to refute the allegations and innuendoes which had been raised by the questions from Mr Adams. There was now "no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and there is no need for any further clarification." But he did not think it would clear up the issue of clarification in the mind of the Sinn Fein president. "He will go on rabbiting on until he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney ceasefire. "He now has run his course, he will not now be able to say to America or any other nation that he is in any sort of puzzlement or any misunderstanding about what was meant -- he has got it all set out there. "I think it is a very good thing that the Government refuted and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr Adams' paper because if that not been done it would have given encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the law abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all been cleared up." The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, was outraged at the response. He said the Government had produced a 14 paragraph declaration and now a 20-page clarification. "The thing is not finished at all. It means the British Government has been in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in cahoots with the murderers." And he accused the Government of "lying through its teeth" about a border poll. It was only a "red herring" which he claimed would be held only if it ran concurrently with one in the Irish Republic. Mark Dirkin, chairman of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party said: "I would hope that people would find no more need for clarification. I hope they come to that conclusion by reading the paragraphs provided by the British Government today." He said the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] had always encouraged Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street Declaration and continued to do so. [passage omitted] Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said: "The Labour Party for some time has called on Sinn Fein to specify points of clarification and for the British Government then to respond to such points." "Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to prolong their support for and justification of the use of violence for political ends. "Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on the basis of Irish self determination as specificed in the Downing Street declaration."
