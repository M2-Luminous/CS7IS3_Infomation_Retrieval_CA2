Bo." in Brussels on 19 May: "Yes, Your Funding Operations Are Irregular"] [Text] Brussels -- Even now that he had overcome his great wrath -- and was sitting in his quiet commissioner's office -- Karel van Miert was holding out: "I submitted the plan, and I then withdrew it. I fail to see how we can go back now," he said. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there really no way, then, of reviving this plan for the steel industry, despite the fact that you have now declared it dead? [Van Miert] I see no way. We are not in the position to reach, or even to approach, the 19 million ton productive capacity reduction quota which had been set by the Council of Ministers as a minimum target. We have stopped at 11 million tons. Now we have also lost the opportunity to cut back 5 or 6 million tons in Italy. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did this failure come about? [Van Miert] On the one hand, we had received promises of closures which did not materialize. On the other hand, if we interpret the aid regulations rigorously, we are forced to acknowledge that the Italian funding operations are irregular, and therefore the solution envisaged for Italy has also become impracticable. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is there no other way to break the deadlock? [Van Miert] I can see no other solution. The aid regulations are adamant: There can be no funding for partial closures, which is what many Italian firms would be prepared to do. Given that cutting back 5 or 6 million tons in Brescia was essential to the plan's success, we tried to find a solution based on a less stringent interpretation of the aid regulations. I did everything I could, right from the beginning, to try to implement this plan in the interests of the steel sector as a whole. However, the Commission has now reached this decision, and it has done so knowing what it was up to. I highlighted all the consequences of such a decision. I did everything in my power. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So what will happen now? Will the plants have to close down without receiving any aid? [Van Miert] I do not know. We will see. Some will close down, others will not. Actually, government funding only accounted for a relatively small amount compared to the extent of the planned closures. Just think that, in order to cut back 5 million tons in the public sector, aid had been authorized to the tune of 5 billion ECU. Here, barely 400 million ECU had been earmarked for an even larger reduction. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So will you now impugn the Ciampi government's decree? [Van Miert] Of course. I will be forced to do so. Out of a sense of loyalty, I must accept the Commission's decision.
