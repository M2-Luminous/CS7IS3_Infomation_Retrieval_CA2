The cable says: To the dear comrades, you know these national occasions, in the book of national strugglers and revolutionaries of national liberation, provide a good opportunity for assessment of past achievements in their struggle. This anniversary comes amid very complicated and difficult circumstances brought about by international, regional, Arab, and national developments fraught with dangers that target all of us, Arabs and Muslims. The results of these developments and the way we respond to them will determine the fate of our people's cause, their rights, and national existence, as well as the fate of the rights of Arabs and Muslims, their present, future, and national, regional, and human role. The cable adds: Historic responsibility entails missions to be performed by all Arab and Islamic forces that are committed to the defense of inalienable, historic rights and that are aware of the comprehensive visible dangers. The purpose of this is to foil plans to recognize the Zionist enemy and normalize relations with it, support Palestinian national steadfastness in the face of the conspiracy, and emphasize the Arab and Islamic dimension of the cause and the conflict. We think that our present situation and national performance play a major role in the nation's awakening to assume its responsibilities.
