The senior level of the CPC is very shocked and has expressed concern about the development of the incident. According to an authoritative informed source, Wang Jiaqi escaped while being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan City Public Security Bureau. When they arrived in Tangshan, Wang Jiaqi escaped from the control of the public security personnel and, thereafter, was assisted by another person to flee safely to Hong Kong. According to sources, this pro-democracy activist, who has a "special status," was a high official in Tangshan City Public Security Bureau's Legal System Office. Because he had worked for 11 years in the public security bureau and was involved in a wide range of work, he had the opportunity to examine files which were not known to outsiders. Therefore, the authorities are very nervous about Wang Jiaqi's sudden escape and the possible leak of internal files. Beijing's Public Security Ministry has already issued notices to various localities, demanding that they strengthen precautions and prevent similar incidents from happening. Several days ago, Tangshan City Public Security Bureau received a notice from the senior level demanding a thorough investigation into the cause of the incident. According to information, the relevant personnel will face disciplinary action and will lose their jobs. Information has it that Wang Jiaqi, 34, was admitted to the graduate program at Beijing University Department of Law after the 4 June incident. Thereafter, he and some dissident intellectuals, such as Yuan Hongbing, were involved in pro-democracy organizations. During the period of the "two meetings" on the mainland, Wang Jiaqi, Yuan Hongbing, and Zhou Guoqiang initiated an underground labor organization called the "Labor Union." Because the organization involved more than 100 people, the authorities viewed it as "illegal" and banned it, and several dozen of the participants, including the abovementioned three persons, were summoned by the authorities. Zhou Guoqiang, the lawyer representing Han Dongfang, was also arrested by mainland public security personnel after a secret "seven-day tour" of Hong Kong. According to information, Wang Jiaqi was the lawyer representing Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to Jiaojiang City People's Congress in Zhejiang Province, in a case of conflict between the people and the police in Beijing last September, a case which drew widespread attention in the municipality. On 19 April, the Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth Jiaojiang City People's Congress in Zhejiang decided that the relevant department should educate Yan Zhengxue through labor. Wang Jiaqi, who is now overseas, does not have the opportunity to defend Yan. Szeto Wah of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic Movement in China, said yesterday that as regards Wang Jiaqi's arrival in Hong Kong, he was not aware of his whereabouts.
