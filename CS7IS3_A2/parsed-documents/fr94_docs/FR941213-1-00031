FR941213-1-00031 FR941213-1-00009 The proposed rule also allows the Administrator to authorize any other certificate holders that conduct operations under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of subparts N and O of part 121. These operations would include commuter operations using aircraft that do not meet the criteria outlined above and all unscheduled operations conducted under part 135. However, because of the size and scope of these operations, the FAA proposes to permit these certificate holders to comply with the operating experience requirements in §135.244 instead of those in §121.434. Each certificate holder operating under part 135 that would be required under proposed §135.321(b) to comply with the training and qualification requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, would also be required to submit and obtain FAA approval of a transition plan converting from part 135 to the part 121 training and checking requirements. In the proposed plan the certificate holder should address issues such as: (1) whether currently employed crewmembers need additional training to meet minimum part 121 training and qualification requirements; and (2) whether and how the certificate holder's training curriculum will be modified to meet part 121 requirements. Although not part of the transaction plan, the proposed change to §121.405 would also require certain part 135 certificate holders to modify their training program manual contents. Under proposed §121.405(g) a certificate holder may request a reduction in the programmed hours of ground training from the minimum hours required under present §121.419. A reduction may be warranted in cases where a certificate holder shows that the airplanes it operates under part 135 are less complex than those generally operated under part 121. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training A major objective of this proposed rule is to require all certificate holders operating under part 121 and certain certificate holders operating certain airplanes under part 135 to provide CRM training. Over the last decade, a number of air carrier incidents and accidents have been attributed, in part, to the lack of CRM skills (e.g., communication, decision-making, leadership, management). Over the last decade 24 part 121 accidents were reported by the NTSB as having resulted, in part, from CRM-related causes. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies over the last ten years indicate more than 60% of fatal air carrier accidents were not directly linked to mechanical failure or lack of pilot skills, but rather to human error. These NASA studies emphasize a training deficiency in areas related to human performance factors, such as poor group decisionmaking, ineffective communication, inadequate leadership, and poor task and resource management. The NTSB's study, ``A Review of Flightcrew-involved Major Accidents of U.S. Air Carriers 1978 through 1990,'' states ``a comprehensive CRM program is one tool an air carrier can use to improve both decisionmaking and monitoring/challenging by crewmembers.'' Since 1990 the NTSB has issued two safety recommendations (A&hyph;89&hyph;124 and A&hyph;93&hyph;37) that recommend that CRM training be added to crewmember training programs. For a list of FAA and NASA publications and reports and related research findings and publications, see AC 120&hyph;51A, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training.'' In addition, certain events may occur during flight where the activities of flight crewmembers and flight attendants must be coordinated. One of the prerequisites for crew coordination is effective communication between all crewmembers. In a 1986 survey of safety representatives and flight attendants, only 37% of the flight attendants and 60% of the pilots said that they thought communication between the flight crew and cabin crew was adequate. Similarly, clear communication between aircraft dispatchers and flight crewmembers is essential to flight safety. Poor communication between dispatchers and the flight crew may jeopardize flight safety. CRM training teaches crewmembers and aircraft dispatchers to use effectively all resources available to the crew (e.g. hardware, software, and all persons involved in aircraft operation) to achieve safe and efficient flight operations. Proposed amendments to §§121.404, 121.419(a)(1), 121.421(a)(1), 121.422(a)(1), and 121.427(b)(4) require that each ground training portion of an approved training program provide approved CRM training to flight crewmembers, flight attendants, and aircraft dispatchers. If this NPRM becomes a final rule, part 135 certificate holders who would be required or who successfully obtain FAA authorization to conduct training under part 121 would also be required to provide CRM training as part of their approved training programs. The FAA anticipates that for a CRM training program to be approved it would include three distinct components: (1) An indoctrination/awareness component during which CRM issues are defined and discussed; (2) a recurrent practice and feedback component during which trainees gain experience with CRM techniques; and (3) a continuing reinforcement component which ensures that CRM principles are addressed throughout the trainee's employment with the certificate holder. Advisory Circular (AC) 120&hyph;51, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training,'' and AC 121&hyph;XX, ``Dispatcher Resource Management Training'' provide basic guidance in establishing approved CRM training. (In this notice, the term ``CRM'' includes both crew resource management and dispatcher resource management.) DOT/FAA/RD&hyph;92&hyph;26, ``Crew Resource Management: An Introductory Handbook,'' goes into further detail. Proposed §121.404 includes initial CRM training for persons already employed by the certificate holder, and for new employees of the certificate holder, unless a new employee has completed the applicable initial CRM training from another certificate holder. The FAA anticipates that this component will be very similar for all certificate holders. CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training is a curriculum segment with a variety of instructional methods, which can include lectures, discussions, films, practice in an operational setting or a LOS session, and feedback with a facilitator. CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training must be provided to all crewmembers, including flight attendants, and to aircraft dispatchers; this training is in addition to existing training. Under proposed §121.406, the FAA may credit some CRM/DRM training received before the compliance date in the proposed rule. Some operators have been providing CRM/DRM training under AQP or under voluntary programs. In appropriate circumstances, the FAA may credit part or all of such training toward the initial ground CRM/DRM training which would be required by proposed sections 121.419, 121.421, and 121.422. The recurrent practice and feedback component of CRM training is best accomplished through the use of simulators and video equipment. However, if the use of simulators is not practical, CRM scenarios can be created without simulators and practice can be tape recorded to provide feedback. Feedback should be directed by a facilitator who has had appropriate CRM training. Practice and feedback provide participants with self and peer critiques to improve communication, decision-making, and leadership skills.
