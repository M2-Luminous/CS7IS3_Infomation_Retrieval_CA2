In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Foreign Minister Mock backed Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, who have both rejected Austria's participation in NATO's "Partnership for Peace." Vice Chancellor Busek, however, has repeatedly stressed in recent days that such a partnership would also be of interest to Austria. Mock: "I do not see any specific need for action regarding Austria's direct cooperation." He added that Austria's pragmatic function as an observer on security policy problems was growing anyway. "In any case, prior to membership in the European Union, we cannot act as observers with NATO or the Western European Union." The foreign minister concluded: "First things first." The minister also stressed that his opinion on such a partnership was "basically favorable," but he connects this above all with the "great importance it will have for the Central and Eastern European countries." To that extent, Partnership for Peace is also significant for Austria. Vice Chancellor Busek reiterated to DIE PRESSE his desire for Austria to come closer to a partnership with NATO. He formulated his proposal more specifically: "The point is the flow of information. We should have a military officer permanently and officially accredited to NATO as an observer." Busek also hinted that he had pledges from NATO saying this would be possible.
