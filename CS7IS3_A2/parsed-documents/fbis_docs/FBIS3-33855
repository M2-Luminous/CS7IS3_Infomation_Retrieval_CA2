Our correspondent Ruhani-Nezhad reports on the president's speech at these ceremonies. [Ruhani-Nezhad] In his speech Hashemi-Rafsanjani honored the memory of his eminence, the imam [Khomeyni] -- may his soul be admitted to paradise -- the founder of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, and praised the epic-makings and self-sacrifices of Iran's revolutionary people. He described the Ten Days of Dawn as the real feast of Iran's Muslim nation and all the deprived Muslims of the world. He said: During the blessed Ten Days of Dawn, the Almighty's blessings and favors were displayed in a manner never before seen during the length of our history, in all their glory and greatness. The president pointed to the factors making for the victory of this great development during the current century and noted that the life-giving Islamic doctrine and the important principle of the velayat-e faqih and leadership were the most important factors in achieving victory. He said: With the passing of incidents, events, and the trend of the Islamic Revolution, this fact has been proven that motivation by a doctrine, people's belief in Islam, and society's full confidence and trust in the leadership, not only led this great movement to victory but also played an important role in its preservation, survival, and continuation until today. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The destiny-making and important events following the victory of the Islamic Revolution, that is, the imposed war, the economic boycott and many other plots, each of which could have left an impact on the Revolution's direction, were all foiled and rendered ineffective, thanks to the virtuous leadership of his holiness the imam -- may his soul be admitted to paradise -- and the rational measures of his eminence, Ayatollah Khamene'i, respected leader of the Islamic Revolution, and the extensive and enthusiastic presence of the people on all the arenas of the Revolution. Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized: In order to strengthen and stabilize the Islamic system all the more and to strengthen economic development and completely cut our ties of dependence, we should fully follow the eminent leader of the revolution and be present on the scene to defend the aspirations and valuable heritage that was passed down to us by his holiness the imam.
