FR940825-0-00118 FR940825-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Transit Administration 49 CFR Part 604 Charter Service; Address Change AGENCY: Federal Transit Administration, DOT. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This technical amendment revises an address related to the agency's charter bus requirements. The amendment is required because the organization has moved. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rita Daguillard, Attorney Advisor, Office of the Chief Counsel, 202&hyph;366&hyph;1936. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 49 CFR part 604 of the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) regulations govern charter service that recipients of FTA funding may provide using FTA funded equipment or facilities. The regulation prohibits an FTA recipient from providing charter service if there is a private charter operator willing and able to provide the charter service proposed by the recipient. In determining whether there are any willing and able operators to provide this charter service, an FTA recipient must follow the procedures set forth at 49 CFR 604.11. These include public participation procedures, which require a recipient to send a notice to all private charter operators in the proposed geographic area, and to any private operator that requires notice, to determine if there is any private operator willing and able to provide the charter service proposed in the notice. Further, recipients must send a copy of this notice to both the American Bus Association and the United Bus Owners of America. In this connection, the American Bus Association has changed its location. This notice merely updates its address. For the reasons set forth above, Title 49, Chapter VI of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below: PART 604&hyph;CHARTER SERVICE 1. The authority citation for part 604 reads as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 5323(d); 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4); 142(a); and 142(c); and 49 CFR 1.51. 2.
