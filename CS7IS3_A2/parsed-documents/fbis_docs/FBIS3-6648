On this auspicious occasion, I would like to thank you, Your Excellency, for the kind words filled with a sense of profound and intimate friendship, courtesy, and affection in your speech. Those profoundly meaningful words serve to ensure the further development of the relations of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the peoples and legislative organizations of the two countries. At the same time, we are extremely impressed by the warm welcome extended to our delegation during our official friendship visit to the LPDR, especially the arrangement of facilities and itinerary for our visit, thus making our first visit to Laos a brilliant success. On this occasion, I would like to express our profound thanks to Your Excellency and the National Assembly for your hospitality and to extend our wholehearted welcome to you for your future friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. As neighbors sharing a long border, Cambodia and Laos have maintained the fine relations of friendship and cooperation since ancient times. Our two peoples have shared not only water from the Mekong River but similar languages, traditions, customs, and Buddhist principles. Our characteristics are also very alike. All this has become a factor serving to further strengthen our mutual friendship, affection, understanding, and cooperation. Lao and Cambodian peoples always share a common aspiration, that is to live in peace and happiness with beloved and respected friends. Such an aspiration has become a basis for our people to maintain close relationship in all periods of our histories. In particular, in the new period when Cambodia and Laos are in the stage of development, the consolidation and enhancement of the relations of friendship and mutual cooperation have become even more important. The exchange of visits by delegations from the two sides, such as the friendship visit to the LPDR by Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively, first and second prime ministers of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the recent visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Lao Prime Minister His Excellency Khamtai Siphandon, has opened new pages in the history of friendship and cooperation in all fields between Cambodia and Laos for the common interests of the states and peoples of the two countries. Aside from instituting a chapter of cooperation between our two legislative organizations by paying this friendship visit to the LPDR, our delegation has also brought with us the goodwill and fine friendship of the Cambodian people to the Lao National Assembly, government, and people, thereby reaffirming the solidarity and sincerity of the Cambodian people toward our Lao friends. I would like to express my confidence here that in the future, this spirit of friendship will be further strengthened and multiplied with every passing day. Respected Mr. Chairman and beloved ladies and gentlemen, having suffered a bitter destiny for more than 20 years, Cambodia has encountered numerous unprecedentedly serious dangers. At present, the Cambodian people are entering a new period of peace and national reconciliation under the clear-sighted and talented leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. This is an important turning point for the Cambodian people, who will cooperate with one another in rebuilding our country and doing away with the bitter past. As a matter of fact, the Cambodian people will still be encountering certain difficulties and obstacles in the future in our efforts to rebuild public utilities and various other infrastructure facilities, to develop our human resources, and to enact and enforce many laws and regulations for the equitable management of our state, economy, and society in accordance with the democratic principles so as to ensure stable and lasting national development in the future. Though encountering numerous monumental difficulties, we, the Cambodian people, are still very proud of and confident in our bright future. This is because we have strong determination, are confident in our unity, cohesion, and unification, and receive support and assistance from various international organizations for the reconstruction of our country. The new Cambodia will strive to develop the relations of friendship and cooperation wilh all countries regardless of the differences in our poltiical systems and on the basis of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and noninterference, especially with the neighboring countries and countries in this region. We pledge to further strengthen our relations of friendship, solidarity, and cooperation with these countries in the interest of peace, stability, and development in the region. That is why we are confident that the relations of friendship between Cambodia and Laos will become exemplary in the development of ties serving the invaluable interests not only of Cambodian and Lao peoples but also of other peoples in this region. This development will become an encouragement for the countries in this region to further broaden regional cooperation. In conclusion, I would like to extend wholeheartedly my best wishes to the Lao National Assembly, government, and people. We wish you greater victories in building the LPDR.
