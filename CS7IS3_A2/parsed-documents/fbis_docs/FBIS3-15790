"Information of this kind is extremely confidential as shipping such freights entails necessary security measures," he told Interfax-Ukraine. "It would be desirable if people handling these processes on both sides did not create tense situations in future," Shmarov said. He added that "professionals did their best to ensure the security of the shipment and make sure the freight arrives at its destination by the shortest possible route." Ukraine has not received nuclear fuel from Russia as envisioned in the trilateral statement by the U.S., Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The only thing the Ukrainian leadership received was a telegram from Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stating that the Russian government would start the supplies before the end of this month.
