Throughout its period of activity, the peshmerga force has carried out many such operations, and especially recently we have heard many reports on the punishment and the revolutionary execution of traitors broadcast on the Voice of Iranian Kordestan [VOIK]. Naturally the punishment of the traitors and of those who serve the regime and commit crimes against the people and the peshmerga force is an aspect of armed struggle. Of course the peshmerga force both kills and is killed through its armed struggle against a powerful and armed enemy because armed struggle is a matter of life or death and anyone who is armed will be killed if he does not kill the enemy himself. Moreover as in most countries of the world, punishment for traitors and for those who harm the interests of their nation and of their homeland, and who work against the interests of their people and their land is execution, unless we are talking about countries where capital punishment has been banned and replaced by life imprisonment. Of course this is meaningless under the current conditions in Kordestan during a violent and bloody armed struggle. Thus, there is no doubt that traitors and criminals should be punished as persistently and as harshly as possible. As stated above this is basically one of the duties of the peshmerga force in its struggle. However there are some important points which should be considered when carrying out this duty; and although we are sure that the party committees and the party's revolutionary peshmerga force always has these points and many others in mind, we deem it necessary to re-emphasize them. The most important point to underline is that when punishing people, the objective is not revenge. Killing and executing constitute only one method of punishment and should be used as a last resort. This means that when punishing culprits, execution should only be carried out if all other methods have proven to be ineffective or when the treachery is so great that the only punishment is execution. We have repeatedly said that during an armed struggle, resorting to execution may be the simplest thing to do. However, the simplest thing is not always the best thing. If we want to comment more precisely on the way that traitors should be executed, we believe that we should start from the beginning to reach the last phase which is execution. First and foremost, when speaking about the punishment of a traitor it should first be proven that person has actually committed treason. Treason is a serious accusation, and as previously pointed out, even warrants punishment by execution. Therefore, such an accusation should not be made lightly against someone, and someone should not be branded a traitor merely on the basis of allegations by a couple of people or on the basis of reports by some. In order to determine the extent of the crime committed by someone, precise and detailed investigations should be carried out and incontestable documents should exist. During the investigations, the (?type) of treason should be clarified since treason has varying degrees. This means that each type of treason does not warrant punishment by execution and that in many cases the type or degree of treason may call for less severe punishment. Treason committed by someone who reports on the location of the peshmerga force but whose act does not harm the peshmerga in any way is different from treason that is committed by someone who leads one or several peshmerga to martyrdom, or from treason committed by someone who has participated in the war against the peshmerga and whose hands are stained with the blood of the peshmerga. Such degrees of treason should be punished accordingly. Another point is, as stated above, that execution is the last resort. This is why death sentences should be issued only when all other ways to punish, or ways to make a misled person repent have been exhausted. For example, informing and showing the right way to someone who has been caught in the web of treason is undoubtedly the first, and most necessary, step to be taken. A misled person can be shown the right path through the party mechanisms and by the peshmerga force directly or indirectly through encouragement of friends, relatives, acquaintances, and neighbors. When all these methods prove ineffective, he should then be warned and threatened. In addition to all this, the decision on executing a traitor is a collective decision which should be adopted through consultations and not individually. In other words, when all said points are observed, when all the phases referred to above have been completed, and when things reach a point where someone has to be executed, a decision on this should be discussed at the party committee and all its aspects be analyzed and examined. It is only then that orders to carry out the execution should be given to the peshmerga force. It should be said that the party committees in the various parts of Kordestan have the authority and competence to execute traitors and criminals. However, it should be noted that only the committee or, at least, three high-ranking officials of the party have this authority and competence and none of the party members have this authority and competence on their own. In addition, in cases when a decision on such an important issue should be made, it is better to ask for the opinion of many others too. And, if possible, the views of a number of the villagers and especially of some members of the rural council of the area where the traitor lives should be sought because, as the adage goes, it is better to be safe than sorry. It is only in this way that those who issue death sentences can have a clear conscience. When the death sentence for a traitor is issued its execution is assigned to the peshmerga force. If the traitor is not being held by the peshmerga and the sentence has been issued in absentia, the peshmerga force should attempt to arrest him. However, the peshmerga should try, as best as possible, to hand over the traitor to the party committee so that he will have the right to defend himself or have another hearing. Of course this is not a simple task and involves many problems because the culprit is in the area which is under the enemy's control and he may exploit this situation and refuse to surrender to the peshmerga force and to attempt his self-defense or to cry out to the enemy for help. In all these cases, there is the possibility that the lives of the peshmerga are threatened. This is why we do not consider this duty compulsory, hence our noting that this is something which the peshmerga should try to do as best as possible. The last point which should be noted as far as the execution of a traitor is concerned is that after the punishment of the traitor, the people should be clearly informed on the reasons for this execution and the record of the traitor. As far as the punishments that have been carried out by the party committees, we see that this point has been very well observed since reports on these executions have been sent to the VOIK. This is a source of happiness. All the efforts and struggles by any individual or revolutionary organization are for the people. This is why the reasons for the behavior of these individuals and organizations and their political and social stances should be clear for the people during the struggle so that the people will be able to understand them and to voluntarily support them. Moreover, the major objective behind punishments is to teach a lesson to others; and the execution of a traitor can be a lesson only when those who are doing more or less what the traitor did can see what acts the party considers to be treason and punishable by execution and, in a nutshell, see and understand the consequences of their acts. As stated at the beginning of this talk, we believe that the responsible political people inside the party and among the ranks of the revolutionary peshmerga will observe these and many other important points. Reports on some revolutionary executions that have been received by the VOIK until now prove this point; and this is a source of pride for us. Thus, we hope that our few words will make our combatant brothers more alert and more persistent in carrying out their duties. Do not forget that the peshmerga force is fighting for human rights and the members are sacrificing their lives in the process. Thus, they should not unwillingly commit acts that will trample on the human rights of an individual or of a group of people.
