The Ministry of Ownership Transformations [MPW] will gain in importance -- it will no longer have to listen to what foundation organs [organy zalozycielskie] have to say. The most important part about the commercialization program is that a shape of the ultimate, future model of the Polish economy has been defined with some precision. For the first time, the program suggests separating the flow of revenue from income. Revenue from privatization would go not just to the state budget. A restructuring path is to be established in industries, supervised not by the state administration, but a trust agency based on commercial principles. And that is more important than the fact that state-owned enterprises -- through commercialization -- will be transformed into Treasury-owned joint-stock companies [JSSP]. There are still about 5,300 state-owned enterprises, but not all of them are to be covered by the commercialization. Small enterprises will be excluded, due to the cost of such a transformation -- they are supposed to be simply sold as soon as possible. Not for the Weak Ones What is more important, the commercialization will not cover those enterprises whose funds are negative (or at zero level) as it is impossible to establish a company in which the capital would not be effectively covered -- this would be against the Code of Commerce. The program clearly suggests -- even though it happens through dispersed provisions -- that enterprises will no longer be so easily bypassed by bankruptcy proceedings. According to the changes being proposed, notions of a mandatory and non-mandatory bankruptcy will appear in the law on state-owned enterprises. The mandatory type of bankruptcy is supposed to take place when the value of the property being given away for usage exceeds half the financial resources of the enterprise. It means more radical policies toward those companies that have reported profit, not through production, but through the leasing of national wealth. Managers, Beware! An attempt to have the enterprises financially disciplined is also demonstrated by the proposal that foundation organs be empowered to recall those managers who conduct irrational policies, and also -- perhaps even more important -- those who resist declaring bankruptcy. MPW's position would also be stronger as a decision on commercialization could be undertaken without the consent of the enterprise's organs, and even without the consent of the foundation organ. If this were to be implemented, the recent dispute between Ministers Kaczmarek and Pol (and two other ministry chiefs) would not happen again; the dispute created a danger that privatization might go in different directions, depending on the ministries' policies. Instead of collecting a capital tax (so-called interest rates on JSSP's capital) which is completely detached from company profit, the State Treasury is supposed to derive income from dividends on profit. The dividends for the budget would be divided (it is not known yet in what ratios). A part of them should be reinvested, and destined for a restructuring of JSSP's. That should not be dealt with by MPW, but by agencies operating on commercial principles. When it comes to enterprises, the decision on whether to accept the commercialization program could be determined by the proposition that the enterprises be able to decrease their initiation capital by the value of redundant property, and then to just bear the cost of securing the property. But at another point, it is mentioned that a transfer of redundant property to the State Treasury will be possible. May it be only in those cases where the State Treasury will think that it may somehow use the property, otherwise the taxpayers will feel the impact. Only after deliberating on these consequences of a massive commercialization, can one mention the obvious: In developed market economies, there are no state-owned enterprises (with employee boards), but there are instead companies based on the Law of Commerce, and these may even have the state as the main shareholder. Commercialization may also turn out a job offer for managers, since MPW has to come up with 14,500 candidates for filling up the posts on the supervisory boards of about 4,000 companies,
