The technology is urgently needed, and each maker plans to incorporate it in its equipment. Since the problem of SEM surfaced through questionnaires conducted by SEMI, it was clear that SEM technology was urgently needed after 0.35 �m. In 0.35 �m, 0.25 �m technology will be incorporated. Each SEM maker will seek short term measurement for improvement, and will reduce the charge-up contamination. Some makers might attempt to lower voltage acceleration to less than 500 volts. In view of stability, this time mainly the TFE model electron gun will be employed for SEM. Aiming at less than 5nm precision rendering measurement needed for manufacture of 0.25 �m LSI represented by 256 MDRAM, SEM makers will install technology for high precision measurement within 1994 (see figure 1 and figure 2.) Because low voltage is increasingly demanded, it is essential to reduce inconsistent measurement of line width, and improvement in high precision is urgently needed (see figure 3). Figure 1. Coming Era Of 0.25 �m, 5nm Figure 2. Causes Of Reduced Measurement Precision and Figure 3. In Transistor, Influence From Inconsistent Gate In order to improve the development of the technology, it is essential to understand the present status of measurement technology. For the purpose of standardizing the equipment, the SEMI Standardization Committee, which is the international organization for LSI manufacturers and material makers, distributed a questionnaires in Japan, U.S., and Europe between 1992 and 1993. As a result, it was realized that even the existing technology of EB measurement will not be adequate to interface with high precision measurement (details will be discussed later). Improvement For Rendering High Precision Measurement Urgently Needed It is said that in the era of 0.25 �m, low 1 volt devices will be needed as notebook type personal computers and portable cellular phones are in great demand. Thus, it is necessary to reduce the tolerance level from 10% to ``5%'' in circuit line width (Engineer at NEC's R&D Center - ULSI Devices). In order to reduce the production of inconsistent line widths, lithography and etching processes must be controlled with high precision. And the problem of this kind ``will be solved by employing new processing technology'' (Process Engineer at Hitachi's R&D Center). However ``improvement for precise measurement is rather urgently needed'' (Process Engineer at NEC's R&D Center - ULSI Devices). In order to guarantee 5% tolerance of line width, high precision measurement of less than 5 nm must be obtained. By Reducing Charge Up And Contamination, Measurement Rendering 5 nm Is Sought SEM makers have been working on the development of precision measurement with emphasis placed on (1) consistency for short term; and (2) consistency for mid term, in order to respond the needs of LSI makers. Within the year, SEM will be incorporated. Consistency For Short Term Improved by Reduction Of Charge-Up For the developing site, the objective of (1) short term rendering measurement with about 30 repetition must be improved. For this reason, SEM makers have developed the technology in which line width is variably changed with a short period of time, and reduced (1) charge up and (2) pattern contamination. At present, especially Topcon of the EB Business Group is trying to reduce charge up which largely influences the quality of the image and processing. For example Topcon succeeded in reducing the charge up by lowering the accelerating voltage to less than 500 V with secondary main power equipment. Since secondary electrons are captured from the very surface of the wafer, pattern edge necessary at the time of measurement and detailed image at the bottom surface of the pattern are obtained. Within the year, Topcon said, ``the development will achieve 3nm resolution and 5nm (3 sigma) rendering measurement.'' In order not to reduce the resolution even with low acceleration, a 500V/mm electrical field in the pattern part, and 1,000 gauss magnetic field are added, and the secondary electron beam coming from the bottom of pattern was collected efficiently. Also even with a low acceleration voltage, electromagnetic lens aberration is reduced to 1/5th. On the other hand, a new comer, Nikon, came up with a new and unique method of employing electrically conductive gas in the chamber, and ``this is effective for reduction of charge up'' (Nikon SEM designer). Even with 3 kV, a relatively high acceleration voltage, charge up can be prevented, beam diameter can be narrowed to about 10 nm, and 5 nm resolution can be achieved. By improving the electromagnetic lens, they aim to achieve 5 nm rendering measurement. Problem Of Pattern Contamination Suddenly Surfaced Pattern contamination also will influence the precision of rendering measurement. Traditionally, it was thought that distortion of direction of secondary electron beam by charge up causes this problem. However, because always line widths tend to increase regardless of negative or positive electrical load, it was pointed out that the problem is not because of distortion by observational electrons, but it is due to the formation of a wide pattern by contamination. Hitachi is tackling the problem based on the notion that degassing from the wafer, and contaminants coming from a reverse direction, from the exhaust system are the cause. So, the problem is being solved by looking at the reduction of exhaust resistance, pump material, and structural design. From experience in the development of ultra high particle decomposition SEM that is quite sensitive to contamination, ``we know how to solve this problem'' (Hitachi). Hitachi is confident that it can solve this problem and indicates that the problem will be solved using the currently installed equipment. Shifted To Radiation Model By Thermal Field Emission In a mass production line in which measurement is frequently done, the objective described in (2) above, mid term, about a day of rendering precision will become a problem. Quite a few LSI makers say that the problem is caused by cold field emission (CFE) from the electric gun. A flashing operation that cleans the surface of the electron gun with a large current may lower the consistency of measurement. At present, Hitachi's ``S-6000 Series'' which has an 80% of market share in SEM, employs this CFE type. Each LSI maker now is considering the employment of thermal field emission (TFE) which does not require flashing. Since the CFE model produces minimal spreading of the electron beam, it is advantageous for high resolution. Although at present this point is indisputable, at the time before and after flashing, the measured value fluctuates, and ``precision is lowered'' (process engineer at a major LSI maker). On the other hand, the TFE model is disadvantageous because of low resolution. However it is said by SEM makers that employ TFE, that by improving the electromagnetic lens, resolution was ``improved more than that of CFE model.'' ``If data compatibility is disregarded, the model can be used right a way,'' said a major LSI maker which has a mass production line using the CFE model. Responding to the needs of LSI makers, Hitachi finally plans to market TFE from 1994. Hitachi says, ``resolution has not yet reached the level of CFE,'' so the company will manufacture two models in parallel. However, for consistency level, ``main equipment will be shifted to TFE'' said Hitachi pointing to competitors.
