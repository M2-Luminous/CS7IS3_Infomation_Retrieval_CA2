This was revealed during the interrogation of the three drivers of Ijoo Sheikh alias Irralu Abdul Hamid Sheikh, on Friday. Ijoo had supervised the landing of 100 consignments at Fansa village near Umbergaon in Bulsar district last year. With this the total number of consignments of explosives, arms and ammunition that had landed on the south Gujarat seacoast has risen to 400. As many as 120 consignments had landed at Porbandar seacoast. Four more persons, who had carried out the loading and unloading of the consignments at the instance of Ijoo were nabbed from Kanaria village in Bulsar taluka on Friday evening. Bhikha Bhimji, one of the three drivers of Ijoo, is reported to have confessed to the police during the interrogation that besides the landing of 100 consignments near Fansa village at Umbergaon, between January 17 to 21, as many as 300 consignments of different sizes had landed between February 1 to 7 at Jaibordi and Kanaria villages in Umbergaon. Later all 300 consignments were sent to Bombay by the two landing agents of Dawood Ibrahim and distributed. The evidence given by Bhikha Bhimji, in connection with the landings of more consignments was further corroborated by Bhima Vansa and Manilal Patel. The three drivers also revealed that Dawood Ibrahim was constantly in touch with Ijoo in connection with the transportation of the consignments. This revelation has provided a clue to the police to believe that the highest number of consignments containing explosives and arms had landed on the south Gujarat seacoast. The police also suspects that some of these consignments might contain silver, gold and even contraband goods. Further interrogation of the culprits revealed that Ijoo had accompanied Bhikha, Bhima and Manilal, right up to Bombay city. However, the identity of the places where these consignments were unloaded in Bombay were not disclosed to the three drivers by Ijoo. A team of experts from Bombay city, who had examined the gunny bags, seized by the police from Tatawadi area in Fansa village, in the laboratory confirmed that the RDX was packed in these gunny bags. Examination of the elements of explosives present in the gunny bags also indicated that the RDX must have been in cake form at the time of unloading of the consignments. In a related development the Bulsar customs department has found that Ijoo, who is wanted by the police in the RDX smuggling, has smuggled silver worth Rs117 crores into Gujarat since 1987. Acting on a tip-off customs officials arrested four of Ijoo's drivers on Thursday. They were taken to a place that has been kept a closely-guarded secret for interrogation. It was during the course of the interrogation that the accused's involvement in smuggling of silver came to light. The assistant customs collector, Mr Ajay Dikshi said an offence had been registered on Thursday against Ijoo under the provisions of the Customs Act as well as Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). Mr Dikshit said that Ijoo had so far carried out 62 landings of silver and used more than 15 trucks for the purpose. The Bulsar police will seek the help of its counterpart in Bombay in finding out the links of the culprits with the other accused involved in the smuggling activities. Meanwhile, it is learned that Ijoo was let off by the police last May. Ijoo, who was not traceable for some time after the dastardly Bombay blasts was kept in a police station, questioned, but was allowed to leave after 24 hours on May 15, 1993. According to the assistant collector of customs at Bulsar, Mr Ajay Dixit, Ijoo had given an undertaking to make himself available for inquiries but has been at large.
