This is part of the efforts to beef up the competitiveness of the city's industries in the market. Some 5,000 managers, chief accountants and chief engineers from 2,000 state enterprises are attending training seminars by the Shanghai Quality Control Association (SQCA), and waiting for their enterprises to be officially attested. The national "gb/t1900-iso9000 quality control and quality criteria" system was issued in 1992, in line with the standard series of iso9000 system promulgated by the international standardization organization in 1977. "The qc system and its attestation is fundamental for shanghai's industries to be able to compete in the world market in a coherent framework with the developed economies in regard to producing quality products," said Xu Zhiyi, director of the Shanghai economic committee, a renowned qc expert in China. Thirty state-owned enterprises are expected to be approved this year, he said, adding that another 400 key enterprises with annual sales up to 500 million yuan (56.82 million U.S. dollars) are preparing to be attested. Some foreign-funded companies--among them Shanghai Foxboro Ltd, Shanghai AT and T, and Shanghai Belling Micro-Electronics Co.--have already passed the official attestation. And more companies of this kind are undergoing such attestation procedures. Hundreds of enterprises and managers in Shanghai have been sent to the United States, Britain, Japan, Singapore and other countries to receive training in management expertise and the latest developments of world trade.
