ACTION: Final rule with a request for comments. SUMMARY: The National Science Foundation (NSF) is amending various regulations to delete unneeded provisions, update titles of NSF officials and organizations, correct clerical errors, and incorporate a new address for the Foundation. DATES: This rule is effective July 22, 1994. Comments, however, are welcome at any time and will be considered in making future revisions. ADDRESSES: All comments should be addressed to: John Chester, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Room 1265, National Science Foundation, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Chester on (703) 306&hyph;1060 (voice) and (703) 306&hyph;0149 (facsimile)_those are not toll-free numbers_or by electronic mail as jchester@nsf through BITNET or jchester@nsf.gov through INTERNET. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Science Foundation's nonprocurement regulations are contained in chapter VI of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This volume is republished as of October 1 each year. This rule makes clerical corrections, deletes unnecessary provisions, corrects nomenclature, reassigns internal responsibilities to reflect organizational and nomenclature changes, and changes addresses to reflect the Foundation's relocation so the 1994 volume will be correct. The only change of any substance is deletion of two parts_``Procedures and criteria for resolving questions involving moral character or loyalty of applicants for and holders of National Science Foundation Fellowships'' (Part 610) and ``Fellowship Review Panel'' (Part 630). These were adopted because prior to 1988 section 15(c) of the National Science Foundation Act NSF to obtain a loyalty oath and statement as to criminal convictions from persons receiving NSF Fellowships. Those requirements were repealed by section 105(b) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 2865, 2868) and implementing regulations are no longer needed. Determinations I have determined, under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, that this rule is not a significant regulatory action requiring review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. I also certify, pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§601&hyph;612, that none of the clerical corrections and nomenclature and address changes made by this rule will have a significant economic impact on any small entities. Finally, I have reviewed this rule in light of section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and certify for the National Science Foundation that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b) of that order.
