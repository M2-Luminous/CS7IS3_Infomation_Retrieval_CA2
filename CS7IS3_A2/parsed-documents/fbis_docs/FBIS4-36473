The forum was launched by the heads of the Jerusalem area local councils of Efrat, 'Etzyon Bloc, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ma'ale Adumim.

The participants defined the forum's objective: building up settlements in the Jerusalem environs and creating territorial contiguity from Jerusalem to its surrounding towns and settlements. This is in view of the recent Palestinian pronouncements and attempts to make gains in Jerusalem during the interim period. The forum demanded that the implementation of the construction plans in local councils around Jerusalem be expedited and additional construction plans be carried out in a bid to create a Jewish territorial contiguity in the Jerusalem district.
