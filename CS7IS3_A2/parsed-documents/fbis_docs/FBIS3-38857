Wednesday's meeting is expected to include discussion of the results of a NATO meeting in Brussels, also slated for Wednesday, on air strikes against Serbs around Sarajevo, peace conference spokesman John Mills said. Mills said the talks between the foreign ministers of the eight states concerned would take the form of an "informal meeting." The ministers were invited by international peace mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Greece earlier said it would attend the meeting, despite original opposition to Turkey attending. Italian sources said Rome expected an "exchange of views" on progress towards a peace accord. The participants -- Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Turkey -- would also consider the impact the continuing UN embargo on the rump Yugoslavia is having on their own economies. Earlier in the day the Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara said that the meeting might be put back. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said "Nothing has been fixed yet." Turkey had been invited to the meeting called by international peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg before last Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo of 68 civilians in a mortar blast which also injured 200 people. Meanwhile Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic is due Thursday to meet his Bosnian Serb counterpart Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Croats representative Mile Akmadzic, replacing Mate Boban, who resigned Tuesday. Representatives from neither Belgrade nor Zagreb would attend the talks, which aim to build "confidence-building measures" between the three warring factions and "are not a resumption of peace talks per se," Mill said. One such measure would be the establishment of telephone hotlines between the warring parties to permit rapid contact between them, as well as the restoration of electricity to Sarajevo. "Those measures could assist in reducing the tension", Mills said. But "we are under no illusion. They won't stop the fighting." Mills added that the question of the demilitarisation of Sarajevo would be high on the agenda although this was was "a very complicated matter." A Bosnian Serb statement Monday said the situation was not condusive to a global peace settlement, but added: "the Bosnian Serbs are now ready to bring peace to Sarajevo, to negotiate its demilitarisation and to place it under United Nations control" for two years, "prior to a definitive peace accord." According to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi, the Moslems wanted not just the withdrawal of Serb artillery outside Sarajevo's range, but were demanding their guns be placed under UN control, which the Serbs would not accept. Silajdzic has also been meeting Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in an attempt to boost relations between the two sides, locked in bitter fighting in central Bosnia.
