The co-operative training project, jointly funded by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry and the Japan International Co-Operation Agency, started from 1990. As a main contractor of the project, the Beijing Forestry University built ten computer and soil analysis laboratories in the training center, equipped with advanced instruments costing over 250 million yen provided by Japan. The center has, ever since its founding, made great achievements in research fields, including forestry hydrology, remote sensing, soil science, water and soil conservation, and natural disaster prediction. Also included is research into soil erosion control and afforestation on north China's Loess Plateau. Experimental forests have been planted in north China's Shanxi province over the past few years. Many of the specialists have now been promoted to leading posts in county-level water and soil conservation departments.
