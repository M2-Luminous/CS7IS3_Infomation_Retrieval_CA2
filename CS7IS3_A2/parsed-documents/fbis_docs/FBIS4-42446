[Denktas] We are prepared to continue the talks if the 21 March document is changed in accordance with the points we agreed upon in Vienna. We have already mentioned that and we reiterate our position. In fact, that was Ambassador Richard Boucher's question today. We gave him a positive reply. [Correspondent] Has he asked whether our position is still valid? Why has he asked that question? Will there be a new development? Do the U.S. officials plan to make a new initiative? [Denktas] He wished to be informed on our position. I do not know why. Nor do I know whether or not he plans to undertake an initiative. [Correspondent] Has the UN secretary general's report not killed your proposal on the talks? [Denktas] That is what we have said. However, they have interpreted the report in a different way. They have said that one of the alternatives calls for the maintenance of the talks. They have also asked whether we agree. Well, that is why we have conveyed a written message to Mr. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special envoy. However, it has been ignored. Furthermore, we have been threatened with sanctions. All that has killed our document. However, the U.S. officials are convinced that the door is open and they have asked whether we still agree to hold that door open. [Correspondent] Is the United States expected to undertake a new initiative? [Denktas] I do not know. [Correspondent] Can you comment on the framework of your contacts with Turkey? [Denktas] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and the other Turkish leaders have supported us. They have issued statements on the unacceptable report. We welcome that state of affairs. Nevertheless, Turkey probably does not want us to close the door. We are prepared to maintain the talks if the 21 March document is changed in accordance with our request. [Correspondent] Does a difference of opinion exist between the UN secretary general and the United States on that matter? [Denktas] It is because of the difference of approach between Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and Gustave Feissel that talks were held in Vienna. We removed that difference on at least two and a half of the five disputed points [sentence as heard]. We asked that the two and a half points be included in the 21 March document. We stressed that we shall agree to the views on the map [on Varosha] and the access road, views which we rejected until that time, if the two and a half points are included in that document. The difference of opinion is between Robert Lamb, who represents the United States and tries to help us, and Gustave Feissel, not between the United States and the UN Secretariat. [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you comment on what will happen at the present time? A state of uncertainty exists. [Denktas] Do not worry. Continue your daily lives as you have in the past. We exist as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We shall continue to stand on our feet and defend our rights. We are ready to comply if they wish to hold talks with us under equal conditions.
