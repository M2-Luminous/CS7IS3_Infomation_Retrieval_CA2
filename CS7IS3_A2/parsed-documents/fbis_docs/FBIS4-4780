The move follows reports that not a small number of North Koreans live in fear of being caught and sent back to North Korea. And North Korean agents are said to be on their trail. They are not protected by the Chinese authorities because of an extradition pact between Beijing and Pyongyang. According to recent press reports, it is estimated that the number of North Koreans in this pathetic state comes to a few thousands. Most of them left North Korea to escape abject poverty. Some of them carry poison to put an end to their own lives in case of arrest because this means an outright deportation and subsequent capital punishment in North Korea. Meantime, the National Assembly has decided to send a parliamentary team to Russia to help with the fate of North Korean loggers who deserted the logging camps run by North Korea in Siberia. They are also roaming around in Russia, hoping to escape the reach of North Korea. Most of them are learned to be seeking shelter in South Korea. The South Korean government is studying ways of accepting them because the Russian authorities are said to be ready to help them leave Russia for South Korea. But the situation is said to be a little different for the North Koreans hiding in China because of the still strong ties between Beijing and Pyongyang. Notwithstanding, the government cannot turn its eyes away from the terminal situation where the North Koreans find themselves in, government officials said.
