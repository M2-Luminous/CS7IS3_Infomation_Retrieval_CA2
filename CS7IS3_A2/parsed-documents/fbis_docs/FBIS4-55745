Keri; place and date not given: "The MDF's Tone Did Not Prove To Be Expedient"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Keri] According to the election results, the whole society has rejected your party, when the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] won the first round everywhere.... [Kulin] You should not say more than the figures show, and the figures show that almost 70 percent of the citizens participated in the vote, including more than 30 percent who voted in favor of the MSZP. This shows that our society is equally divided into socialist, liberal, and national trends. [Keri] In your opinion, what did the MDF do wrong in the past four years? [Kulin] The reasons for the defeat of the MDF and of the coalition are not subjective. The process of change in the regime in the whole region is taking place much more slowly and with more conflicts than society expected. It is almost an automatic development that the parties carrying out the change in the regime in our region lose the elections. [Keri] The MDF and the government have often been accused of arrogance, haughtiness, "mission-awareness," and lack of sensitivity in the past years. [Kulin] These accusations of arrogance and loftiness were created by the mass media. However, I admit that the MDF leaders were crude to the press and some intellectual circles from the very beginning, but not with society and the common people. Therefore, it is not true that the government led by the late Jozsef Antall disregarded the people or the citizens. It is, however, true that the MDF turned its back and became rude to those who wrote and spoke of the MDF with hatred even before the 1990 elections. The accusations of arrogance originate from this circle of journalists, and some Hungarian intellectuals picked up this accusation, people who had lost their public offices in the wake of the change in the regime. I would look for the mistakes somewhere else. The tone with which we addressed the society did not prove to be expedient. [passage omitted] [Keri] In your view, did the negative television campaign against the MSZP chairman influence voters? Did the dismissals carried out in the Hungarian Radio have any effect on the election results? [Kulin] I am very curious to know, but I cannot judge this. I would welcome a thorough and objective opinion poll about these issues. My personal experiences are controversial: A similar number of people agreed with those dismissals and said that it harmed the MDF. As for the MSZP and its chairman, Gyula Horn, he must be aware that his name and his past symbolize forces that constantly led to conflicts in Hungarian political life. [Keri] In your view, what can we expect from the Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television after the elections? What can the heads of News, Panorama, or Sunday News expect, programs that the public regards as too ardently pro-government? [Kulin] I firmly believe that a new phase of the media war is beginning now. Obviously, the political forces which now have the right to make personnel decisions will reorganize the leadership of these two institutions in accordance with their taste and will. [Keri] The present government also formed the media according to its own image.... [Kulin] No, it failed to do so. The ideas and the balance of intellectual forces that emerged in the past 40 years have such a preponderance in the media that the changes that pro-government leaders could make were only the tip of the iceberg. The News, Panorama, and other programs can only be regarded as the tip of the iceberg. [Keri] Will there be scapegoats for the expected election defeat of the MDF? Do you think that you might be such a scapegoat, since you were the one who worked out the party's program? [Kulin] I do not think so because I do not believe that the program decided the fate of the party. I believe, of course, that an analysis of responsibility, including personal responsibility, will take place in the party. Nor do I think that the defeat could lead to a split in the party. It is possible, however, that, after the establishment of the new parliament, the leading bodies of the MDF will offer the possibility of personnel changes at the national meeting.
