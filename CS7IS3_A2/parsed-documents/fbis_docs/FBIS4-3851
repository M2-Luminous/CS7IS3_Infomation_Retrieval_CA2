At a news conference, the Russian minister claimed that the planned NATO air attacks, especially the massive ones, can make the conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside Bosnia- Herzegovina. He argued that NATO air strikes did not and will not at present bring any results within the military sphere. In Grachev's opinion, settlement of the conflict lies in a summit meeting involving Russia, the U.S., European Union allies and the United Nations, which can be held in any European state and should include the political leadership of the whole former Yugoslavia. The defense minister urged the Peace-Keeping Forces in the Moslem-held town of Gorazde be reinforced to avert bloodshed, adding that Russia intends to send a 19-men strong platoon to the stricken city. He strongly opposed the withdrawal of Russian troops from war- torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, warning that this would be an untimely and inappropriate decision fraught with a further political isolation of Russia in the world community. Grachev said that it was not only Serbs but both conflicting sides who are to blame for the current crisis. Gebnardt Von Moltke, NATO deputy secretary general for political issues, who is heading a NATO delegation participating in an international conference here, said earlier Monday [25 April] that NATO is going to cooperate closely with Moscow in solving the Bosnian crisis.
