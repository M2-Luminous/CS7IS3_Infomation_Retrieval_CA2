[Words indistinct] handed to YSU, ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] only garnered 49.8 percent of the vote. Thus, there will be a runoff election. This is virtually official [words indistinct] TSE magistrates. ARENA announced a news conference to be held in a few moments. We want to underscore that this runoff election will reportedly be held in late April, probably the last Sunday of April, on 24 April. The magistrate also told YSU that the official vote count will start tomorrow, and a runoff election for late April will not be called until an official announcement of the results is made. We repeat, there will be a runoff election. [Words indistinct] a TSE magistrate confirmed to YSU. The vote count as of 1359 [1959 GMT] performed by the company the TSE hired showed the following results: ARENA, 494,255 votes or 49.26 percent; Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-National Revolutionary Movement [CD-FMLN-MNR] Coalition, 256,746 votes or 25.59 percent; Authentic Christian Movement, 8,200 votes or 0.81 percent. Everything indicates this party will definitely disappear. Unity Movement, 23,759 votes or 2.36 percent; National Solidarity Movement, 9,905 votes or 0.98 percent -- this party will probably survive -- National Conciliation Party, PCN, 50,572 votes or 5.04 percent; and the Christian Democratic Party, 159,790 votes or 15.92 percent as of 1400 [2000 GMT]. So far, 73.06 percent of the votes have been counted. There was an absentee rate of 47.18 percent. So far 5,103 voting table boards have been counted, and 1,684 are still pending. Everything seems to indicate there will be a runoff election, as a TSE magistrate told YSU. The last runoff election took place in 1984 when the late President Jose Napoleon Duarte disputed the Presidency with the late Major Roberto D'Aubuisson. On that occasion the first election was held in March and the runoff election in May 1984. It is happening again, but ARENA is not in the opposition. It is the ruling party, and will face the CD-FMLN-MNR Coalition. Preparations will start tomorrow and the TSE [words indistinct] throughout Easter, the magistrate who requested anonymity told YSU.
