In a statement he accused minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha and South Africa's ambassador to Bophuthatswana, Tjaart van der Walt, of flagrant interference in the homeland's internal affairs. Mr van der Walt, "State President F W de Klerk's personal destabilising agent", should be recalled, Mr Langley said. In an apparent reference to the Bophuthatswana cabinet decision to boycott the April elections, Mr Langley said: "Any action to promote unrest in Bophuthatswana is blackmail from the textbook of Messrs de Klerk, Botha and his boss, ANC President Nelson Mandela." Problems in Bophuthatswana were deliberately being exaggerated by SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television news and the media in an attempt to stimulate pressure from outside, Mr Langley claimed. Mr Botha's "gossiping" about the state on television and in the media was an attempt to "give body" to the destabilisation, he said. "Mr Botha and the NP government have made a total mess of South Africa. He is now helping South Africa to become Azania...and yearns to do the same with Bophuthatswana."
