RESPONDENTS SPEAK ABOUT RUSSIA'S OVERCOMING THE CRISIS To the question: "Which bodies of power can help Russia to overcome the crisis?" the answers were the following [in percent]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With President Yeltsin |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With "power structures" (the army, th-|12 | |e Interior and Security ministers) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With the Chernomyrdin government |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With the State Duma (lower house of p-|6 | |arliament) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With Federation Council (upper house |2 | |of parliament) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |With none of them |35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Taking part in the poll held early in April, were 1040 city residents of Russia. They were also asked another question: "Does Russia need democracy?" [in percent] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those who pin their hopes on Yeltsin believing he may help Russia to overcome the crisis, mostly believe that democracy is needed (77 percent). Those who rely on power structures, are mostly against democracy (44 percent). WHAT IS `MIDDLE CLASS'? To the question: " Who, do you think, can be attributed to the "middle class" in Russia?", the answers were the following: [in percent] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Those who have a comfortable flat, a |36 | |dacha and a car | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Those who have a comfortable flat (ho-|13 | |use) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Those who have a car |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Those who have a dacha |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other things |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I do not know |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If U.S. residents were asked the same question, there would be no undecided. The situation is different in Russia. Everyone knows from the childhood what is the working class or the class of capitalists. The notion "middle class" is new for the Russians. However, while politicians are discussing who could be attributed to the middle class, and parties are being formed which declare they uphold the interests of the middle class, a considerable part of the population attributes to the middle class the owners of cars. This means that people themselves try to explain the notion. The poll was conducted simultaneously with the above one and involved the same respondents. WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER 50 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS BECOMING RICHER AS THE NUMBER OF THE RICH GROWS, IN RUSSIA OVER 50 PERCENT DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION Residents of Russia and the United States were asked to answer the question: "Do you agree that the state is getting richer as the number of the rich people grows?" Here are the answers: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Americans () |Russians() | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |62 |29 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |32 |52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |6 |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Taking part in the poll were 1472 respondents in Russia. In the United States the poll was conducted by the Gallup Organization. WHAT TV CHANNEL RUSSIAN PEOPLE PREFER To the question "What TV companies do you prefer?" the respondents who can watch Channel four over their TV-sets, answered in the following way: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |March () |April () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ostankino |64 |71 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |54 |55 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |NTV |53 |62 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ViD |15 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2x2 |11 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moskva |10 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |St Petersburg |9 |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TV-6 |9 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Russians watch the Ostankino Channel more often than NTV, which is being done by the force of habit, explain sociologists. However, over the time that passed since the first poll, the number of TV viewers, who believe that programs of NTV are more interesting than of other channels, has almost doubled. To the question: "Which TV channels do you prefer?" the answers were the following: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |March () |April () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |NTV |38 |61 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ostankino |36 |55 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |33 |40 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2x2 |8 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moskva |8 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TV-6 |6 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ViD |5 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [passage omitted] Taking part in the poll in March were 999 inhabitants of the European Russia.
