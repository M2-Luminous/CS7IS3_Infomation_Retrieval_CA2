This issue has been entrusted to the politburo. However the FLN has been reaffirming that it will not participate in approving a meeting that excludes any effective political force. The resolution endorsed by the FLN central committee called on the politburo which it authorized to take the initiatives it deems necessary for the national dialogue and to avoid solutions that do not lead to national unanimity. [Begin FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri recording] The central committee, out of its desire to avoid useless solutions, asks the politburo not to endorse any authority, and not to employ the credit of the party in providing imaginary legitimacy to such an authority, but it remains prepared to cooperate with any authority which genuinely desires to take the country out of the crisis and restore it to legitimacy and its natural situation. The central committee, out of its concern for the position of the National People's Army and its desire to preserve its position on account of it being a constitutional establishment, expects from it in these serious circumstances to support any orientation for a comprehensive dialogue which responds to the people's expectation to take the country out of the crisis and restore it to a natural situation. The central committee is of the opinion that the proposed national conference is not the only formula for making the national dialogue successful. It reaffirms once again the FLN's attachment to the serious comprehensive and far-reaching dialogue to take the country out of the crisis. [end recording] Immediately following the end of the session Mr. Abdelhamid Mehri met with the national and foreign press and answered some of the questions relating to issues of national dialogue. The participation in the national conference remains linked to the extent of the development of the stances of the sides involved in the national dialogue. For its part, the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD] held a session of its national council to study the general situation in the country and its attitude toward the dialogue and the participation in the national conference. At the beginning of the session and following a comprehensive analysis of the situation in Algeria at the political, economic, and security levels, RCD leader Said Saadi dealt with the issue of the dialogue. Will the RCD participate in the national conference or not? To answer this question, Said Saadi said that it was inevitable that several points should be discussed, and in the light of this the executive council of the party will decide whether to participate in the dialogue.
