"By approving the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine is committed to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty in the shortest possible time," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. The U.S. comments came after Ukrainian lawmakers voted 260-3 yesterday to remove conditions they had imposed for approving the start one treaty under which Kiev is required to give up all its nuclear warheads. Under the agreement, Ukraine, now the world's third nuclear power, is to surrender more than 1,600 nuclear warheads inherited from the former Soviet Union. "Although the lawmakers voted not to join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty for the time being, their support for start one and the Lisbon Protocol advances the security interest of both the United States and Ukraine and represents a major non- proliferation achievement," Myers said.
