Belyy mentions this year's visits to China by Kozyrev and Chernomyrdin, and to Russia by Jiang Zemin that promise to boost contacts. "The Russian side is satisfied with the current level of cooperation. Last year bilateral trade reached a record level--7.68 billion U.S. dollars, while direct ties between enterprises and firms prevail. A considerable volume--more than 2 billion dollars--falls to the share of cross-border trade." Belyy stresses the need to assess the present state of the economy and for the Russian Government to achieve a constructive partnership with China, both bilaterally and internationally. Replying to a question as to whether the Chinese side is concerned about Russia's intention to take part in the "Partnership for Peace" with NATO, M. Belyy said: "We are explaining to the Chinese side that this program does not represent any kind of threat to China. It would seem that China has an understanding attitude to this issue and there will be no serious problems." Belyy continues that major international problems will be discussed and stated that "we are interested in strengthening multilateral cooperation with China in regional and world affairs." He adds that documents are to be signed on the Russian-Chinese frontier, cooperation in environmental protection, on the regulation of material and water resources in the Amur and Ussuri River basins, and on agriculture. Replying to a question as to whether military agreements are being examined, the Russian diplomat asserted that no military deals will be signed. Normal business ties exist between the military departments, he added. A short time ago a batch of SU-27 aircraft was sold to China, there will possibly be additional deliveries. China is interested in acquiring a licence for the production of the SU-27, the conditions of this deal are being discussed. Russia is not however, preparing to sell China an aircraft carrier. In arms trading, Moscow, he noted, is guided by the principle of not harming its own security. We are also refrain from selling weapons that will destabilize the situation in the region. He also rejected as false the newspaper reports on possible "exercises" with the Chinese Armed Forces or "joint maneuvers" on Russian territory. Replying in conclusion to a question about the "Taiwan" or "Tibet" aspect of Russian-Chinese relations, M. Belyy stressed that with regard to Taiwan the development of ties is progressing along purely unofficial lines. The Russian diplomat expressed the opinion that "they have an understanding attitude in China toward the recent stay in Russia of the Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama as well. Therefore, one should not dramatize this question."
