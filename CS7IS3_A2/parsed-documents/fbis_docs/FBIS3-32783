The Cuban position was reaffirmed before the 50th UN Human Rights Session at the UN Palace where the economic, social, and cultural rights and those related to development are being debated. According to Cuban representative to the United Nations, Jorge Lago Silva, the UN Human Rights Commission must make the U.S. Government understand that a dignified, heroic country cannot be subdued by force, nor can it be deprived of its subsistence and development. This was the second appeal made by the Cuban delegation to that commission during the two-day session on economic rights. Speaking before the 50th session of the Human Rights Commission at the UN Palace, Jorge Lago Silva said that the U.S. blockade, as a coercive measure against a small country, seeks to prevent its access to essential goods, whether they are called food or medicine, in an effort to destroy the political, economic, and social system chosen by the Cubans. Lagos Silva said before the plenary session that Washington ignores decisions made by the international community. It does not respect the UN resolutions, but on the contrary, tries to impose its own unilateral concessions. Within the specific structure of international politics, Lago Silva stressed the lack of political willingness by countries of the North, namely the United States, to promote measures that seek to achieve increasing development levels in the Third World.
