FR940721-0-00042 FR940721-0-00014 NHTSA notes that on July 5, 1994, the President signed a bill (Pub. L. 103&hyph;272) which revised and codified ``without substantive change'' the Cost Savings Act and two other NHTSA statutes. The content labeling provisions, which formerly existed as section 210 of the Cost Savings Act, are now codified at 49 U.S.C. 32304, Passenger motor vehicle country of origin labeling. Since this final rule was essentially completed before the new bill was signed and since the bill did not contain substantive changes, NHTSA is not revising the preamble of this final rule to delete references to section 210 and cite the new statutory sections. However, the statutory citations in the regulatory text have been updated. If the agency determines that additional conforming changes are appropriate for the regulatory text, it will make them at a later time. Section 210 requires passenger motor vehicles 1 manufactured on or after October 1, 1994 to be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content. The purpose of the section is to enable consumers to take country of origin information into account in deciding which vehicle to purchase. 1 The term ``passenger motor vehicle,'' defined in section 2(1) of the Cost Savings Act as a motor vehicle with motive power, designed for carrying 12 persons or less, is amended for purposes of section 210 to include any ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' and ``light duty truck'' that is rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less. Thus, the new motor vehicle content labeling requirements apply to passenger cars, light trucks, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and certain small buses. Motorcycles are excluded. Section 210(b) requires each new passenger motor vehicle to be labeled with the following five items of information: (1) The percentage U.S./Canadian equipment (parts) content; (2) The names of any countries 2 other than the U.S. and Canada which individually contribute 15 percent or more of the equipment content, and the percentage content for each such country; 2 If there are more than two such countries, only the names of the two countries providing the greatest amount of content need be listed. (3) The final assembly point by city, state (where appropriate), and country; (4) The country of origin of the engine; and (5) The country of origin of the transmission. 3 3 As discussed elsewhere in this document, for purposes of items four and five of the label, engine and transmission country of origin determinations exclude assembly costs. Therefore, these items can also be referred to as the country of origin of an engine's or transmission's ``parts.'' This preamble refers to these items in both manners, i.e., country of origin for the engine (or transmission) and country of origin for the engine (or transmission) parts. Section 210(b) specifies that the first two items of information, the equipment content percentages for the U.S./Canada and foreign countries, are calculated on a ``carline'' basis rather than for each individual vehicle. The term ``carline'' refers to a name of a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction, e.g., body, chassis. Manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles are required to establish the required information annually for each model year, and are responsible for the affixing of the required label to the vehicle. Dealers are responsible for maintaining the labels. In order to calculate the information required for the label, the vehicle manufacturer must know certain information about the origin of each item of passenger motor vehicle equipment used to assemble its vehicles. For example, in order to calculate the information for the first item of the label, i.e., the percentage of the value of the motor vehicle equipment installed on passenger motor vehicles within a carline which originated in the U.S./Canada, the manufacturer must know the U.S./Canadian content of each item of motor vehicle equipment. The statute specifies that suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment must provide information about the origin of the equipment they supply. For purposes of determining U.S./Canadian origin for the first item on the label, the statute provides different procedures depending on whether equipment is received from an allied supplier (a supplier wholly owned by the manufacturer) or an outside supplier.
