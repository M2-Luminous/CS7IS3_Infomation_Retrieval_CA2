Objectively, this is real progress compared with the establishment of NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council), whose creation aimed to fill the political and military gap created by the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of communism. We can, therefore, now be certain that real cooperation will be established on the European Continent, even if the prospects offered by the Partnership remain vague. The terms of the final communique leave no room for doubt: The expansion of the alliance is within the realm of possiblity and has been announced, although no timetable has been established. Compared with the intentions expressed in autumn, this is considerable progress. Of course, some people rightly think that this development is not rapid enough. The Central European countries in particular, whose heads of state will meet with Bill Clinton in Prague this Wednesday [12 January], will probably regret that the alliance has not taken more account of their hopes. But the choices made in Washington at the initiative of Strobe Talbott, the new assistant secretary of state (a former journalist who was posted to Moscow), show that the White House's European policy is determined to do nothing which could jeopardize Boris Yeltsin's reforms. On the other hand -- diplomatic circles make no secret of this -- if things turn out badly in Russia, it seems obvious that the Central or even East European countries would receive their membership without delay. In such conditions, the Western countries would no longer allow themselves to give in to the amoral temptation of isolationism: They would have to provide the security guarantees which Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest are asking of them. Paradoxically, as an expert stressed, the worst thing to happen -- which nobody wants -- would favor the aspirations of the members of the Visegrad group.... In short, the U.S. Administration is taking a kind of gamble. It wishes to play on two stages at once. Assured of the rapprochement of the countries naturally attracted by the Western world and which have no choice but to accept the Partnership formula, it would like to establish (if not maintain) the best possible relations with the Kremlin at the same time. But, in politics, it can also prove tricky to keep two pots on boil. In addition, the historical precedents of this century certainly should not encourage the Visegrad group leaders into thinking that the Western countries would give them aid worthy of the name if their relationship with Moscow were to deteriorate.
