FR940805-2-00088 FR940805-2-00051 Proposed Procedural Schedule 1␣ 1␣ F Primary application filed. F+30 Commission notice of acceptance of primary application published. F+75 Comments on primary application (except DOJ, DOT) due. F+90 DOJ, DOT comments on primary application due. F+105 Second lists of protective conditions due. Applications for abandonment, petitions for exemption, and all related verified statements due. (Notice of intent to abandon will be filed within 30 days prior to the filing of applications for abandonment; notices of intent will not be filed as to petitions for exemption.) F+120 Responsive applications due; opposition to primary application due. F+130 Commission notice of acceptance of applications for abandonment published. F+150 Commission notice of acceptance of responsive applications published. F+240 Government parties' evidence due; opposition to responsive applications due; rebuttal in support of primary application due. Opposition to applications for abandonment and to petitions for exemption, and all related verified statements due. F+285 Responses to government parties' evidence due; rebuttal in support of responsive applications due. F+306 Hearing on all evidence; witnesses to be to cross-examined only to the extent specific need is shown in order to resolve material issues of disputed fact. F+335 Opening briefs due. F+360 Reply briefs due. F+380 Oral argument. F+430 Final decision. Under the proposal, immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant to the filing (other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open to all parties, and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective order will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant excerpts of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination is needed to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately upon their filing. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will have the authority: (1) to revise the schedule as may appear necessary; and (2) initially to resolve any discovery disputes. The dates for filing post-hearing briefs and for oral argument before the Commission will be set upon completion of oral hearing before the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The proposed schedule contains substantially shorter time periods than those provided for in our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4(a)-(e). For example, 1180.4(e) which tracks the statute at 49 U.S.C. 11345(b)(3), requires that the evidentiary proceedings for a major transaction be completed in 24 months after acceptance of the primary application, with a final decision to be issued within 180 days thereafter. We invite interested persons to submit written comments on the proposed procedural schedule. Comments must be filed by August 22, 1994. Applicants may reply by September 1, 1994. Decided: July 29, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons and Morgan. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
