The plan was revealed following a news report that the agency sets import shares for the trading companies through which it purchases rice and wheat for the public. The report said the agency informs the 26 designated trading houses of their shares ahead of grain auctions, prompting grain traders to collude on bids. Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, defended the government procedures for buying grain at a press conference earlier in the day, while a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) official said it would be a violation of the Antimonopoly Law if the report is true. Under the new agency plan for wheat imports, grain traders will be allowed to buy foreign wheat exceeding their quotas by up to 30 percent, instead of the 20 percent limit under current restrictions. The decision was made in response to an FTC request for greater competition among wheat importers. Import ceilings for exceeding quotas have gradually increased from 5 percent in 1960 to 10 percent in 1973, and 20 percent in 1990. In a further bid to loosen its controls on the wheat trade, the agency said it also invited prospective importers to be added to the current government-authorized 26. So far no traders have responded to the invitation, they said.
