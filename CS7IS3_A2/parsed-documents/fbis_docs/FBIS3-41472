Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation for Protection of Nature''] [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in the activity of international environmental protection organizations and is participating in the implementation of the corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an Administration of International and Social Relations has been created under the State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The solutions to problems of international cooperation of the Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy Bricag. The concrete results of the state department's international activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access to the World Environmental Data Bank. It should be noted that in international cooperation in the area of environmental protection, preference should be given to concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level. The endorsement of international conventions should take into account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can enter international environmental protection organizations. Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific centers, and financial structures should include primarily the development and implementation of national ecological projects. As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection organs of the Union republics. This activity has been continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first protocol has been signed between the State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Ukraine. The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February 1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment Program] and other international organizations. This group was formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP. In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for cooperation with international environmental protection organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the coordinating group under the MES. Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all structures created within the framework of the former USSR. Representatives of Russia are working in many international organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This could have decisive significance for us--the success of our cause will depend on the position of one or another representative of an international organization. Joint entry and coordination of activity will help incline international organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a commitment to render assistance in international support for Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the organization of a similar center in our republic. We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus, the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized the right to develop and implement the project for protecting the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of funds allotted by the World Bank. Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis of the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the Ministry of the Environment of Romania. In keeping with this, a Romanian-Moldovan commission was formed for working together in the Prut basin. But there has been no marked success in this area. Cooperation is limited mainly to unilateral aid from Romania. Financial and technical aid has been rendered to the Moldsilva Association and the National Institute of Ecology--for forestry and radiological research on the territory of Moldova. Following the lines of cooperation within the framework of international conventions, we will have to solve difficult financial problems. Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994, international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction. In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding depository with an official government note. The same thing pertains to international organizations of the UN system. And if we are still not cooperating with such well-known organizations as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the UN Center for Human Population (HABITAT), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and others, this is because of our inefficiency and sometimes simply because of our ignorance of the procedures for addressing, joining, and entering them. A center for international programs and projects would help to eliminate this information gap and establish permanent contacts with dozens of international funds, organizations, and centers that would be extremely useful to our country. For example, the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in Central and Eastern Europe (REK) in 1994 allotted $600,000 in financial aid to nongovernmental organizations engaged in the development and implementation of environmental protection projects. And through the DZhYeF [expansion not given] Fund of the World Bank, $208 million is being allotted just for projects within the framework of the Convention on Biodiversity. In order to participate in these projects, we must either make a request for financing our projects or submit an application to enter the REK, MSOP, and so on. But here, as they say, we have fallen slightly behind. For the sake of clarity, I will give some other facts. Just during the past two years, Ukraine has been able to organize the participation of its specialists in seminars financed by the governments of the United States and Poland, and the World Bank, for training specialists in the area of ecological projects and programs. The United States, additionally, finances the Center for Ecological Education and Information formed in Kiev. Canada has allotted to the Ukraine $3 million for a program for saving the Dnieper River. The Know-How Fund from England renders the Department for the Introduction of International Projects consulting aid in the implementation of 13 projects for ecological restoration of Ukraine. The World Bank has already allotted to the country about $1 million for carrying out projects in the Carpathian preserves and the Danube Delta, and the European Community is financing the development and introduction of a system of monitoring, legislative acts, and standards. Summing up what has been said, I must note that the State Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of Moldova has adopted a number of measures to work in the main areas in which our country should cooperate in the area of environmental protection. Specialists of the state department are participating in the implementation of a program for protecting the Danube River and a program for ecological restoration of the Black Sea basin. Materials are being prepared for entry into the International Union for Protection of Nature and Natural Resources and the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations are being conducted with representatives of international organizations to hold the international fair Eco-94 at the beginning of next year, and with representatives of the international convention for one called the ``Role of Information in Overcoming the Ecological Crisis in Countries of the Former Socialist Camp During the Period of Transition to a Market Economy.'' Lists of international conventions and agreements that are of primary significance to Moldova are being systematized and prepared to be submitted to parliament.
