Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said NATO forces "stand ready" to carry out air strikes against "anyone, anyone" who further launch shells. NATO made a similar announcement, with more details, in Brussels, Belgium, minutes later. Just before the NATO announcement, the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims reached a new ceasefire, on top of the numerous ones that failed before. Clinton welcomed the move, hoping the latest ceasefire would really hold this time. He said Washington has important interest in seeing the end of the Bosnian carnage. Although the situation does not justify U.S. unilateral actions, it deserves active U.S. efforts and leadership in seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict and otherwise, Clinton said. In response to a question on Russia's opposition to the NATO air strikes ultimatum, Clinton said attempts earlier today to call President Boris Yeltsin had failed and he would try to talk to him later. Clinton said he hopes the Russians would at least understand, if not agree with, the NATO move. Russia has traditional and historical links with the Serbs and Clinton stressed that the NATO threat "applies to anyone, not only the Serbs." The President said he was grateful for the support of the countries with soldiers in Bosnia, such as France, Britain, Canada and Spain.
