Lula denied having masterminded a maneuver to unleash election-oriented strikes. He said that these strikes are just "a reflection of the government's incompetence." Lula said: "Instead of taking the appropriate measures the government, out of sheer lack of competence, is trying to blame us for something over which we have absolutely no responsibility. It is absurd to charge the PT with fomenting these strikes. The de facto regime used to make this type of charge." In Lula's opinion, the strikes are being motivated by salary demands alone. He said: "The strikes are a result of this faltering economic program. The problem is clearly economic; it is devoid of any ideological content." During a meeting he held on 11 May with Sterie Beza, director of the IMF Western Hemisphere Department, at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Washington, Lula promised some sort of future agreement should he be elected president. After hearing Lula explain his economic program and asking for more details about his stabilization and revenue policy, Beza, who supervises all the IMF negotiations with the Brazilian Government, said: "If this is the case, it will be great. Remember, however, that if you win the elections I will expect you to keep your promises." Lula said: "Perfect. Just remember that I will remind the IMF about the evaluation you have just made of our plan."
