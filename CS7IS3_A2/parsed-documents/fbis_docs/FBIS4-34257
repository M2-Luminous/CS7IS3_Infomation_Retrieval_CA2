He said the negative position the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has expressed in Chiapas is more a political issue than a social problem. [Begin Salinas recording] The peace process continues, and local organizations must ensure smooth progress. Allow me to say the efforts of the peace commissioner and the mediator have paved the way for the San Cristobal negotiations and certified the cease-fire. Their job was quite satisfactory and constituted a starting point for continued progress. Allow me to say that despite not having a formal peace agreement yet, it is noteworthy to mention the cease-fire is still in effect, and both sides do prefer a political solution for peace. These two things, the cease-fire and the political solution, have been achieved. They confirm the strategy we chose to deal with the problem from the very beginning was in fact the correct one. We have managed to build a national consensus in favor of peace. The EZLN's response seems to come from a more political decision than as the result of social or justice analyses. The federal government reaffirms the following: 1. We will proceed to ensure military security in the area and guarantee national sovereignty over the territory. 2. Current social programs will be reinforced, particularly for health and supplies. 3. Government institutions, organizations, parties, and society in general will participate in the continuing debate on the country's political and democratic progress, in accordance with the law.
