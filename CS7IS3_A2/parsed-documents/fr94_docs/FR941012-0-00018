FR941012-0-00018 FR941012-0-00004 V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on February 23, 1994, and revised and resubmitted on July 20, 1994. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations Executive Order No. 12866 This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Management Planning and Review). Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding Federal regulations. List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 935 Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining. Dated: October 5, 1994. Richard J. Seibel, Acting Assistant Director, Eastern Support Center.
