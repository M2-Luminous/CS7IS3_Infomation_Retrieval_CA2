Describing the resolution to be adopted by the UN Security Council as important, Denktas said that the future of the talks will depend on it. President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative, this afternoon. Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit, Under Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray, Presidential Advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun, and Adviser on Special Political Affairs [title as heard] John Paul Cavanaugh attended the meeting. In a statement after the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, President Denktas said the Turkish Cypriot side wants the UN secretary general to change the untrue and unjust views he has included in his report against the Turkish Cypriot side. [Begin Denktas recording] We worked with Gustave Feissel on 31 May. We gave him a memorandum that removed all the problems. However, the UN secretary general's report is dated 30 May. It does not refer to the work carried out on 31 May. It blamed and even insulted the Turkish Cypriot side. Naturally, that state of affairs has drawn our attention. We have invited Gustave Feissel here to ask him that a new report be drawn up to inform the UN Security Council that the Turkish Cypriot side is prepared to agree to the map [on Varosha] and the views on the access road to that area on the condition that the agreement that was reached in the Vienna talks is included in the main document. We hope that this is done. [end recording] A correspondent asked Denktas whether the UN Security Council will adopt a resolution. He replied: [Begin Denktas recording] A resolution may or may not be adopted. If a resolution is to be adopted, then we want it to be done realistically. The new resolution should not be slanted toward the view expressed in the first report that the Turkish Cypriot side lacks the will to reach reconciliation and establish peace. It must be based on the view that the Turkish Cypriot side has used its will in a constructive way until the last moment and has submitted constructive proposals that have safeguarded the Turkish Cypriot people's rights. That must be realized. We want a new resolution to be adopted reflecting this. The resolution to be adopted can either kill or facilitate the negotiating process. [end recording] On his part, Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that he will convey President Denktas' message to the UN secretary general. Feissel declined to respond to a question on whether a supplementary report can be drawn up. Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot journalists protested that Feissel either declined to reply to their questions or gave evasive answers. They recalled that, although he declined to reply to their questions on the talks, he made disclosures to the Greek Cypriot journalists as soon as he crossed into the Greek Cypriot side. Feissel claimed that this was not true.
