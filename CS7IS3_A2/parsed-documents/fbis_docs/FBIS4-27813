The group made the proposal in a draft report on tax reforms, including a continuation of income tax cuts beyond this fiscal year and a raise in the consumption tax. Regarding tax privileges for small businesses in connection with the consumption tax, the subcommittee proposed overhauling the present system of applying reduced tax rates to businesses with taxable annual sales of less than 50 million yen. The report, however, made no mention of the margin of a raise in the consumption tax. Members had failed to reach agreement on the matter, officials said. The subcommittee will submit its final report to the tax reform panel around June 9 after coordinating its views, and the coalition will use the report to work out basic guidelines for tax reforms by the end of this month, the officials said. The draft report also suggested that the income threshold for taxation be raised to offset the effects of a higher consumption tax on low income earners.
