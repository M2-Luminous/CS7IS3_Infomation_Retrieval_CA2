"The Ministry of Defense did not plan for such a meeting on 5-6 January," the press center representative said. He added that work is in progress on preparations for a bilateral agreement on military cooperation, and Ukrainian-Russian military consultations on the issue were already held from 28 to 29 December in Moscow. According to an earlier UNIAN report, the Ukrainian delegation was led by Deputy Minister of Defense Ivan Oliynyk. In the view of a high-ranking Ministry of Defense representative who would not give his name, a meeting of Ukrainian and Russian defense ministry delegations on the nuclear arms issue will be possible only after the problem is discussed by the presidents of both countries, or at least by government delegations.
