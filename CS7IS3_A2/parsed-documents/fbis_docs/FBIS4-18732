Speaking on the Europe 1 radio station, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said: "What worries me is that the diplomatic process is stalling. What I want, and it is relatively urgent, is for the diplomatic process to be reintegrated into a coherent format. ``A (peace) plan exists, the European Union's,'' he said, refering to a plan for the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three mini-states and a conditional and phased lifting of sanctions against Serbia, accused of backing Bosnian Serb forces. Juppe said negotiations should "resume on that basis and I invite all parties, including the Serbs. The only possible solution (to the war) is (to be found) around the negotiating table." The French minister is due to hold talks later Monday with Yasushi Akashi, the UN special representative in Bosnia, a Foreign Ministry spokesman here said. Juppe welcomed Sunday's strikes by two U.S. F-16s, but said "they were delayed a bit too long." In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the action by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation fighter-bombers was "justified, necessary and proper. Gorazde is a particularly dramatic case, it is right and proper that this action took place," Kinkel told public service WDR radio. "I hope that the (Bosnian) Serbs will finally understand, or else NATO could be forced to intervene again," he warned, adding that the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia was a "new important symbol after Sarajevo." Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said she was "pleased that NATO planes have now intervened to stop the Serb invasion of Gorazde and protect the civilians and UN personnel in the area." But she was critical of the United Nations' recent inaction in the region, saying more decisive action "could have been displayed earlier." The Netherlands also expressed support for the action in a statement released in The Hague by the Foreign Ministry. Earlier Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for the UN Security Council to discuss the NATO air strikes against the Serbs and said Russia must be consulted prior to such attacks, the ITAR-TASS news agency said. "I insisted and I insist that such questions as shelling of Serb positions cannot be decided without talks beforehand between Russia and the United States," ITAR-TASS news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying prior to his departure for a visit to Spain. Kinkel meanwhile called on Russia to use its influence with the Serbs to halt the offensive on Gorazde, which occupies a strategic site on the road from Belgrade to the self-styled Bosnian Serb capital of Pale. The Serbs on Monday announced they were suspending all contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in protest at the air strikes.
