Al-Qadhdhafi selected Central Bank Governor 'Abd-al-Hafiz Salatini as a top adviser. Al-Salatini is to be assisted by 'Umar al-Manshi; 'Abd-al-'Ati al-'Ubaydi; Sadiq Hajjaji, the president of the Arab-Hellenic Bank in Milano; and Sulayman al-Shuhumi, under secretary at the Unity Ministry. The five men are busy transferring Libyan assets in European banks to private accounts. The value of these assets have been estimated at $3 billion and were withdrawn in cash and taken in bags to Libya. Some funds have been transferred to secret accounts in Swiss banks and some to personal bank accounts in Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Lebanon. ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the transfer of Libyan funds is not only taking place due to the UN Security Council resolution freezing Libyan assets abroad but also due to the current power struggle in Libya between supporters of Abd-al-Salam Jallud and those of al-Qadhdhafi. Transfers to accounts held by supporters of both men were made as a measure of their loyalties to the country's strongmen. It is expected that Libyan oil exports will be affected due to the ongoing power struggle. The roads running though the oil fields are no longer safe. Colonel Sa'id 'Uwaydat al-Qadhdhafi, commander of the Seventh Division stationed in Zahunah, has been ordered to move some of his units to al-Yarta'ah to protect oil shipping docks from possible attacks by clan militia. Some public transportation buses lately came under attacks involving robbery and murder.
