SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given of proposed contractual actions pending through December 31, 1994, and contract actions that have been completed or discontinued since the last publication of this notice on January 21, 1994. From the date of this publication, future quarterly notices will be limited to modified, new, completed or discontinued contract actions. This annual notice should be used as a point of reference to identify changes in future notices. This notice is one of a variety of means being used to inform the public about proposed contractual actions for capital recovery and management of project resources and facilities. Additional Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) announcements of individual contract actions may be published in the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation in the areas determined by the Reclamation to be affected by the proposed action. Announcements may be in the form of news releases, legal notices, official letters, memorandums, or other forms of written material. Meetings, workshops, and/or hearings may also be used, as appropriate, to provide local publicity. These public participation procedures do not apply to proposed contracts for the sale of surplus or interim irrigation water for a term of 1 year or less. Either of the contracting parties may invite the public to observe any contract proceedings. All public participation procedures will be coordinated with those involved in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act. ADDRESSES: The identity of the approving officer and other information pertaining to a specific contract proposal may be obtained by calling or writing the appropriate regional office at the address and telephone number given for each region in the supplementary information.

Kenney, Acting Chief, Contracts and Repayment Division, Bureau of Reclamation, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240; telephone 202&hyph;208&hyph;3014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 226 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1273) and 43 CFR 426.20 of the rules and regulations published in 52 FR 11954, April 13, 1987, Reclamation will publish notice of proposed or amendatory contract actions for any contract for the delivery of project water for authorized uses in newspapers of general circulation in the affected area at least 60 days prior to contract execution. Pursuant to the ``Final Revised Public Participation Procedures'' for water resource-related contract negotiations, published in 47 FR 7763, February 22, 1982, a tabulation is provided below of all proposed contractual actions in each of the five Reclamation regions. Each proposed action listed is, or is expected to be, in some stage of the contract negotiation process in 1994. When contract negotiations are completed, and prior to execution, each proposed contract form must be approved by the Secretary, or pursuant to delegated or redelegated authority, the Commissioner of Reclamation or one of the Regional Directors. In some instances, congressional review and approval of a report, water rate, or other terms and conditions of the contract may be involved. Public participation in and receipt of comments on contract proposals will be facilitated by adherence to the following procedures: 1. Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the contracting entities may negotiate the terms and conditions of a specific contract proposal. 2. Advance notice of meetings or hearings will be furnished to those parties that have made a timely written request for such notice to the appropriate regional or project office of Reclamation. 3. Written correspondence regarding proposed contracts may be made available to the general public pursuant to the terms and procedures of the Freedom of Information Act (80 Stat. 383), as amended. 4. Written comments on a proposed contract or contract action must be submitted to the appropriate Reclamation officials at the locations and within the time limits set forth in the advance public notices. 5. All written comments received and testimony presented at any public hearings will be reviewed and summarized by the appropriate regional office for use by the contract approving authority.
