Explaining his move, he said that in his opinion it is hardly expedient to hold elections so soon. Kravchuk believes that presidential elections, to be held immediately after the parliamentary elections on March 27, will result in the excessive politicizing of society. The second reason he gave for his unwillingness to run was the fact that he now bears a part of the responsibility for the present social and economic situation in Ukraine as "a man who is currently working." In his opinion, in the case of his participation, his contenders would spend their forces not to develop constructive programs but to prove that the present president has failed to fulfill his duties. A commentator of the Ukrainian radio expressed regret due to the fact that this statement was provided for Radio Svoboda but not for the state TV and radio company. According to the commentator, "the presidential explanations do not look persuasive." "There are more questions than answers in the president's statement," said the commentator who preferred to stay anonymous.
