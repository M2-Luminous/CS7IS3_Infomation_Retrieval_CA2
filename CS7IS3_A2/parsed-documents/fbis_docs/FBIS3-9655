According to a survey carried out in the first two weeks of March, only three politicians out of the constant "players" on the list remained in the same position. At the beginning of the election campaign, the public showed signs of uncertainty. The number of people who are uncertain about which party to support although they would like to vote increased from February to March, and so did the number of people who do not know which party might win the elections. Two months before the 1990 elections, slighly fewer people (58 percent) declared their readiness to participate in the voting than now (61 percent), but then the proportion of people who had no party preferences was only 31 percent, compared with the current 41 percent. In the first two weeks of March 1994, 22 percent of the people who are sure they will vote do not know which party they will vote for. This figure was 9 percent in 1990. The number of people who refrained from giving their opinion on politicians also increased since February. With a few exceptions, there has been a decrease in the popularity index, but most of the differences are statistically insignificant compared with the previous month. In the case of two politicians of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], namely Viktor Orban and Laszlo Kover, and two politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], namely Ferenc Kulin and Sandor Lezsak, the drop in their popularity index borders the statistically significant line. Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions, is again on our March list. He is in second place on the national list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. His popularity has not changed since September 1992. Women, older people, and people with a lower level of education find Sandor Nagy more sympathetic than others. Generally, people who sympathize with the left think of Sandor Nagy more favorably than the average, and people who do not sympathize with the left think of him less favorably than the average. Consequently, Sandor Nagy is considerably more popular among MSZP followers (65 points) than among other voters (42-50 points). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Popularity List |Percent |Change | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
