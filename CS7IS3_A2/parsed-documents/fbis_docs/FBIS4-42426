A top-ranking member of the military was sentenced to life imprisonment this week. The 37-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Liao Chih-wei apparently revealed military secrets to the agent of a Netherlands company. In the CHINA TIMES, this company was identified by civil servants of the Taiwan Defense Ministry by the initials "W.F." Seven other officers have been charged, together with 10 arms dealers. Chuang Ming-yao, the commander of the Taiwan Navy, was forced to resign in April because of the affair. Director T. Jonker of the Schiedam shipyard company stated that it was all "a complete mystery" to him. Jonker: "We have not built any frigates since the 1970's, and we have never supplied Taiwan with any frigates. In 1987 and 1988 Wilton did, however, supply Taiwan with two submarines." Jonker also said that the shipyard company has no agent in Taiwan, but representatives often travel between the two countries to maintain contacts.
