FR940622-2-00072 FR940622-2-00055 (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. These factors are to be considered in the disjunctive. That is, the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of those factors, giving each the weight he deems appropriate in determining whether a registration should be revoked, or an application denied. See David W. Warren, M.D., 55 FR 40017 (1990); Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D., 54 FR 16422 (1989); England Pharmacy, 52 FR 1674 (1987); and Felix Seisin, M.D., 51 FR 3863 (1986). The Deputy Administrator finds that the fourth and fifth factors are relevant to the adjudication of this matter. The record clearly establishes that the Respondent issued approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances without a valid DEA registration. Further, Respondent had been excluded from the Medicare program and had disciplinary action taken against him by the Florida Dental Board based upon Medicaid fraud and unprofessional conduct. Additionally, Respondent falsified his DEA application. The administrative law judge concluded that the record warrants denial of Respondent's application for registration at this time. The Deputy Administrator concurs in this evaluation. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR §§0.100(b) and 0.104 [59 FR 23637 (1994)], hereby orders that the application for a DEA Certificate of Registration submitted by Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., dated November 8, 1991, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective July 22, 1994. Dated June 15, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15089 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
