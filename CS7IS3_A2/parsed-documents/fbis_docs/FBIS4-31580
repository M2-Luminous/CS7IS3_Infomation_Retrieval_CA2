According to the 13 January issue of the Ljubljana economic weekly GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK, Slovenia enjoys a comparative advantage because it started its transition to a market economy as the "most developed" of the former socialist countries, although it is the smallest in population (2 million in 1992) and size (20,000 square km). In 1993 Slovenia led in per capita GDP ($6,186) and purchasing power ($8,500). While the transition to a market economy caused recession in all the former socialist economies, such trends were "less intense" in Slovenia. The journal also noted that Slovenia has better prospects than the Visegrad Group countries because the Slovene economy has been "traditionally export-oriented" and, as such, influenced by trends in the global economy. According to some economic experts, who have dubbed Slovenia "the Switzerland of the countries in transition," the country has already reached the level of the "less-developed members of the European Union." The 19 May issue of GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK analyzed positive and negative trends in the Slovene economy. On the positive side, the journal pointed out that: --After a period of stagnation and decline, the economy grew in the third quarter of 1993, indicating a gradual economic revival; --The national currency, the tolar, has been stabilized -- the monthly inflation rate is averaging 2 percent, with inflation estimated to total 18.5 percent in 1994; --Foreign debt is relatively low; --Exports make up two-thirds of the GDP, the highest in this country group; --Structural economic reforms and the rehabilitation of banks are "progressing successfully." On the negative side, GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK noted a 15-percent unemployment rate caused mainly by recession in the industrial sector. Data show that unemployment continues to present "one of the most difficult problems," particularly among the "less educated work force." Although the private sector is rapidly expanding, it is unable to generate sufficient new jobs. The journal sees increased production as the only long-term solution to unemployment. Another problem mentioned in the article is low productivity reflected in low wages. Slovenia's average monthly net wage of $415 nevertheless represents the highest reported monthly income among the former socialist countries. GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK concluded that Slovenia is on the right path to recovery, while conceding that the pace of privatization is lagging. The 16 May issue of the Belgrade economic weekly EKONOMSKA POLITIKA observed that the Slovene economy "navigates well" between recession and postsocialist economic difficulties. Citing the financial journal EUROMONEY and the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, the Belgrade weekly predicted "possible" economic growth for Slovenia in 1994 and stronger commercial activities, thanks to "new export markets" in the Czech Republic and Hungary. According to EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, the Vienna Institute anticipated 1-percent economic growth for 1994 resulting from exports, 20-percent annual inflation, and 18-percent unemployment. Further confirmation that Slovene industrial production is increasing in response to growing local demand, ECONOMSKA POLITIKA reported, came from the Ljubljana Economic Institute in March. Institute economists attributed the increase in retail trade to the boost received from "invisible" exports to Croatia -- many Croatian citizens shopping in Slovenia. Citing data from the Slovene Statistics Institute, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA noted that retail prices rose 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 1994, while the overall cost of living increased 4.7 percent. The value of exports in January and February was $915.6 million, with imports worth $856.1 million. Trade with the Yugoslav successor states continued to decline. Signs of economic growth and general improvement in employment opportunities for 1994 have also been confirmed by the Ljubljana Economic Institute in its April survey of economic trends, as reported by Ljubljana Radio on 16 May and the Ljubljana daily DELO on 18 May. The Institute reported that rising production spurred by an increase in demand led to high levels of retail trade and a reduction in the stock of unsold goods. The following Institute data for the first quarter of 1994 was published in DELO: --Industrial production grew 3 percent compared to a year ago. --Unemployment, while still "one of the key problems," has started to abate. --Trade is balancing out. Foreign debt increased by $29 million and foreign currency reserves by $148 million, nearing a total of $1.8 billion -- sufficient to cover 90 percent of Slovenia's total foreign debt. --The large supply of foreign currency is supporting the exchange rate of the Slovene tolar, which was devalued by almost 2 percent during the first four months of 1994. --Inflationary pressures are diminishing despite a 6.1-percent increase in retail prices and a 4.5-percent increase in manufacturers' prices.
