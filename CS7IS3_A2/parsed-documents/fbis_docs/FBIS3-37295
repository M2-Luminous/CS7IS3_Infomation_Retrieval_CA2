In January, Interfax-Exclusive acquainted the reader with Yuriy Meshkov as a candidate to the presidential post. Political scientists believe that Meshkov's pro-Russian position may complicated relations between Moscow and Kiev. Moreover, some analysts predict that Crimea may become a second Karabakh. Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov talks with Yuriy Meshkov. IF: Some assert that the forthcoming referendum on Crimea's independence is the main element of your policy. MESHKOV: The main aspect of my policy is Crimea's independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our economic problems. The results of the presidential elections confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and other links with Russia, and to a union with Russia. As to the referendum, there is a law on the referendum which must be observed. IF: Do you mean economic aspects when you talk about Crimea's independence? MESHKOV: Economy comes first. The forthcoming referendum is expected to put Crimea's economic independence on a juridical footing. IF: Do you favor Crimea's integration with Russia or Crimea's complete independence? MESHKOV: Our goal is an independent and self-sufficient Crimea. It will not be isolated from the CIS, however, but be a full-fledged member of a single economic system. IF: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told Interfax recently that Ukraine was planning to depart from the Massandra agreements on the Black Sea Fleet and get back to the Yalta agreements. What is actually meant here is Kiev's refusal to pass the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. What would you say about this? MESHKOV: This is not the first time Kiev violates the international principle of observance of agreements. Agreement must be implemented, said the Roman law more than 2000 years ago. Ukraine's position has nothing to do with the principles and norms of international law. The Black Sea Fleet must be indivisible, belong to Russia and be based in Sevastopol which is an inalienable part of the Republic of Crimea. IF: Suppose the Black Sea Fleet will belong to Russia. Simferopol may claim a compensation for the utilization of the fleet's infrastructure. What will relations be like between the Crimean authorities and the Black Sea Fleet? MESHKOV: I hope these relations will be good and either side will observe its own interests. IF: Moscow anxiously followed both rounds of presidential elections in Crimea. How do you assess Kiev's official reaction to your success and the defeat of the Crimean parliament speaker Nikolai Bagrov? MESHKOV: How can one respond to almost unanimous results? (Last Friday the Crimean president had talks in Kiev with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. To quote Meshkov, the talks were sincere and gave a fresh impetus to Crimean-Ukrainian relations. "I returned to Simferopol with a shield," said Meshkov. Journalists note, however, that Meshkov looked depressed after the talks -- Interfax). IF: Some argue that the elections in Crimea were illegal, because they were at variance with the Ukrainian constitution, so their results might be challenged. Do you think such a situation may evolve into open military confrontation? MESHKOV: No, it can't. One may say whatever one chooses, but no one can cancel the more than a million votes cast for the president. The elections were juridically grounded and no one should anticipate any unreasonable steps on the part of Kiev. IF: Crimea is faced with many problems, including the problem of the Crimean Tatars. How are you going to tackle it? MESHKOV: We shall seek a solution of this problem on the basis of international law and the laws of the Republic of Crimea. The material damage inflicted on the citizens of the Republic of Crimea must be compensated. The government must do so by all means and Simferopol will provide such guarantees. However, in tackling this problem Crimea must act in close cooperation with Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan (most of the Crimean Tatars banished from Crimea in 1944 live in Uzbekistan -- Interfax). IF: What would you say about the white Lincoln which a Crimean billionaire promised to give you? MESHKOV: If he keeps the promise which he gave before the elections, when nobody knew who would become president, I will not consider this limo as something given to a specific person. I don't think I'll use it very often. But I might make use of it to welcome Leonid Kravchuk or Boris Yeltsin here in Crimea.
