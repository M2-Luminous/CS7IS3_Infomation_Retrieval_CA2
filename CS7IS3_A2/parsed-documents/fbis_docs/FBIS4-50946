The Public Security Internal Work Handbook, published last July, contains a whole section on how to deal with media reports "unfavourable to the public security departments" and the methods to be used in evading sensitive questions raised by reporters. "When reports are not accurate or twist the truth the Public Security Bureau (PSB) shall not keep silent instead it shall take immediate action to tell the truth and demand the news organisation corrects its mistake," the handbook states. "If you express no views or make no protest, it means that you will have acquiesced in the report," it adds. Last Friday, the ministry issued a strong denial of a United Press International report that a ministry spokesman had confirmed the authorities had decided to start legal proceedings against Wei, saying the report had been fabricated with ulterior motives. In cases where a report is "accurate but leaves your unit in a bad situation because it only reports the mistakes of an individual PSB unit or officer", the handbook says, the unit should "modestly admit" the mistake and express willingness to correct it. "It will be a major error of judgment if you make no response or refuse to admit your mistakes or even threaten the news organisation," it says. However, the handbook warns that when PSB officers grant interviews to reporters they must "always keep in mind the need to protect secrets", something which would include the impending trial of Wei. "In order to get what they think to be important information, reporters may ask one question after another or talk in a roundabout way so as to get to the bottom of something. "Some may even try to establish a relationship with you or invite you to dinner. In such circumstance, you must be on your guard, make acute responses to questions, avoid making indiscreet remarks and never leak secrets for profit," it says. But no mention is made of what should be done in the event that secrets are accidentally or inadvertently leaked. The handbook does however, contain useful tips for PSB officers on staging press conferences and avoiding those "harsh questions" journalists sometime ask. Officers can use various tactics to "get out of trouble" at press conferences such as delaying evading, admitting, denying and returning the question, the handbook says, and even offers some stock phrases to be used in awkward situations. For example: "This is not a matter of yes or no" "that depends on your point of view", or "to understand this question, one must first understand the background". The 800-page handbook covers everything from handling top secret documents to how to answer a telephone call from a superior officer.
