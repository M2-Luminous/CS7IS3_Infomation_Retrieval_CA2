The revolutionary zeal of the masses has been extraordinarily enhanced and we faced enormous tasks. This reality demands that the guiding functionaries revolutionize themselves more than ever before and stand at the van of every work. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Whether success can be attained in the revolutionary struggle and construction work or not will largely depend on how the cadres--commanding members of the revolution--will work. Cadres are the backbone of our party and revolutionary ranks and are commanding members of the revolution. The firmness and combat capabilities of the party and revolutionary ranks largely depend on the cadres and the issue of registering a revolutionary turn in socialist construction depends on the cadres. Only when the functionaries firmly prepare themselves ideologically by thoroughly revolutionizing themselves and only when they excellently carry out the role of the vanguard in all works, can they vigorously push ahead with the revolution and construction and firmly defend, protect and glorify our-style socialism. It is a revolutionary mission for guiding functionaries, who uphold the party, to stand at the van of all works. Our party is the party which carries out the revolution and struggle, and is a motherly party which leads destiny of the people by bearing the responsibility. It is a lofty intent of the dear comrade leader to carry out benevolent politics for the people and to make the cadres genuine faithful servants of the people who embody the party's benevolent politics. Functionaries of our party should more satisfactorily have lofty traits as commanding members of the revolution and as faithful servants of the people by constantly revolutionizing themselves, and should always work devotedly for the party and the people. It is an important demand in brilliantly carrying out gigantic revolutionary tasks facing us this year for leading functionaries to stand at the van of all works. The spirit of struggle of the masses, who rose in the worthwhile struggle to implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy, is very high. The issue is for leading functionaries, who command each outpost of general march, to correctly organize and mobilize the masses by displaying the revolutionary spirit and combat capability. The experience in the units, which created miracles and innovations in the first march of the new year, illustrates that only when functionaries stand at the van of others with the initiative, will all works be carried out satisfactorily. The cadres decide everything in the revolutionary struggle and construction work. How thoroughly the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy is implemented depends on the cadres at last. When the functionaries organize and command at the van of the struggle to implement the party's policy with loyalty to the party and with the spirit of devoted service for the people, we can successfully accomplish all tasks, no matter how gigantic they may be, and can effect a great revolutionary upsurge in this year's socialist general march. It is also an important insurance for firmly consolidating our single-hearted unity with the party and the leader [suryong] for the leading functionaries to stand at the van of every work. The single-hearted unity between the party and revolutionary ranks is a powerful weapon which only our party--the chuche-type revolutionary party--has. Because there is such single-hearted unity, we can break through all trials, no matter how difficult and complex they may be, and can defend and carry to accomplishment our-style socialism without wavering even to a slight degree, no matter how strong the enemy may provoke. Our functionaries should further consolidate our firm single-hearted unity, which has been attained the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center. When the functionaries--the standard-bearer and genuine educators of the masses--precisely educate and lead the party members and working people, the people will more firmly trust and follow the party and our single-hearted unity will be consolidated in an indomitable unity. The issue of more highly displaying the superiority of our-style socialism importantly depends on the role of leading functionaries. Today our people, without exception, absolutely support and endlessly trust our-style socialism. It is important for leading functionaries to struggle devotedly so that superiority of this system be more highly demonstrated. The leading functionaries should devotedly struggle to more highly display the superiority of this system. Our functionaries are assigned with the mission to infiltrate warm benevolence of the party and the leader more thoroughly into the people and to provide them with happier and richer life. When the functionaries actively struggle to brilliantly achieve our party's intent to make the people live more happily, the imperialists will get week-knees, no matter how frantically they maneuver to isolate and crush our-style socialism, and the sound of "Long live socialism!" will continually resound from among our people. The party's expectations for leading functionaries in today's general march are very great. Our party has not only assigned important revolutionary outposts to functionaries but also energetically led functionaries so that they constantly revolutionize themselves. This reflects our party's lofty intent to foster all functionaries to be unswerving revolutionaries who share destiny with the party and the leader to the end, and to be genuine faithful servants who devotedly serve the people. The outposts assigned to our functionaries are different from each other. However, the position on which they should stand always is the van of every work. Those who should play the kernel role in the struggle to uphold our party and to strengthen the single-hearted unity are our functionaries and those who should lead at the van the struggle to carry to accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle are our functionaries. The men who should set an example in the work to establish law-abiding trait and the socialist life style are our cadres. Without the kernel and vanguard role of our functionaries, they cannot think of any worth and honor as commanding members of the revolution, no matter what revolutionary outposts they are in charge of. All functionaries should keenly realize that the destiny of the party, of the revolution and of socialism, depends on how they prepare themselves ideologically and on how they enhance their role, and should stand at the van of all works. Thus, they should fulfill the mission as commanding members of the revolution. Functionaries should, above all, uphold the party at the van of others with faithful loyalty. The faithful loyalty is a basic trait that commanding members of the revolution should cherish. The revolutionary fighters should fight to the end with faithful loyalty for the party and the leader [suryong] by sharing destiny with the leader [yongdoja] by dedicating their lives. Herein lies their valuable life and honor. Functionaries should become the standard-bearers and vanguard in upholding the party and the leader [suryong]. Functionaries should entrust the party with their whole destiny and should loyally uphold the party and the leader to the end with thorough faith and determination to die at their posts while defending them. Just as commanders of anti-Japanese guerrilla units who fought by willingly dedicating their lives to defending and protecting the respected comrade commander, our functionaries should dedicate all of their wisdom and energy to the struggle to achieve the intent and ideas of the leader [yongdoja] by sharing destiny with the great leader [yongdoja]. In particular, functionaries should direct essential interest to safeguarding and glorifying forever the achievements made by the party and the leader. Functionaries should precisely inform the party members and working people of greatness of the achievements made by the party and the leader and should consistently carry out the work to glorify such achievements. Functionaries of the unit who received on-the-spot guidance must work well to make their unit an example of the whole nation and must thoroughly implement the tasks presented at the on-the-spot guidance. It is important for functionaries to have high party spirit like Comrade Yi In-mo by loyally upholding the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution. The words of the poem dedicated to the dear comrade leader by Comrade Yi In-mo are filled with his attitude, position, and lucid party spirit toward the party and the leader. All functionaries must reflect their party spirit to Comrade Yi In-mo's party spirit and must exert all efforts to train and self-discipline themselves ideologically. Functionaries must also have a sacrificial service spirit to the people and must struggle by devoting everything to the people. Our functionaries emerge from the working masses, including workers and farmers, and they are messengers of the people who are possessed with the mission to serve them loyally. For our functionaries, serving the people with devotion is the road of complete loyalty to the party and the leader. There is no greater happiness and worthiness for the functionaries than further upholding the party's and leader's plan and intention and receiving the masses' faith and love by working as the people's faithful servants. In our society the party and the regime serve the people, the people give orders, and functionaries are entrusted with the duty of implementing them. All functionaries must faithfully experience our party's ideology of believing in the people as in heaven, and carry out all work by always thinking and acting from the position that they are the messengers of the people. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught that for functionaries to go into the masses and serving the people devotedly are the same as eating healthy food, and for functionaries to exercise power and bureaucratism are the same as eating poisonous food. This is a favorite proverb in the work and life of our functionaries, which must always be engraved and embodied in their minds. Our functionaries must highly uphold the slogan of "Serving the people," presented by the party, always go deeply into the masses to listen attentively to their demands and fulfill their demands at the right time, and must exert themselves to make the people's living standard more abundant, even though they may sleep and rest less. Those who are indifferent about the people's living conditions cannot be regarded as commanding members of the true revolution. Like the people's faithful servants, when there are good things and happy events take place, our functionaries must think of the people first, affectionately take care of the people's living conditions -- from the political, labor, cultural life to the family life -- so they can exert all their strength in carrying out their revolutionary duties. There cannot be satisfaction in the work to implement the party's intention of devotedly serving the people. Our functionaries must actively learn the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's endlessly lofty trait of always thinking of the people first, being thoughtful of working to provide better things for them, and find utmost delight from the people's happiness. Therefore, work must be carried out to brilliantly embody the party's intention of making functionaries work more and allowing the people receive more benefits. Our functionaries must also highly manifest the revolutionary trait of unconditionally receiving and thoroughly implementing the party's ideology and plan. Unconditionally receiving and thoroughly implementing the party's ideology and plan are just duties of the cadres and a revolutionary attitude. Functionaries must have the spirit of absoluteness toward the party policy so the party's ideology and plan can be thoroughly advocated and fulfill their duty as the commanding members of the revolution. Our functionaries must regard the party's ideology and plan as their faith, accept them as an absolute truth, and must think and act only in accordance with the party's ideology and intention in whatever environment. Today's general march to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy is a responsible struggle that inspects the functionaries' faithfulness and revolutionary spirit. Functionaries must devote all their energy and wisdom in the struggle to implement the party's plan and orders, and do a splendid job of the task that they are entrusted with through skillful operations and command. In particular, in accordance with the demand of the Chongsan-ri spirit, Chongsan-ri method, and the Taean work system, functionaries must always go deeply into the producer masses and live under the same roof with them so they can be roused in the new struggle and feat. They must also sow plants with their own hands and harvest with their own hands. Self-reliance and hard struggle, this is the criteria of functionaries' loyalty to the party and the revolution. Under the condition in which the imperialists intensify economic blockade maneuvers to stifle us, our functionaries should stand at the van to implement thoroughly the party's policy, upholding the banner of self-reliance and hard struggle to defend and adhere to the socialism of our own style and bring full its vitality. With the firm will that what the party decides, we will do, functionaries should vigorously strive to carry out the given revolutionary tasks with their own efforts by seeking out what is in short supply and producing what is deficient. In particular, they should learn by Comrade (Chong Chun-sil)'s example of spirit of devotion, sacrifice, and self-reliance that was shown in the struggle to realize the party's plan and to promote the people's standard of living. Our functionaries, as Comrade (Chong Chun-sil) did, should open a passage of advancement by pushing hard with their renewed courage whenever they are faced with difficult tasks. They should complete their entrusted tasks and should highly display the ethos of deliberating and running until their tasks are brilliantly achieved. In order to stand at the van of every task, it is very important for the functionaries to possess the revolutionary work method and popular work style. All functionaries should positively learn by the revolutionary work method of Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and should work in accordance with it. Whatever they may do in any position, functionaries should eliminate their conventional attitude and have plain and easy characters. They should always be humble before the masses and be upright, unaware of any recompense or privilege. They should always be with the masses and share joy and sorrow with them. By climbing a mountain ridge and carrying burdens before others, functionaries should stand at the van of the masses if it is for the people. Functionaries should become accustomed to living in this way. If functionaries are to become genuine commanding officers of the revolution, who are endlessly loyal to the party and the leader, they should make steady efforts to carry out the works to train and discipline themselves in a revolutionary manner. There is no born revolutionary nor consummated commanding officers of the revolution. One can become a genuine chuche-type revolutionary only through steady ideological discipline to revolutionize themselves and revolutionary practice. As a gem sparks only when it is constantly cleaned, a revolutionary can endlessly add luster to its political life by training himself in a revolutionary manner and putting forth strong demands. Most of our functionaries are the people who were brought up after the liberation of the fatherland under the bosom of the party without any difficulties or worries. Our party's line on endlessly revolutionizing commanding officials is the most just line that enables our functionaries to be brought up as genuine chuche-type revolutionaries. Responsible functionaries should set examples in standing at the van of revolutionizing. As the saying goes "When the upper part of water is clean so is the lower part," when the responsible functionaries revolutionize themselves and make constant demands, the lower functionaries will follow them. The functionaries should always join a grand struggle to implement the party's policy to revolutionize themselves. In particular, they should mingle with the working class and positively learn by their unlimited loyalty to the party and the leader, and their strong revolutionary spirit and working class spirit. Functionaries should sincerely participate in the party organizational life and endlessly discipline their partisanship by learning by the noble view of organization shown by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Functionaries should always work and live in conformity with the party organization from a standpoint of being a rank-and-file member of the party and consciously strive to receive the party organization's guidance and control. All of our functionaries are revolutionary fighters who are fighting with the promise to be loyal to the party and the leader. All functionaries should not forget the promises they made before the party and stand at the van of every task. By doing so, they should become a staunch chuche-type revolutionary, sharing life and death with the party, and a faithful servant devotedly serving the people.
