It also called for rejecting the principle of appointments. In a statement distributed yesterday in Ramallah, the DFLP warned against the municipalities' assumption of political tasks, as in Hebron. The statement emphasized the need for municipalities to fulfill their role in serving the residents, far from the Oslo accord. It said that no one has the right to use the municipalities for political purposes. The statement renewed the demand to hold comprehensive elections for all municipalities. It considers the lack of response to the demand for elections as an indication of the dictatorship of the coming authority, which our people will not allow. The statement said that the Israeli consent to reinstate the Hebron municipal council members, who were elected 18 years ago, was a bribe. The Israeli authorities have refused and are refusing to collectively reinstate the elected municipal councils, which is a popular Palestinian demand. The statement sharply criticized what it called "the new concessions," namely; having the settlers remain in the heart of Hebron and in all the occupied territories, giving up the demand for international protection for our defenseless people, and sufficing with a weak multinational observers' presence as a substitute to the international protection stipulated by the Security Council.
