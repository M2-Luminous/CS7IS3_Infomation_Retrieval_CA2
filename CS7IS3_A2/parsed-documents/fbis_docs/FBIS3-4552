Meeting at a resort hotel in the Frankfurt suburb of Kronberg, G- 7 finance ministers and central bankers reaffirmed their support for aid to Moscow and for its economic reform efforts, while belittling Tokyo's attempts to curb its huge trade surplus. Touting President Boris Yeltsin's efforts to tame inflation and privatize the behemoth Russian economy, and flush with their diplomatic moves to end the siege of Sarajevo, the Moscow visitors sought a seat at the global economic table from the G-7. They were not disappointed. The tone was signaled by a statement from the meeting's chairman, Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany, a country with close ties to the former Soviet Union. The conference closed with the G-7 agreeing to fully implement its comprehensive 43 billion dollar Russian aid plans, according to the statement. But Japan, with the world's second biggest economy -- and the only trade surplus among the G-7 -- was told to do more to boost domestic demand and reduce its swollen current account imbalance, while not even getting a strong call for currency market stability. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii headed to Germany to reexplain Japan's recent 15 trillion yen pump-priming package, with its 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. He and bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno sought reaffirmation that the G-7 frowns on the currency gyrations that again sent the yen soaring against the dollar this month after Japan-U.S. Trade talks foundered. The G-7 welcomed Moscow's assurances of continued reform, reaffirmed the group's commitment to full implementation of support measures agreed to in Tokyo in April and July, urged Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to agree quickly on a loan accord and expressed a willingness to support a substantial new Russian debt rescheduling. Japan apparently got little overt help from its G-7 partners, which also include Britain, Canada, France and Italy. Also in Frankfurt were representatives from Moscow and the European Union. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Tokyo should "put in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen domestic demand, reduce its large trade surplus and open its markets" The chairman's statement lacks the reaffirmation that Japan sought of the G-7's formulaic call for exchange rates to reflect economic fundamentals and against erratic currency movements. Bentsen said currency issues got little attention at the G-7 meeting or in his preceding talks with Fujii. The yen surged after fruitless trade talks between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington on February 11 as currency dealers anticipated pressure from U.S. authorities for a higher yen, which hobbles Japan's export-reliant economy and theoretically blunts its trade surplus by pricing Japanese exports out of foreign markets. U.S. officials have denied any intention to toy with the foreign exchange market, but the G-7 skirted exchange rate comments and focused more blandly on general cooperation. Still, Fujii fell back on what he called the G-7's "long history of taking appropriate measures on rapid movements in currency rates with monetary authorities contacting each other." He told a press conference that Waigel "emphasized the continuation of this process." Central banker Mieno, who has repeatedly said that no clear signs of a Japanese economic recovery have appeared, said global improvements since the last G-7 meeting in September will have "favorable effects on Japan." But Japan's economic stimulus steps, already labeled skimpy by Washington, received less than warm praise Saturday from the IMF, which said the package will have limited effect on Tokyo's current account surplus. AP-Dow Jones said Managing Director Michel Camdessus presented an IMF report predicting that the surplus will dip to 130.3 billion dollars this year from 131.4 billion dollars in 1993, but then rise to 131.1 billion dollars in 1995, 140.9 billion dollars in 1996 and ease to 140.0 billion dollars in 1997. The report suggests that Japan's black ink with the world would differ little from those expectations, even without the 15.25 trillion yen pump-primer, AP-DJ said. Some 5.4 trillion yen of the stimulus package -- such as land purchases for public works projects and housing and small-enterprise loans -- will not directly spur the economy, the IMF report says. It says the package will nudge Japan's economy above what would have been no real growth this year but have minimal impact after that, with 1995 growth of 2.3 percent next year with or without the package. Indeed, without the package, the report charges, Japan's 1996 growth would have been 0.6 percentage point more than the predicted 4.0 percent, while 1997 will see 5.0 percent growth either way. Concerns also surfaced at the G-7 meeting over lack of Russian progress in stabilizing its economy, with the finance leaders urging Moscow to act to curb its fiscal deficit and inflation and promote credit creation.
