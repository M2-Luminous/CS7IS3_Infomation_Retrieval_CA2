The Netherlands infantry battalion in Bosnia is to dispatch for a temporary time a company to the northern part of the war zone to assist Scandinavian blue helmets. Over 100 Netherlands UN troops will be quartered at Tuzla airport for a couple of weeks and around 20 people will be stationed near Srebrenica in the north. Vermeulen has one company -- the Bravo Company -- in Srebrenica, which, in his opinion, is not enough to do its work properly. The Netherlands battalion originally was to have deployed two companies to Srebrenica and one to the nearby enclave of Zepa. In that village the Ukrainian UN troops are expected to extend their stay. Vermeulen says: "Bravo Company has to make a great effort to perform its assigned security and observation tasks." In his opinion, a second company is needed to relieve patrols and checkpoints more regularly. In addition, the situation around Zepa remains very tense. Therefore, Vermeulen plans to increase the number of observation points. The Scandinavian battalion is responsible for large parts of northern and eastern Bosnia. In this area there are various places where General Rose wants to eliminate the transportation problems. The official decision to change part of the Netherlands battalion's location still has not been made, but General Rose's order is expected any day now. The reopening of Tuzla Airport is vital to provide humanitarian aid, and it also should solve the problems of ensuring provisions to the Netherland battalion. Right now, the Dutch have to use a long and heavily used road to transport provisions from Split, Croatia to eastern Bosnia.
