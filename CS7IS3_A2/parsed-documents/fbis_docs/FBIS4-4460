Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the conference. The delegates evaluated the results of party-building work in accordance with the third midterm national party conference resolution and discussed measures to ensure that party organizations and party chapters fulfill two objectives satisfactorily; namely, building themselves into units that are firm, strong, and pure in terms of politics, ideology, and organization and satisfactorily carrying out their political role as advisers to the party Central Committee and state on matters related to the implementation of the renovation process. Regarding orientations and tasks for the next two years, the conference set forth the following main objectives: -- It is necessary to guide cadres and party members in satisfactorily directing the implementation of each agency's political tasks and intensifying efforts to make the party firm, strong, and pure. -- Steps must be taken to foil the peaceful evolution strategy and encourage everyone to contribute toward the successful implementation of the third midterm national party conference resolution. -- Measures must be adopted so that the entire party organization fully grasps all party resolutions and state policies and lines. -- Efforts are needed to build firm, strong, and pure party chapters in terms of both politics and organization. -- Positive steps must be taken to fulfill satisfactorily the party organization's advisory role in suggesting general leadership patterns. -- Special measures must be worked out to institutionalize party policies and lines aimed at building the socialist Vietnamese state into a law-governed state that belongs to, comes from, and works for the people. On behalf of the party Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi welcomed and commended the Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization for its achievements during the first half of its term. These achievements are positive contributions toward the common success of the renovation process and the implementation of the seventh party congress resolution. He stressed: Because of the fact that a large number of its personnel work with organs in charge of providing support services to the party Central Committee, state, National Assembly, and government agencies, the Central Agencies Bloc 1 party organization performs a very important role and has a very great duty to uphold. To be worthy of this important role and heavy responsibility, everyone must pay due attention to the task of making the party firm and strong in all fields. It is necessary to step up educational activities aimed at strengthening the ideological concepts of cadres and party members so they can firmly grasp the party organization's policies and lines and set a good example for others to follow. Practical plans must be worked out to help party members learn how to improve their professional skills and intellectual background as well as take the lead in the movement against corruption, waste, misappropriation of public funds, bribery, red tape, authoritarianism, and the tendency to distance oneself from the masses.
