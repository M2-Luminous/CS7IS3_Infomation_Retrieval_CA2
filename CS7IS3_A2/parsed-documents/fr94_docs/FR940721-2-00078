FR940721-2-00078 FR940721-2-00039 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [CA&hyph;060&hyph;4210&hyph;05] Intent to Amend the California Desert Conservation Area Plan AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 43 CFR 1610.2(a), notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management proposes to change the Multiple Use Classification from Class L to Class M for the following public lands: San Bernardino Meridian, Imperial County, California T. 16S., R. 16 E., Sec. 25, SE1/4NW1/4. DATES: Written comments on this proposed plan amendment will be accepted until August 22, 1994. Please address comments to G. Ben Koski, Area Manager, Bureau of Land Management, El Centro Resource Area, 1661 South 4th Street, El Centro, CA 92243. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Friedrich, El Centro Resource Area, 1661 South 4th Street, El Centro, California, 92243, (619) 353&hyph;1060. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of March 20, 1992 (Vol. 57, No. 55, p. 9743), a Notice of Intent was published initiating the 1992 Review of the California Desert Conservation Plan and inviting requests for amendments to the Plan from individuals, public and private organizations, and the Bureau's own observation. Those amendment proposals were included on the agenda at the public meeting of the California Desert District Advisory Council Meeting on June 3&hyph;4, 1992. A Notice was published in the Federal Register of May 22, 1992 (Vol. 57, No. 100, p. 21820) announcing the meeting. The proposal to reclassify the above-described land from Multiple Use Class L to Class M was presented at the meeting and no adverse comments were received. This Notice of Intent is being published to re-initiate the public scoping period. The forty-acre parcel described above is being considered for direct sale at fair market value to General Farm Investment Company, owner and operator of the farmland that borders three sides of this land. The subject land extends into the farming operations and is an obstacle to efficient farming and irrigating. Disposal would establish a more manageable ownership boundary benefiting both the Bureau of Land Management and General Farm. The proposed plan amendment and decision on disposal will be determined through environmental analysis in accordance with 43 CFR 1610.5&hyph;5. Dated: July 13, 1994. Jim Talent, Acting Area Manager.
