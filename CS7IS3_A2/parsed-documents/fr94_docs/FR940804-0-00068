FR940804-0-00068 FR940804-0-00022 Finally, the Act contains due dates by which the State is required to submit certain SIP's. The EPA does not believe that Congress established the 18-month period before mandatory sanctions must apply as a grace period in which States have a legal right under section 179 to submit SIP's after the relevant statutory due date. In fact, EPA interprets section 110(m) of the Act as providing EPA with the authority to ``*␣*␣* apply any of the sanctions listed in section 179(b) at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, disapproval, or determination under *␣*␣* section 179(a) *␣*␣*.'' Therefore, EPA is not precluded from taking more aggressive action than required under section 179 when States fail to correct deficient plans. 4. Other Areas of Comment This section addresses the remaining areas of the proposal where comment was received. a. Lack of Good Faith Determination. Under section 179(a), both the offset and highway sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State. In the proposal at page 51274, EPA indicated that any finding of a lack of good faith EPA makes under section 179(a) will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. One commenter believes that the final rule should define a ``lack of good faith'' and require application of both sanctions as a default where it exists. The commenter believes that some situations may require fact specific judgment, while others are so extreme that they presumptively prove the State has decided not to make a good faith effort at complying. The commenter believes that EPA need not undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking with respect to findings of a lack of good faith. Another commenter believes that the phrase ``if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State'' is subjective and ambiguous and needs defining. In response to the comments, EPA still believes findings of a lack of good faith under section 179(a) must be subject to notice-and-comment since it is a discretionary action which requires exercise of a substantial degree of judgment on EPA's part. The public should have an opportunity to comment on the basis for these actions. Further, EPA does not yet have a policy on how to further define the Act's language, or when and where it plans to make findings of a lack of good faith other than the case-by-case approach described above. The notice-and-comment rulemaking will provide an opportunity for the public to comment on EPA's interpretation of a lack of good faith in each case-specific circumstance. b. Sanction Timing. The proposal at page 51272 indicated that since section 179(a) provides for automatic sanction application once EPA has made the selection, under this sanction sequence rule sanctions will apply automatically in the order prescribed herein in all instances in which sanctions are applied following findings under section 179(a) (1)&hyph;(4) that EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to select a different sequence of sanction application. However, the proposal indicated that where the sanction clock expires for any findings before this action is final and effective and EPA has not taken independent sanction selection action, EPA interprets section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as this action. At page 51272 of the proposal EPA also indicated that EPA intends to notify States of the automatic sanctions by letter and publish a document in the Federal Register in which EPA amends the language of the rule to indicate areas subject to the applicable sanctions. The proposal provided that if removal of sanctions is warranted, EPA would notify the State that sanctions are being removed and amend the rule to reflect that. One commenter believes that EPA's interpretation of section 179 is incorrect and that section 179 unambiguously requires sanction application within 18 months of a finding. The commenter believes that Congress did not condition EPA's mandatory sanction application duty on completion of notice-and-comment rulemaking. The plain reading of section 179(a) is that sanctions, ``as selected by the Administrator,'' apply within certain prescribed timeframes. The section does not provide any guidance to EPA on sanction application sequence. Given this wide discretion, EPA believes that it is necessary for sanction selection to be subject to notice-and-comment in order to provide for public comment. The EPA interprets the phrase ``as selected by the Administrator'' as words of condition that must be met before mandatory sanctions apply. Indeed, EPA is undertaking this rulemaking to satisfy the conditional duty so that sanctions may apply automatically when sanctions clocks expire. The EPA is also conducting this rulemaking to eliminate the future need (except to reverse the sanction sequence) for individual rulemakings for every finding with respect to part D requirements. The EPA believes in the long run this action will facilitate smooth application of sanctions to encourage State compliance and protect air quality. c. Notice and Comment for Nonsubmittal and Incompleteness Findings. In the proposal at page 51272, EPA's view was that notice-and-comment is not required for findings of failure to submit because of insufficient time provided by the statute. Since EPA has less than 60 days to determine whether a State's submittal is complete, and it is impossible to provide notice-and-comment in 60 days, EPA believes that Congress clearly intended that EPA should not go through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making findings of failure to submit. Additionally, EPA argued that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit were subject to APA rulemaking procedures, EPA believed that the good cause exception to the rulemaking requirement applies (APA section 553(b)(B)). Section 553(b)(B)of the APA provides that EPA need not provide notice and an opportunity for comment if EPA determines that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The EPA argued that notice and comment for findings of failure to submit does not require any judgment on the part of EPA and, therefore, is unnecessary.
