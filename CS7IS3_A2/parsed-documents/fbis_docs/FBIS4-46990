Grain Procurement Prices Raised"] [Text] In order to increase the material incentive for producers to increase volumes of grain sales to the state and in order to save on the expenditure of hard currency funds on the acquisition of grain from abroad, and also taking into account the higher costs of material and technical resources and energy sources used on the farms, the growth of inflation, and the higher prices on the world market, the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers considered it expedient to adopt the proposals of the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Grain Products Company, and the Ministry of Economics to raise prices of grain from internal reserves. As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the Ministry of Agriculture, the average selling price of one tonne of grain from the 1994 crop sold to the state is 50,000 manats, a sevenfold increase over last year's prices. Taking into account the fact that priority in raising procurement prices has been given to hard and strong strains of wheat, the following prices have been set: for one tonne of hard wheat meeting requirements of class I--65,000 manats, of class II--62,000 manats, and of class III--55,000 manats; for strong and soft strains, regardless of class--48,000-53,000 manats; for one tonne of barley--46,000 manats, of corn--50,000 manats, and of peas for human consumption--94,000 manats. The ministry has prepared additional recommendations in order to increase the material incentive for machine operators and other workers to harvest the grain at optimal times and without losses. It is stipulated that each combine operator participating in the harvest may be issued as wages 50 manats and 10 kilograms of grain, and their assistants, 35 manats and 7 kilograms of grain for each tonne harvested; truck drivers are to be issued, in addition to their wages, one kilogram of grain for each tonne that is transported. Additionally, combine operators are to be paid bonuses in the amount of 1,500-2,500 manats, depending on the volume of grain reaped during the season. Ministry of Agriculture workers think that raising grain procurement prices will have a positive effect on strengthening the economies of the farms, will increase the material incentive for workers, and will make it possible to achieve an increase in the volumes of grain sold to the state.
