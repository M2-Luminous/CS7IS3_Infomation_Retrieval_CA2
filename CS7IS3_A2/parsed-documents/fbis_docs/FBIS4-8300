Summing up his discussion with the Romanian head of state and other officials, Willy Claes said that the political statement he signed in Bucharest offered a framework "comprehensive enough" to allow for the development of relations, especially legal and economic. The Belgian foreign minister said that when there are sufficient guarantees of stability in Romania, Belgian investors would not hesitate to do business in Romania. The same day, the Belgian foreign minister had an interview with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase, during which he said Western Europe did not intend to treat countries in Central and Eastern Europe differently than any others. Minister Willy Claes had to cut his Romanian visit short because of recent events in Rwanda which cost the lives of several Belgian UN officers stationed in that country. He left Romania in the afternoon of April 8.
