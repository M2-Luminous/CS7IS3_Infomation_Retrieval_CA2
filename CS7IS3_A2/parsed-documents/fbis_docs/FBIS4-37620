[Mordekhay] They have used Sagger missiles in the past. What we do find grave and unacceptable is that some of the gunfire came from inside houses, from inside inhabited areas in the outskirts of Tibnin. Their use of the civilian establishment, the residents, the houses, and the villages to shoot at us greatly contravenes previous understandings. [passage omitted]
