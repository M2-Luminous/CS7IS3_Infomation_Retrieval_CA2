North Korea stopped issuing visas to Japanese tourists one year ago when international tension began building up over its nuclear question. An official of Chukai Travel Co., a Japanese travel agent specializing in North Korea tours, said Tuesday, "a North Korean travel firm informed us in mid-May of a plan to accept Japanese tourists." He said his firm has been advertising for North Korea visitors. Japanese tourists are expected to enter North Korea by chartered plane via Beijing. "North Korea seems to have decided to resume accepting foreign tourists as international tension over the nuclear issue has begun to ease," a Japanese public security official said.
