At the meeting the president expressed his pleasure with the consultation, cooperation, and joint efforts of Iran and Pakistan in combatting the cursed phenomenon of narcotics on the common border and in the region. He also described as very positive the UN's support for the successful implementation of joint measures. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that over the past few years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been in the vanguard of the fight against contraband narcotics in the region. He stressed that the comprehensive fight against the big international narcotics gangs, which have advanced facilities and equipment, requires the cooperation and coordinated joint effort of all neighboring countries. The president said that the venomous propaganda by certain Western media, and even some institutes affiliated to the United Nations about Iran's efforts to fight the merchants of death stems from the infiltration of the world's propaganda centers by big international narcotics smuggling gangs. He said: While Iran is combatting the merchants of death in the region at great expense, certain so-called human rights institutions, with the help of their influential propaganda centers, paint Iran's humanitarian efforts with the same brush as their own political prejudices and describe the execution of narcotics smugglers as the execution of political dissidents and a contravention of human rights. He said: Iran will not deviate from its chosen path despite these allegations. Iran's law enforcement and military personnel will fight this cursed phenomenon with decisiveness and will support the actions of other countries in the matter. At the meeting, the UN executive under secretary-general and chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee expressed his pleasure at Iran's progress in the fight against narcotics. He said: In our inspection of the common border between Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, I and the team accompanying me saw the diligent efforts of Iran's law enforcement forces to combat the narcotics smugglers. We will place at the UN's disposal comprehensive information on those humanitarian efforts. He added: Iran's efforts in the matter should not only be praised by international forums but it should be presented to the rest of the world as a model. Supporting the joint efforts of Iran and Pakistan to combat narcotics smuggling, he said: There is no doubt that fighting this cursed global phenomenon, which causes murder, corrupts youngsters, and pollutes the environment requires all-round international effort. All other countries, particularly regional countries, must use Iran's and Pakistan's joint efforts as a model and continue their efforts to combat narcotics jointly and comprehensively. Later in the meeting, which was also attended by Interior Minister Besharati and a number of our country's law enforcement officials, the Pakistani interior minister thanked the Iranian authorities for their efforts in the fight against narcotics smuggling. He described his talks with his Iranian counterpart as very fruitful, and added: We hope that with the measures taken to safeguard the common border the fight against narcotics and the merchants of death will be continued even more seriously in the future.
