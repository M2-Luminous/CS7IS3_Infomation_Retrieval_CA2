FR940902-0-00065 FR940902-0-00010 Subpart F_Federal Handling of Non-criminal Complaints and Other Allegations A commenter recommended that the reference to the handling of discrimination complaints at 20 CFR 627.600 be made a separate paragraph. The Department agrees with this recommendation and is amending the final regulations to redesignate the first two sentences of §627.600 as paragraph (a), and the last sentence, pertaining to discrimination complaints, as paragraph (b). A commenter recommended revising §627.601, noting that section authorizes the receipt of complaints at the Federal level without mention of the statutory preconditions for such acceptance that are partially explained in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(5) of that section. Further, the commenter argued that although some of the preconditions for acceptance of a complaint at the Federal level appear in later sections of the regulations, §627.601, as written, is unauthorized by the Act and is misleading. The provisions at §627.601 are not intended, by themselves, to spell out all of the preconditions that apply to the various complaints and allegations that may be filed at the Federal level, but rather are intended to indicate the types of such complaints that may be received and the options available to the Secretary for the handling of such complaints. The provisions that apply to the Federal handling of non-criminal complaints and other allegations are set out in all of subpart F and must be viewed in their entirety to determine how they apply. The various sections in subpart F either include the preconditions for filing a complaint or cite other provisions of the Act and/or JTPA regulations which spell out such preconditions. The Department believes that the regulatory provisions are consistent with, and accurately reflect, the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. A commenter suggested that, under the provision at §627.601, the Governor does not have final determination authority in any complaint because the regulations specify that Federal level reviews may include all of paragraph (a), which includes any violation of the Act, and recommended that the final rule provide clarification in this area. The regulations, at §627.503(d), provide that, with the exception of complaints alleging violations of the labor standards at section 143 of the Act, the Governor's decision is final unless the Secretary exercises the authority for Federal-level review set forth at §627.601 of the interim final regulations. The provisions at §627.601(a) reserve the Secretary's authority to receive and review complaints alleging a specific violation of the Act and/or JTPA regulations, notwithstanding resolution of a complaint under procedures at a lower level. Upon receipt, the Secretary may handle such complaints, as set forth at paragraph (b) of that section. The Department believes that the regulations accurately reflect the Secretary's and Governor's authority in this area and that further clarification in the regulations is not needed. No change is made to the final rule. A commenter noted that, in the remedies available for labor standards violations, §627.603(c)(3) refers to ``back pay,'' and paragraph (d)(2) of that section refers to ``lost wages'' and asked for a definition of these terms. The interim final regulations incorporated the statutory language pertaining to remedies for labor standards violations at section 143(f) of the Act, which includes these two terms. The Department believes that, from a practical standpoint, there is no difference in these two terms. Both terms refer generically to ``compensation'' in the context of appropriate remedies; under paragraph (c)(3), wages are not an available remedy, while they are an available remedy under paragraph (d)(2). In applying a remedy, these terms would refer to the amount of compensation (excluding benefits which are separately provided for) that a person would have received had the violation not occurred. The Department believes that the regulations are sufficiently clear and that further clarification is not needed. No change is made to the final regulations. A commenter disagreed with the provision at §627.603(b)(4) which provides that there is no ALJ review of the Secretary's decision upholding the Governor's decision in complaints alleging section 143 labor standard violations. The Act, at section 144(d)(2), specifically provides that the Secretary may modify or reverse the Governor's decision on a complaint alleging a labor standards violation, or issue a decision if no decision has been issued, only after an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the Department of Labor. The opportunity for an ALJ hearing is limited to actions by the Secretary to change a Governor's decision or to issue a decision as provided for at section 144(d)(2) of the Act. The provisions at section 144(d)(3), pertaining to the Secretary upholding the Governor's decision, specifically state that the Secretary's decision ``shall become the final decision of the Secretary.'' The Department believes that the regulations accurately reflect, and implement, the provisions at section 144(d) of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations. No comments were received on §627.604 and no change is made to the final rule. A commenter recommended that under the provisions at §627.605, Special Federal review of SDA and SSG-level complaints without decision, where there has been no action on a complaint at the local level the Department should not only act on the individual complaint, but also conduct a thorough review of the administrative capabilities of the SDA/SSG. In addition, the Secretary should be prepared to impose more than just a sanction for failing to issue a complaint decision, but also impose corrective actions up to and including reorganization of the SDA/SSG. The provision at §627.605 pertains to actions that may be taken against the Governor for failing to provide a decision as required at §627.503(a) of the regulations. These actions may include imposing a sanction for failing to issue a decision pursuant to the provisions at §627.605(b). The right of the Secretary to review SDA/SSG operations for compliance with the Act and applicable JTPA regulations is reserved at §627.601(b) of the regulations. The Department believes that the regulations provide adequate and appropriate procedures for the handling of complaints alleging violations of the Act and JTPA regulations at the Federal, State, and SDA/SSG levels, consistent with implementing the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. A commenter indicated that there were two paragraphs (d) in §627.606. The second is now redesignated as paragraph (e). Another commented that the correct reference in §627.606(d)(2)(vii) should be subpart H. The final rule is corrected. Also, the heading of §627.606(c) is changed to read, `` Informal resolution ''.
