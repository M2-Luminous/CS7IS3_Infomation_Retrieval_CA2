The new abbreviation for this stern department now goes like this--FSK. Our correspondent met with the chairman of the Committee for State Security of the Republic of Tatarstan, V. Salimov. [Shcherbakova] Vener Asylgareyevich, was anybody left without a job after your department was reorganized? [Salimov] As far as I know there are about five people on the staff of the FSK today. And all the rest of us are outside the staffs. [Shcherbakova] Excuse me, but where do you personally stand now? Have you been fired too? [Salimov] No, we have not been fired. We are working as hard as ever. But we are all waiting for the time of our appointment to the appropriate positions. I personally have to present my vision of the structure of the future organ--my rights are restricted here. Republic leaders have the right, taking into account the situation that has developed, to make their own proposals regarding the formation of the structure, which by no means has to copy the central apparatus. Future workers will be appointed by the future manager of the new organ, and as for the manager himself...everything is in the hands of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. According to our Constitution, it determines the list of ministries, departments, and committees. It also has to decide whether or not our structure will remain a part of the Cabinet of Ministers and what it will be called. Possibly the territorial counterintelligence service. I will not have any objections. As they say, call us whatever you will...the important thing is the essence of our activity. I personally do not like the fact that our department's tasks have eroded over the past three years. Some people, including people's deputies, have had a great desire to direct the efforts of state security organs almost to carrying out militia tasks. [Shcherbakova] But you have also had programs in common.... [Salimov] And we still have them. But we take from them for action those issues that must be decided by Chekists and counterintelligence workers. With the appearance of the new statute, everything was put back into place and now our workers can breathe easy--they will finally be doing what they were taught to do. [Shcherbakova] Unfortunately, the statute itself is classified. [Salimov] And I do not dare to quote our main tasks from it. They include disclosure, prevention, and interception of subversive intelligence activity on the part of foreign special services and organizations against the Russian Federation. They include fighting terrorism, corruption, contraband operations, illegal trade in arms and narcotics, illegal armed formations, and also illegally created or banned social associations that encroach on the constitutional structure of the Russian Federation. They also include providing, within the limits of our authority, for the protection of the country's state secrets. And so forth. In brief, during the process of reorganization subdivisions are formed that will engage exclusively in professional activity--based on the tasks I mentioned to you. Fortunately, we have something to defend. [Shcherbakova] Yes, just take the military-industrial complex. It seems that the top departments have not yet been eliminated anywhere. [Salimov] Quite right. [Shcherbakova] But the times of sabotage and terrorist acts when enemies appeared everywhere seem to have passed.... [Salimov] But take the war in the Caucasus and reports about important communications being out of commission. I personally do not participate in the investigation of the events going on there, they are independent states, but according to the estimates of our specialists, all the signs of subversive acts are there. In our offices we analyze and predict the development of situations and take preventive measures not to allow such actions to occur here. Do not forget that we have vital facilities that are of immense importance! And if the water that comes into the sinks from immense reservoirs is poisoned or if during a 40-degree freeze the city ends up without electricity or heat, it makes no difference to the rank-and-file citizen who is responsible for the action--whether it was an assignment of a foreign special service or by the will of a sick person, a schizophrenic. And we must also predict the social explosions that could create a threat to the population. [Shcherbakova] So when it comes to predictions, are you an unofficial adviser to our president? [Salimov] No, he has plenty of advisers. But, naturally, I report my conclusions periodically. And if they are worthy of attention, the appropriate decisions, as a rule, are made. A recent example: An edict was adopted declaring it illegal to create militarized formations on the territory of the republic. It was partly on our initiative that this edict appeared. [Shcherbakova] How do you feel about the demands to place your department under the jurisdiction of Tatarstan? [Salimov] Today the KGB of the Republic of Tatarstan is wholly and completely guided by the norms of the law of the Russian Federation. Today we are no longer a law enforcement organ, we are purely a special service, counterintelligence. Training specialists for our service is a very costly matter. If they were to make an ill-considered decision to transfer us to the jurisdiction of Tatarstan, this service would be doomed to complete inaction. And then, since we are physically located in the center of Russia, whom would we work against? [Shcherbakova] Do you think that the shakeup of your department has finally ended and that you will now engage exclusively in counterintelligence work? [Salimov] We would like to hope that. The activity of the FSK is by no means directed toward encroachment on the legal rights of citizens as envisioned by the Constitution. At the same time, it will make it possible to solve basic problems more efficiently and on a higher professional level. Note that last year alone several dozen citizens were exposed (including state bureaucrats--editor's note) who had been recruited by foreign special services. This shows that subversive counterintelligence activity has become much more active. The conditions for this are more favorable than ever before. Many components of the Russian Federation have been given the right to conduct foreign economic activity independently. Leaders of joint-stock companies and retail firms have direct connections with foreign partners. But they have no experience! The corresponding legislative base is not in place either. Until recently we did not even have laws on state secrets or state borders. [Shcherbakova] But let us say that there were new elections of parliament and the president, would the situation change.... [Salimov] Let us not guess about the distant future. And anyway in the near future, in keeping with the new statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service...we will be able to organize our own work. Workers of our department are quite satisfied: The time of vagueness and the time of doubts has passed. The tasks have been earmarked. Let us work.
