"Gitarama is in the hands of the RPF (the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front)," UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by telephone from Rwanda's capital Kigali. The capture of Gitarama puts all-out victory within the rebels' grasp after a two-month offensive, analysts said. Gitarama was the seat of a rump government proclaimed after the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspected rocket attack on his plane. The RPF seized the town from Army soldiers and militiamen on Sunday. Habyarimana's death rekindled civil war and sparked ethnic and political massacres in which up to half a million people were killed. The guns fell silent in Kigali on Wednesday after a ceasefire announcement, but Mehu could not confirm whether the truce was holding.
