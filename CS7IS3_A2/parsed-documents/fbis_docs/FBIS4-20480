Because animal growth is controlled by the secretion of growth hormone (GH), which is in turn controlled by the inhibition of somatostatin. Since Chinese researchers failed their first attempt to obtain a genetic engineering somatostatin subunit vaccine through expression of somatostatin gene in E. coli, they therefore switched their attention to the use of live vectors, the vaccinia viruses. They first fused ss gene with HBsAg gene, then used the ss antigen-carrying HBsAg gene to construct a recombinant vaccinia virus. When the recombinant vaccinia virus is used to directly immunize animals, the ss antigen expressed in animal bodies induces immune response to neutralize the ss antigen, and animal growth is therefore promoted. The vaccine is believed to be the first genetic engineering product worldwide for animal (livestock) growth promotion.
