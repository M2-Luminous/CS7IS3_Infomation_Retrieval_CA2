Hosokawa has been trying to get rid of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top government spokesman and leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), for openly challenging his plans to introduce a national welfare tax, political sources said. "The prime minister said he would like to carry out a cabinet reshuffle if conditions permit," Takemura said at an afternoon press conference, adding he reiterated his opposition to a cabinet change. The sources said the two men also have been at odds over the course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa favoring closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito and Takemura against it. [passage omitted containing previously filed material] SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama restated his opposition to an immediate reshuffle, saying Diet passage of the national budget for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1 should be the top priority. "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet as quickly as possible," he told a news conference. He said Hosokawa "should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up at this time." Hosokawa is scheduled to deliver his policy speech to the Diet on Friday, and sources close to the 56-year-old premier said he hopes to reshuffle his near seven-month-old cabinet by then. Hosokawa and his supporters in the coalition reportedly favor replacing Takemura in addition to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii due to a money scandal and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai because of a dispute with bureaucrats over the firing of Masahisa Naito, chief of the ministry's industrial policy bureau. Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, is also likely to be relieved of her duties, sources said. Murayama of the SDP, the largest force in the coalition, said he will reiterate his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday. He said it should wait until after the budget program wins Diet approval. The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to give up his plan for an immediate changeover. Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet, Murayama replied that he has not given serious thought to such a possibility, saying, "I haven't heard any such proposal at all." Hosokawa told a House of Representatives panel on political reform that the government has time to change the cabinet because it has overcome its most difficult tasks -- political reform and completing the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's Diet affairs committee, told a news conference the SDP opposes a reshuffle. "We believe now is not an appropriate time," he said. He also said it is better to wait until after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 state budget, expected in early May. Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out political reforms, and apparently thinks the cabinet will have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in January. Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata said he understands moves to remove Takemura from his present post, adding that a party head assuming the post of chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in helping a prime minister as a close aide in the coalition government. Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime minister's views, as they belong to different parties. For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of chief cabinet secretary.
