And if the United States is playing its role as a full partner, if it really is committed to the principles of the peace process, it should persuade Israel of these principles. In practice it should find no difficulty in persuading Israel. Because by virtue of its relationship with Israel and by virtue of the nature of that relationship it is capable of making Israel's rulers respect international legitimacy and comply with the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. A Syrian official said that the United States has precedents in this connection. After the tripartite aggression in 1956 it was able to force Israel to relinquish Sinai one week after the Knesset decision. Because then-U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower took an influential position that persuaded Israel. If U.S. President Bill Clinton were willing to do the same today with regard to the Golan, the peace process would move in the required direction. But Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator for the peace process, has become a promoter of concessions to those violating international legitimacy -- which is not in line with the interests of peace or with the characteristics of the full partner that the United States claims to be. The official said that Syria is still and will remain committed to the peace process and its foundations. All the evidence proves that it is seeking peace. This is a Syrian strategy, not a diplomatic game or a transient propaganda campaign. It will continue to cooperate with the United States as long as the United States continues to respect the basis of the peace process and the resolutions of international legitimacy. The problem is still not with Syria but with Israel, the U.S. position on Israel, and the lack of a serious, influential, fair, and responsible role. The official added that Israeli logic, which differs from any other logic, will push the Middle East region into a new whirlpool of escalation, tension, wars, and bloodshed. On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region, the official said that the problem lies not in whether Christopher should come to the region or not, but rather in whether the United States demonstrates commitment to the full role it has chosen for itself. This role was not a Syrian invention or demand; it was a U.S. idea. Asked whether Syria will agree to receive Christopher during the tour now in preparation, the official said: We are always willing to acquaint ourselves with whatever new baggage Christopher may be carrying, because we are seeking to achieve a real peace. If Christopher carries with him Israeli proposals that achieve the basic requirements of the peace process, there is no problem in joining the negotiations. However, we urge the United States to commit itself and adhere to the UN resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy. In this context we do not accept that there should be any room for any neutral approach or for acting merely as a mailman: Either Washington is with international legitimacy, or it is not. He added that the problem is not between Syria and the United States; the problem is with the Israeli position. And Syria is looking forward to hearing the Israeli proposals that Christopher might carry with him during his announced tour. These proposals should fall within a new framework so that the peace process can advance. He said that Syria has not yet been informed of the date of Christopher's arrival in the region. The official pointed to the existing full coordination between Syria and Lebanon, saying that the two tracks will not diverge, that the efforts being made to separate the two tracks from one another will fail; and that the Lebanese resistance will continue to fight until the land has been liberated.
