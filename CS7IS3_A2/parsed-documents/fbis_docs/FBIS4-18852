As expected, the commissioner's study focused mainly on relations with Russia. This was based on discussion notes by Mr. Christophersen, Sir Leon Brittan, and Mr. Van den Broek and on a memorandum on industrial policy by Mr. Bangemann (who is in the United States), as well as technical annexes. Although no information was made public on the results of the seminar, EUROPE has reason to believe that: - All of the Commissioners who spoke felt that it was not realistic for Russia or the other CIS Republics to consider joining the European Union [EU]; - Therefore, efforts should focus on how cooperation between the [European] Union and these countries can be strengthened; - Economic cooperation should be both bilateral (by means of different agreements the Union has already concluded or is envisaging with the different republics) and multilateral in nature, notably through improvement of the TACIS programme [Technical Assistance Program for the Republics of the Former U.S.S.R.]. This programme should be made multiannual; - Political cooperation should include stepped-up political dialogue, which, in particular with Russia, should be wide-ranging and systematic; - A certain degree of cooperation should not be excluded in areas covered by the "third pillar" of the Treaty of Maastricht (home and justice affairs) in specific sectors, such as efforts to combat drugs and organized crime and monitoring of the recycling of dirty money. Several commissioners highlighted the scope of industrial cooperation (see the example of aluminium with Russia) and scientific cooperation.
