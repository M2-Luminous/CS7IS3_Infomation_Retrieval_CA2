FR941230-0-00037 FR941230-0-00008 INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION 19 CFR Part 210 Procedures for Investigations and Related Proceedings Concerning Unfair Practices in Import Trade AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Interim rules and request for comment. SUMMARY: The Commission is amending certain rules of practice and procedure to implement amendments to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 enacted by Congress as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. By implementing the law, the rules bring U.S. procedures into conformity with national treatment obligations under GATT, while providing for the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights at the border. DATES: The effective date of the interim rules is January 1, 1995, the date on which the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, unless the United States Trade Representative announces prior to that date that the WTO Agreement will not enter into force on that date. Should the effective date not be January 1, 1995, the Commission will publish notice to such effect in the Federal Register . These interim rules apply to section 337 complaints filed on or after the effective date. Comments on these interim rules will be considered if received by March 30, 1995. ADDRESSES: A signed original and 14 copies of each set of comments, along with a cover letter addressed to Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary, should be sent to the U.S. International Trade Commission, Office of the Secretary, room 112, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul A. Newhouse, Esq., Office of the Administrative Law Judges, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2699. Hearing-impaired individuals can obtain information on the final rules by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal at 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1989, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) adopted a report finding that USITC procedures in investigations under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 violated GATT ``national treatment'' rules. The report listed several ways in which imported goods are treated less favorably in Commission investigations than domestic goods are treated in district court infringement cases. In the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Congress amended section 337 to bring USITC procedures into compliance with the GATT ``national treatment'' rules. See H. Rep. No. 103&hyph;826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 140&hyph;142 (1994). The amendments, and the interim rule revisions that follow, focus on changes in four areas that respond to GATT criticisms: time limits for concluding an investigation have been eliminated and a procedure for establishing a ``target date'' for completion has been adopted instead; respondents are given the opportunity to stay parallel actions in district court while a Commission investigation is proceeding; the Commission's record may be used subsequently in the district court; limitations are placed on the Commission's ability to issue ``general'' exclusion orders; and respondents are permitted to file counterclaims at the Commission; these claims will be heard by a district court, but the same subject matter may be considered as part of an affirmative defense at the Commission. Other amendments bring Commission practice into closer conformity with district court practice with respect to bonding requirements and the deference accorded to arbitration agreements. The Procedure for Adopting Interim Rules The URAA was enacted on December 8, 1994. This legislation contains provisions which, inter alia, amend section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337). The Commission's rules concerning Section 337 practice and procedure need to be amended to conform to the new legislation. Commission rules to implement new legislation ordinarily are promulgated in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. ), which entails the following steps: (1) Publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) solicitation of public comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and (4) publication of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could not be utilized in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1994, and will become effective, with respect to the amendments to section 337 of the Act, on January 1, 1995, the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, unless the United States Trade Representative announces prior to that date that the WTO Agreement will not enter into force on that date. These interim rules apply to section 337 complaints filed on or after the effective date. It was consequently not possible to complete the section 553 rulemaking procedure prior to the effective date of the new legislation.
