According to the opposition, the government not only has no ideas for changes, but it outright reaffirms the ways of the old Polish People's Republic [PRL]. A majority of the parties is against abandoning the reforms. On Friday [20 May], Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak accepted the resignation of Minister Michal Kulesza from the post of the government's plenipotentiary for reforms of public administration. Kulesza announced his resignation from the post a week earlier in Poznan, during a Second All-Poland Conference of Territorial Self- Governments. "The reason for my resignation is the current government's decision to slow down the work on reforming the country's administration" -- Kulesza said this past Saturday. "The governing coalition has no plans for any kind of system-wide transformations of the state, it ignores self-governments, it is against powiats [small administrative units], and it strives to achieve centralized management." According to the former minister, the government not only has no vision or plans for changes, but it outright proposes a return to solutions deriving from the PRL period. This is demonstrated by draft laws being prepared by Michal Strak, chief of the Council of Ministers' Office [URM], on URM, on governmental and territorial administration, on employees of state offices (an amendment to the 1982 law), and a superficial law on state civil service. "I cannot reconcile a loyalty towards the government with a faithfulness toward a program of decentralization and reforms of public administration" -- Kulesza says. "I do not want to be responsible for disassembling the program of reforms." In a statement issued to journalists, the former minister said that decentralization is required in Poland because an overly centralized state is managed inefficiently, with taxpayer money being spent irrationally, and at times it is even outright wasted. The current governing team is returning not just to the old personnel, but also to the old way of thinking, as exemplified by the practice of "booty sharing" which was introduced in the clerical sector of the territorial administration. "There are many marvelous mayors and chief officers of groups of villages [wojtowie] in the Polish Peasant Party, whose managerial skills are as good as those of wojtowie coming form other parties" -- Kulesza told journalists. "The misfortune is about the fact that is not they that are the intellectual basis for the party's leadership, and that it is an apparatus which strives only at strengthening its own position that has the upper hand in the party." In Kulesza's view, the other participant in the coalition -- the Democratic Left Alliance -- does not transform its reform-oriented program into specific measures. The former plenipotentiary expressed his concern over the subsequent fate of some draft laws which were prepared by his office -- these concern public orders [zamowienia publiczne], economic activities by gminas [small administrative units], and self-governmental appeal collegia.
