He is calling for a "cultural revolution" in the arms industry to prevent "structural disarmament." [Garraud] The government is counting on the enterprises to improve their productivity by 2 percent in order to successfully implement the Military Programming Law. Does this strike you as feasible? [Conze] I am satisfied by this measure. What is being asked for is 2 percent in addition to the normal productivity increases by enterprises through better coordination of all the actions of the general staffs, the DGA, and the industrialists, who all have to adopt new directions. This measure was necessary because we were coming up against a brick wall. If we had remained with the bad habits which have existed for decades, we were heading for structural disarmament. Spending on equipment between 1980 and the year 2000 has been virtually constant at around 100 billion francs [Fr] at the 1994 value. What is the cost of a helicopter, a plane, a frigate in 1980 and the year 2004? Between these two dates, the ratio is one to three. This means that in the year 2020, we will have one-third of the number of fighter planes, helicopters... We therefore had to get out of this structural disarmament and start to make an effort, launch a cultural revolution which must be continued. [Garraud] Will this imply less sophistication in the new equipment, like the future NH-90 helicopter or the Rafale plane? [Conze] The NH-90 will be radically reviewed in cooperation with our partners. With regard to the Rafale, we will make a new analysis of the costs. We will ask ourselves certain questions again to ensure that the plane corresponds as closely as possible to Air Force requirements, at the lowest possible cost. I cannot predict the answers. For decades we gave priority to performance at all costs. As we go into the new millenium, the problem is presented in different terms. [Garraud] How have the industrialists reacted? [Conze] It will take time for the message to be understood. On a fairly large number of programs now being implemented, we will very shortly have to make a functional analysis and an analysis of the value of these programs. The aim is once again to ask ourselves the question: Are all the functions stipulated for the product still valid? But the further advanced the program is, the more difficult it is to change it. I do not want to frighten anybody, but we will be faced with choices on a number of programs. [Garraud] Some deputies of the majority think that the DGA's intervention in the programs is too costly... [Conze] The cost of the DGA's intervention is 10 percent of equipment spending. Five percent is devoted to the actual functioning of the DGA. The other 5 percent corresponds to the DGA's intervention in the sphere of tests, evaluation, monitoring, and program expertise. It is justified by the advantages gained by having a capacity for opposition to industrialists, who are often in the position of having a monopoly. This does not mean that there is no need to make an effort to reduce this intervention cost. Henceforth the program directors will establish contractual relations with the DGA centers to see whether this intervention is necessary and whether, here too, productivity cannot be improved. [Garraud] Some people suggest that the DGA should abandon its role as project manager in many programs. Are you considering that? [Conze] We are wondering about it. Project management is not one of the DGA's responsibilities, but in practice it took this role when, 25 years ago, General de Gaulle launched major programs and France had neither the technologies nor the industrial network to implement them. Thus, the DGA often has a project management role in practice rather than in law: We have built strategic missiles, tactical missiles, and so forth. The project management and technological capabilities now exist in industry. We must continue to develop and transfer to industry as much know-how as possible on the equipment which they are manufacturing. This is not so easy. There is a happy medium to be found between project management responsibilities and the industrial policy which is the DGA's responsibility. The move toward less intervention by the DGA will therefore be slow.
