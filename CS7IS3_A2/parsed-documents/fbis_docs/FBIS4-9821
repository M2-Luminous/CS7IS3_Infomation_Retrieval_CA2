Specialists contend that this is a key factor in the reform because judges are responsible for handing down decisions and bringing prestige to their offices. The system used to appoint judges has been one of the most controversial issues concerning the judicial career, as well as a topic that has been widely debated in the nation. Political interference has caused considerable damage in this respect. Background In accordance with Article 223 of the 1933 Constitution, the Judicial Branch Organizational Law provided that "the performance and qualifications of first instance and appellate court judges will be evaluated every five years by the Supreme Court, which, acting as a jury and after conducting the inquiries it might deem appropriate, may dismiss any judge from office..." It should be noted that the only time an evaluation was conducted in accordance with that law was in 1966. No further attempt to evaluate magistrates has been made since that year. Later, a decree-law issued in December 1969 by the military dictatorship provided for a special confirmation in office of judges (based, of course, on criteria advocated by the government at that time). Later, the 1979 Constitution established that Supreme Court justices must be confirmed by the Senate and that all other lower-ranking magistrates must be confirmed by the Supreme Court plenum. The 1979 Constitution did not provide for the periodical confirmation of judges. Prospects The new Constitution has entrusted the National Council for Magistrates (CNM) with the task of selecting and appointing judges and prosecutors. Until the CNM is organized, its functions will be exercised by the Disciplinary Board for Magistrates. Specialists contend that the CNM organizational law should include the requirement of periodical evaluations based on established guidelines for each level. In this respect it should be noted that the Judicial Branch Organizational Law establishes clear, precise guidelines for evaluating the merits of judges, namely the timely and correct disposition of cases, moral integrity, the lack of sanctions or disciplinary measures, duly accredited academic degrees and training studies, publication of legal papers, awards, and decorations. Therefore, there can be no argument against establishing the requirement for periodical evaluations in the CNM organizational law, especially considering that the evaluation is to be conducted by an independent, nonpolitical body. Impact of the New Procedural Codes In earlier reports we stated that our procedural laws are being rapidly modernized through the Code of Civil Procedures, the Code for Minors, and the imminent implementation of the Code of Penal Procedures. Specialists have argued that the "pro-code" mentality that prevails among judges and that is taught in our law schools is not the most appropriate one for implementing the new procedures. In fact, our judges have always preferred to go to trial instead of promoting conciliation between contending parties. As we reported earlier, judges now are required to seek conciliation, because if they fail to do so the procedure may be nullified. But what happens when judges have been trained for litigation and for applying laws instead of administering justice conscientiously and equitably? A civil judge said: What could happen is that conciliation may become a pro forma, pointless procedure because the judge is not prepared to bring litigants together. In this context, there is an undeniable truth: Law schools' curricula must be reformed to conform to the new procedural trends. Academy for Magistrates The creation of a judicial school for higher studies, which had been proposed in every reform initiative for decades, was incorporated in the new Constitution. An organizational law -- which should be proposed by the judicial branch -- now is required to outline its objectives and functions. Through this institution, which will make it possible to implement a policy of steadily training judges and prosecutors and to promote discussions on the administration of justice in our country, the Peruvian justice system will have the chance of measuring up to the judicial branches of other countries. In this respect, it has been reported that the judicial branch manager went to the United States in October to negotiate an agreement with the vice rector of Harvard University whereby the latter would support the future academy for magistrates. A well-informed source said: "The objective is to create a legal school similar to ESAN [School of Business Administration]." It also has been learned that the judicial executive council is drafting the bylaws for the academy and all that remains to be done is to remodel a recreational center in Chaclacayo that formerly belonged to the Popular Bank. In his book "Alternative Justice," specialist Alberto Bustamente states his opposition to the idea that the academy should be the only institution charged with training judges and prosecutors for selection and appointment purposes. He contends that this will pose the risk of allowing a single institution to monopolize the training of magistrates on the basis of its own ideologies, and this procedure would entail going back many decades as far as training techniques is concerned. He believes every law faculty should be prepared to give these training courses so there will be several trends of thought in the law. Another decisive factor in the judicial career crisis is salaries. In a previous report, we reported that the monthly salary of Supreme Court justice amounts to only 3,800 soles (less than $2,000), while their counterparts in other countries earn an average of $5,000 monthly. The Judicial Branch Organizational Law establishes that a superior court member should earn 90 percent of the income of a Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,400 soles. The reality is quite different: He makes only 1,600 soles. In the case of criminal, civil, and other judges, the law provides that their salaries should be equivalent to 80 percent of the salary of a Supreme Court justice; that is, 3,000 soles. In reality, they only make 1,100 soles. Justices of the peace with law degrees should earn 2,600 soles, but they only make 700 soles. Conclusions The solution to the judicial career crisis requires actions by several institutions, from the CNM to law faculties. One of the key reform topics is to include the requirement for a periodical evaluation in the future CNM organizational law -- based on merit guidelines -- for confirmation and promotion purposes. Thus, annual evaluation panels will become true national events. Additionally, law schools' curricula must be reformed to conform to the new role assigned to judges in accordance with procedural codes. This job must be coordinated with the Academy for Magistrates. Finally, there will be no judicial career reform if the current salaries are not increased.
