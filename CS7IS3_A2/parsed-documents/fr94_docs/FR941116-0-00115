FR941116-0-00115 FR941116-0-00022 Under the options program, CCC entered into contracts with eligible producers who (1) agreed to purchase at least one CBOT put option for their chosen commodity, and (2) agreed to forgo other program benefits on any enrolled bushels. Producers were reimbursed by CCC for the cost of the premium for purchasing the put option and received an incentive payment of 15 cents or 5 cents per enrolled bushel for participating in the program, depending on whether producers enrolled at the target price equivalent level or the price support equivalent level, respectively. The enrollment period for this program was March 1 through April 30, 1993. This program was available to corn producers in nine counties in three States: Champaign, Logan, and Shelby Counties in Illinois; Carroll, Clinton, and Tippecanoe Counties in Indiana; and Boone, Grundy, and Hardin Counties in Iowa. In the three Illinois counties, wheat and soybean producers could also participate. Producers were required to participate in the annual ARP for corn and wheat to be eligible for the options program on those commodities. Soybean producers must have accurately reported their soybean plantings in order to be eligible to participate. Participation Choices Producers could participate in the options program at levels that are alternatives to either (1) deficiency payments and loan program protection, or (2) loan program protection. Producers who chose the ``deficiency payments'' alternative enrolled production in the options program as ``target price bushels'' and agreed to forgo deficiency payments, price support benefits, and loan deficiency payments on any enrolled bushels. Producers who chose the ``loan program protection'' alternative enrolled production in the options program as ``price support bushels'' and agreed to forego price support benefits and loan deficiency payments on any enrolled bushels. Production could have been enrolled at either the target price or price support level, but not both. However, a producer could enroll some production at each level. Premiums and Incentives Producers participating in the options program received: (1) A subsidy to cover the cost of the premium for the purchase of the put option(s), and (2) An incentive payment of 15 cents per bushel on target price bushels, or 5 cents per bushel on price support bushels. Target Price Participation Corn participants were required to purchase at least one CBOT December 1993 corn put option contract (5,000 bushels) at a strike price equivalent to the $2.75 per bushel target price on or before June 15, 1993. Wheat participants were required to purchase at least one CBOT September 1993 wheat put option contract (5,000 bushels) at a strike price equivalent to the $4 per bushel target price on or before May 15, 1993. Price Support Participation Corn participants were required to purchase at least one CBOT March 1994 corn put option contract at a strike price equivalent to the county price support price for corn. Wheat participants were required to purchase at least one CBOT December 1993 wheat put option contract at a strike price equivalent to the county price support price for wheat. Soybean participants were required to purchase at least one CBOT March 1994 soybean put option contract at a strike price equivalent to the county soybean price support price, minus the 2 percent loan origination fee. Put options at the price support level could be purchased until the options expired, beginning at harvest of the crop (at the time the crop was otherwise eligible to be placed under loan). The Secretary determined that the strike price equivalent to the county price support price for all nine counties was $2 per bushel for corn, $2.90 per bushel for wheat, and $5.50 per bushel for soybeans.
