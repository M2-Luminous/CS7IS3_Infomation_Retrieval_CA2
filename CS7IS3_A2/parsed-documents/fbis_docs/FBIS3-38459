FBIS3-38459 "drweu023_i_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 FRANCE Fishermen Greet Government Package `With Skepticism' AU0202192794 Paris AFP in English 1858 GMT 2 Feb 94 AU0202192794 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The French Government announced aid totalling 300 million francs ($50 million) to the fishing industry Wednesday [2 February] after violent protests by fishermen protesting at low prices for their catches. Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech told fishermen's representatives here they could have half in grants and half in low-interest loans, with 10 million francs released immediately for families in the most difficulty. Puech also said all fishing firms would have their welfare charges cut by half, at an estimated total cost of 83 million francs, and added that he had asked the European Community to fix minimum prices for seven species of fish. French fishermen on the west coast have kept their boats in port and staged frequent clashes with police since their protests came to a head last weekend as fish prices fell to an all-time low. They have said that by Monday all fish markets would be closed, with nothing to auction. Wednesday's handouts came before a scheduled meeting between Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Puech with fishermen at Rennes, the Brittany capital, on Friday, when they had been promised a stormy reception. In the north Brittany port of Roscoff late Tuesday some 100 fishermen and their wives seized and dumped crates of Scottish fish that had arrived by ferry from Plymouth, southern England, police said Wednesday. Further south, in Lorient, fishermen sacked refrigerated warehouses in violent clashes which injured 17 police. Nine protestors were arrested and released only after a battle at the police station where they were being held. In Brussels a European Commission spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the commission does not intend any immediate reestablishment of minimum import prices for certain fish species, since no European Community member had requested such a move. Such minimum prices were set for the March-December period last year for six species, while a minimum price for Atlantic salmon was applied from mid-November last year until January 31 this year. The spokesman said no member had supplied the commission with figures showing a marked drop in market prices for one or more species. At the most recent meeting of EC fishing ministers, held in December, the commission pledged to reintroduce such minimum prices as soon as circumstances called for it. The EC fishing ministers are not scheduled to meet again until April 12. Speaking after a cabinet meeting here earlier Wednesday, Puech conceded that fish prices had "fallen sharply" and that the situation was "very difficult." "Emergency measures" are needed, he said, adding: "The government will actively support this sector." The government announcement also came as Brittany fishermen were heading for a mass demonstration Thursday in the channel port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, the main port for fish imports. The strikers voted to allow ferries to continue operating provided they carry no fish. Breton fishermen greeted Puech's package with skepticism late Wednesday, saying that it would make little difference.
