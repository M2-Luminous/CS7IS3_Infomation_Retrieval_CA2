FR940119-2-00099 FR940119-2-00069 Launches will either be licensed by DOT's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST) or carried out by the U.S. Government on its own behalf. OCST licenses commercial space launches in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, as amended (49 U.S.C. App. 2601 et seq. ) (the Act). OCST exercises regulatory authority over launches of launch vehicles to ensure the protection of public health and safety, the safety of property, and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. To obtain a license from OCST, an applicant, such as OSC, must demonstrate that it is capable of conducting launch related operations safely and responsibly. Launches carried out by the U.S. Government on its own behalf are not subject to the Act and, accordingly, are not licensed by OCST. In those instances, the FAA would continue to exercise regulatory authority over the civil aircraft and the U.S. Government would be responsible for launch operations. While the carrier aircraft/ALV combination will be capable of operating out of many locations worldwide and then launching an ALV, the takeoff and landing operations may be limited to certain military, government, or selected civil airports. FAR 91.313(e) places the following constraints upon operation of restricted category aircraft: ``Except when operating in accordance with the terms and conditions of a certificate of waiver or special operating limitations issued by the Administrator, no person may operate a restricted category civil aircraft within the U.S._(1) Over a densely populated area; (2) In a congested airway; or (3) Near a busy airport where passenger transport operations are conducted.'' Orbital Sciences Corporation's current proposal is to release the ALV over the ocean but, in some circumstances, OSC may apply to release the ALV over land. During a typical operation, the pilot would release the ALV after the carrier aircraft climbs past 38,000 feet above sea level. After falling away from the carrier aircraft, the ALV rocket motor would ignite and carry the payload into the desired orbital or sub-orbital trajectory. After each rocket stage exhausts its fuel, the spent stage drops from the ALV. Depending on the ALV's altitude, the spent rocket stage would either drop back to the earth's surface, burn up in atmospheric reentry, or enter orbit. During ferry flights and launch operations, OSC proposes to use safety inhibits to keep the ALV in a safe condition and protect the carrier aircraft and persons or property on the ground from inadvertent rocket ignition or other hazardous events. In addition, OSC proposes to use mechanical safety inhibits to inhibit inadvertent rocket ignition while the ALV remains attached to the carrier aircraft. OCS will protect the ALV release mechanism on the carrier aircraft to ensure that the pilot cannot inadvertently release the ALV. OSC has proposed placing a launch control operator on the carrier aircraft to continuously monitor the ALV's status and to ensure that the safety inhibits remain in place using carrier aircraft and ALV instrumentation. Safety inhibits are not removed from the motor and other critical circuits until after the pilot releases the ALV and it has dropped clear of the aircraft. OSC must plan the carrier aircraft flight routes for both ferry and launch operations to minimize the risk to public safety and the flight routes must be approved by the FAA.
