Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, chaired and addressed the meeting. Wu Liji, chairman of the regional government, made a report on relaying these guidelines. Present at the meeting were Wang Zhan, Wuyunqimuge, leaders of several regional-level leading bodies, and the veteran comrades who have been working in the region for a long period of time. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in his speech: Comrade Wu Liji's report on relaying the guidelines of the "two national sessions," the central rural work conference, and the national family planning work forum, as well as his opinions on the next-step work made according to the region's realities, are of extreme importance, are major issues relating to the overall situation, and are related to not only the current situation characterized by stability and unity, but also the region's long-term development; and embody the central 20-character policy of "grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability." Comrade Wang Qun said: The state has paid full attention to Inner Mongolia's development. We have reported to the central authorities on the economic development strategies of Inner Mongolia and our region's plan and projects. The state completely agreed to it. This embodies the central authorities' concern over and assistance to Inner Mongolia and the border areas inhabited by minority nationalities in northwest China. We may see that the state has shifted the focus of the economic development strategy on the western areas. Inner Mongolia has very good prospects for development. The reserve strength for our development is heartening. Comrade Wang Qun emphatically pointed out after analyzing and introducing the current international situation: The central policy on reform, development, and stability stands for the strong aspirations and basic interests of the people of various nationalities. All of our work should be submitted to and serve this policy. We should unswervingly achieve the work in various aspects but never do things that are not conducive to the overall situation. Our region has this tradition and this kind of foundation and conditions. The current situation is very good. However, there are still many problems. The main factors affecting unity and stability are problems concerning prices of goods; wages; small, poor, and money-losing enterprises; enterprises whose production is completely or partially suspended; corruption; and social order. These are the problems that the broad masses of the cadres and the masses are concerned with. The party committees, governments, and leading cadres at various levels should pay high attention to and conscientiously solve these problems so as to make the people satisfied. We must understand that the problems we come across are ones cropping up in the course of advancement and development. For instance, we should try every possible means to solve the problems concerning wages. However, we should clearly understand the problems relating to our understanding. Some localities are unable to issue, according to schedule, sufficient amounts of wages. This is not caused by our economic situation but by various factors such as excessively increasing expenses and providing for a excessively large number of people. These problems are ones essentially cropping up in the course of reform and development. Through collective study, the regional party committee maintained that the wages can be issued if efforts are made to carry out the wage reform. We are confident of this. We are also going to extensively solicit opinions on this issue. I hope that all of you, including veteran comrades and democratic party comrades, will make opinions. By so doing will we be able to seek unity of thinking and work with one heart and soul to make development. In his speech, Comrade Wang Qun set forth his new ideas, methods, and specific opinions on enterprises' deficits, goods prices, opposition to corruption, and overall improvement of social order. He stressed that we should use new ideas and methods to solve the problems cropping up in the course of development and use the methods of expanding the dynamics of reform and opening up to solve these problems instead of adopting a wait-and-see attitude or blaming everyone and everything but ourselves. He finally stressed the necessity to strengthen the leadership of the party, to seek unity of thinking, to be inspired with enthusiasm, to work with one heart and soul, to overcome difficulties, to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all tasks, and to ensure to make new achievements in reform, development, and stability. [passage omitted] Present at the meeting were principal responsible comrades of all departments and units directly under the regional-level organs; the principal leading cadres of leagues, cities, departments, and bureaus who were participating in the theoretical study and discussion classes at the regional party school; and the students participating in the classes for the advanced studies of the cadres at league, city, department, and bureau levels.
