This was stated by Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations. "We are making progress in this area at the necessary rate," she said. "But the main thing in this problem is to take the measures, and not the speed with which this is done." According to her the United States will proceed with the imposition of sanctions on Pyongyang for its refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to its nuclear facilities, even if China refuses to cooperate in this sphere. At the same time Albright expressed the hope, based on the experience of dealings with Chinese diplomats at the United Nations, that "Beijing realizes that the emergence of a nuclear North Korea is not in its interests." "A week after Washington stated that it would seek the imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea, the administration of President Bill Clinton is still working intensively on a plan of such actions," THE NEW YORK TIMES writes.
