Churkin and Malk held their first talks in Tallinn June 7 and 8 without any tangible result toward resolving the tangled state in relations between the two countries. But both parties at the Tallinn talks said they will continue active contacts. Churkin told reporters before leaving Tallinn that "with good will, there is nothing unrealistic" about the Aug. 31, 1994, troop withdrawal deadline. In his words, there has to be a firm basis in terms of agreements to proceed energetically with what is necessary to complete the withdrawal. The Russian diplomat said a "realistic agreement that is up to the very high international standards of human rights" is needed to remove the tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. He voiced hope that such an agreement will be concluded. Both Churkin and his Estonian partner in talks were short-spoken when commenting on actual progress in hammering out such agreements. "(There is) nothing concrete to announce at this stage," Malk said. "Over the course of two days we have had good talks. ... We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as possible." Churkin, too, noted that talks with Malk were at a stage when it was premature to get more specific. In his words, an agreement was reached that the talks would soon continue and that Malk may go to Moscow already next week. "It seems to me that (we talked) with a sincere attempt on both sides to solve as quickly as possible those questions which still remain, in order that we can turn the page, perhaps even finish an entire chapter in the history of our relations," Churkin told reporters June 8.
