In a personal letter to the king dated June 18, Hun Sen said he told the Cambodian Foreign Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut, who consulted him on June 13 on the conferring of power to the king, that Article 17 of the constitution -- which states that the king reigns but does not govern -- cannot be changed. Hun Sen said amending the constitution was the mandate of the National Assembly. "I further told Samdech Khromkhun that it is not sure that the Assembly would support any change to the Constitution," he said in the letter obtained by THE NATION. Hun Sen said he was forced by circumstances to clarify his position on the Khmer Rouge problem and on the conferring of executive power to the king. In the letter, Hun Sen apologized if his wording might offend or inconvenience the king, who is undergoing medical treatment in Beijing. Hun Sen complained that while he has done everything according to the constitution, he had still been blamed for being an obstacle to accommodating the Khmer Rouge, who are opposed to the Paris peace agreement, the present constitution and the elected government. In the letter, Hun Sen demanded that the king clarify his plans for Cambodia in relation to an article in the June 23 edition of the FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW. Despite the king's persistent denial of rumours that he was about to return to power, Hun Sen said he was deeply shaken by an article entitled Cambodia: Last Act, especially the parts which suggested that he (Hun Sen) "is an obstacle to conferring power on the King". "What I need right now is the truth about whether Your Majesty really wants to take power as Prime Minister as has been published in the media, so that I might assess according to the real facts," the letter said. The FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW said Sihanouk had acknowledged that his bid for power would be doomed without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] because he (the King) does "not want to shed blood to fight a secession led by Hun Sen. [no end quotes as published] The article quotes the King as saying: "I cannot return to power to go back to Cambodia unless I have the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join me in my government." In his letter to the king, Hun Sen said: "This paragraph is very serious vis-a-vis myself because it implies that a war might break out not by the Khmer Rouge but by my humble person." He said he was prepared to resign and allow the Khmer Rouge nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, to replace him if "permitted by the Constitution, supported by parliament and necessitated by national interest." "There is no need to fear that I might wage a secessionist war," he continued. In the six-page letter, Hun Sen also said he could not accept the Khmer Rouge political programme which he described as "a coup" against the constitution. The Khmer Rouge has demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly and the elected government, and the formation of a new government with Khmer Rouge participation; and the withdrawal of government troops from the frontline in return for a ceasefire agreement and other military concessions. Hun Sen said it was up to the National Assembly to debate the demands of the Maoist group, but as an MP he would certainly vote against them.
