Incidentally, the signing of the treaty on the basis of friendly relations between the two countries and other documents, which was expected immediately after the conclusion of talks, has been postponed until this evening. Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that "in fact, there are no disagreements between us." Explaining the delay regarding the signing of Russian- Vietnamese documents, the head of the Russian Government noted that during a discussion "technicalities" arose, which require further work on the part of specialists. Thus, he added, the signing is being postponed until this evening. "We are convinced," Chernomyrdin stressed, "that we and Vietnam have all the possibilities and potential to increase traditional cooperation in the trade-economic, technical, scientific -- as well as other -- spheres". For his part, Vo Van Kiet agreed with the assessment of the talks given by the Russian prime minister and added: "We need some time to better prepare these documents." ITAR-TASS correspondents have learned from well-informed sources close to the Vietnamese delegation that disagreements in the position of the sides arose on the following issues: the problem of settling the debt of Vietnam to Russia, which the latter inherited from the former USSR, the conditions for the Russian Navy's use of the base of Cam Ranh, and a range of issues relating to Vietnamese citizens residing in Russia.
