FR940606-0-00042 FR940606-0-00019 One commenter opposed the application of URA protections to occupants of non-assisted units in a partially-assisted building. The commenter was concerned about the cost and indicated that the policy would subsidize discrimination because families who don't want to live with assisted families would ``grab a pot of money and move.'' This observation reflects a misunderstanding of the proposed rule. A tenant who is offered the opportunity to occupy the property upon completion of the rehabilitation under reasonable terms and conditions is not entitled to relocation assistance if he or she elects to relocate. Given the limited amount of rehabilitation (and relocation) that can be supported with PBC subsidies, HUD does not anticipate significant displacement under the PBC program and, therefore, does not expect significant relocation costs under the program. More importantly, those costs which do occur as a result of a project should not be borne by the tenant. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt this comment. The third commenter asked that ยง882.712(g)(3), which allows an HA to request HUD's determination as to whether a displacement is or would be covered by the regulations, should include a requirement for a 30-day response time by HUD. HUD will endeavor to respond to all HA requests as quickly as practicable and certainly within 30 days after all relevant information is received. A regulatory requirement for a 30-day HUD response time would not be meaningful, however, because HUD's failure to respond within that period could not serve as a basis for the HA to conclude that the person was not eligible for relocation assistance. The final rule is similar to the proposed rule. As with other HUD-assisted programs, in-place tenants, who will not be displaced from the building/complex, must be provided a written notice, which offers the opportunity to lease a unit in the building/complex under reasonable terms and conditions after the rehabilitation has been completed. As described in ยง882.712(g)(1)(iii)(A), such reasonable terms and conditions include a post-rehabilitation rent that does not exceed the greater of: (1) The rent charged prior to the agreement, or (2) an affordable rent based on the tenant's income. Such reasonable terms and conditions also include reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by an in-place tenant who is required to relocate temporarily or to move permanently to another unit in the building/complex so the rehabilitation can be carried out. If these conditions are not met and the in-place tenant moves permanently from the building/complex, the tenant will be considered to have been displaced by the project and to be entitled to relocation assistance at URA levels. IV. This Final Rule This rule is being issued to conform existing HUD program regulations to the DOT final rule at 49 CFR part 24. This rule does not reissue the DOT rule, but, for the benefit of HUD program users, adds definitions or descriptions that are peculiar to HUD's programs. Also, the rule does not change any of the environmental program requirements or the compliance requirements of 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. Users are urged to consult the DOT final rule (49 CFR part 24) for a more detailed description of, and guidance for, all matters relating to displacement covered by the URA. As indicated in the interim rule published by this agency on February 19, 1988, and now adopted by this rule, parts 42 and 43 have been removed, except that ยง42.1 (the only section in 24 CFR part 42) remains as a guide-post to readers. It advises readers to consult the DOT rule at 49 CFR part 24 for the regulations implementing the URA and the 1987 Amendments. Certain terms, although treated in the DOT rule, are nonetheless defined, where appropriate, in the several parts of this rule. See, for example, the definitions contained in this rule for the terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation of negotiations.'' (These terms are defined in the DOT rule at 49 CFR 24.2(g) and 49 CFR 24.2(k), respectively.) The terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation of negotiations'' are defined in this rule in order to cover circumstances unique to HUD's programs.
