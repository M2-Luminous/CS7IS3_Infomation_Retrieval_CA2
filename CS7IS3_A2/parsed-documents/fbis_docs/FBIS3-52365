He said the Iraqi people will always recall with fondness and appreciation the Jordanian people's support during their calamities, both in the Iraq-Iran war against the racist hostile current and in the Mother of Battles when forces of evil and aggression massed and more than 30 barbaric, treacherous states assembled to strike at Iraq. In an interview with the AKHBAR AL-USBU' editor in chief, Hammadi said the reopening of Umm Qasr port in the Gulf will not affect the transportation of Iraqi imports and continued commercial activity via al-Aqabah Port. He said Umm Qasr port was operational during the Iran-Iraq war but this did not affect the flow of goods to Iraq via al-'Aqabah port in Jordan. The Iraqi information minister said: The reopening of Umm Qasr port confirms Iraq's right to make the appropriate decisions and repair everything destroyed by war. It also confirms Iraq's determination to break the chains of the blockade imposed against it. The decision to allow imports via Iraqi ports will also encourage major shipping companies to ship directly to Iraq to unload the goods that are allowed to be imported. Hammadi underlined Iraq's strong desire to continue to receive its imports via al-'Aqabah port, particularly the imports shipped by big vessels with a load capacity of over 30,000 tonnes. He said even after repairing and expanding the port, and overcoming the silt problem, Umm Qasr port can only receive vessels with a load capacity between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes, particularly those arriving from Pakistan and India. The distance from these countries to Umm Qasr port, he said, is shorter than that to al-'Aqabah. The information minister said certain shipping companies are worried about sending their vessels to Umm Qasr because they think the area between al-Bakr harbor and Umm Qasr port is dotted with mines and because of higher insurance costs. Hammadi also talked about the Iraqi Government's positive attitude toward former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and other European figures who visited Iraq recently to secure the release of prisoners. He said: These people who wagered on the collapse of Iraq and who thought that its capitulation was only a matter of time have come back to show repentance and admit that the regime is strong and so is Iraq. He added: We cannot turn back those people, who, we think, have begun to understand the suffering of and injustice inflicted on Iraq and the effect the blockade is having on its people. We responded favorably to them on humanitarian grounds and we hope they will make their voices heard to their governments and to the officials and people in their countries in the hope that awareness may move to end the injustice and repression against Iraq. The Iraqi information minister praised the good relations between the Iraqi and Turkish peoples. He said: We sensed from the brothers in Turkey -- including party, professional, and trade union leaders and parliamentarians -- only sincere feelings toward us. We have trade links with Turkey. We expect an increase in trade links between the two countries through the thousands of trucks that enter Iraq with foodstuffs. They barter these goods for gasoline and kerosene, which they take to sell in Turkey. We hope these convoys will continue to supply particularly foodstuffs and medicine, to help lessen the burden on the Iraqi people that is caused by the blockade, Hammadi adds: Some 50,000 people live in the Diyarbakir area. Cafes, restaurants, hotels, and resorts can be built on a 120-km stretch of road to serve drivers and truck convoys. It is expected that between 17,000 and 20,000 trucks loaded with goods, particularly rice and legumes, will enter Iraq daily. Trade links with the Diyarbakir area date back more than 50 years and Iraq used to import legumes, particularly good quality peas, from that area. Asked about his expectations on the resumption of Iraqi oil exports via Turkey, Hammadi said: Al-Bakr harbor, which extends 25 km into the sea, is ready to receive tankers and export oil. The harbor was repaired and made ready for work two years ago. As for exports via Turkey, Turkey alone can answer this question and determine the date. Asked about lifting the unjust blockade and Iraq's compliance with the UN resolutions, and whether there were still any requests which Iraq has to fulfill, the information minister said Iraq has implemented all UN Security Council resolutions. He said it is time now to lift the blockade imposed on Iraq and we expect matters to become clear in February. Asked about recent U.S. moves to secure a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iraq to recognize Kuwait and stop action against the opposition, Hammadi said: We understood from UN envoy Ekeus that there are no appendices or new conditions to the UN Security Council resolutions, which introduced and maintained the sanctions against Iraq. We will have to wait and see what they say in the next meeting which, as I have said, will be held in February. The blockade will, God wiling, erode; this is only a matter of time. At the conclusion of the interview, Hammadi said he is proud of the position of Jordan--king, government, and people. He asked us to convey his greetings to the Jordanians, whose blood was mixed with the blood of the Iraqis.
