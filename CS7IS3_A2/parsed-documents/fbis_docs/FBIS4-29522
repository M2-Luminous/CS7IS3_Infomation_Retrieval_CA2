FBIS4-29522 "dreas118_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 South Korea Reportage on North-South Summit Proposal Reportage on North-South Summit Proposal Papers Examine Proposed Summit SK1906114394 SK1906114394 BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 June carry articles and editorials on the proposed summit talks between ROK President Kim Yong-sam and DPRK President Kim Il-song. The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "In Not Even 24 Hours." The editorial starts off by expressing hope that "the North Korean nuclear issue can be resolved through dialogue and realize the South-North summit talks" so that it will be an opportunity to further move toward achieving reunification. The editorial criticizes the government for hurriedly accepting President Kim Il-song's proposal for summit talks saying that it seems that this matter was not examined thoroughly. While urging that no decisions be made until North Korea shows practical reliability, it says that South-North summit talks will be welcomed with "open arms" if North Korea truly comes forward to the arena of dialogue to guarantee inspections and nuclear transparency. The editorial concludes by saying that the ROK must not be "dragged along" by North Korea. The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Truth and Falsehood of the South-North Summit Talks." The editorial begins by welcoming the possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Then it notes that "the government must prudently consider North Korea's true intention" on holding the summit talks. The editorial continues to point out "Kim Il-song's dualism" noting that this proposal may only be a disguised will for peace. Noting that originally summit talks are held when about 90 percent of the pending issues between the countries concerned are resolved by the high-ranking working-level officials, there are prerequisites to be solved before holding the summit talks. It also notes that without solving the various prerequisites, the summit talks will only be for propaganda use and that it may only be a "trap," thus giving disappointment to the people. The editorial concludes by urging the government to solve prerequisites and the United States to delay the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks until complete and thorough nuclear inspections are carried out. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Anticipated South-North Summit Talks." Noting that "a new chapter can be opened in resolving the nuclear issue and reconciliation and cooperation between the South and North can be achieved" if the South-North summit is realized, the editorial elaborates on expectations for holding the summit. The editorial notes that it welcomes the summit talks but that at the same time it notes that this matter must be "observed with prudence." Noting the subtle timing for the proposal of the summit talks, the editorial points out that this may be a "tactic" for North Korea to escape from its difficult situation. The editorial concludes that the ROK must recognize the true intention of Kim Il-song's proposal for the summit talks and take prudence. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Meeting Between the Summits Has a Great Significance." The editorial starts off by welcoming the possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting that a working-level contact will be held soon for the summit talks, the editorial expresses the hope that the summit talks can be realized soon from "the level of national interest." It continues to elaborate on why it is necessary to hold the summit talks, emphasizing that "it will play a decisive role in creating an atmosphere" to resolve pending issues between the South and North. However, the editorial expresses worry over the true intention of Kim Il-song in his proposal for the summit talks, noting that the ROK must have a thorough understanding of his true intention. The editorial concludes by saying that since nuclear transparency is the most important pending issue in South-North relations, it will be desirable to guarantee nuclear transparency and then hold the summit talks. SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK Government's position regarding the possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. The article says that if the South-North summit is realized, it will be a decisive motive in resolving the nuclear issue. While noting that the exchange of special envoys of the South and North must be realized to discuss the holding of the summit talks, officials view that if such dialogue is resumed, it will be carried out actively to realize the summit talks. Noting Kim Il-song's message to hold summit talks, which was conveyed to the ROK by Former U.S. President Carter, the paper says officials view that there is a 50-50 chance that Kim Il-song is sincere. The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 1,000-word article by reporters Kim Se-song and Yi Tong-chu on the significance and prospects for holding the South-North summit talks. The article begins by saying a new phase has opened in South-North relations due to the possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting that Chongwadae, the presidential office, conveyed to Mr. Carter its acceptance of the summit talks, it seems that the "Carter channel" will be used for the time being. The article notes that if Kim Il-song has the will to hold the summit talks, it first means that he will face all South-North issues including the nuclear issue "head on," and second, it may only be a "gesture to temporarily escape the nuclear crisis." The article notes that what cannot be overlooked is the fact that the proposal for holding the summit talks may be an "appeasement strategy" to "resume dialogue with the United States." The article concludes by urging the government to examine this matter with prudence. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial on the North-South summit talks. The editorial appraises that the proposal evokes much expectation particularly because the two presidents agreed to hold the talks "anytime, anywhere, and without any conditions." The editorial also expressed suspicion because of North Korea's past record of breaking various promises and agreements. The editorial notes that whether or not Kim Il-song's proposal is a strategy to escape from the current situation should be determined by how faithful the North Korean attitude is in the forthcoming working-level contacts to prepare for the summit talks. The editorial reaffirms that "the working-level contacts should not be used to delay sanctions." KYONGHYANG SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporter Kim Chung-il on the background and prospects of the North-South summit talks. The article analyzes that if Kim Il-song made the proposal as an extension of his remarks regretting the rupture of past summit talks proposals, it will be a mere appeasement gesture. However, if Kim Il-song is determined to hold the talks, the article analyzes that the proposal will be based on North Korea's "political and economic interests" because "North Korea needs South Korea's economic aid to restructure its economy which is essential to maintaining political stability." Turning to the agenda of the summit talks, the article believes the nuclear issue cannot be resolved in a single round of talks because the North will not give up the nuclear development at once while the South wants complete transparency through more inspections, even though the United States might be satisfied with North Korea's merely remaining in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The article further warns that the ROK Government should be prepared to make a decision when North Korea requests the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea during its negotiations with the United States. KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 1,000-word article by reporter Yi Sung-chol on the significance of Kim Il-song's proposal for talks. The article finds it significant that "North Korea recognized the ROK as a dialogue partner" making a concession from its previous stance that the nuclear issue can only be resolved between the North and the United States. The article hopes that the dual communications channel will give new possibilities of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue because it will be easier for the United States to accept the package deal proposed by the North if the North-South summit talks are realized. The article anticipates that "the North Korea-U.S. talks will still be the core channel for the nuclear issue while the North-South summit talks could discuss mutual inspections [sangho sachal] and the compliance of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." The article points out that a key matter is the verification of North Korea's past nuclear activities. The article is concerned that the nuclear issue will again face a crisis if North Korea refuses to discuss the assurance of transparency during negotiations with the United States. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Expecting an Honest Meeting for the Nation." The editorial appraises the proposal as "the most tangible possibility" different from previous official and nonofficial North-South contacts. The editorial says that previous dialogue proposals by both North and South Korea, including those by President Kim Yong-sam, were political strategies to solidify domestic positions, and hopes that "this time, the summit talks will not be ruptured by collateral conditions irrelevant to the essence of the talks." HANGYORE SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,100-word article by reporter Chang Chong-su on the background and prospects of the summit proposal. The editorial analyzes that Kim Il-song is truly pursuing improved North-South relations because he proposed the summit talks "when the communications channel with the United States was not closed but opened by Former U.S. President Carter's visit." The article also analyzes that the United States pressured both North and South Korea behind-the-scenes to improve relations and that the North proposed the summit talks to prove their will to ease tensions. The article expects many obstacles on the way to realizing the summit talks because the ROK Government has not given up on UN sanctions and would not ignore North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons for the sake of improved relations. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Prerequisites of North-South Summit Talks." The editorial notes that the proposal could be a positive one if there are no political calculations which have always been the obstacle of North-South dialogue. The editorial also welcomes the proposal as an opportunity for the ROK to take the initiative in resolving the nuclear issue. Recalling how "inefficient" previous working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys were, the editorial urges the government to be fully prepared to carry out working-level contacts for the summit talks. The editorial also warns the government of the "strategic aspect" of the proposal. Noting that North Korea made the proposal through a third party, Carter, the editorial analyzes that North Korea may have made the gesture of summit talks to expedite DPRK-U.S. contacts. CHUNGANG ILBO also publishes on page 3 a 1,000-world article by reporter Kim Hyon-ik on the prospects of the summit talks. Admitting that Kim Il-song's proposal has blurred the focus of the nuclear issue and that everything is going as Kim Il-song intended, the article expects that tension on the Korean peninsula will be alleviated for the time being. The article states that if North Korea tries to make little progress during the working-level contacts, that will prove that the proposal was a strategy to avoid sanctions. The article reports that "ROK specialists on North Korean affairs are expressing concerns that the sudden variable of Carter's visit might have wasted all the efforts to adopt UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea."
