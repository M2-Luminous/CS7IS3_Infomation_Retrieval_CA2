FR940414-1-00044 FR940414-1-00010 The raw material of refilling establishments is the registered pesticide product, which is simply transferred from one refillable container (a stationary bulk tank) to another refillable container (a minibulk tank). The raw materials for the formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities are active ingredients and inert ingredients which take all physical forms and require formulating and packaging to result in the registered product. Thus, raw materials are a contributing factor in subcategorizing this industry. In addition, the type of operation performed at refilling establishments, repackaging only, is considerably different from the operations performed at formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities. Thus, the type of operation also contributes to the subcategorization of this industry. There are no great differences in the sources from which wastewater is generated, virtually all wastewater is derived from cleaning equipment and surrounding areas. However, there are differences in the volumes of wastewater generated by facilities. The median annual volume of PFPR wastewater generated by manufacturing/PFPR facilities is 179,330 gallons, the median annual volume generated by PFPR only facilities is 2,223 gallons and the median annual volume generated by refilling establishments is 736 gallons. Although these differences are substantial, they alone might not justify subcategorization. They do, however, affect the costs of wastewater treatment. PFPR facilities do not necessarily have a dominant product although most serve one predominant market. EPA considered the effect that market differences could have within the PFPR subcategory as described in the next section. The refilling establishments are very homogeneous in that they serve only one market, the agricultural market, and the products they repackage are mostly liquid bulk herbicides. Thus, the dominant product is a factor in subcategorizing this industry to the extent that the refillers have a dominant product and the PFPR facilities do not. Climatic conditions which are related to location could have an effect on water use and water conservation practices. At the time of the industry survey, California was experiencing a severe drought. EPA noticed that the lack of and cost of water in this part of the country encouraged many innovative pollution prevention and reuse techniques at those facilities. However, many of these same techniques have been implemented in areas of net precipitation, thus the climatic conditions related to geographic location are not a factor in subcategorizing. There are some distinct differences in the location of facilities. Whereas most refilling establishments are either in rural locations or in small towns near agricultural areas, many of the PFPR facilities are located in urban areas. In particular the PFPR facilities that serve the industrial and institutional/commercial markets are located in urban areas. The Agency is unsure whether this is due to the fact that the type of business these facilities are engaged in and the markets that they serve result in their urban location, thus providing them with access to POTWs, or that all facilities that were more rural in their location and also direct discharges either discontinued production or relocated and switched to becoming dischargers to POTW's in response to the BPT limitations requiring the elimination of dischargers directly to receiving waters. Treatment costs and best available wastewater treatment technology are a significant factor in considering whether to subcategorize PFPR facilities and refilling establishments. As described more fully in the discussion of the regulatory approach, wastewaters generated at refilling establishments are expected to be recycled/reused without treatment. EPA has estimated the cost of holding the wastewater until it can be recycled/reused. As previously mentioned, the refilling establishments generate a median of 736 gallons annually. These wastewaters are expected to be collected in the containment system and loading areas, whereafter they can be pumped into and held in a tank or container. The few refilling facilities that are estimated to discharge wastewater were discharging a total estimate volume of 1500 gallons annually to POTW's. This represents an average volume of approximately 78 gallons per facility which can be held in a single minibulk container, which costs about $200&hyph;$300. The PFPR facilities (other than refilling establishments) are also expected to be able to recycle/reuse wastewaters, however some wastewater sources may require treatment before they can be recycled. EPA has estimated the costs for storage of wastewater and treatment through the Universal Treatment System. The average estimated cost of compliance for PFPR facilities is approximately $32,300 annually. Based on this higher cost between the two basic types of facilities and the different operations, separate economic analyses were conducted. These analyses showed that refilling establishments and most types of PFPR facilities can achieve the zero discharge limitations economically. However, EPA's analysis of economic impacts for PFPR facilities indicate that a small segment, sanitizer facilities, will incur much greater costs and economic impacts from complying with the zero discharge limitations than the other facilities would incur. The Agency considered creating a separate subcategory for sanitizer facilities, but sanitizer facilities are very similar to other PFPR facilities in other respects. Since the data indicate that the economic impacts can be reduced and the amount of discharge is small for indirect discharging sanitizer facilities, EPA decided not to form a separate subcategory but simply to provide separate pretreatment standards for sanitizer facilities. As described above, there are clear differences between refilling establishments and PFPR facilities. They differ in the raw materials, water use, location, wastewater treatment requirements and costs. Therefore, EPA proposes to establish a separate subcategory that will apply to refilling establishments. However, following review of comments on this proposal, the final rule may incorporate the refilling establishments into the PFPR subcategory, provided the limitations are the same. C. Proposed Subcategories The following discussions of EPA's subcategories reflects the analysis done with the survey data representing the formulating, packaging and repackaging practices for the 272 active ingredients that were the subject of that survey. EPA believes that the formulating, packaging and repackaging practices for the rest of the active ingredients will be the same as for the 272, however, the data presented in the following discussion does not reflect their inclusion. 1. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) This subcategory applies to the formulating, packaging and repackaging of pesticide chemicals. BPT regulations already exist for this subcategory. EPA proposes to add the word ``repackaging'' to the title and applicability provision of this subcategory, but these do not represent changes to the applicability or coverage of this subcategory. Repackaging is proposed to be defined as ``the direct transference of a single pesticide active ingredient or single formulation from any marketable container to another marketable container, without intentionally mixing in any inerts, diluents, solvents, other active ingredients, or other materials of any sort.'' The term ``packaging'' in the applicability provision of Subpart C was always intended to cover repackaging as well as packaging operations. Facilities engaged in repackaging pesticide products must comply with the same reporting requirements under FIFRA as formulating and packaging facilities. In addition, repackaging frequently generates wastewater sources similar in nature to formulating and packaging activities. Thus, repackaging activities are within the scope of Subcategory C. To assist EPA with its evaluation of the PFPR facilities, EPA divided the industry into subgroups. This analysis of subgroups was also performed to evaluate whether there was a need to further subcategorize the industry based on these subgroups. These subgroups were developed primarily from the information in the questionnaires. The subgroups were analyzed to determine if there are trends in water usage, water discharge or disposal methods, and production associated with particular markets or products. EPA identified facilities within the subgroups that are currently achieving zero discharge through recycle or reuse of wastewater and facilities that are not achieving zero discharge. This information was used to coordinate additional data gathering activities. EPA created ten subgroups defined as: â€¢ Aerosol _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that operated a Department of Transportation (DOT) aerosol test bath in any formulating, packaging or repackaging operation. These facilities are not included in any other group, regardless of other activities at the facility or the markets reported by the facility.
