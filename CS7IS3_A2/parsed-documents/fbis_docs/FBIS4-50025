It is claimed to be able to maintain a fair and free foreign trade order and is believed to be conducive to China's development in trade and economic cooperation with other countries as well as facilitating the establishment of the market economic structure. The new law, consisting of 8 chapters and 44 articles, was passed at the closing of the Seventh Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) today, over which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided. The NPC Standing Committee also passed the State Compensation Law today to make state functionaries adhere to laws in their operations. It stipulates that citizens, legal persons and other organizations will be "compensated for their losses or suffering when their legal rights are harmed due to illegal deployment of power by state functionaries or state employees." The lawmaking body also approved three decisions today: -- The supplementary provisions to regulations governing offenses against public order, initiated by the ministry of public security, defined 18 new offenses, targeting newly-emerging public security problems in the country at the time of reform and opening to the outside world. -- The amendments to the regulations on active service and rank of military officers of the People's Liberation Army are meant to meet increasing needs of the reform and construction drive of the the nation and the armed forces. The first amendment takes two to three years off the ceiling age for officers of deputy-army level, officers at the level of deputy commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and officers with elementary professional posts. The latter one spells out the disestablishment of first-class (highest ranking) general. It also stipulates that no military rank will be granted to the chairman of the central military commission. Wang Yingwei and 12 other persons today were added to the membership of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The NPC Standing Committee appointed Nie Li as a member of the NPC Internal Affairs and Judicial Committee, named Song Ruixiang and Sun Jiazheng as minister of geology and mineral resources and minister of radio, film and television, to replace Zhu Xun and Ai Zhisheng respectively. Guo Zhenqian was named auditor-general of the auditing administration to replace Lu Peijian.
