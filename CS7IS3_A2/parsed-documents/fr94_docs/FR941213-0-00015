FR941213-0-00015 FR941213-0-00003 A number of commenters noted that many more school children die or are injured as pedestrians or bicyclists than as school bus occupants. The National School Transportation Association stated, ``Outside the bus, in the loading/unloading zone area, has been and is still the problem area.'' According to NHTSA's ``Traffic Safety Facts 1993_School Buses,'' of the people who lost their lives in school bus-related crashes from 1983 through 1993, 59 percent were occupants of other vehicles involved in the crash, 30 percent were non-occupants (pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.) and only 11 percent were occupants of school buses. Some of these commenters were hopeful that problems related to the loading and unloading of school children can be addressed through the Pedestrian Safety program area, which was designated a National Priority area in 1991. Within this context, some commenters requested additional emphasis and attention from the agencies with regard to pedestrian safety issues, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction in Washington State cautioned that ``the emphasis of [pedestrian safety programs] usually has little to do with school bus stops.'' NHTSA has already taken steps to address this concern, which is shared by the agencies. In September 1992, NHTSA started a research and development effort relating to elementary school-age pedestrians who are school bus riders. Under this effort, which was completed in the spring of 1994, the agency reviewed existing training materials and national crash data relating to school bus pedestrian safety for elementary school-age children; developed a school bus/pedestrian safety educational program for children in grades K&hyph;6, which includes teacher's guides, a poster and a video for grades K&hyph;3, videos and brochures for parents and bus drivers, and promotional materials; selected a school district to assess the program's effectiveness in reducing crash-related behaviors; implemented and evaluated the program in that district and modified the program, as warranted. A report regarding this effort is expected to be published in the spring of 1995. As stated earlier, the National Safety Council (NSC) has agreed to undertake a comprehensive marketing campaign on the school bus/pedestrian safety educational program. This program is currently being modified into a product that will be more marketable. NSC anticipates reaching over seven million people in its initial marketing effort. The Center for Auto Safety (CAS) objected to the agencies' decision by arguing that Congress ``mandated'' in ISTEA that School Bus Safety must be a priority program. CAS asserted that, since Congress was aware when it enacted ISTEA that there were lower fatality rates for school buses, ``The only way for DOT to overturn the Congressional mandate in ISTEA that school bus safety shall be a Priority Program is for DOT to find that a Priority Program cannot reduce deaths and injuries in school bus accidents.'' According to CAS, ``DOT cannot substitute its judgment for that of Congress which has determined that saving even a few lives from school bus accidents is as important a priority as saving thousands of lives lost due to excess speeds.'' The agencies strongly disagree with CAS' comments. We have no reason to believe, and CAS cites no basis for its assertions, that Congress mandated that School Bus Safety must be designated a priority program if the program has the potential to save just a single life or that Congress believes that the thousands of lives lost due to excess speeds (many of whom are children) are somehow less important than the few children whose lives are lost in school buses. In fact, the legislative history shows quite the contrary. The House version of ISTEA identified eight required and seven optional highway safety programs. Speeding was identified in the House legislation as a required program; school bus safety was identified as an optional program. (The Senate version of ISTEA had no comparable provision.) The final ISTEA legislation, which was developed in conference, listed just six program areas and eliminated the separate categories. However, it specifically provided the agencies with the option of choosing not to designate one or more of these six programs as National Priorities by reporting to Congress the reasons for not establishing the programs as priority areas. (CAS acknowledged this option in its comments.) Moreover, there is no suggestion anywhere in the legislative history that School Bus Safety (or any of the highway safety programs, for that matter) should meet criteria other than those normally applied by the agencies when they determine what programs should be designated as National Priority areas. CAS also questioned the agencies' reliance on data from FARS, ``Accident Facts'' and the National Safety Council. CAS argued that the agencies should not rely on these data because they under-report school crashes, deaths and injuries. Another commenter, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, also pointed out that school bus crashes, injuries and fatalities may be under-reported, and suggested that the agencies investigate this issue. This commenter, however, fully supported the agencies' preliminary conclusions. The agencies acknowledge that there may be some under-reporting of school bus crashes, deaths and injuries, and we are taking steps to improve these data. Currently, pursuant to section 2002(a) of ISTEA, the Department is in the process of developing minimum reporting criteria for States regarding deaths and injuries resulting from school bus crashes, as well as deaths and injuries involving other circumstances. While it may be possible to improve the data, it is clear from the data currently available (including those contained in comments received in response to the NPRM) that the numbers of school bus crashes, injuries and fatalities are extremely low.
