As expected, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has once again been reelected to the leadership of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]. However, though taken for granted, this outcome was only reached through a compromise -- unexpected as regards its proportions -- with rival Alfonso Guerra, who leads the party's left wing. [passage omitted] [Botti] Do you believe that this was Gonzalez' last congress as prime minister? [Aznar] The last, the second last... I cannot tell. What I do know, however, is that the Socialist cycle has come to an end. [Botti] Why has it come to an end? [Aznar] Because the congress has ratified Gonzalez' power, leaving the basic problems unresolved. The majority of young, urban voters are now voting for us, that is, for the PP [People's Party]. The PSOE is backed by those who are not so young, and those who depend on the state's apparatus. After all these years, people are tired of this way of governing. The Socialists should be replacing their ideological platform with a pragmatic one, but they are incapable of changing. [Botti] What mistakes has Gonzalez made in his capacity as head of government? [Aznar] In a favorable context, he had every opportunity to transform Spain, but he failed to seize any of them. He gave rise to a number of irregular practices, which generate mistrust and pessimism. He failed to link Spain to Europe's more developed countries. [Botti] What is your opponent's greatest fault? [Aznar] I do not like to make personal judgments. If you wish me to mention a fault, I might say he is inconsistent. [Botti] Do you think that an analogy can be established between the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] collapse in Italy and the PSOE's present difficulties? [Aznar] I think that the problem concerns all Socialists in Mediterranean countries generally. Socialism had its last stronghold in southern Europe, in France, Greece, and Portugal, apart from Italy and our own country. In all cases it has evidenced a strong tendency to conflict, and a similar conception of power, which has given rise to corruption. [Botti] Has corruption in Spain reached the same levels as in Italy? [Aznar] I hope not, but it is certainly widespread here, and patronage is too. This mechanism that generates public expenditure in order to win votes has seriously contributed to worsening the state's deficit. [Botti] Do you think a "manos limpias" [clean hands] enquiry is required? [Aznar] I do not think that there will be one, and I am not advocating one either. It is preferable for regeneration to take place through a political change. [Botti] Meaning through you and your PP? [Aznar] It is up to the Spanish people to decide. However, the European elections will be very important. [Botti] Would you rather be considered a center or a right-wing man? [Aznar] A center man, whose party covers the entire center-right area. [Botti] Do you believe anything can be salvaged from Francoism? [Aznar] Nothing is left today of that period. It is a page in history, and in terms of the people's will, that has now been definitely turned. [Botti] What is your answer to those who accuse you of not having the stature of a leader? [Aznar] Leaders are created by citizens. Last year 8,200,000 people voted for me, and 9 million for Gonzalez, but I believe that our votes are qualitatively better. [Botti] The fact remains that the center-right is in power in France, England, and Germany, whereas it did not win in Spain. Why is this so? [Aznar] Because of the resistance shown by Mediterranean socialism, as I mentioned earlier. However, sooner or later we will win -- that much is certain -- and it still remains to be seen whether this legislature will reach the end of its term. Generally speaking, the problem lies in the fact that governments become worn out, and the need for renewal is felt. Just as in France people were fed up with the Socialists, in Germany people may get tired of [Chancellor] Kohl -- irrespective of whether parties are on the Right or the Left. [Botti] Who will win in Italy, though? [Aznar] Who knows! I hope that the Left does not win. The pole of freedom has possibilities, but I think that it still has to solve some internal problems. The new Popular Party still has a long way to go. I hope that it will undergo the same change that we have carried out. [Botti] What is your opinion of [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? [Aznar] Many businessmen turn to politics, but becoming a politician in the first person requires extraordinary devotion and capabilities. It is very difficult to be a businessman and a politician at the same time. [Botti] Whom would you vote for? [Aznar] I do not feel I can express a preference. However, I wish our Popular Party namesakes all the best. [passage omitted]
