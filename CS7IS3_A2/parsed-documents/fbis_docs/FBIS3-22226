Poland faced this problem a couple of years before Ukraine. Its lengthy border with Germany -- the world's largest manufacturer of these ``products'' -- facilitated the immoral activities of companies involved in selling toxic waste. However, the Polish side adopted a strict law on shipping waste across the border. According to Greenpeace Ukraine, this is one of the best laws of its kind in the world. Ukraine still has no legal footing for controlling this sector. A resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet in November 1993 was not implemented because the Council of Ministers has been lingering in compiling the list of toxic substances. The problem of German waste shipped to Rivne, Nikolayev, and Ochakov has not been resolved, regardless of the investigation conducted by competent organs and negotiations with Germany on returning the waste ``to its native land.'' The treaty with Poland is important for Ukraine first of all, because it includes a clause on prevention of transit of hazardous waste via the two states' territories. Thus, our ecological border has moved farther to the west.
