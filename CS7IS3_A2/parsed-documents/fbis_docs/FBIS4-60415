The remarks were made in the context of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's mediation efforts between Israel and Syria. According to the ambassador's classified cable, Peres said "Clinton is obviously more involved in economic issues than in foreign policy, and Christopher cannot upstage his superior." The foreign minister clarified through an aide that in his meeting with Mitterrand, he had expounded on the criticism leveled at the Americans by the Syrians. According to the aide, Peres himself believes that the U.S. Administration "is doing its utmost to promote the process." It should be noted that the talk was conducted in French, Ambassador Lankry's mother tongue. [passage omitted]
