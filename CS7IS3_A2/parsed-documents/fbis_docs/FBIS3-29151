Hata told a press conference he thinks the currency markets will naturally return to normal as Japanese monetary authorities make close contacts with their counterparts in other countries. He said such a rapid surge in the yen against the dollar will greatly affect the lives of people in the United States. Hata also criticized some comments by U.S. officials approving a higher yen against the dollar, saying those who have posts which could exert great influence on markets should be cautious in making comments.
