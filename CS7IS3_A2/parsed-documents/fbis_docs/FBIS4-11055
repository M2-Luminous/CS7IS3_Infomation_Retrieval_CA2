While not on its deathbed as some analysts believe it is, its problems are far from being solved. The economic liberalization has not been a good thing for Colombian textiles and the future of the industry looks rather grim. "In 1992, Colombia exported $840 million worth of textiles and ready-to-wear garments, one-third of all industrial exports. However, how much longer can it stay in the market?" asks the latest edition of THE ECONOMIST after analyzing the problems facing the country's textile mills. "Last year," the prestigious publication continues, "nearly 5,000 textile jobs were lost in Medellin alone, profits collapsed, and several dozen small firms had to close their doors." The situation is truly dramatic. According to an analysis done for the Superintendency of Securities based on the 1993 financial results of 86 companies in the manufacturing sector whose securities are registered with the National Registry of Securities and Middlemen, the only economic sector that suffered net losses last year was textiles. Of the 14 companies included in the sampling, six--including Tejicondor and COLTEJER [Colombian Textile Company]--suffered losses and only three of the other eight improved their financial situation (see box). What is more serious is the fact that despite the government's efforts to plug some of the holes that caused the crisis, such as the elimination of minimum import prices and the free entry of fabrics into the country, the sector's prospects are not at all bright. The world market is glutted and incentives to smuggle remain great. Dumping is far from disappearing, Customs has not caught up with the requirements of liberalization, and revaluation has hurt the ability of Colombian textiles to compete on the world market. It is therefore not surprising that shareholders in the country's largest companies meeting in recent days demanded better treatment for the industry from the government. Domestic Scene Not all the sector's ills are the fault of the international environment or government policy, however, says one prestigious American consulting firm. For over a year, Monitor has been completing a diagnosis of the ability of Colombian industry--including textiles--to compete and last week submitted its conclusions in Bogota and Medellin. According to analyst Michael Fairbanks, the sector's biggest companies, such as COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, are facing an unprecedented fall if they do not want to be pushed out by China, Pakistan, and India, whose low-cost production is flooding the world market. Furthermore, in Fairbanks' opinion, it would almost be better to close the existing companies and replace them with new ones that are more vigorous and aggressive. The textile companies feared the result of the Monitor studies, but emphatically reject such a radical solution, i.e., pulling the plug on the big companies and precipitating their death throes. "If dying and being born were so easy, we would have heaven in our hands," COLTEJER President Rene Gomez told SEMANA. In terms of its ability to compete, Monitor gives the national industry low grades in four key areas. Looking at the so-called advanced factors, it fails in terms of basic infrastructure (highways and ports), telecommunications, technological experience, and professional training. It has little or nothing to offer in terms of competitive strategies. Effort is poor in the area of common trade guild objectives. The lag in the makeup of the domestic market is worrisome. Only one of its two traditional comparative advantages, geography, still ranks above average. The other, wages, has also begun to sag. The truth is that labor liabilities have the three Colombian giants: COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, on their knees. COLTEJER has one retired worker for every two on the job, and the ratio at Fabricato is practically the same. Even Tejicondor, which has had no union since the 1982 crisis and has thus been able to negotiate with its employees directly, has only four active workers for every one retired. "When the economy was closed, the private sector managed some of the retired workers and handled certain benefits," Gomez says, "but under the economic liberalization, that social burden has been transferred to the government." As a result, led by COLTEJER, Antioquia's textile companies intend to present new alternatives so that the government will shoulder the responsibility for retired workers. "That social function belongs to it," Gomez adds. Nevertheless, the companies recognize that some progress has been made in terms of benefits, in particular, passage of Law 50, the system of work providing no benefits. In the case of Tejicondor, for example, the company has managed to place 90 percent of its personnel roster (1,835 persons) under the new regime. In addition, most of the company's new contracts are for a set term. "Our average seniority no longer exceeds four years," SEMANA was told by Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil. At COLTEJER, half of the 7,200 workers opted for the new system, while at Fabricato, 60 percent of the 5,330 employees did so. However, progress made in this field has been lost in the area of wages, which rise daily in relative terms. When compared with other Latin American countries, Colombia's minimum wage has surpassed that of Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile. When one adds the accelerated rate of the revaluation, the labor advantage shrinks even further. For this reason, textiles now being produced in Colombia include finished (and sometimes complex) components because making rough fabrics is no longer profitable. A Little Bit of Everything Concerning the Colombian supply, Monitor criticizes the practice of making a little bit of everything for an underdeveloped national market that consumes five kg of fabric a year compared with a world average of 25. COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor recognize that the multiplicity of lines is a drawback and have begun to make significant cuts. "Monitor is right about this business of trying to produce everything," Perez admits. As head of Tejicondor, he has cut his factory's lines from 100 to 33. The immediate effects include a substantial improvement in quality and a tangible reduction in costs. Monitor recognizes that changes introduced by the textile companies in this direction have been positive because they have given Colombia a new competitive outlook it did not have before. "Most of the competitive innovations in Colombian industry can be seen in the textile sector," Fairbanks says, while suggesting even deeper scrutiny: "The bottom line is that the lines produced by Colombian textile companies are so elementary that they are easily copied, which explains the takeoff of Asian producers." The fact is that Colombia is still far from creating a movement of style and ready-to-wear clothing enabling it to impose trends and brand names as the garment industry multinationals have done. "In this area, there are international trade barriers that hurt us," says Fabricato President Jorge Restrepo. "Turning Colombian brands into stylish name brands will take previously unheard-of levels of time, investments, marketing, and advertising which we are not prepared to make." Monitor points to what it considers a serious flaw in the primitive articulation of the Colombian textile chain, a fact which the presidents of the main national companies accept, but which they largely blame on the government. The price of cotton is one example. Manufacturers are forced to buy and pay for Colombia's total production at the international price, plus an additional duty of 10 percent. In Asia, Colombia's main competitor, the price paid by manufacturers for raw materials is 25 percent under the world price. By trying to protect cotton producers, the textile companies say, the government hurts manufacturers. Monitor also criticizes the Colombian manufacturers' custom of operating as sealed units, preventing anyone else from discovering their secrets. There is no true guild spirit that serves to stimulate every link in the chain. While this is true--and the entrepreneurs admit they have all been very accustomed to going their own separate ways--they have recently begun to obtain state-of-the-art information, share data on world style trends, buy raw materials as a bloc, and respect each other's markets. Nor do their efforts end there. Another effort to remedy shortcomings pointed out by Monitor involves industrial conversion. The textile firms say they have invested over $400 million in state-of-the-art technology in order to catch up with the latest market developments, a step that has already gained recognition. For example, the ECONOMIST article points to the plans of COLTEJER, which "has cut its labor force from 8,900 to 7,200 in a matter of just a few months, invested $32 million in manufacturing systems, and cut back on its range of production"--previously amounting to some 4,000 lines--"by more than half." In short, Monitor's diagnosis is not far removed from reality, but some of its conclusions are nothing new to the entrepreneurs. Many of them were already in the works. Consequently, while relying on more active government intervention in terms of Customs supervision and control of the exchange rate, they look to the future with more optimism than does Monitor. "We shall make the necessary efforts, but we cannot change overnight without causing serious social problems," Gomez says. "If we were to accept all the recommendations, we might make our business more profitable, but we would be leaving the government with a serious social crisis, which we cannot do. We shall view it as our social mission."
