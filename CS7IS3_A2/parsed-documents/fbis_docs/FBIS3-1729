Kosei Fukunaga, second daughter of Pu Jie, spoke with reporters the day after his death and eulogized him as a kind, loving and unselfish father who was like a saint to her. Half of Pu Jie's ashes will return with his daughter to Japan and the other half will remain in China, she said. The remains of Pu Jie's wife and eldest daughter, which have stayed in Beijing, will be kept together in Nakayama shrine, she said. Pu Jie's younger brother, Aisin Giorro Pu Ren, joined her. "While he was living, father felt that he was indebted to many of his Japanese and Chinese friends," Fukunaga said solemnly in recalling the latter part of Pu Jie's life after New China was established. "Father's most unhappy thoughts were that mother died before he," she said. Dressed in a finely cut black jacket and matching skirt, Fukunaga, 53, remained composed while discounting Pu Jie's role as a high-level military official in the puppet state of Manchuria, set up by the Japanese Government in the early 1930s. "In such a wartime situation, he didn't have much choice," she said, adding that overcoming such an "adverse situation" made Pu Jie a better person in later life. Pu Jie, the younger brother of the last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, died Monday morning in a Beijing hospital from complications due to pneumonia and an enlarged thyroid gland. His funeral will be held on Monday at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery.
