So says a statement sent to TANJUG by Montenegro's Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic. In his opinion, these are the latest tragic consequences of the proclamation and recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina without securing a consensus of all three constituent peoples beforehand, a principle that was explicitly defined in the constitution of that republic at that time. Lekic, however, notes that the fundamental causes of the war do not exonerate the warring adventurers belonging to the sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina from responsibility for the activities which not only continue to cause further suffering among the innocent population, but also further diminish the possibility of finding a peaceful solution. To unquestioningly give in to everything that comes from the top brass cannot be in the national interest. This particularly refers to those things which irresponsibly undermine the efforts aimed at restoring peace. True patriotism, he adds, can be seen in those who, in addition to promoting national interests, advocate peace and respect for the rights of others and an end to the suffering of the population.
