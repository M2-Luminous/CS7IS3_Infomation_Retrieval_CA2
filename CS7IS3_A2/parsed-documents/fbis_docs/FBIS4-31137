The Council discussed the economic and other prerequisites for making the kuna a hard currency, the presidential office announced today. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic told the Council that the monetary reform in Croatia has been wound up by the introduction of a new Croatian currency whose international code is HRK 191. The stable and convertible kuna is a prerequisite for the further development of the Croatian economy. Valentic stressed that the government will continue to implement the stabilization program and to reform the Croatian economy. A significant production increase has been registered for the first time since 1987. The government will insist on financial discipline in payment transactions. Croatia has met all IMF conditions by implementing its economic program and is expected to sign a letter of intent with the IMF and conclude financial agreements with leading international financial institutions in the next few months. The Council commended the government, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, and Pero Jurkovic, governor of the National Bank of Croatia, for their efforts toward the introduction of the kuna and creating conditions for overall international financial support and development and for Croatia's economic renewal. The Council also discussed some foreign policy issues and Croatia's international position. The Council was informed about the construction of the Altar of the Homeland, a monument erected on Mount Medvednica overlooking Zagreb in memory of heroes who fell for Croatia's freedom, the Croatian president's office has announced.
