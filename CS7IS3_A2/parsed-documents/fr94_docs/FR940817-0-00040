FR940817-0-00040 FR940817-0-00016 50 CFR Part 651 [Docket No. 931076&hyph;4220; I.D. 071194C] Northeast Multispecies Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to make corrections and clarifications to the regulations implementing Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). EFFECTIVE DATES: This final rule is effective August 12, 1994 except for §651.9(a)(14) which is effective September 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christopher B. McCarron, NMFS, Fishery Management Specialist, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9139. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP on September 27, 1993. Two measures of the amendment were disapproved on September 30, 1993_one measure pertaining to a haddock possession limit, and the other pertaining to winter flounder fishing in state waters. The remainder of Amendment 5 was approved on January 3, 1994. The final rule for Amendment 5 was published on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872). This action makes several corrections and clarifications to that rule. Amendment 5 requires vessels in the Fleet days-at-sea (DAS) program, for multispecies trips longer than 24 hours, to tie-up (layover) at the dock at the end of each trip for half the amount of DAS accrued on the trip. Since many vessels, when in harbor, tie-up at a mooring instead of a dock and/or move between locations in the harbor to attend to operational needs such as refueling, a definition for ``tied-up to the dock'' has been added to §651.2 to clarify that a vessel may be tied to either a mooring or a dock and may move between locations in the same harbor during its layover period. This definition complies with the objectives of the FMP. From March 1 through July 31, vessels in the Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area are required by §651.20(a)(5) to have 6-inch (15.24-cm) square mesh in the last 140 bars of the codend and extension piece of all mobile net gear. The final regulation inadvertently did not define square mesh. To clarify the square-mesh requirement, a definition of ``square mesh'' has been added to §651.2. The final rule for Amendment 5 set forth how diamond mesh would be measured for enforcement purposes but inadvertently omitted the measurement technique for square mesh. Language is added to §651.20(g) to set forth the measurement technique for square mesh. The regulations implementing Amendment 5 allow vessels fishing for non-regulated species, in the regulated mesh areas, to obtain an exemption permit to fish with midwater trawl or purse seine gear. Although the FMP only requires such a permit in those areas that do not allow the stowage of small-mesh nets, the regulations are not clear and seem to require that such a permit be obtained for all areas. Sections 651.20(e) and 651.20(f) are revised to remove that ambiguity. According to the regulations as now written, a vessel, while its DAS are being appealed, may fish under the Fleet DAS program until a determination is made on the appeal. The regulations are not explicit, however, on whether a vessel that has received an initial allocation of individual DAS may fish pursuant to that initial allocation during an appeal of the amount of DAS allocated. In such a case, the vessel has received, independent of the appeal, authorization to fish under the individual DAS program. The fact that the vessel may be appealing the amount of DAS allocated does not preclude the vessel from fishing the individual DAS that are not in dispute. The regulations as originally written were intended only to define the rights of vessels that otherwise would not have any significant allocation of DAS while an appeal was pending. To clarify the intent, §651.22(b)(7) is revised to specify that vessels may elect to fish under the individual DAS program, while under appeal, if they have been initially allocated individual DAS, provided they do not exceed their initial allocation of DAS and remain in the individual DAS program for the remainder of the 1994&hyph;95 fishing season. In the October 27, 1993, proposed rule for Amendment 5 (58 FR 57774), dealer, operator and vessel permits were to expire upon the date specified in the permit. This was done to eliminate unnecessary renewal burdens to permit holders and to give the Regional Director the flexibility to deal efficiently with the administrative burden associated with permit renewals. The final regulatory language inadvertently specified that permits must be renewed annually. This was not the intent. Accordingly, changes are made to §651.4(i), §651.5(g), and §651.6(f) to remove the annual renewal requirement. A prohibition concerning the reporting requirements in §651.7(b)(1) was inadvertently omitted and is added at §651.9(a)(14). This prohibition requires federally permitted multispecies vessel operators to sell, barter, or trade multispecies finfish only to federally permitted multispecies dealers. This prohibition mirrors a prohibition at §651.9(e)(7) that prohibits federally permitted dealers from purchasing, possessing, or receiving multispecies from a vessel that does not hold a Federal multispecies permit, with the exception of vessels that fish exclusively in state waters. The regulation implementing Framework Adjustment 4 to the FMP (59 FR 26972) implemented a series of time and area closures for the sink gillnet fishery. Since these regulations prohibit sink gillnet operators from possessing gillnet gear aboard their vessel while in the areas and for the times specified in §651.32(a), vessels would be prevented from transiting a closed area while in possession of gillnet gear. Based on a review of the record, it is clear that the Council did not intend that gillnet vessels be precluded from accessing open areas. This action clarifies the Council's intent by adding language that will allow for net stowage pursuant to §651.20(c)(4) so that a gillnet vessel may transit a closed area. The Regional Director, pursuant to §651.20(c)(4)(iv) may specify by letter to permit holders additional methods for lawfully storing gillnet gear while transiting a closed area. Currently, §651.30 prohibits the transfer at sea of multispecies finfish. A review of the record revealed that this prohibition should have been limited to the transfer of regulated species. Section 651.30(a) and §651.30(b) have been revised to correct this error, as have the corresponding prohibitions in §651.9(a)(7) and §651.9(e)(5). Finally, this action accomplishes three other corrections: The metric conversion for winter flounder in §651.23(a) is corrected; in §651.22(c)(1)(i)(B), ``multispecies'' is replaced by ``regulated species;'' and clearer, more detailed versions of figures 1 and 3 are provided.
