Permission given the veteran activist to leave jail and seek medical treatment in the United States confirms a policy the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopted more than a year ago: To get rid of "troublemakers" by exiling them. The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has already cited the "release" of Wang as a sign of improvement in Beijing's human rights record. "Emigration" is one of criteria set forth in Mr. Clinton's executive order, the fulfilment of which is necessary for the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status in early June. In spite of Beijing's refusal to allow Han Dongfang and other exiled dissidents to return to China, Washington -- and Western governments in general -- have yet to decry this as a violation of the civil rights of Chinese citizens. "Almost all dissidents who have left China have seen their effectiveness as the custodians of the national conscience suffer," said political scientist Yan Jiaqi, who fled the country immediately after Tiananmen Square. Professor Yan, who recently moved to New York from Paris, added: "They are cut off from their soil. Moreover, even big names among exiles have to solve their livelihood problems. This detracts from their ability to pursue the (pro- democracy) crusade on a full-time basis." In spite of Wang's credentials as one of China's most respected and combat-hardened intellectuals, analysts are pessimistic that he could unify the badly fractured overseas dissident movement. Two other figures of comparable stature who have settled in the U.S. -- astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and Shanghai-based writer Wang Ruowang -- have disappointed their followers by failing to provide strong leadership. In the past two years, the flagship of the overseas dissident movement, the Paris-based Federation for a Democratic China, has splintered into six outfits most of whose leaders do not talk to each other. Friends of Wang Juntao said they would advise him not to join any of the six so as not to get bogged down with ugly in-fighting. And while Wang had to contend with the Herculean task of pursuing the pro-democracy crusade on alien soil, negotiating with Beijing over the terms of his return could be as daunting. The CCP administration has in the past year forced a number of "second-line" exiles to submit to humiliating conditions for their homecoming. These include pledges that upon returning to China, they abstain from "anti-government activities" and stay away from "underground political organisations." Beijing has, however, been adamant against letting prominent dissidents including Professors Yan and Fang, Han, and journalist Liu Binyan to go home on any terms. In most instances, the Chinese embassy in Washington and the consulates have simply refused to renew their Chinese passports. A West Coast-based dissident journalist indicated last week that Beijing was using the threat of permanent exile to "cow him into subservience". "Senior cadres visiting the U.S. have told me I have no hope of returning unless I stop writing `anti-Chinese' articles in Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers," the journalist said. "Last month, when a friend of mine renewed his passport at the local consulate, he was asked by the consular official to relay the same message to me." Both as a means of clinching MFN and to rid the administration of challengers, Beijing is expected to give more dissidents one-way tickets to the West. Yet if the CCP had the interests of the country at heart -- or even if it is merely committed to the much narrower goal of maintaining stability, as numerous party leaders have reiterated since January -- it should keep a more open mind. Setting free Wang -- with his unique background and experience -- and allowing him to stay in China could actually help Beijing defuse tension in the dissident community and society in general. In spite of Wang's reputation as the "black hand" of the 1989 movement and his being characterised by Premier Li Peng as a "tiger which should never be allowed to return to the hills," the economist and editor is a moderate within the pro-democracy movement. "Since his activism began in the late 1970s, Wang has always believed in evolutionary changes inside the system," a source said. During the Democracy Wall period, Wang worked with the liberal wing of the CCP, then led by the late party chief Hu Yaobang, to bring about progress from within. "Wang and Hu struck up a friendship which lasted into the early 1980s," the source said. In the three or so years before the June 4, 1989 crackdown, Wang -- together with fellow "black hand" Chen Ziming, who was also given 13 years in jail in 1991 -- was involved with a quasi-private institute for economic and social research as well as the now- defunct Economics Weekly, a paper that urged market reforms. "Wang has never advocated revolution," another friend said. "Right through early June 1989, he tried hard to prevent radicals among the students and intellectuals in the Square from directly confronting the regime." Until the eve of the massacre, Wang maintained ties with liberal cadres and the children of party elders. Analysts said if the hardline faction of the CCP could put aside its prejudices, Wang together with Chen, another candidate for "medical bail" -- would be an ideal mediator between Beijing and the dissidents. Instead, the CCP has refused to consider options other than using the weapons of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" to impose control. It is true that Beijing might, through a spate of detentions since the spring, be able to stifle the voice of opposition in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of June 4. However, the underlying causes of revolt -- hyperinflation, unemployment, corruption and the party's total refusal to share power are more acute now than in early 1989. Without the moderating influence of "evolutionists" like Wang and Chen, the next outbreak of the democracy movement could be more extreme -- and violent -- than ever. Packing the likes of Wang into exile merely ensures that when the conflagration erupts, there could be no dialogue between the administration and its critics.
