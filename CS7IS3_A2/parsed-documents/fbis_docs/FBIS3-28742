During the past years, we have surmounted numerous acute difficulties and surged forward. We have taken a very important step in curbing the socioeconomic crisis. The capabilities of our nation, people, party, and state have been enhanced amid difficulties and hardships. The achievements recorded on the internal and international fronts have created new opportunities for national development. However, our nation is still poor and the results of our economic activity are insufficient and uncertain. At the same time, hostile forces are attempting to undermine us, and social vices -- especially corruption and lavish spending -- are still prevalent. These are the great ordeals in our efforts to advance along the path chosen by our esteemed Uncle Ho, the party, and the people, which is aimed at making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and civilized so as to catch up with developments in countries around the world. Indeed, our past achievements have created favorable conditions for our country to enter a new stage of development. New opportunities as well as some acute ordeals are currently placing increased demands on our nation's capabilities. People throughout the country are concentrating their efforts to accelerate development by attaching importance to agriculture and changing the economic structure in the direction of industrialization and modernization. Efforts are also being made to improve social welfare, strengthen political stability, and consolidate national defense and security, thereby helping to extricate the nation from its socioeconomic crisis and lead it to a new, firm developmental position. Spring always comes with prospects; the greater the prospects, the more efforts must be made to attain them. We must seize opportunities to overcome any obstacles and only by overcoming obstacles will we be able to advance further. We must bear in mind that all developments depend chiefly on internal strength. People throughout the country are united and heading in the same direction, and as a result new opportunities will be seized and developed in the new year.
