Dubinin and Gromov are currently staying in Sevastopol as the Ukrainian side refused to allow them to enter Odessa, the Black Sea Fleet press centre quoted both men as saying at a joint news conference in Sevastopol on Wednesday. "While one side is studying the situation on the spot the other has been denied such a possibility, it is extremely hard to establish the truth," Gromov said. At the same time, he said that the research ship Cheleken which brought radar equipment from Odessa to Sevastopol did not violate Russian-Ukrainian agreements. However, the incidents in Odessa, including the seizure of a Black Sea Fleet reserve unit, "violate the spirit and the letter of the Massandra and other agreements," he added. He stressed that a Navy personnel department official has been sent to Odessa to find out the composition of the unit, how many sailors have taken the Ukrainian oath of allegiance, conditions of life and work in the unit and other circumstances. The participants in the press conference said that the incidents will be discussed at the upcoming round of Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet due to take place in Moscow at the end of April. Gromov believes "it is necessary to do everything possible in order not to whip up tension in the fleet." He said the Russian Navy is determined to "resolve all disputes over the fleet on a legal basis within the context of strengthening state relations between the Slavic states." He expressed the hope that the forthcoming talks will facilitate the implementation of the previously reached agreements to hand over Ukraine's part of the fleet to the Russian Navy. He regretted that since September 1993 Russia has been financing the fleet alone, although under the agreement Ukraine is supposed to cover 50 per cent of the expenses. Moreover, Ukraine has imposed customs duties, fines and even tax on land on the Black Sea Fleet, while exempting its own Armed Forces. "If the Black Sea Fleet is fully financed by the Russian Federation, it should become Russian," Gromov concluded.
