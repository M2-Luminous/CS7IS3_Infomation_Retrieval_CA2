[Peres] Not yet. There are two moves here; the UN Security Council vote, which was to take place later this evening, but was postponed by four hours and a dialogue, a debate, taking place between the United States and others regarding the nature of the resolution. At the same time, there is a move for the resumption of the talks with the PLO on the Gaza-and-Jericho agreement and on the conclusions that have to be drawn from the events in Hebron. [Ganor] What about your meeting? [Peres] My meeting comes in between these two moves. It is part of the attempt to design a complete move. [Ganor] Can we assume it will take place? [Peres] I cannot tell you before it is scheduled. I believe that the talks, the dialogue, will eventually resume. [Ganor] What will be in the center of your meeting with 'Arafat, when it takes place? [Peres] On the one hand there is the desire to speed up the process of completing the negotiations on the Gaza-and-Jericho agreement, and implementing it. We want this done as fast as possible. We would also like to see this through in a relatively short time. The other thing will be the need to see what can be done about Hebron to calm spirits and create a better atmosphere. It should be remembered that 'Arafat's source of power and authority is the entire Palestinian population in Judaea and Samaria, and not just in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. There is no doubt that the Hebron incident put him in an almost intolerable situation. He came under very harsh criticism in the territories. In the Palestinian camp, he is the only partner we have today with which we can talk peace. [Ganor] What are the steps Israel wants to take to bolster 'Arafat's standing? [Peres] It is not only a question of bolstering 'Arafat's standing. We need to dissolve the tremendous tension which was created in the territories, and spread as an angry wave through the Muslim and Arab world. We should remember that the reactions to the incident are no less severe than the incident itself. [Ganor] What are the steps Israel wants to take to help him? [Peres] I will not detail the steps. I will tell you, however, that we want the following points perfectly clear: First, we bear the responsibility for the security of all the residents, including the Arabs. They are nobody's prey. Second, we wish to hold a dialogue with the local residents about the appropriate steps that should be taken which will make them feel they are secure and that their needs are being considered. Third, all the means that are needed to create a new security situation, as recommended by our defense establishment, will be implemented. These are the three basic assumptions, more or less. [Ganor] What is your personal stand regarding moving the Jewish residents of Hebron into a single site? [Peres] My view -- what I can say outside the cabinet session and before a session is held -- is the following: First, any decision regarding sites or settlements throughout the territories should be made by Israel alone. It cannot be made as a result of external pressure or as part of negotiations with the PLO. This is strictly an Israeli decision. Israel, on its part, must be reasonable. It has to decide what is needed, what is logical, what is the price -- and I do not only speak of money. We are very thinly spread in very many places, and believe me that I fear for what might happen to one man or one woman here and there. Not everything can be provided for with security measures. The conclusions have to be drawn. Putting them on a map, in practical terms, will have to be done in the cabinet session. It is clear to me that the way we are spread in Hebron is intolerable. We have five sites scattered throughout the city in which some 400 Jews live among 120,000 Arab residents who today feel a tremendous need to protest. I fear for the security of each and everyone of them, and I am not just saying this. [Ganor] What is your stand regarding the evacuation of Jews from Tall al-Rumaytha? [Peres] I am not sure that the Declaration of Principles [DOP] covers the issue of Tall al-Rumaytha. The DOP speaks of settlements, not of sites which are not settlements, neighborhoods, or suburbs. It was established in between governments, when one government was leaving and another was not yet set up. Hence, the government will have to discuss the issue. I will not say what I think here, before a cabinet session is held. I will say, however, that Tall al-Rumaytha -- just as any other place -- cannot be an issue for negotiations with the Palestinians. It should be an Israeli Government decision, made by us alone. [Ganor] Does this also apply to carrying guns in areas densely populated by Arabs? [Peres] Certainly. That is, a distinction should be made between carrying arms for self defense and wielding arms for the sake of revenge -- which we will not allow. There is a difference between carrying weapons while on the roads or at work and carrying arms when you and suddenly go smashing windows or torch cars. That is: arms only for self defense, not for provocation. [Ganor] How long will it take to implement the Gaza-and-Jericho First plan? [Peres] Several weeks. Look, when you ask how long will it take to get there, you must first ask when do we start walking. The problem now is that we are standing still, hence there is no point in discussing the time of arrival at the destination. I believe that the fundamental change in the Palestinian public opinion will take place when they see a change in their reality. The Palestinian people had two prominent leaders in this century: The Jerusalem Mufti and Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat has been the head of the PLO and the most important Palestinian representative for the past 28 years. The Mufti was a leader for 40 years. He was the most popular leader. He kept saying no, no, no, and brought disaster after disaster on the Palestinian nation. He prevented them from establishing an Arab state on most of the territory of Eretz Yisra'el. He is the only one to blame for this. He caused the problem of refugees, and did not allow anyone to solve it. He caused the unification of Judaea and Samaria with Jordan, which no one later knew how to get rid of. He lived in negation, and this is how he died. He demanded everything only to end up with nothing, and brought nothing but sorrow and loss of life to his nation. At first, 'Arafat also started off this way. At a certain point he changed his way, and said: Let us opt for a concrete thing, not something theoretical. If the negotiations succeed, 'Arafat will be the first Palestinian leader in history who will receive, for the Palestinians, a territory, a budget, responsibility, an address, a flag -- since the Palestinians have never had neither a state nor an autonomy. 'Arafat told me: Do you want to make me a mayor of one town? I told him: Listen Sir, when Israel was established, there were only 650,000 Jews here. You start off with 1 million Palestinians. This is a great thing. [Ganor] Will Israel help Yasir 'Arafat? [Peres] The State of Israel will help its Palestinian neighbor. We have a vested interest in seeing them succeed. We do not want our neighbors to live in poverty, fear, or bitterness. This would be a terrible life. Furthermore, this will spill over to our side as well as to their side. We can change relations between neighbors. We have no desire to change our neighbors, their opinions, location, or nationality. We are making a supreme effort to improve or change the relations between the Arab and the Jewish nations.
