The day before yesterday, Ciro criticized an alliance with the PMDB. Fleury said yesterday that "instead of speaking cholerically, the governor ought to taking care of the cholera in his state"--a reference to the fact that Ceara leads the nation in cholera cases. "All indications are that he (Ciro) wants to become a candidate thanks to Fernando Henrique's failure," Fleury said. Fleury also said that it was the president of the PSDB, Tasso Jereissati, who had asked him to initiate talks. He said sarcastically: "Since they are both from the same state, they should have discussed the matter." Ciro Gomes reacted with sarcasm to the statement that he was unable to control cholera in Ceara and that that was why he was making choleric statements. "I think that shot was fired from Carandiru," he said, referring to the massacre of 111 prisoners at Carandiru in 1992. "The shot was fired from Carandiru because, first of all, cholera is an epidemic all over Latin America, and governments have little control over it in the present circumstances. Second, because treating its effects requires good health care. And since health care is a municipal responsibility, it is the responsibility of the local government, which here in Fortaleza has been under the control of Fleury's PMDB for many years," Gomes said. The governor also said that he "would rather leave politics" than appear on the same platform as the former governor of Sao Paulo, Orestes Quercia, in the presidential race. "The PSDB came into existence as a rejection of Quercia politics, which constitutes the worst element of Brazilian politics, and for that reason an electoral alliance will not have my support," Ciro said. The PSDB leadership believes that Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes has decided to enter the race for president of the republic. Ciro's statements bombarding the already difficult alliance with the PMDB, his attacks on Lula, and his constant attempts to obtain space in the media are leading PSDB leaders--mainly those in Sao Paulo--to bet that Ciro's short-term goal is Planalto Palace. Ciro's sudden appearance in the presidential scenario has intensified the quarrel between the Ceara and Sao Paulo groups of the PSDB. Although it is not admitted publicly, there are disagreements between the two wings. The view of the group closest to Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is that although it may not have been intentional, Ciro has done a great disservice to Fernando Henrique's plan and indirectly to the minister's candidacy by provoking a verbal duel with the PMDB. If Fernando Henrique is unable to make his candidacy work, the Ceara governor will have room to become a presidential candidate himself, say PSDB members close to the minister. But even while criticizing Ciro's attack on the PMDB, top PSDB leaders admit that an electoral alliance between the two parties was already practically impossible anyway. In the PSDB, there is talk of the "Garrincha effect" in the group put together by Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul) to unite the two parties for the October elections. The reference is to the soccer player who, following a complicated explanation by his coach on how to reach the opposing goal, asked: "Did you make a deal with the opponent?" In this case, the opponents are former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia and the quarrels between the PMDB and PSDB at the state level. Relations between the two parties are very complicated in such states as Sao Paulo, Ceara, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Parana, and others. Members of the PSDB, especially Senator Mario Covas (Sao Paulo), have been saying over and over that in combined elections like those to be held in October, it will be very difficult to explain to the voters why state alliances are different from the national alliance. In talks with PSDB leaders, Simon has been insisting that a strong movement for union between the two parties might corral Quercia and make him refrain from running for president. But neither Simon nor Deputy Luiz Henrique, the PMDB's national president, who also wants a coalition, can give a conclusive answer when the PSDB asks them for guarantees that the agreement will not be shot down by Quercia. The PSDB comes away from its talks with the PMDB with the impression that former Minister Antonio Britto is beginning to enjoy the talk about a possible presidential candidacy. But Britto also fears Quercia's influence in a possible boycott of his candidacy. Ciro Meets With Maluf, Gives Speech Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) will begin his schedule today by having breakfast with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]), after which he will address 27 foreign press correspondents stationed in Brazil. The subject of Ciro's speech will be "Post-Collor Brazil and Economic Prospects for 1994." The journalists are in Fortaleza to attend the seminar on "Foreign Correspondents and National Reality" that is being sponsored jointly by the Ceara Secretariat of Culture and the National Federation of Journalists. According to Ciro, the meeting with Maluf "is a gesture" of courtesy, and the meeting with journalists has no connection with the presidential race. "Actually, I am an anticandidate. If I wanted to be a candidate, I would be traveling around the Amazon Region or involved in administrative matters rather than making statements that only make enemies for me," he said.
