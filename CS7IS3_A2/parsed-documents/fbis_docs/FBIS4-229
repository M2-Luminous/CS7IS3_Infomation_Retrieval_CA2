FBIS4-229 "drafr066_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela To Meet Natal ANC Leaders on Elections Mandela To Meet Natal ANC Leaders on Elections MB0604092394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0907 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604092394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Clive Govender] [Text] Durban April 6 SAPA -- African National Congress President Nelson Mandela will meet Natal ANC leaders in Durban on Wednesday to review the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] contention that elections cannot be held in kwaZulu in the current political climate. A working committee, comprising representatives from the IEC and the South African and kwaZulu governments, concluded on Tuesday that several factors, linked to the politically charged climate in kwaZulu, would render free and fair elections improbable. These included high levels of political intolerance and intimidation and the fact the kwaZulu civil service and tribal structures were unable to assist the process for a free and fair election. ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Wednesday's meeting with Mr Mandela would centre on the IEC announcement, and "give full consideration to the implication of that announcement and provide a preliminary response". "The present climate of violence makes it impossible for free and fair elections (in Natal and kwaZulu) but it is too early to make a decision." Mr Mamoepa said a full statement will be issued after the internal meeting. Meanwhile, IEC Chairman Justice Johan Kriegler said a decision on whether elections could be postponed in Natal or not, was a political one, which lay outside of the IEC's ambit of jurisdiction. The matter is expected to be high on the agenda of Friday's summit between F W de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Mr Mandela travelled to Durban on Wednesday to address a youth conference at the University of Durban-Westville, and will then meet with the leadership of Natal's three ANC regions. ANC Midlands spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande said the meeting would focus on elections in Natal and "yesterday's (Tuesday) development gives it an added significance". The SA Congress of Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party will also attend the meeting, which comes amid spiralling violence in the province. Since the declaration of the state of emergency last Thursday, about 100 people have died in political bloodletting in Natal, and last month's toll reached nearly 300 -- the highest recorded in several years.
