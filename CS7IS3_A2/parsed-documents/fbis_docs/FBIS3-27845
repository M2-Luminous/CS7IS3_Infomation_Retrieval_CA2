Presiding Judge Yoji Okahisa rejected the suit by ruling that "In Pakistan there is no objective reason to fear persecution, so refugee status does not apply." "The domestic situation is such that no criminal penalties would be applied aside from using the name of Islam publicly," the court decided. The six men and two women had filed suit against the justice minister to be recognized as refugees by the Japanese Government, saying they feared persecution for their religious activities in Pakistan. In 1984, the Pakistani Government pronounced a law that prohibited the Ahmadi Sect from identifying itself with Islam and including criminal penalties for religious activities. The eight plaintiffs arrived in Japan in 1988 with the help of the sect's Nagoya branch office. Claiming that they feared being arrested if they returned to Pakistan, the eight applied for refugee status with Nagoya immigration authorities, receiving an extension to stay in Japan while waiting for a decision. Immigration authorities decided, however, there was no concrete evidence of persecution. Meanwhile, the extensions to their visas expired while they pleaded their case from 1990 to 1992 in a series of suits.
