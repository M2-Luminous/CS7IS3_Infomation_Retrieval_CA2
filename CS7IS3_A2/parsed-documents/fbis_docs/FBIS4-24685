Shi Jiliang, governor of the Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said that money raised in the Tianjin financial market amounted to 36.6 billion yuan in 1993, next only to the financial market in Shanghai. He said that Tianjin ranks second among the eight largest financial markets in China -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Xian, Chongqing, Wuhan and Shenyang. Tianjin currently has 1,598 financial institutions, including 1,048 banks, employing a total of 34,000 people. Governor Shi described the financial sector as a "driving force" behind Tianjin's economic growth. "Tianjin's financial sector has continued its strong growth since the beginning of this year," he said. For example, banks in the city took in 65 billion yuan in savings deposits and extended 80 billion yuan in loans in the first four months of 1994. Shi said that the rapid growth of the financial sector was due primarily to the reform of the financial system over the past few years. As a result, Tianjin has introduced a new financial system, with the state-owned banks as the mainstay, and non-banking institutions and foreign banks as the subsidiary. The system also consists of an inter-bank borrowing and lending market, a securities market and a foreign exchange swap market. To date, financial institutions in other parts of China have set up 38 subsidiaries in Tianjin, Shi said. Since October 1992 banks from Britain, France and the United States have opened 12 branches in Tianjin, he added. The Tianjin securities trading center now has 300 trading seats, three trading halls and 213 members, he said, adding that 5.6 billion worth of treasury bonds changed hands there in the first quarter of 1994. "The foreign exchange market in Tianjin is brisk, too," Shi said. In the first four months of this year, about 500 million U.S. dollars changed hands in the Tianjin foreign exchange swap center, providing an impetus to the growth of foreign-funded firms and export-led companies, he said. Speaking of the financial reform, Shi Jiliang said that it is imperative to improve macro-economic control means and the financial market, and introduce an efficient operational system in specialized state-owned banks. To this end, existing specialized banks will be turned into commercial banks, a financial supervisory system instituted and intermediate financial agencies established, he said. He also revealed that Tianjin plans to open the country's third stock exchange in the future, after Shanghai and Shenzhen.
