During those three days of mourning, dozens of youths, regardless of political affiliation, would clash with troops. Both Fatah and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] had an interest in assuring that those confrontations did not get out of control. The ceremonies held would offer speeches in his memory, his courage would be extolled and many tears, some of them, at least, crocodile tears, would be shed at the funeral home in the Jibalya refugee camp. If 'Aqel's name had not been erased from the IDF's wanted list, if he had remained in resistance and refused to submit himself to the local leadership, he would have been put at the top of Fatah's wanted list on 14 December. In calling for mourning in his memory, Fatah is attempting to show that a local hero is everyone's hero. But there are lists. The lists of wanted Fatah hawks are being crossed out these days. Their names have been erased by the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Whoever appears on the list goes to the offices of the Palestinian delegation in the Rimal quarter, receives the honor due him, leaves his weapons and is accompanied by a young local leader to a final meeting, so it is hoped, with General Security Service [GSS] personnel. Some Fatah wanted men still resist. It is not that they will not turn themselves in, they say, but only after the 13th of the month, and only to Fatah. Fatah is already preparing, very energetically, to take control of the area. What is not clear is whether Fatah/Gaza and Fatah/Tunis see this exactly eye to eye. The interface with Israel, if it can be put that way, has been made in a number of ways: Fatah/Tunis-Israel; Fatah/Gaza-Israel; Fatah/Tunis-Fatah/Gaza; Fatah/Gaza-Hamas/Gaza. These connections sometimes have become entangled. That is what happened during a visit to Gaza early this week by 'Abdallah al-Faz'a, who is set to become the local inspector-general of police. His visit was coordinated through Fatah/Tunis with the civil administration. Senior commanders escorted him and showed him the facilities and road axes that will be under his control. The youths who control the offices in the Rimal quarter were not permitted to accompany him. They did not hide their rage at the arrangement. "He goes around the area like a prisoner of the IDF," they said, but meant someone else: 'Arafat, who sent him, thinks that we are his captives. For the moment, it seems that Palestinian security forces, like everything in the IDF, will be divided into three: a police force, which will deal with civil matters (property crimes, traffic, neighbors' quarrels). It will not lack for work. A-Faz'a will be in charge of it. A larger force, which will be composed mostly of men from the Palestine Liberation Army, under the command of Yusuf Naser, will be responsible for security--the autonomy area borders, guarding the roads and general security, including responsibility for seeing that men like 'Imad 'Aqel do not continue their activities against Jews in the strip. If they try to attack Jews in Tel Aviv, that will be Israel's responsibility. It looks as though the physical base of this force will be the installation that the IDF division stationed in the center of Gaza used as its headquarters. There will also be an intelligence service, a "GSS" as it is called by young Gazans, many of whom have encountered the original up close. To the general security force will be attached a unit for protecting people. Twenty-two of them returned this week from official training in Egypt. In most Third World countries, official bodyguards also serve as a status symbol. Among other things, they are living proof that you are a leader. When he served as a minister, Avner Shaqi demanded a bodyguard. At the time, some said that Shaqi wanted to feel important. It will be a little different in Gaza. The bodyguards assigned to Dr. Zecharaya al-'Ara, for example, do, indeed, mark him as a leader, but as a leader of a particular type, someone not in favor with everyone. Who will be the commander of the GSS? That question draws an enigmatic laugh at the delegation's headquarters in Gaza. "It will be someone, don't worry, and the Palestinian GSS will definitely work long hours. Everything here will be GSS," one key activist tells me. Aharon Domb and his colleagues on the Yesha council claimed this week that the GSS will work against them. Through information that they provided the media, they attempted to portray the GSS as a political tool, but they painted it as a bungling organization, installing easily discovered listening devices and trying to recruit Gabi Butbul, chairman of the Qarney Shomron council. The Palestinian GSS, it seems, will not use bugs. It will tell people to spill the beans. Will you also work against Hamas? I ask my man in Gaza. "That's not the problem," he says. "We know perfectly well who's who in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. If someone hides and refuses to obey, we'll found him in a few hours. The street can expose him." Do you know, for example, who murdered the lawyer Abu-Sha'aban As'ad Siftawi? "Whoever knows knows," says my contact. "It's true that the killer is still free at large, but after we take control, whoever needs to decide will decide what to do with him." Hamas members well know that the period approaching will not be easy for them. The optimists among them are afraid that they'll sit behind bars in the coastal prison, which will soon be turned over to the Palestinians. The pessimists fear a more vicious script. A PLO man, Tufiq Abu-Husa, tries to put me at ease. "Hamas is against the agreement but not against Fatah." It is known that Fatah and Hamas have stable understandings in Gaza that, until now, since the signing of the agreement on principles, have been strictly observed. Now, when the PLO must take responsibility for the security of Jews as well, but the goal of Hamas is precisely to undermine that security, a confrontation is likely to be created. It can be expected that Hamas men will keep their heads down. They are wily and sophisticated, they want a share of the administration, and more than a few of them will look forward calmly and confidently to reaping the fruits of the internal rivalry foreseen within Fatah itself. "The only way we'll be able to work peacefully in all of Palestine," says Abu-Husa, "is through the route of democracy and the rule of law. We learned democracy in the Israeli prison. We were all there, we all understood that without democratic decisions among ourselves and without obedience to those decisions, we wouldn't achieve anything. I'm sure that everyone knows that." It still is not clear how the law will be seen or who will issue orders. It is clear, however, that "whoever breaks the law will be judged by the law," as Abu-Husa says. One month ago, he tells me, the Shati and Jibalya camps, through democratic elections, selected local representatives for the Fatah leadership. "'Arafat might be able to tell me to leave my office in the delegation," one of the activists tells me, fearing that might actually happen, "but that won't do him any good. Instead of going to my office, people will just come to see me at home." The offices are packed with people just now. People with problems. One has a relative who has been arrested, another has a property dispute with a neighbor, a third wants to turn himself in. Most of the problems are solved efficiently. When the Fatah youths speak about the need for democracy, one can interpret is as a veiled threat to Hamas. It can also be interpreted as something else--a broad hint for 'Arafat, not exactly someone people see as a pillar of democracy. Rehav'am Ze'evi said in the Knesset this week that if he is stopped by an armed Palestinian policeman, he will shoot to kill. Ze'evi and a faction of the settlers apparently still do not grasp what is going to happen on the ground. Before they are stopped by a Palestinian policeman, they will be stopped by an Israeli officer or soldier. Residents of Gush-Qatif will be permitted to travel only on certain roads. The IDF will prevent them from entering Gaza city and will occupy the same control points at the entrances to the strip that it mans now. A substantial border fence will mark the boundary. The IDF will patrol the bypass route to Gush-Qatif. Some of the military outposts on that road will remain in place, some will be dismantled and some will handed over to the Palestinians. So far, the residents of Gush-Qatif have opposed the installation of an IDF base on the settlement. They have contended that it would impinge on their quality of life. They seemed to be softening last week. Even now, although they have not noticed it, they live behind a fence. At the civil administration offices on 'Omer al-Mukhtar Street, the entire civic system will be managed in a sort of government compound. It will be staffed at the professional level by the same Palestinians who provide most of the services today. It is possible that the bosses will come from Tunis to get a secretary and an official car. Contacts are now under way between local representatives and the civil administration concerning computers. The IDF will take with it all the hardware, which was bought with tax revenues collected from residents of the strip, who also financed the administration's operations. The current discussion is over software. A complete work-up of the strip's residents lies within the administration's computer, including economic data, tax collection accounts and property holdings. There is also information of a security nature, which is the source of the discussion. If the administration doesn't give us the data, say delegation officials, no great loss. Our own information is just as good. Most branches of the administration will cross over to the Israeli side of the Erez checkpoint. Instead of "administration," it will be called the "coordination team." A need will exist for coordination between the local and Israeli authorities. The level of coordination on civil matters is already high; the hope is that it will remain so. It must be assumed that the two sides also have an interest in fostering coordination in secret services. The Palestinians were very angry when they found out that Israel had planted agents and bugs in the PLO's offices in Tunis. It is doubtful whether they would refuse to share information. The Palestinians learned more than democracy in Israeli prisons; some of them also acquired the fundamentals of their professional training. 'Abd al-Salam Abu-'Asab and Sa'ud Abu-Ramadan slept in beds side by side in the tents of the Antzar 2 camp in Gaza. Both were "Shabiba" activists. In prison, they were ordered by the leadership to prepare a daily newspaper roundup for the prisoners. Their comrades would comb garbage dumps, scavenging Israeli newspapers thrown away by the soldiers, which the pair then translated and edited. Today, on the outside, they are very busy professionals. One works for THE WASHINGTON POST, the other for a European television network. One works for MA'ARIV, the other for YEDI'OT AHARONOT. They have a competition. One is known for his scoops, the other for his skilled writing and analysis. You can see them together at most events. The pair received instructions this week to go to Jordan for six weeks advanced study in television in preparation for the start of operations of the autonomy broadcast network to be run by Radwan Abu-'Ayish. The pair jointly refused the behest. The timing is inconvenient for them. Between 7 and 14 December, they are swamped with requests from foreign networks for assistance, translation, escorting and even for booking local hotel accommodations for the television crews. "There's going to be a lot of work in December," says Abu-Ramadan. As a journalist, he cannot allow himself to listen to lectures in Aman while the story of his life is taking place at home: the start of the IDF's withdrawal and the beginning of autonomy. There is also a practical aspect--the foreign networks will pay him and his colleagues hundreds of dollars a day. What they will do during the week of December 7 to 14 cannot be compared to what they have earned over the entire past half year. Campaigns, the biography of Hafiz al-Asad, came out in Hebrew this week. It was written by Patrick Seale, the official biographer of the Syrian ruler. The military publication has an interesting timing. Shortly after the outbreak of the intifadah, a Hebrew translation was done of Alistair Horan's book on the Algerian war of liberation. This highly relevant book has since been distributed to all generals on the general staff. Is this a sign that someone high up believes that al-Asad's time has come? Indeed, although Rabin is stepping on the brakes, his formula, "withdrawal in proportion to peace," is also acceptable to the Syrians. More than a small portion of his talks in Washington was devoted to this subject. Mubarak sent a message early this week, and Warren Christopher, who will arrive here next Friday, will try to come up with a creative idea to budge the negotiations out of the rut they are stuck in. It is for precisely that reason that he has already spent a week lowering expectations, but unofficial meetings recently held between Israelis and Syrians in Europe indicate that there is something to talk about. The current catchphrase is "Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan." Does this mean that al-Asad is now ready to let settlements stay on the heights? Al-Asad will not say. Al-Asad first wants to hear that Rabin is ready, but from the Americans, not from Rabin himself. The idea of leaving Israeli settlements under Syrian sovereignty gets a bitter laugh at the settlement council on the Golan. What is the purpose of getting the Jews of Syrian out of Damascus when we're going to add 13,000 people to the community? "I'm sure that if Rabin weren't prime minister, he would be running our lobby," says Yehuda Wolmann, chairman of the regional council and a Rabin man in the Labor Party. Someone in the prime minister's office has told the Golan settlers that Peres' foreign ministry will not handle the Syrian deal. That will reassure some people. Wolmann is calmed by work ("You really can't say that I'm calm," he says. "I'm still not sleeping well at night because of the political climate"), by the fact that development plans and investments on the Golan have not been disrupted. In fact, a new mall, Lev Qatzrin, recently opened in Qatzrin, new roads have been built all across the Golan Heights, 1,700 housing units are nearing completion, a new holiday village has just been finished in Neveh-Ativ, 46 new cow barns have been erected and there are also plans for construction of a tourist resort, a volcanic park in the hill country. The plans call for vista points, hiking trails, camping cabins and a visitors center. The problem is that unlike other ministers, Minister of Tourism 'Uzi Bar'am, apparently for reasons not unrelated to his political outlook, is somewhat reluctant to pour in money. "Eventually, we'll take this from him," Wolmann vows. He is also sure, and relatively calm as a result, that there will be no arrangement over the Golan without elections or a national referendum, in which it is clear that most of the nation would vote against withdrawal. He is also certain that the Labor Party will not abandon the banner of security and settlement.
