He said: This year will be a crucial year for China's economic structural reform. State-launched reforms of the financial, banking, taxation, foreign exchange, and foreign trade systems have proceeded smoothly. As long as we firmly grasp the overall interests of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability," and as long as we translate the guideline of "combining comprehensive coordinated reform with breakthroughs in key areas" into concrete actions, we will surely be able to smoothly achieve the various reform targets this year. In the course of implementation, all localities should pay attention to the following four areas: 1) It is necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of various reform programs introduced by the central authorities by subordinating local to national interests and working hard to gradually establish a socialist market economic system; 2) It is necessary to go all-out to change the operating mechanisms of enterprises to gradually establish a modern enterprise system; 3) It is necessary, in line with the spirit of the "decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to earnestly implement the reform of macroeconomic regulation and control formulated by the central authorities under unified plans, and to study and formulate other reforms in light of the realities of each locality to facilitate sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; 4) It is necessary to properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. On 31 March and 1 April, Li Tieying and Vice Minister He Guanghui of the State Economic Restructuring Commission inspected the Tianjin Stock Exchange, the Lisheng Pharmaceutical Plant, and the Lida Group International Emporium in the company of Tianjin party Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor Zhang Lichang, and they heard briefings by the municipal party committee and the municipal government on Tianjin's experimentation with comprehensive coordinated reform. After hearing the briefings, Li Tieying said: Following the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Tianjin municipal party committee and government took the initiative to explore ways to establish a socialist market economic system, and they put forward a number of pilot projects for comprehensive coordinated reform. They have attached great importance to the pilot projects, thus fostering sound ideas and adopting effective measures in formulating and implementing pilot and special projects. After seriously studying Tianjin's pilot projects, the State Economic Restructuring Commission and other relevant State Council departments on 15 January 1994 approved Tianjin as the city designated by the state for experimenting with the comprehensive coordinated reform of the economic structure. As one of China's three municipalities directly under the central government, Tianjin is the economic center of the Bohai Rim economic zone, as well as a major economic, trade, and port city in northern China. The municipality's reform and development have a vital bearing on the country as a whole. Discussing areas to which Tianjing as a key economic city must pay close attention in the next-phase reform, Li Tieying said: First, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of readjusting the structure of industries and to energetically develop tertiary industry, which is very important for bringing into play the key economic city's functions. An underdeveloped tertiary industry will inevitably make the municipality dependent on industrial enterprises for financial revenues and aggravate the predicament of enterprises, while a developed tertiary industry can provide the municipality with more financial revenues and give old enterprises a chance to recuperate and build up their strength. Second, it is necessary to cultivate new economic growth points. In seeking development, village and township enterprises should implement a shareholding cooperative system, and a small number of qualified enterprises may try out stock systems. This will be a general trend of economic development. The expansion of nonstate economic sectors is an objective demand of the socialist market economy. Therefore, we should encourage the healthy development of individual, privately owned, and foreign-funded economic sectors. Third, it is necessary to attach importance to maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets, and to readjusting the structure of state-owned assets. The transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises is essential for invigorating the state sector of the economy. However, the transaction must be conducted according to standards and must avoid the losses of state-owned assets during the entire process from the assessment of assets to the transfer of property rights. The transfer of state-owned enterprises' property rights should be approved by the investment organization authorized by the state, while the transfer of property rights of enterprises owned by the central government should be approved by the investment organization designated by the central government. A government system of assessing assets and approving the transfer of property rights in accordance with the principle of unified state ownership and supervision by governments at different levels should be established to avoid confusion.
