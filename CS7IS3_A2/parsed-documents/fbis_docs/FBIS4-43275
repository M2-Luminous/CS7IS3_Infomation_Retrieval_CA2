Replying to correspondents' questions, Papoulias once again expressed opposition to the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin Papoulias recording] Greece has always defended its national sovereign rights in the Aegean and this position has not changed, whether it concerns the state power for the extension [of territorial waters] to 12 miles, or the air space, where Greece's positions have been firm since the first PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government. Engaging Balkan powers in the massacre of the former Yugoslavia causes additional problems instead of alleviating the situation. The presence of Turkish forces in Bonsia-Herzegovina indeed makes things more difficult and, I believe, particularly causes more tension in the inter-Balkan relations. [end recording]
