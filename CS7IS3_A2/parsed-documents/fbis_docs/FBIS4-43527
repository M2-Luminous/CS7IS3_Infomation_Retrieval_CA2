One week after the referendum on European Union membership, the SPOe wants to use the impetus of the European elections for the forthcoming Nationalrat election campaign. In his speech which lasted almost one hour, SPOe Chairman Vranitzky yesterday reminded the 300 delegates that the issue "on 9 October" is "approval for a course of economic prosperity and social security." And addressing Haider: "The SPOe intends to turn its election movement into a large-scale campaign against the new edition of contempt for democracy." The SPOe chairman did not leave any doubt that he wants to continue bearing the coalition partner in the government. With the unanimous adoption of the electoral program (150,000 additional jobs) and the list of candidates, the course was set to bring this about. Vranitzky himself is the top candidate on the federal list and also on the Vienna [provincial] ticket. The SPOe top candidate in Burgenland is Health Minister Krammer, in Carinthia Deputy Anton Leikam, in Lower Austria Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, in Upper Austria SPOe Economic Spokesman Nowotny, in Salzburg SPOe Deputy Harald Hofmann, in Styria Heidrun Silhavy, in Tirol Walter Guggenberger, in Vorarlberg SPOe Federal Councilor Herbert Boesch. Banker Rene Alfons Haider is also running for the Nationalrat: on the promising 25th place of the SPOe's federal ticket.
