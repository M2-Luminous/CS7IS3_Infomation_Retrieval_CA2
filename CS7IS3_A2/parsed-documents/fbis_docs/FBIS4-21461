In the talks, the minister stated that a decision on dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the sea should be made only by the Russian Government, and that the Maritime Kray administration has no authority to independently decide on the issue. Minister Danilov-Danilyan made the remarks in response to Ambassador Watanabe's concern over Japanese media reports that the Maritime Kray administration seems to be preparing to authorize additional dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the Sea of Japan. In proposing that Japan provide financial and technological assistance to Russia at an opportune time, Minister Danilov-Danilyan stated that it would be possible for Russia to completely prevent the dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the sea if it can construct temporary tanks for storing the radioactive wastes in the maritime region with Japanese cooperation. In the meeting with Ambassador Watanabe on 4 April, Minister Danilov-Danilyan highly appraised Japan's cooperative position in the field of dealing with nuclear wastes. Moreover, the minister assured that Russia would conduct a thorough environmental survey at storage tanks for liquid radioactive wastes as well as facilities for solidifying these wastes.
