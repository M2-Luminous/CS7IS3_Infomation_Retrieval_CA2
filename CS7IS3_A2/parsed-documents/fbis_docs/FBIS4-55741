FBIS4-55741 "dreeu098_d_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-098 Daily Report 11 May 1994 SLOVAKIA Company Develops New 9-mm Pistol for Army Company Develops New 9-mm Pistol for Army AU1905160594 Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 11 May 94 p 5 AU1905160594 Bratislava PRAVDA Slovak BFN [Article by Emil Bajanek: "First Slovak; A New Pistol for the Slovak Army"] [Text] In the second half of the year, the range of short-barreled small arms on our market will be extended with a 9-mm pistol, the model PS 93 Parabellum, manufactured by the Povazske Strojarne [Vah Valley Engineering Works] a.s. at Povazska Bystrica. This individual automatic weapon is intended for firing at targets within a range of 50 meters, but it can be used for firing at more distant targets, as well. The pistol has a 15-cartridge magazine. Engineer Dusan Melioris, director of the Povazske Strojarne Research Institute, says that this top-quality product builds on the company's production of small firearms that was discontinued in 1954. The Army of the Slovak Republic currently does not have a pistol of this caliber in its arsenal. The weapon had been developed for sports shooting, particularly for combat shooting enthusiasts. The well-balanced pistol is distinguished by its extraordinary precision. The most up-to-date technical methods have been applied in its design. The pistol has a locked breech system [uzamknuty zaverovy system] and the automatic repeat function is secured by a short recoil of the barrel. The pistol has a push-pull triggering mechanism [mechanizmus napinania bicieho kohuta pistole je dvojcinny] and is equipped with a manual safety catch, and, after the last cartridge has been fired, the breech mechanism becomes locked in the rear position, says Melioris. From the head of the Research Institute's Technical Department, we have learned that once production reaches full capacity, some 300 employees will be involved in the implementation of this supplementary production program of Povazske Strojarne. He also mentioned that, following the federation's partition, the development of the pistol was not without certain hitches. Povazske Strojarne will exhibit the pistol model PS 93 Parabellum in several modifications at the specialized IDET [expansion unknown] exhibition in Brno at the beginning of June. In cooperation with the Syndicate of Slovak Journalists and the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the manufacturer is preparing a demonstration of the weapon on 8 June. The demonstration will take place in the Turecky Vrch military training compound. During our visit to Povazske Strojarne, our hosts also acquainted us with the first Slovak pistols equipped with an optical or laser direction finder. The creatively designed wood-lined butt attracted our interest because it is perfectly adjusted to the anatomy of the hand and is a comfortable fit. Povazske Strojarne will also be manufacturing ammunition for the pistol. Until recently, local engineers produced some 50 different types of cartridges.
