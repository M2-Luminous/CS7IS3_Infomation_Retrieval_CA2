A 10-point plan was put forward outlining how the Nordic area can influence the EU if Sweden, Norway, and Finland become members. According to the yes-organizations it is chiefly on women's and environmental issues and in the field of labor market policy that the Nordic area can make a positive contribution to the EU. "We are entering an EU where there are many men with gray hair and gray suits. But this was also the situation in the Nordic area 25 years ago. This is simply a new challenge. All organizations working for equality inside the EU welcome the Nordic countries," said Ines Uusman, who leads Sweden's Social Democrats for the EU. The 10 points are of necessity pretty woolly in their formulation, since the yes-organizations attract voters from many different parties and countries. There is also a big difference for the yes-side in Finland where they have a majority of 48 percent for the EU against 32 percent against in the polls, compared with Sweden and Norway where the no-side has the upper hand. "But there are also big differences between Sweden and Norway," Carl Hamilton, chairman of "Yes to Europe," pointed out. "In Norway people have already entered the trenches, while Swedes will reply `don't know' or have a weak preference in one direction or the other." Therefore influencing public opinion in Sweden is easier. According to Hamilton, another difference is that fact that in Sweden there are no credible leaders on the no-side. "The only political parties saying no are the Green Ecology Party and the Left Party which both have fairly unusual leaders." In Norway Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein has been proclaimed "no-queen." But the Socialist Left Party has also begun to move in recent opinion polls and has topped 10 percent. With its 140,000 members, "No to the EU" is bigger than any political party. Kalevi Sorsa, who leads the organization called "A Better Alternative -- Finland in Europe," pointed out that the Finns attach greater importance to security policy and see the EU as a more secure alternative to the country's standing alone. For the other yes-organizations people's fears of losing their prosperity, equality, and jobs are what are being mentioned most often as the biggest challenge to overcome. "The voters are used to the fact that the political situation in Europe has been stable, and it has been most stable in the Nordic area. Now we are part of a Europe in turbulence, and there are many people who want to withdraw. Political nostalgia is flourishing, but it is our common task to explain that we have to go on the offensive to meet this," said Inge Lonning, who leads the Norwegian Europe Movement. "The real world is chaotic and turbulent. Joint Nordic membership of the EU will have an influence and is the alternative which will give the greatest security," Inge Lonning said.
