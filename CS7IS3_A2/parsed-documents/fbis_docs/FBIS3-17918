Some time ago, for his nationalist convictions, he had the good fortune to be imprisoned by our democratic authorities; he was also subject to repression by the communists. Today, he is head of the political department of the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA]. He has never put forward his candidacy for a people's deputy seat, because he thinks the soviets are still soviets. [Blazhko] Mr. Lupynis, how can you explain the present government's repressions against the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense [UNA-UNSO]? [Lupynis] It happened due to the fact that Ukraine has already lost 99 percent of its gains in the referendum held on 1 December 1992. The attack on UNA develops at the time when nuclear weapons are being transferred, our territory is being given up, and our highest state leadership has testified to its full incapability of opposing pressure from world imperial circles. In such a situation, all political organizations involved in ruling structures are participating in the process of Ukraine's surrender. All of them are engaged in sucking Ukraine's blood; during the past two years, a significant part of our national wealth has been transferred abroad, while not a cent has been received in return. Under such circumstances, the only force capable of resisting this is the UNA-UNSO. It is the only organization which has a mechanism for combating profiteering, firmly opposes the surrendering of our state, and is ready to stand to the last to prevent such developments. I say "the only organization" not because of my alignment to it. Today, power is exercised jointly by traitors and thieves; today's power is an association of these two categories of criminals. The UNA, which emerged as a nationalist organization and adheres to the principles of Ukrainian revolutionary nationalism, has come to the conclusion that, given the current circumstances, it would have been wrong to neglect social problems and break away with real processes in Ukraine. Therefore, UNA works for both forming national forces and uniting all social groups which are interested in true nation building, production, and the creation of normal living conditions for our people. Today, Ukrainian society is divided into two groups uneven in both number and profit. The former is a group in power, which knows that its time will soon be over; therefore, it tries to sell abroad everything and reap as much as possible, transferring profits to accounts abroad. If a catastrophe were to happen in Ukraine, they would be cozily reading Ukrainian news somewhere in Miami. The latter includes all those who are interested in producing goods, establishing order, and building a real state. The Assembly aims at uniting all forces that are interested in producing goods, building the state, and creating a real defensive capacity, that is, at uniting all productive forces to abolish the power of profiteers. [passage omitted] [Blazhko] The people do not believe anybody by now. Can you guarantee that the UNA will not betray the people? [Lupynis] The UNA will not betray the people, because we are not democrats -- we are not playing this hypocritical game. We assess reality soberly and adequately. We are not going to fool the people with any law-governed states. I think that only an infantile man or a deliberate political charlatan can discuss democracy in this Mongolian and Bolshevik country. By all appearances, it will take several generations to install democracy here. Nobody has ever built a democratic society and law-governed state. Democracy is a state of society, which is attained as a result of the long-term establishment of moral, religious, ethical, and legal norms. [passage omitted]
