EU Industrial Commissioner Martin Bangemann warned that the 1999 deadline needed to be honoured in the interests of both sides. "Whoever asks today for a prorogation of the arrangement jeopardises the current talks," he said. Bangemann was speaking on the first of two days of negotiations between the Union and Japan in Tokyo to set levels of Japanese car exports into the EU for 1994. His warning was clearly addressed to France. French Industry and Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said last week that the 1991 agreement to curb Japanese car exports to the EU should be extended for two years after 1999. EU officials said they wanted Japanese car exports in 1994 to be maintained at last year's level to reflect a stagnant European market where sales are expected to show zero or very low growth this year. They noted that this would mean higher Japanese car sales in Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, because import barriers had kept Japanese penetration in the five countries at particularly low levels until 1993. The 1991 agreement provided for Japan to regulate overall car exports to the EU until 1999 according to demand, raising them moderately when the market was good and reducing them in years of declining sales. Thus, the two sides agreed to cut Japan's 1993 exports to the union by 18.4 percent (to 980,000 units -- about 8.4 percent of the market) to reflect a 15.9 percent drop in car sales in the EU. The 1991 agreement aims at giving European car-makers a breathing space until 1999 to restructure and prepare for unrestricted Japanese competition. It was prompted by the EU's single market launched on January 1 last year, which eliminated barriers between EU countries. This meant that national quotas for Japanese auto imports in Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain became impossible to enforce. The Japanese share of the auto market in these countries is supposed to increase gradually until 1999, even in bad years.
