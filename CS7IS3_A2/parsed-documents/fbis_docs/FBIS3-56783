Here is what Zurab Dvali, correspondent of the independent agency IPRINDA reports from Tbilisi by telephone: [Dvali] This morning a Georgian Government delegation headed by head of state Eduard Shevardnadze left by plane for a two-day visit to Turkey. In the course of this summit meeting, a large package of economic agreements and also of cooperation in the sphere of culture and tourism will be signed. The plane stopped over in Batumi where the government delegation was joined by Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Autonomous Republic of Ajaria. Also today, a meeting took place between the Georgian Government delegation and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel. Meanwhile, in the republic's parliamentary building, the meeting continued between Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze and deputies who are interested in his proposal regarding Georgia joining the ruble zone. The parliamentarians listened with great interest to the address by the republic's former Deputy Prime Minister Roman Gotsiridze, who analyzed the situation regarding the Georgian coupon. He stated that he is amazed by the statement by the head of state that the introduction in the republic of coupons has been a hasty and erroneous decision. Gotsiridze said that he himself had taken a direct part in the talks with Russia and that he is certain that Georgia would never receive Russian money and would not be able to join the ruble zone. In this way, according to him, putting the Georgian coupon into circulation was the only way out of the situation that had arisen. What is more, according to the former deputy prime minister, Russia will never give Georgia the promised technical credit. Gotsiridze stressed that in his view, Georgia is being run by a technocratic lobby made up of party functionaries and the armed mafia. It is they who have organized this unprecedented hyperinflation, which in the final analysis will result in the establishment in Georgia of an authoritarian regime, the former deputy prime minister remarked at the end of his speech. The speeches made by the opposition-minded deputies were of approximately the same content. The only thing that is amazing, as local observers note, is the fact that for the time being no one has asked Russia itself whether it would agree to Georgia joining the ruble zone.
