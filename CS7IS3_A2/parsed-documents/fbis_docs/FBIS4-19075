Otherwise the result will be that we too build up a huge state debt," Torstein Moland, Norwegian Central Bank chief, said. Even though most of the curves are positive for Norway at present there is one that is falling sharply -- that which shows state assets. When at their highest, these were over 200 billion kronor in 1990. A couple of years earlier the government began an expansive finance policy which threatens to wipe out the whole of the Norway's fortune before 1997. Torstein Moland took up his post at the beginning of the year. As a result of a private investment, which is now the subject of a police investigation, he has already been the target of tougher criticism than any of his predecessors. Nevertheless he is determined not to tell the Norwegians things they would prefer to hear. But he has the same educational problems as everyone else who tries to explain how the Norwegian economy hangs together. Why be worried when Norway is the only country in the OECD which does not have a national debt, which has lower interest rates than Germany, which has improved its competitiveness by 12 percent over five years, and whose Central Bank has not needed to intervene in the currency market since 1992? "It is tempting and quite understandable to breathe a sigh of relief when optimism returns to the Norwegian economy and to be happy about the upturn we we can see coming. But it is indefensible," Torstein Moland said. He warned that Norway like other countries must adapt itself to structural changes which go deeper than the shifts in the market. "Compared with other countries we had the advantage of building up an oil fortune in the eighties. But the freedom of action we have had thanks to it is now largely a thing of the past. There are not many countries which have spent money at the same rate as Norway without acquiring serious national financial problems." Torstein Moland pointed out that Norway's surplus in its balance of payments is also a result of the fact that there has been too little investment in mainland industry. "We need a large sector that is exposed to competition. Simply increasing oil production is not enough. Even though the Norwegian Bank is not expecting prices to rise by more than a couple of percent this year, there is still a certain amount of uncertainty. ``We have never been in a situation in which unemployment falls from the high level we have had for several years. It is possible that despite unemployment levels, shortages will occur. In the construction sector there are already signs that there will be a shortage of qualified labor when construction takes off again at the same time as large public projects, such as a new main airport, are carried out.'' Thus Torstein Moland's message to Finance Minister Sigbjorn Johnsen is that the national budget should show a surplus as soon as possible. The budget deficit for 1994 is the equivalent of 3 percent of GNP. "It is only now that we can begin to tighten our belts without strangling economic growth," he said.
