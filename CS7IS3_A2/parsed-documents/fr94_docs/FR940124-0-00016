ACTION: Final rule; non-approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing the non-approval with required amendments of a proposed amendment to the Wyoming permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment, submitted January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, pertains to shrub density standards. The proposed amendment was intended to revise the Wyoming program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal rules. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Guy V. Padgett, Telephone: (307) 261&hyph;5776. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Wyoming Program On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11, 950.12, 950.15 and 950.16. II. Submission of Amendment By letter dated January 6, 1993, (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;1) Wyoming submitted shrub density rules as a proposed amendment to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. The proposed Wyoming amendment revises the Land Quality Division (LQD) Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E), shrub density standard, and Appendix A, entitled ``Vegetation Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations.'' OSM published a notice in the March 22, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 15318) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period ended April 21, 1993. During this public comment period Wyoming submitted additional information regarding shrub density legislation, Enrolled Act No. 86 [Senate File No. 39] on April 13, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;21). This proposed legislation amended Wyoming Statute (W.S.) 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) by creating new paragraphs (xxxviii) through (xxx), that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important or critical habitat; modified the paragraph at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b), that provides shrub density standards; and created a new subsection (c) at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402, that would provide shrub density standards on grazingland. OSM published a second notice in the April 30, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 26079) announcing receipt of this additional information, reopening and extending the comment period, and providing an opportunity for a public hearing. The public comment period closed on June 1, 1993.
