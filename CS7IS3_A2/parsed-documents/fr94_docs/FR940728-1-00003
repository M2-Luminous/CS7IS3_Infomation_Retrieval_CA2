FR940728-1-00003 FR940728-1-00001 Employees who have not had a break in service ending after December 31, 1986, are excluded from automatic FERS coverage if they satisfy the one-part test under subparagraph (B). These employees are excluded from automatic FERS coverage_even if they have no prior service covered by CSRS or FERS_as long as they did have at least 5 years of creditable civilian service (under CSRS rules) before January 1, 1987. Proposed section 842.104(d) would merge and revise current paragraphs (a) and (e) of section 842.104 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, to simplify and clarify the regulations. Paragraph (e) particularly needs to be revised because the regulatory text does not show that it applies only to employees with just social security coverage such as those serving under multiple term appointments continuously since December 31, 1986. The supplementary information in our notice of interim rulemaking (published at 51 FR 47195, 47196, on December 31, 1986) states the intended scope of this paragraph, which also reflects our guidance to the employing agencies that make these determinations. Proposed section 842.104(e) defines a break in service for the purpose of applying these rules as a separation from CSRS-covered service lasting more than 3 days, consistent with our general practice. However, in unusual circumstances employees will also be considered to have had a break in service in situations in which there may be no period of separation from service but the individual acquires automatic social security coverage ( e.g., when a District of Columbia employee who is excluded from social security transfers to a Federal position). Proposed section 842.104(e) restates the current section 842.104(f) applicable to certain employees who have exercised their election rights under section 8461(n) of title 5, United States Code, to retain coverage under a retirement system for employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities. OPM's guidance on making coverage determinations is not affected by these amendments, which are intended to clarify the regulations and ensure that they will be interpreted correctly and in accordance with our existing guidance, ``The CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices'' (formerly FPM Supplement 830&hyph;1), chapter 10. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government employees and their survivors.
