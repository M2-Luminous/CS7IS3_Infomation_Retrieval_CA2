FR940124-0-00020 FR940124-0-00002 (i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a permit-specific basis. The existing State statutory provisions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), respectively, provide as follows: (b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii). (e) (xxvi) ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' means land designated wholly or partially to the production, protection, or management of species of fish or wildlife. The quoted State provisions require the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to use the noted definition of ``fish and wildlife habitat'' when consulting on the revegetation of lands to be reclaimed to the fish and wildlife habitat land use. These provisions do not correspond to 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i). Additionally, the quoted provisions do not specify if the Wyoming Game and Fish Department would be the appropriate State agency responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs for any of the land uses, other than fish and wildlife habitat, mentioned in the Federal regulations (recreation, shelterbelts, and forest products). Therefore, without further clarifying information from Wyoming, the Director finds the statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) combined with the previously approved definition of fish and wildlife habitat at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), does not satisfy OSM's February 21, 1990, required amendment. 5. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c): Grazingland Shrub Standard Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402 establishment of standards as follows: (c) For the reclamation of grazingland, operators shall be required to reestablish shrubs on ten percent (10%) of the affected surface at a density of one (1) shrub per nine (9) square meters, or to a pre-mine density, whichever is less. The shrubs used for reestablishment shall be those native to the general area, and shall include those found pre-mining, but the premining dominant shrub need not be the dominant shrub in the post-mining reclamation. SMCRA, at section 515(b)(24), requires that the operator, to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available (BTCA), minimize disturbances and adverse impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values, and achieve enhancement of such resources where practicable. Further, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 (Fish and wildlife information for permit applications) require resource information of which the scope and level of detail determined by the regulatory authority in consultation with State and Federal agencies with responsibilities for fish and wildlife shall be sufficient to design the protection and enhancement plan. This plan shall include a description of how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will minimize disturbances and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife and related environmental values. The State has failed to demonstrate through the submission of documentation and/or other materials, that the proposed shrub standard: (1) would minimize disturbances and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife and related environmental values; (2) represents BTCA; and (3) was developed in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD). Therefore, the Director finds the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c) to be less stringent than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements. The Director is not approving the proposed statutory provision and is requiring Wyoming to either repeal this statutory provision, modify it to make it consistent with SMRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations, or provide the required documentation to show that the standard meets the Federal program requirements. 6. LQD Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2 and Appendix A_Shrub Density Rule and Revegetation Success Standards The State additionally proposes to revise LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) to require a shrub density standard of 1 shrub per square meter over 20 percent of the affected surface (including fish and wildlife habitat land use) and excluding areas where the premining land use was pastureland or cropland. Additionally, the proposed standard can be reduced to the level of the premine shrub densities if premine shrub densities are less than the proposed success standard. The proposed rule requires establishment of shrubs in a mosaic pattern to optimize habitat interspersion and edge effect. A minimum shrub patch size of 0.05 acres is required. For areas of crucial or important habitat, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) must be consulted for recommended reclamation standards for shrub establishment. Specific criteria and procedures implementing this proposed rule were provided in modifications to Appendix A_Vegetation Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations. The modifications provide examples of acceptable shrub density standards on specific land uses, shrub composition, and acceptable species type.
