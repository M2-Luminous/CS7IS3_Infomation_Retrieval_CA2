As of the end of November, they have cracked 22 major cases of smuggling in Shandong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Hainan, Fujian and other provinces, confiscating 1,557 smuggled vehicles, 29,000 cases of cigarettes, 23,800 tons of scrap metal, as well as air conditioners, color television sets, cameras and other items worth some 260 million yuan. On the evening of 24 July this year, the Huanqiu, a freighter of Honduran registry belonging to the Hong Kong Maritime Shipping Company Limited, entered Yantai harbor carrying 8,000 cartons of contraband cigarettes bound for the Fugang [Fujian-Hong Kong] Fuxing Aquatic Products Company Limited of Yantai city in Shandong Province. The Yantai Coastal Defense units in close cooperation with the customs departments, worked on the case from four different angles. On the following day when the Huanqiu off-loaded the contraband at Bajiao Port in Fushan and prepared to depart, all of the smugglers were apprehended on the scene. The Qinzhou Prefecture Economic Development General Corporation in Guangxi and the Dongxing South-Central Economic Development Corporation and the Qinzhou Prefecture Materials Trade Corporation smuggled in 25 vehicles and 100 copy machines. When the Guangxi Qinzhou Prefecture Anti-smuggling Office received reports of this from the public, they acted immediately and nabbed all of the smugglers. At present, the public security organs in Shandong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Hainan and Fujian, acting under the instructions of the party center and State Council to vigorously prosecute all crimes of smuggling, are actively investigating other cases under the guidance of the Public Security Bureau and are striving for even greater achievements.
