The circular states: To formulate and implement the public service system is an important event in China's political life. It is an important content of the reform of the political system, as well as a necessity in establishing a socialist market economy. It is of great significance to increasing the building of clean and honest government as well as to improving the quality of state functionaries and the efficiency of the administration. All localities and departments should attach great importance to the public service system and conscientiously strengthen leadership over its implementation. The circular points out: The public service system should be carried out step by step in a planned manner in conjunction with organizational reform. The personnel positions, staffing, and non- leadership jobs must not be finalized before the "three-fix" plan [san ding fang an 0005 1353 2455 2714] is approved. Units which have not yet carried out organizational reform should actively organize the implementation of the systems for hiring, performance appraisal, awards, discipline, training, challenge [hui bi 0932 6699], and retirement. During the course of implementing the public service system, it is strictly prohibited to enlarge the scope of implementation, establish unauthorized positions, and rush promotion or transfer of cadres. Violation of regulations should be corrected in good time, and leading cadres concerned should be blamed for the violation. The implementation plan for the public service system contains clear and definite stipulations on the scope, procedures, and methods of implementation. It also sets specific requirements for the current office staff to transit to the public service system, for the rank and grade of public servants, and for the establishment and appointment of non-leadership staff members. The plan emphasizes the necessity to implement the public service system under the leadership of party committees and governments, pay attention to studying new circumstances and new problems during the implementation, seriously strengthen the ideological and political work, and ensure a smooth implementation.
