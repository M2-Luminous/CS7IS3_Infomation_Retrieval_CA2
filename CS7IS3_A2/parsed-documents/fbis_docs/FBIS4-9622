FBIS4-9622 "dreeu083_k_94008" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 CROATIA _O_Opposition Reacts to Croat-Serb Agreement _O_Opposition Reacts to Croat-Serb Agreement 94P20690A 94P20690A CSO [Editorial Report] While Croatian Government representatives have hailed the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and separation of forces signed with the Krajina Serbs in Zagreb on 29 March as a "step toward normalization of relations on the entire territory of Croatia" (Zagreb VJESNIK 31 March), the reaction of most Croatian opposition parties to the agreement has been considerably more cautious and even negative. In a statement to VJESNIK that appears in the paper's 31 March issue, Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] President Drazen Budisa says that, while he had not yet have a chance to review the document, his party supports "efforts for the peaceful reintegration of the UN Protection Areas [UNPA] but does not see how this can be achieved without changing the UNPROFOR mandate. Budisa believes that, under the present conditions, the cease-fire agreement between the Croatian Government and the Krajina Serbs offers "no guarantees" that displaced persons will be able to return to their homes or that Serbian paramilitary groups will be disarmed. The HSLS insists, Budisa says, that the effects of ethnic cleansing must be reversed. The 7 April VJESNIK carries a report on a news conference held the previous day by five opposition parties -- the HSLS, the Croatian Peasants' Party, the Istrian Democratic Assembly, the Croatian National Party, and the Social Democratic Party [SDP] -- at which they demanded that all political talks with representatives of Serbia be halted until: -- "Serbia and Montenegro recognize Croatia within its internationally recognized borders, terminate logistical and political support for the Serb insurgents, and withdraw the Serbian dinar [as the official currency] from the occupied territories." -- "The Serbian Army and Serb insurgents cease ethnic cleansing and criminal attacks on Croatian settlements and the insurgents accept the solution of their political demands within the Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the principles of the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and international documents on the rights of national communities." The five opposition parties also demanded the closing of the Croatian Government Bureau in Belgrade and its Serbian counterpart in Zagreb and made the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate conditional on the protection of the Croatian borders with Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Zdravko Tomac, chairman of the SPD Council, told reporters that one consequence of the Zagreb agreement would probably be a "long-term solution modeled on Cyprus" and that "everybody who remains silent about it" would bear a "historic responsibility," VJESNIK reports. Savka Dabcevic-Kucar, head of the HSN, said in an interview published in Zagreb VECERNJI LIST on 11 April that, while she welcomes "any step" leading to a cease-fire, negotiations, and a "just peace," she is "reserved" and "skeptical" and considers the agreement "unfavorable" because it appears to "sanction the present situation." In her opinion, the most important issues have not been resolved: The "occupying army" and the Croatian Army are treated identically; the Croatian state is not even mentioned in the agreement; the "Pink Zones" are not excluded from the agreement, and the return of displaced persons has not been defined. She also asks why the "questions of aggression" had not been raised and states that the "only positive thing" resulting from the agreement might be the cease-fire. The 9 April VJESNIK reports on a news conference held on 8 April by the Croatian Christian Democratic Union [HKDU], at which its secretary, Dr. Milan Bicanic, enumerated the shortcomings of the Zagreb Agreement, stating that the aggressor was not named, "which raises the question whether this is an agreement on separation or delineation of the opposing sides," and that the "dynamics" for the reintegration of the occupied territories into the Croatian constitutional and legal system had not been established. HKDU President Dr. Marko Veselica found fault in the government's approach to the talks with the "Serb rebels" and felt that the cessation of the war was being discussed in a manner that "destabilizes Croatian military power and creates a defensive strategy." Ilija Rkman, the party's executive secretary, mentioned the danger of a "Cyprus solution." The official party statement carried in the 13 April VJESNIK added that the agreement does not mention Croatia as a sovereign and internationally recognized state and fails to deal with war crimes, the punishment of war criminals, and war reparations. The 9 April issue of the same paper contains a statement by Croatian Christian Democratic Union President Ivan Keglevic, who proposes that, in addition to the present negotiators, Croatian refugees from the Krajina should be authorized to negotiate with the "Serbian rulers" in the UNPA, because the refugees "would know much better how to facilitate returning to their homes." The Socialist Party of Croatia issued a statement, published in the 1 April VJESNIK, which welcomes the agreement, describes it as "the first step toward the establishment of the territorial integrity of Croatia," and concludes that, apparently, "the two sides had not been able to achieve it without maximum engagement and pressure by the international community, especially the United States and Russia."
