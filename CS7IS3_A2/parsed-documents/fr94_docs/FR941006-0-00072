FR941006-0-00072 FR941006-0-00020 There are three main population centers of Isotria medeoloides. The northernmost concentration, comprising 66 sites in 1993, is centered in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in New England and northern coastal Massachusetts, with one outlying site in Rhode Island. A second grouping of 18 sites is located at the southern extreme of the Appalachian chain in the Blue Ridge Mountains where North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee join. The third center, with 13 sites, is concentrated in the coastal plain and piedmont provinces of Virginia, with outliers in Delaware and New Jersey. Seven sites scattered in the outlying States and Ontario are considered disjunct populations. Previous Federal Action Isotria medeoloides was listed as endangered on September 10, 1982 (47 FR 39827&hyph;39831). At that time, records for the species were known from 48 counties in 16 States and Canada, though there were only 17 extant sites, in 10 States and Ontario, Canada. These sites had less than 500 stems. Subsequent searches led to the discovery of many new sites. In 1991, 86 sites in 15 States and Canada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992) were known. By 1993, 17 additional sites in New Hampshire and 1 site in Maine were discovered, bringing the total to 104 extant sites (Table 1). A number of States currently have only historic sites; these include Vermont, New York, Maryland, Missouri, and the District of Columbia.

The first Small Whorled Pogonia Recovery Plan was completed in 1985 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1985). The original objective, outlined in the 1985 recovery plan and based on the best available information at that time, was to locate and protect 30 populations (sites) of at least 20 individuals each, with at least 15 of the sites to be located in New England. Implementation of several recovery tasks generated additional life history and population information, the identification of new sites and protection of those sites deemed important to the survival and recovery of this species. Upon review of new life history and site information, this recovery objective was no longer considered appropriate. Viability, based on the reproductive status and persistence of a population, as opposed to merely a stem count, is now considered to be an important factor in determining the recoverability of this species. The Small Whorled Pogonia Recovery Plan: First Revision, was completed and approved in 1992. New recovery goals for the reclassification and delisting of Isotria medeoloides and tasks for the recovery of this species were developed using the most recent information regarding population trends and dynamics, life history, and previous recovery efforts. The current recovery strategy is based on a multi-faceted approach of habitat protection and management (on a site specific basis), threat reduction, and environmental education.
