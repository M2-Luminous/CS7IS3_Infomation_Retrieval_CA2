FR940922-1-00069 FR940922-1-00009 Requiring sponsors to obtain information on and either certify or disclose their clinical investigators' relevant financial interests and arrangements is intended to help ensure that sponsors consider these matters in the early stages of product development and, if necessary, consider how best to minimize potential sources of bias. FDA believes that in most cases, sponsors would be able to provide certification for clinical investigators and would not need to submit any further information. FDA recognizes that therapeutically beneficial products have been developed through investigations in which clinical investigators were compensated in ways that may have influenced the outcome of the study and is therefore not intending to prohibit such arrangements, or rule out reliance on affected studies as a basis for product approval, but intends to give such studies particularly close scrutiny and evaluation. Requiring certification or disclosure at the time of submission of marketing applications does not preclude a sponsor from seeking the agency's advice at the early stages of product development with respect to a potentially problematic financial arrangement with a clinical investigator. Indeed, FDA strongly encourages early consultation in cases where the sponsor may be entering into problematic financial arrangements with a clinical investigator. The agency will work with sponsors in planning careful management of such situations. FDA is proposing to require certification or disclosure only with respect to the clinical data submissions in support of marketing applications because if this information were submitted prior to beginning clinical studies, agency staff would be unduly burdened with evaluating financial information for every clinical study undertaken, many of which never lead to marketing applications. FDA has tentatively chosen not to seek information on investigators carrying out preclinical or manufacturing and controls operations for a number of reasons. Employees of the sponsor develop most of these data, and FDA already considers the financial interests of these employees. Also, these data are often verified independently and are relatively insensitive to inadvertent bias. In contrast, clinical data are more susceptible to inadvertent, unrecognized bias on the part of investigators. FDA recognizes that, despite these reasons, biased preclinical or chemistry work could also affect product approvals and welcomes comments on possible approaches the agency could take to ensure the reliability of such work. FDA believes that these requirements for certification or disclosure should apply not only to the clinical investigator's interests, but to the interests of the investigator's immediate family as well. The financial interests of a clinical investigator's immediate family are effectively shared by the investigator and thus would be as potentially biasing as if they were under the investigator's name. The agency envisions that the financial arrangements and steps taken to minimize bias will vary with different product applications and will review these applications on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a study design is sufficiently robust as a result of factors such as independent data monitoring, multiple investigators, blinding, and independent endpoint assessment, FDA could determine that a problematic financial interest would not likely introduce bias. In other situations, there might be sufficient replication of critical results to render the questionable data less important, or it might be possible to carry out further analyses or observations (reexamination of hospital records or patients) that would provide assurance as to the reliability of the data. In still others, intensified scrutiny by FDA's bioresearch monitoring staff might be sufficient to permit FDA to accept the data in support of product marketing applications. In some cases, however, FDA might not be able to conclude that the data were reliable and might require sponsors to conduct further studies. The agency seeks comment as to other appropriate steps that FDA might take to respond to applications that may be considered problematic with respect to potential bias.
