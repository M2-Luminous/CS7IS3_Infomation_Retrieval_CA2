FBIS3-46722 "dreas002__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-002-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Framework Discussions on Insurance Held With U.S. U.S. Official Holds News Conference 942A0013B Tokyo HOKEN MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 Oct 93 pp 1-2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0013B Tokyo HOKEN MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO ["Summary" of remarks by unidentified "senior U.S. Government official" at news conference at U.S. Embassy in Tokyo following 12-13 October U.S.-Japan discussions on insurance] [Text] Two days of discussions were held regarding the insurance issue as one of the areas of negotiations. The aims of the United States in this area are to broadly increase market access for foreign insurers in the Japan market, and to insure the growth of sales of insurance products and services offered by foreign insurers with broad competitiveness in the Japan market. We have surveyed the Japan market for months, and have tried to understand why the share of foreign insurers is extremely low. Three data sources were used. The first was the report submitted by the Insurance Council in June 1992. The second data source was the various comments made by Japanese experts, scholars, and the representatives of Japan's insurance industry. The third source consisted of members of the insurance committee of the ACCJ [American Chamber of Commerce in Japan], who are U.S. insurers operating in Japan, and also data from U.S. insurers who have relations with Japan. At the meeting on the 12th (October), the Japanese Government discussed mainly its points of concern vis-a-vis the U.S. market. Mr. Wall, the vice president of NAIC [National Association of Insurance Commissioners], came to Japan on this occasion as one of the delegates and held a press conference yesterday at the U.S. Embassy. He explained about the U.S. market, saying that, although the Japanese Government criticizes the U.S. market, the criticism is unfounded. Today, the U.S. proposal was submitted to the Japanese Government. The content corresponds considerably with the report submitted by the Insurance Council. Frankly, however, the U.S. proposal is more concrete in its content. I cannot talk concretely today about the content of the discussions exchanged with Japan's Ministry of Finance. Instead, I would like to simply stress some principal points as to why we are concerned about Japan's insurance market and system. The first point is that we feel that the lack of transparency in the Japan market is a serious problem. For example, at the present point in time, we are in a situation where it is difficult for us to sufficiently understand what the prerequisite conditions are to receive business licenses in Japan. We believe that it is necessary to make thoroughly public the existing rules and guidelines, including guidance, in order to maintain transparency. Also, when new policies are introduced in the future, they should be made fully public. The second problem point is that foreign insurers are unable to participate in the forums of insurer organizations and the Insurance Council. We believe that participation by foreign insurers in such industry organizations and the council should be recognized on a similar basis as participation by Japan's insurer companies. We would also like to have participation by foreign insurers be recognized not only in insurance, but also in the councils and committees controlled and sponsored by the Japanese government, as well as in the insurer organizations at the private level. The third problem point is the basic thinking regarding liberalization. Of course, in order to maintain solvency and to protect the consumers and insurees, regulation is necessary. However, if the existence of regulation should conversely deter reform and competitiveness, it would result in injury to the consumers and insurees. The report of the Insurance Council has repeatedly pointed out that promotion of competition is the purpose in easing controls, and we fully agree on this point. We also believe that licensing procedures regarding insurance products and services should change to a registration system. In other words, we believe that the discretionary authority held by the bureaucrats should be abolished. And we believe that, as long as there is no problem of solvency, and as long as there is no problem from the standpoint of the consumers and insurees, new products should be authorized automatically. To rephrase it, except in cases where consumer interests are injured, or in cases where there is a solvency problem, new products and services should be authorized immediately. I would like to move on to the problem of insurance brokers. Insurance brokers are people who are legally authorized or requested to speak for the interests of not the insurance companies, but for the consumers who use insurance. At present, the broker system is prohibited in Japan. It is stated in the Insurance Council's report that it will be possible to offer services to the consumers by authorizing a broker system, and it strongly demands the introduction of such a system in Japan. Next, I would like to talk about the problem of the third sector. There is noticeable newspaper reporting that "the United States opposes easing of controls over insurance in Japan," but such reporting is inaccurate and irresponsible. Regarding easing of controls in the third sector, it is written in the Insurance Council's report that a step-by-step approach should be adopted. Particularly concerning the insurance area where smaller companies and foreign insurers participate actively, it is written that easing controls in the third sector should be implemented gradually. We agree with that portion of the report's content. The reason is that market practices have been built up over many years and cannot be eradicated overnight. We believe that it is necessary to allow a transitional period prior to reaching a completely new and deregulated situation. As for the "keiretsu" problem, the ACCJ has compiled its survey findings on Japan's insurance market. It reports that "generally Japan's `keiretsu' companies conduct transactions with insurance companies of the same 'keiretsu' in an overwhelming number of cases." Because the process of easing controls is continuing, we believe that this problem must absolutely be dealt with. At least regarding the "keiretsu," it is a problem that Japan's Fair Trade Commission should investigate. Trade Sanctions Will Not Be Applied Despite Unattainment of Figures; Concern About 2-Percent Foreign Share in Japan Our goal in the framework discussions is results. We have conducted negotiations with Japan regarding trade agreements over a number of years, and procedures and processes have changed during the period. Also, rules have been revised. However, Japan's market itself has not changed, and such a situation cannot be tolerated by the United States. We hope that concrete results that can be approved will come out of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. By using qualitative and quantitative indices within the framework negotiations, it will be possible to evaluate whether the agreed items will prove successful. There is one thing I would like to stress. We are absolutely not contemplating a situation where figures are used to decide a market share with a time limit and, if the share is not achieved within the time limit, a trade measure is enforced with the United States retaliating against Japan. Our intention is rather to use a group of quantitative and qualitative indices and, based on new rules and regulations, to determine whether Japan's market is undergoing a change. I would like for you to look at this table [not translated]. The shares for foreign insurers are as follows: 18 percent in Canada, 10 percent in France and 2 percent in Japan. In the United States, foreign insurers who are licensed in the United States have a 7-percent share. In addition, foreign insurers are able to offer unregistered insurance products called subline products and, if this is included, it would exceed 10 percent. In other words, these figures indicate an important fact that Japan is an outsider positioned in a totally different location than the other G-7 nations. In July when the framework agreement was reached, the judgment was made that, from the standpoint of macroeconomic measurement criteria, Japan stood in a completely different location from the advanced nations. In other words, looking at the operating balance surplus versus the GDP [gross domestic product] and the import ratio--particularly the product import ratio versus the GNP, an extremely large gap exists between Japan's level and the level of the other advanced nations. It is extremely difficult to gather figures from other nations for comparison. Consequently, the sources of these figures vary in each nation. Also, we believe that the figures submitted to the OECD are unusable. The reason is that the figures reported to the OECD have different definitions used by the respective nations in collecting data. Because there is postal insurance in Japan, the denominator becomes larger when postal insurance is included, and the share become lower than 2 percent. Compared to the other G-7 nations, Japan's insurance market is really closed. The share of foreign companies in Britain is 25 percent, 33 percent in Italy, and 10-13 percent even in the United States, France, and Germany, so the gaps with Japan are extremely large. Our purpose is to see the Japan market gradually draw closer to the other advanced nations. The Ministry of Finance says that the share of Japan's insurers in the U.S. market is extremely small, and that it is particularly small compared with the market share of U.S. insurers in Japan. This is an interesting statement, but we believe the figures are inappropriate or unrelated for use in this forum. That is to say, what we must look at is how open each nation is vis-a-vis foreign insurers as a whole regarding a specific market. We are not considering the problem of how a specific nation's insurers are faring in a specific nation. Also, what we indicated in our negotiations with the Japanese Government under the framework agreement are all based on what we observed multilaterally, and can be applied to other nations on a most-favored-nation base. The results of the negotiations with the Japanese Government will generally be applied similarly to all nations. It will be likewise regarding insurance, telecommunications, autos, auto parts, and medical care equipment. According to the data prepared by the NAIC, Japan's insurers are generally not very successful in the U.S. market, but the insurers of other nations are successful in the United States. Although we are told that Japan's insurers are not succeeding in the United States, the reason is not because the U.S. insurance market is closed or because there is discriminatory treatment. We do not know the reasons why Japan's share is low in the United States, but insuffficient efforts by the Japanese side, indifference toward the U.S. market, or a lack of competitiveness are conceivable reasons. Perhaps it is because the Japanese companies do business only with the so-called traditional customers who have advanced into the United States. In any case, what is clear is that other foreign insurers besides those of Japan are very successful in the United States, and the criticism by Japan that the U.S. insurance market is closed is inaccurate and unfair.
