At present, it is installing them only on some high-class cars such as the "Leopard J Ferry" and "Cima," but they are expanding use to compact cars. In addition to the price being two to three times cheaper than Japanese products, the design is superior and the response to small design changes is said to be quick, on a par with Japanese manufacturers. It is not the result of outside pressure for purchase of U.S. products, but that the Nissan design team is charmed and praises them, saying "Prince Company potential is wonderful" (Masatomo Okahara, deputy manager, International Procurement Department). Nissan has worked out a voluntary plan to purchase U.S. products in the amount of $4.3 billion (80-percent increase over actual amount in fiscal 1992) in fiscal 1997. Moreover, as a trump card to survive in the low price competition era, they recently have put on sale the "Sunny Lukino" which falls greatly below 1 million yen without an air conditioner. The profit margin simply becomes smaller the more the price is lowered. There is no wait to use overseas parts which have the advantage in cost. "We are scouting excellent companies like Prince and drawing out their best" (Masaaki Machida, chief officer, International Procurement Department). Nissan's purchase policy on overseas parts manufacturers is strict control of local manufacturers on cost, differing somewhat from the Toyota Motor style which does basic retraining. That position can be perceived in the MIG (manufacturing improvement group) activities which U.S. Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co. (NMMC; Tennessee), the U.S. base for Nissan Motor, has been implementing at targeted parts manufacturers with whom they do business locally since 1993. The main details are that MIG's divide those with whom they do business into groups by region and each group voluntarily holds field trips to superior plants and they mutually hold study groups to propose cost reductions to each other. MIG's have already been formed in the three regions of Tennessee, Michigan, and Kentucky. Five to seven companies participate in the respective groups and they anticipate further expansion of the number of companies and regions in the future. Although NMMC takes the lead in activities such as the study groups, "Basically, the main body is spontaneous activities by the local parts manufacturers" (Deputy Manager Okahara). One result is that the U.S. Davis Company, a major manufacturer of pressed parts such as oil pans, voluntarily prepared a manual on rationalization suiting its own company based on the rationalization methods learned in the study group with Nissan Motor. As a result of applying this to subsidiary secondary and tertiary manufacturers, its has realized a large overall cost reduction. Moreover, "The places permanently stationing businessmen who can speak Japanese have increased among U.S. manufacturers with whom we do business," and that effect seems to be spreading. It is said that Toyota and Nissan have traditionally differed greatly in methods of demanding rationalization. The person in charge of the auto industry at a certain think tank says, "Toyota gets into the management of parts companies and finds and implements types of fine cost reductions. With Nissan, there are many examples where they leave it voluntarily up to the parts company after they have indicated goals." The difference in posture of both companies domestically can also be perceived in overseas purchase policy. Insofar as viewing the settlement of accounts of the parts manufacturers affiliated with both companies in the past few years in Japan, the Toyota style wins. The answers to how the differentiation will be in the future overseas and how much overseas parts can be managed are yet to come.
