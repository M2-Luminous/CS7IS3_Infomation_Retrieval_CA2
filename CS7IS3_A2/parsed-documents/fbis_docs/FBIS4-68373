How great is social tension now in Omsk and Siberia in general? [Polezhayev] Even in the major regions of Siberia it has a spotty character. The sociopolitical background in Omsk is even. It is based on definite stability and a somewhat more advantageous economic situation. But how it is possible to do this is a special conversation. Here is an example for you. Harvest campaigns always take place with difficulty in Siberia: There is snow and rain, and gathering grain from two hectares is like taking Berlin. Naturally I have opponents, and there is an opposition, which is especially well organized and united in the agrarian milieu. They are all awaiting the kind of autumn when Polezhayev finally fails. So, I calculated what forces were activated in gathering the harvest in bumper-crop years (in the 1970's, etc.). In one and the same land areas--2 million hectares of arable land--in the years 1970-1985, 15-16,000 combines and 30,000 motor vehicles took part in the harvest and 45,000 persons were drawn in from city enterprises. Last year and year before, the biggest harvests in the last 30 years were gathered in Omsk Oblast. However, we managed to get by in the harvest with 7,000 combines instead of 16,000, 3,500 motor vehicles instead of 30,000, and we did not bring in one person from city enterprises. At the same time, all the grain was harvested. What is the reason for this? The kolkhozes and sovkhozes are now joint-stock enterprises. Every stockholder has a share--several hectares of personal land, depending on the area the joint-stock company owns. In previous years a combine operator worked for wages. He was a fifth category broad specialty machine operator. He could earn a maximum of 500 rubles [R] per month in a harvest. Today he does not work for wages. We did not operate a bureau, there were no heart attacks, we did not expel anyone from a party, and we did not employ the Ipatovo method. But the peasant worked on his own field. He knew that he was gathering grain that would feed him. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Leonid Konstantinovich, you are one of the founders and leaders of the Siberian agreement. Just what is it? Will it not lead to the creation of some kind of Siberian republic? Will it not transform Russia, as the opposition threatens, not just into 20 principalities, as there were in the 16th century, but into 89 uncoordinated components of the Federation with an eroded central authority? [Polezhayev] In my view the managers in the regions, after all, are specialists in public law. None of them are infringing upon the integrity of the state, nor on the priority of state authority. When reform began, and when the Union collapsed, the leaders of the Siberian regions, perhaps quicker than all the others, became concerned about what would happen. Let us analyze just what Siberia is for Russia? Is it simply a geographic concept? Or a material-technical and raw material base? Or is it an arms shop? How is Russia balanced internally today in a geopolitical and economic sense with the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics? Very likely, it is now necessary to look at Siberia precisely from this standpoint. Siberia itself does not need the kind of economy that has developed there. Believe me, it is nothing for me to produce 800 tanks per year. There are enough raw materials for 18 million persons in Siberia to live independently: forests, oil, gas, etc. When we begin to collate our budgets and our transfers to the federal budget, and compare them with the budgets of other regions, we find an obvious imbalance to the benefit of the center. I once again return to the principle, which I did not conceive, that we cannot have patchwork reform. It also cannot be uniform for the whole country. In Siberia, for example, there are branches that are not even subject to conversion. For example, how can you convert an enterprise that was oriented on the production of explosive substances or the atom bomb? They simply have to be shut down. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] When Gaydar started his reforms, he proceeded from the fact that there is no socialist economy and there is no capitalist economy, that an economy develops according to laws that are common to all. Just as there is no socialist or capitalist physics or chemistry. Therefore, the center cannot help but work on common problems, for example, on the well-known liberalization of prices. But the regions have to work on their own problems. [Polezhayev] Thus it is necessary to give them the opportunity to work on these problems. This is the first thing. Second, even keeping in mind that the economy has common laws, it cannot fail to take into account the peculiarities of that territory on which these laws operate. It must take into account the national features of the individual, his mentality and psychology, and, separately, the psychology of work to which he has become accustomed over the course of many years. Many of our failures result from the fact that economists, who allegedly project everything correctly, do not take these very important elements and qualities into account. I think it is necessary to have more trust in the local authoritative structures and regional associations. Yes, we should have a unified transport and unified energy system, and a unified foreign policy and defense. But it is not necessary to teach me how to live with bordering Kazakhstan. I know this better than the Muscovites. Let us determine the specific sum that we must give in the form of a federal tax for the maintenance of the state structures and support of the state. But now, Omsk gives 82 percent of its taxes to the federal budget! [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you think that the tax system is imperfect? [Polezhayev] Of course. Let even a small part remain in the regions, but a reasonable one. This is necessary for reproduction, the creation of jobs, and support of the social and production infrastructure. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yavlinskiy is working on reform for Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod, and someone has invited consultants from America. Is there anyone in the Siberian agreement with such a brilliant mind from Moscow, from the United States, or from South Korea? [Polezhayev] The development of regional economic policy and regionalization of reforms here in Siberia is a job that was handled by V.V. Malykhin. Unfortunately, he died recently. He was a great economist. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If Boris Nikolayevich offers you a good post in Moscow, will you go? [Polezhayev] I have had more than one offer. And if I have to say "yes" or "no" today, I will say "no." [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you feel that you have real powers and real authority in Omsk? [Polezhayev] Yes. But I could not work in isolation. I am not a charismatic figure, but simply a good business manager. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is there a probability that the Federation Council will clash with the executive authority? [Polezhayev] I see no drama in this. Everyone should function within the scope of his authorities. But he should also be confrontational on some questions. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But not to the degree that occurred in October of last year? [Polezhayev] No. This is ruled out. There simply are different people there. First, a majority of the members of the Federation Council are people who know what ruling is, and what responsibility is. The managers of the executive structures are not secretaries of oblast party committees. I, for example, am not a manager who can be manipulated. The Council will intervene and compel the government to make adjustments to program actions. But this is natural. I will cite an example. I am a professional hydraulic engineer. Years pass while you are building a large hydroengineering complex, and there is an accumulation of water. When the sluice gates are opened in order to let the water into a new stream sector, a rapid current rushes in. Everything foams, whirls, gathers up old rubbish, and together with the foam, moves to the surface. But then everything quiets down, and the foam is cast upon the banks. A calm and clean channel remains in the center. This resembles our political life. I think that the process of forming the channel has already started. It will become calmer and more sensible. But somewhere there is still erosion, somewhere there are cave-ins, somewhere there are breakdowns. And this is understandable.
