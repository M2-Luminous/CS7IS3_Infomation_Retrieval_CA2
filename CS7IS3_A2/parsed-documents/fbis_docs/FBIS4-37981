[Al-'Attas] As you know, we met today with Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and his representative Lakhdar Brahimi. We also met with the Security Council chairman, Oman's representative Ambassador Salim al-Khusaybi, and a group of the council's members. During these meetings we explained our views regarding conditions in Yemen. Discussions focused primarily on an immediate cease-fire and a halt to the bloodshed, especially as northern forces have recently focused on civilians, hitting primarily residential areas, social establishments, schools, hospitals, markets, and mosques. Then we discussed the need to secure an effective mechanism to watch and consolidate the cease-fire. As for the second issue which was discussed, it is the need for humanitarian aid for our people, especially in Aden Governorate, where people are suffering water and electricity cuts and the disruption of health services and other life necessities. I can say that the talks were positive. I hope that our meetings with these and other parties will continue in order for the council to adopt resolutions to implement Resolution 924. I would like also to say that we expressed our complete willingness to accept a cease-fire without any conditions, to agree on a suitable mechanism, and to engage in the dialogue stipulated by the Security Council resolution. [Matar] But as Sanaa is intransigent and is refusing to engage in a dialogue with you, how will you be able to secure a formula acceptable to the northern government? [Al-'Attas] I believe that there is no justification for Sanaa to reject a cease-fire or accept one and then try to get around it. We have always stressed that the war is harmful and undermining unity. It is also aimed at (hitting) democracy and the development march in Yemen. As you have been following developments in the war, you know how Sanaa began to hit vital economic installations, starting with the historic Aden refinery, which is a vital installation, among others. Sanaa's position is not patriotic and does not reflect a humanitarian position toward the Yemeni people. This is why I am confident that the international and Arab position is capable of compelling Sanaa to return to the right path. I said at the beginning of the war, and I repeat it now, that the courageous and patriotic decision required now is to announce a cease-fire. [Matar] Is there any possibility of returning to unity? [Al-'Attas] War severs all ties, and the longer it goes on, the fewer ties will remain. This is why we have since the war broke out said that the road the Sanaa leadership has been following is wrong and detrimental to unity and the Yemeni people. It is also harmful to the Yemeni people's future and life and to the fraternal bonds and ties among the one Yemeni people. This is why we should confront what results from this unity courageously and with patriotic responsibility. [sentence as published] [Matar] Can you explain to us what exactly is required so that there can be a possibility of returning to unity? [Al-'Attas] I believe that we as a Yemeni people in the north and the south need a period of time to recover from the effects of this war. [Matar] Does mean that the war has affected the general popular position on unity, whether or not 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih remains in power? [Al-'Attas] The war has affected everything. It is bringing nothing but tragedies. The Yemeni people know that this war is not imposed by the Yemeni people. It is imposed by an influential tribal-military group in Sanaa. In Sanaa itself people say this war is the Hashid tribe's war, not the people's war. When fatwas [rulings] are issued -- repudiating the cease-fire, analyzing the reasons for continuing the war, and considering whatever is seized as war booty -- it means that they consider the south their booty. You can imagine the reaction of all our people in both the north and the south when they hear such statements. I would like to recall some events in our history and say that today is similar to yesterday. In the imam's days fatwas like these were issued. So today is like yesterday. The mentality which harmed unity and advocated the annexation of the south to the north is still in control. It is a view of hegemony and domination among that group. [Matar] Some time ago you pointed to the arrest of some Iraqi military personnel who were fighting alongside northern forces. You also spoke about the north's alliances with fundamentalist parties, and so on. How do you view these links and how do you prove they exist? [Al-'Attas] Sanaa is currently clearly allying with Iraq and fundamentalists. It is seeking to set up a new axis and new powers in the region in order to become a source of disruption for the region's security and the security of the Arab homeland as a whole. And as Yemen represents a strategic position on Bab el Mandeb, Sanaa could -- then -- disrupt world security. The Iraqi role has increased recently, and a number of people were arrested during one of the battles. These Iraqis come under various names like teachers, engineers, health assistants, and so on. And there is now among northern forces a number of Iraqi experts. As for the fundamentalist movement's role, it is increasing in Sanaa. And this represents 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's other face in his numerous alliances. In our view, these alliances pose a threat not only to Yemen, but to the region and its stability as well. [Matar] And did you sense any U.S. understanding of this threat? [Al-'Attas] There is understanding...yes, there is understanding and awareness of what is happening. [Matar] The U.S. State Department's statement, which considered the bombardment of Aden a violation of Resolution 924, represents a change in the U.S. position. But this change remains slow with regard to recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen and confronting the government in Sanaa. Will this change continue? [Al-'Attas] I believe that the U.S. position has from the outset been positive and balanced. And the U.S. Adminstration's focus on securing and consolidating a cease-fire is a good step. Washington actually believes that unity cannot be imposed by force. It also says that no decision on Yemen's future can be taken in war conditions. It is a balanced position. But regrettably, the other side in Sanaa has not responded to it. It has continued the war despite the Security Council resolution. As for the administration saying that the bombardment of Aden represents a violation of the resolution, it is a big development in the U.S. position, which is balanced and consistent with its positions since the crisis broke out. I expect the U.S. position to develop in the same direction until a real and complete cease-fire has been imposed -- a cease-fire that allows a peaceful dialogue between the two sides to tackle political conditions. [Matar] Will the U.S. position reach the stage of recognizing you officially? [Al-'Attas] I believe that the main mission discussed between us and the Security Council members is the cease-fire. [Matar] Why has not a single state recognized you openly? [Al-'Attas] Because the main mission is the cease-fire.
