FR940725-0-00073 FR940725-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG83 Exclusions From Income (Tribal Trust Land Income) AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning income exclusions. The purpose of the rule is to implement recent legislation excluding from countable income under federal programs up to $2,000 per year of income received by an American Indian beneficiary from trust or restricted lands. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective January 1, 1994, the date specified in Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Trowbridge, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, telephone (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VA administers several income-based benefit programs under which a claimant's countable income determines the rate of VA benefits payable. 38 CFR 3.271 states that payments of any kind from any source shall be counted as income for purposes of the Improved Pension program unless specifically excluded under ยง3.272. 38 CFR 3.261(a)(1) states that total income from business, investment, and rents is countable income for purposes of the Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation program and prior pension programs. In Precedent Opinion 76&hyph;90 dated July 18, 1990, the VA General Counsel held that although Indian trust lands were an excludable resource for purposes of net worth determinations, rental income from these lands received by beneficiaries of VA's income-based benefit programs is considered income for VA purposes. Section 13736 of Public Law 103&hyph;66 amended 25 U.S.C. 1408 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of income received from trust or restricted lands shall be excluded from the income of individual Indians when determining eligibility for assistance from any Federal program. 25 CFR 151.2(d) defines ``trust land'' as land the title to which is held in trust by the United States for an individual Indian or a tribe. 25 CFR 151.2(e) defines ``restricted land'' as land the title to which is held by an individual Indian or a tribe and which can only be alienated or encumbered by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. We are amending 38 CFR 3.261, 3.262, and 3.272 to show that up to $2,000 per year of income from trust or restricted lands is excludable from the countable income of an individual Indian. The purpose of this rule is to amend the regulations to be consistent with the provisions of Section 13736 of Public Law 103&hyph;66. A notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this amendment simply corresponds to the provisions of section 13736 of Public Law 103&hyph;66. Since a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published, this amendment is not a ``rule'' as defined in and made subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601(2). In any case, this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the RFA, 5 U.S.C. sections 601&hyph;612. This amendment will not directly affect any small entity. The catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.105.
