Specialists of the VTsIOM and the Ebert Fund polled about 400 business leaders in 12 regional centers of Russia: chiefs of administrations, mayors of cities, directors of enterprises, merchants, bankers, and stock brokers. These people's views on the problems of separation of power, the development of Russian federalism, and the division of authority between the center and the provinces were the subject of the sociologists' study. It is customary to think that the opinion of the oblast leader carries weight only after it makes its way to Moscow--over seven decades it has become so firmly set in our brains that we frequently overlook statements from "provincials." And we take notice only when the justifiably offended region proclaims itself to be the "center." Scholars are supposed to be intelligent in that they are the first to recognize the tendencies in the development of society. Clearly aware of who will be the main force in the forthcoming extra or regular presidential elections, sociologists have decided to insure themselves ahead of time against surprises like the one that occurred on 12 December of last year. And it seems that they have achieved a certain amount of success. I am thinking of the information that --as a country that could serve as an example for Russia in economic development, China was named in first place, then came Western Europe and Japan, and the United States came only after that, --two-thirds of those questioned think that Russia's economy should be a unified organism, --85 percent of businessmen think that all regions of the country must have the same degree of independence and autonomy, and only 11 percent think that the regions densely populated by non-Russian nationalities should have a special national status, --when evaluating the attempt at the putsch in Moscow during 3-4 October 1993, 40 percent of those questioned think what happened was a "predictable outcome of the resistance of the Supreme Soviet to the democratic transformations and market reforms." One-third think that the putsch was organized by political and military adventurists and the legislative and executive powers were drawn into it. And 27 percent think that this was an "authoritarian coup of the Yeltsin government which eliminated the parliamentary branch of power and established a dictatorship," --on the whole almost half of the businessmen in Russia assess the political situation in Russia as a loss of order, growth of anarchy, etc. What do you think of the course of the political reforms in the country? [Following are converted from bar graphs] The reforms should be continued, but gradually, without shock measures and increasing the social protection of the population--66 percent. The reforms should be continued using more radical measures than at present--23.7 percent. Which of our society's domestic problems are bothering you most now? the weakness and helplessness of state power--45.2 percent the growth of the number of crimes--45 percent the growth of prices--33.2 percent the crisis of ethics, culture, and morality--31.9 percent the disintegration of economic ties among the republics of the former Union--31.7 percent the threat of mass unemployment--20.4 percent the corruption of representatives of the state apparatus--20.4 percent the aggravation of national conflicts--10.8 percent the threat of a dictatorship--8.5 percent the deterioration of the condition of the environment--7.8 percent the shortage of food products and necessities--3.5 percent the abandonment of the ideals of socialism--2 percent. Tell us, please, which economic system seems to you to be the most correct for Russia? the one based on private property and market relations--72.2 percent difficult to answer--15.2 percent the one based on state planning and distribution--12.7 percent. In your opinion, which of the business leaders and economists have the correct idea of how to lead Russia out of the economic crisis? Yavlinskiy--42.7 percent Gaydar--19.1 percent Volskiy--13.3 percent Travkin--8 percent Chernomyrdin--7.8 percent Shakhray--6.5 percent B. Fedorov--6.3 percent Abalkin--5.3 percent Ryzhkov--5.3 percent Borovoy--3.5 percent Shatalin--3.5 percent
