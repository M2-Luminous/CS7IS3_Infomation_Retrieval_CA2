At the high-ranking government and party policy coordination meeting held on 7 May, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "The issue of the IAEA's presence when North Korea changes its fuel rods is one of the preconditions to continue the DPRK-U.S. dialogue." He added: "The government is currently strengthening cooperation with allies, including the United States, for a smooth resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. We will work to make North Korea realize the seriousness of the current situation by using the DPRK- U.S. channel and the Chinese channel."
