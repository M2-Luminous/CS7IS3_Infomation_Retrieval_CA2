Take notice that on January 21, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) and Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel) filed a Joint Offer of Settlement that would modify Questar's gathering rates, as set forth on proposed Substitute Original Sheet No. 7 of First Revised Volume No. 1 and Substitute Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Revised Sheets No. 8 of Original Volume No. 3 of its FERC Gas Tariff included in its settlement. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the settlement is being filed under Rule 602 (18 CFR ยง385.602) and accordingly the Commission will treat the tariff sheets as pro forma sheets only and not a filing under section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the settlement would change the rate for gathering services rendered to Mountain Fuel, Questar's local distribution company affiliate, pursuant to a Questar-Mountain Fuel gathering service contract entered into October 11, 1993, and would make the same rates available to any firm gathering customer on Questar's system. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the Settlement provides that the new rates would be made effective September 1, 1993, the effective date of Questar's new rates under its order No. 636 restructuring in Docket No. RS92&hyph;9. Questar and Mountain Fuel further state that the rates are based on the cost of service of the facilities used to provide gathering services to Mountain Fuel and are to be effective through August 31, 1995. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that a copy of the filing has been provided to the parties in Docket No. RS92&hyph;9 and to the Utah Public Service Commission and the Public Service Commission of Wyoming. All parties to the proceedings in Docket No. RS92&hyph;9&hyph;000, et al., are automatically parties to this proceeding. Any other person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Pursuant to Rule 602, initial comments in the proposed settlement must be filed on or before February 10, 1994, and reply comments on or before February 22, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
