Unconfirmed reports, coming from Middle East sources, have it that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has felt the Syrian grip on his organization tightening up and is now seeking a better base for the movement. Through his own contacts with Armenians in Syria and Lebanon, sources claimed, Ocalan is currently making arrangements to base the PKK in Kurdish area of Armenia where the organization has increasing mass support. Observers here suspect that such reports aim at putting Turkey's policy with regard to Syria off track and forcing it to ease its pressure on the PKK. Recently, Turkish officials signed a security protocol with the Syrians, accepting the exchange of terrorists and the extradition of draft dodgers. A majority of PKK militants are known to be draft evaders. Syria also guaranteed it would not allow terrorist organizations to use its territories. Turkey observes a complete embargo on Armenia and has no diplomatic ties with the country. Turkish contacts with Armenia only take place on a multilateral level and are limited to such things as the Black Sea Economic Cooperation scheme, CSCE and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. With Syria, however, Turkey has strong bilateral ties and there is considerable U.S. pressure on that country as well. Official sources in Ankara suspect that the message given via speculation on the PKK leadership's intention to move is that if Syria is further pressurized, Turkey may lose any indirect control it has on this organization. In other words, the message could be that if Turkish pressure goes too far and the Syrians get more disturbed over Ankara's tightening grip, it could send the PKK off to a country where it will flourish freely. If the PKK is based in Armenia, it would be literally impossible to prevent its organizational activities there with the lack of diplomatic contact. Meanwhile, security sources on Tuesday denied a report which appeared as a banner story in the Turkish daily HURRIYET and said there had been no contact between the National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and the Syrian secret service, Mukhabarat. HURRIYET claimed in its report that two MIT officers had secretly travelled to Damascus last week and were taken to the house where PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan lived. The report said the agents saw someone in the garden who "looked like" Ocalan but could not be sure. It also noted that it was not clear whether the PKK leader was under custody or only protected very closely. The Syrians reportedly claimed he was detained. An intelligence source, who asked not to be identified, told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that no one from MIT had visited Syria recently for the said purpose. He said "the scenario" described in the paper was not possible "since such relations do not exist between our service and theirs."
