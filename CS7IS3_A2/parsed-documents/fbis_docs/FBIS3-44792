In order to implement the "Decision," the authorities called a series of meetings on economic work in early November, which resulted in a decision on introducing a number of plans in 1994 to reform the banking, financial and taxation, investment, foreign trade, and modern enterprise systems. Unexpectedly, however, the prices of grain and edible oil have risen drastically by up to 20 or 30 percent in 35 large and medium cities throughout the country since late November last year, causing panic among the public. Eighteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have experienced a tide of panic purchases of grain, edible oil, and light industrial products. To deal with this, the authorities immediately started a comprehensive operation, since stabilization of the grain price and the control of inflation are crucial to the smooth implementation of all the reform plans this year. All the country, from the top leadership to the grass- roots level, is called on to plunge into a concerted and resolute effort to keep down the soaring prices of grain and edible oil with a view to creating a favorable environment for this year's comprehensive reform. Ideas for a Free Economy Are Becoming Popular Among Cadres An informed source in Beijing quoted information released by the Ministry of Agriculture as saying that 1993 was another year of bumper harvest in China, the year's total grain output hitting a record high by outdoing that in 1992 which also enjoyed a good harvest. Information released by the Ministry of Internal Trade also revealed a storage of newly harvested grain kept by the state which roughly equaled that recorded in the corresponding period last year. However, the prices in the grain markets in coastal areas suddenly went up in late October. By late November, the retail price of grain in Guangdong Province increased by 10 percent over October while the rice price was rising in such grain producing provinces as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The increase in the rice price in south China has affected the grain market in north China, causing the wheat and corn prices to increase to a varying extent. The grain price hikes have led to price increases for other commodities, thus causing panic among the public and a tide of panic purchasing of grain, edible oil, and even household electrical appliances in many cities. The grain price is soaring at the moment as the country reaps a bumper harvest. What is the reason for this abnormal price fluctuation? Analysis shows that this is mainly because some leading cadres who lack a correct understanding of the market economy believe that the market economy means a completely free economy, that the state may leave the grain price alone once the restrictions on the grain price are lifted, and that any attempt by the state to keep down the grain price is against the principles governing the market economy and equates with backtracking. Based on this logic, they have let commodity prices increase without taking any anti-inflationary measures. The chain effects of price raises would have been increasingly aggravated if Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council, had not promptly called a national work meeting in Beijing on 25 December to discuss and adopt measures to keep down the prices of grain and edible oil, after he found some problems during his inspection tour in Anhui in late November last year. The informed source said that the grain price hikes and the panic purchasing tide had alerted Deng Xiaoping, who had urged the authorities to seize the opportunity to speed up development. Having read reports from some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mid-December last year, Deng made the following comments to Yang Dezhong, deputy director of the CPC Central Committee General Office: 1) the above-mentioned occurrences reflect the delicate mental state of the public, of which party and government leaders at all levels should be clearly aware; 2) as far as the people's livelihood is concerned, party and government leaders at all levels must keep abreast with market developments at all times and do a good job in guiding and overseeing market operations; 3) common problems which may arise from the reform, especially those related to the capacity to withstand the impact of reform on the part of the public, must be promptly brought to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels and put on the order of the day; and 4) the central leadership has paid close attention to the present case in a timely manner and adopted resolute measures, indicating that the present collective leadership is becoming mature. Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji Step Forward To Accept Responsibility The informed source noted that the CPC authorities agreed among themselves, after Deng Xiaoping's retirement, that whatever major issues arise thereafter concerning national unification and economic construction will still have to be referred to Deng Xiaoping for advice. Therefore, they have of course paid great attention to the above comments by Deng Xiaoping on the panic purchasing. The CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin personally called a meeting of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau on 24 December last year to discuss how to carry out Deng Xiaoping's instruction. Jiang Zemin made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said: "Recently, many localities have experienced a tide of panic purchasing of grain and edible oil. This indicates that we have overlooked the public's reaction to price fluctuations while concentrating on the party's central task. Comrade Xiaoping's instruction is both a support for us and a criticism against us. We must not treat this tide of panic purchasing triggered off by widespread price raises as an individual event but view this issue from the high plane of economic development. We must not be ovedr confident about the public's capacity to withstand inflation and thus treat the problem lightly. Changes in the prices of grain and edible oil as basic commodities on the market have a bearing not only on the immediate interests of cadres and the public but also on the public's trust in the party and the government. They will affect the extent to which the public displays enthusiasm and initiative in reform and determines whether or not we will be able to create a stable social environment. Therefore, we must curb inflation resolutely and without hesitation." On the following day, that is 25 December, at a national meeting on the operation to keep down the increasing prices of grain and edible oil, Zhu Rongji, on behalf of the State Council, accepted the responsibility for this occurence. Meanwhile, he pointed out that the principal party and government leaders in some localities were also responsible for the fault. He said that they, as leaders, must not only take the initiative in bearing responsibility but must also try to find out the causes for the case and draw a lesson from it. Zhu Rongji asserted: "Stabilizing the grain price and fighting inflation will be a task of crucial importance to the smooth progress of reform next year (that is, 1994). Our leading people at all levels must resolutely adopt every economic means, applying some auxiliary administrative means where necessary, to rigidly regulate the intensity of the price reform and keep the margin of price increases within a limit that is acceptable to the public." Zhu also urged the judicial sector to penalize according to the law those who corner the market, jack up the grain price for staggering profits, and practice favoritism by abuse of power. Inflation Is the Greatest Risk Factor Thanks to the authorities' prompt reaction, the tide of price raises prevailing in certain parts of China in the fourth quarter last year has now been checked. However, this year's inflation situation still remains a question of common concern among the public. The China Price Information Center holds that, given the intensity of regulation and control exercised by the state through its economic and price policies, the general commodity price level will be going up moderately and slowly this year. Specifically, it may go up by 10 percent as compared with the 13 percent inflation rate last year. The center also pointed out: "Ample supply of grain means stability" and, so long as the prices of agricultural products remain stable, the market price level on the whole will not experience great fluctuation. However, some economic experts hold that the reform process will involve more and more risk factors because China's economy is entering a high-growth stage. Of such risk factors, inflation must be the most crucial one. After all, China's economy is still rather delicate, the public's mental preparedness for economic impact is still rather insufficient, the economic development standard varies considerably from locality to locality, and the income gap between the rich and the poor is very wide. The authorities must be well aware of this situation and must not overestimate the community's capacity to withstand inflation. Last year, the commodity retail price level went up by 13 percent, the volume of living expenses in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent, and the delayed effects of these developments will turn out to be a very great pressure on the economy this year. Therefore, the inflation rate may go up this year, given the expanded scale of investment in fixed assets, the impact of the unification of the foreign exchange rate system, and the increase in the prices of fuel and farm products. In addition, the view that equates the market economy to free economy is still rather popular among cadres and the phenomenon of price raises as a consequence of interference with the market by abuse of power will most likely reoccur from time to time. All these factors discourage people from being optimistic about China's success in the price reform this year.
