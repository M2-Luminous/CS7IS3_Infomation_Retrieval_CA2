FBIS4-58577 "drnes087dd_94023" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs PFLP, DFLP Reject Cairo Agreement PFLP, DFLP Reject Cairo Agreement JN0405180594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1515 GMT 4 May 94 JN0405180594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] said that signing the Israel-PLO agreements in Cairo and in Paris confirms Israel's success in circumventing the implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy, including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. In a press statement today, the PFLP's official spokesman said that the signing of the agreements enables Israel to consecrate its occupation and illegal measures such as building settlements, confiscating territories, annexing and judaizing Jerusalem, and continuing economic hegemony over the occupied territories. The PFLP spokesman said that the front is not obligated by the agreements reached and that it will continue to struggle until the Palestinian people's objectives are achieved. The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] said that the Cairo agreement, which was signed today, brought to light all the misleading, cheating, and false claims on the nature of self rule in Gaza and Jericho. The DFLP explained that withdrawal has been replaced by redeployment, noting that the presence of settlements was legitimized by the fact that the Oslo team recognized these settlements and agreed to have their security protected by Palestinians. In a statement distributed today, the DFLP said that the agreement opens the door to normalizing Arab-Israeli relations which threaten the fate of all Arab territories under occupation and the future of the Palestinian people. The statement adds: As the DFLP rejects the agreement and condemns those who signed it, it announces that the agreement is not binding to the Palestinian people and that it will continue its struggle to achieve the Palestinian people's right to liberate their territories from the occupation, to achieve self-determination, and to establish their independent state.
