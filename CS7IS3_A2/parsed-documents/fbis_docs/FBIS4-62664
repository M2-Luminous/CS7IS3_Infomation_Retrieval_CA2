This is the first-ever top-level contact between Japan and Uzbekistan -- previously this country simply did not exist. He is the third president from the former Soviet expanses of Central Asia to visit Japan in the last few months. The season was opened by the visit to Tokyo by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President Askar Akayev in April last year; this April saw the arrival of Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Uzbek leader's itinerary is one of sightseeing tours, although it is also replete with the necessary and traditional protocol events -- a reception and dinner with the emperor, short talks, and lunch with the prime minister. There is a meeting with business circles, and a long and varied tour of the sights. In fact, the working part of Karimov's four-day visit to Japan is essentially restricted to one event. Bilateral contacts have so far been scanty, and there is virtually nothing of substance to talk about. The Japanese knew in advance that the guest would be asking for money and other aid in various forms, while talking about the Republic's potential wealth. Incidentally, everyone willingly recognizes Uzbekistan's raw-materials potential, but there seems to be some hesitation about providing material confirmation of this in the form of investment, loans, and participation in joint-venture projects. Several Japanese business delegations have visited Uzbekistan of late, studying market conditions and assessing Uzbekistan's potential to meet Japanese requirements -- but no large-scale program for Japanese participation in boosting Uzbekistan has yet been arranged. Of course, the first-ever visit to Tokyo by an Uzbek president will not go unmarked, and there will be some economic "souvenirs" to take away, but people in the know believe that the Japanese-Uzbek dialogue during the summit trip will probably not go beyond symbolism. It is believed behind the scenes in Tokyo that the phrases "it is important to start small and not rush" and "a long journey begins with a single step" will be to the fore in the upcoming Japanese-Uzbek talks. The Japanese media are preparing their audience in their own way for the important Uzbek guest's visit. Thus, for instance, the newspaper ASAHI featured a long article by Yusuke Matsuzaki, who is the senior and the only Japanese adviser to the Uzbek Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank]. The adviser openly notes that in the run-up to his pension he was looked upon as "unnecessary garbage" in Japan, but in Uzbekistan he can still show what he is capable of at age 60. The adviser talks about the promising plan to produce teflon frying pans in Uzbekistan with Turkish assistance, and writes about loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on whose distribution the Uzbek Vneshekonombank is currently working. Another newspaper -- MAINICHI -- published a leader to mark Karimov's arrival, reporting on Uzbekistan's natural resources, its proximity to Turkey, and the fact that it is important for Japan to correctly develop relations with the former Soviet Central Asia. And the newspaper noted that, although diplomacy should be determined by cool calculation and proceed on the basis of Japan's own interests, in the case of Central Asia in general and Uzbekistan in particular they should make allowances and permit a bit of romance to enter the equation. The romance, in MAINICHI's opinion, lies in the fact that Uzbekistan lies astride the old "Silk Road" -- so expanding the dialogue with it will be romantic and touching.
