FR940617-1-00084 FR940617-1-00012 Fluorosalan was not classified as an OTC topical antimicrobial ingredient in the previous tentative final monograph because the agency stated that final regulatory action had been taken against ``*␣*␣* the halogenated salicylanilides, particularly *␣*␣* fluorosalan (21 CFR 310.508) *␣*␣*'' (43 FR 1210 at 1227). Although no comments were received, the agency notes that fluorosalan was not addressed in the final rule for halogenated salicylanilides (21 CFR 310.508), published in the Federal Register of October 30, 1975 (40 FR 5027). In reviewing the Antimicrobial I Panel's recommendations, the agency has determined that the Panel did not intend to include fluorosalan in the group of halogenated salicylanilides which it recommended be handled more expeditiously by the agency in a separate Federal Register notice. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking for certain halogenated salicylanilides as active or inactive ingredients in drug and cosmetic products (September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33102) and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33103 at 33120).) The agency affirms the recommendation of the Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33121) that fluorosalan be classified as Category II for use in antiseptic handwash, health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products. The following charts are included as a summary of the categorization of health-care antiseptic active ingredients proposed by the agency.
