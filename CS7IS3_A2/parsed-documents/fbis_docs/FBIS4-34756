Following the forced entry into the Belgian Embassy, other groups of Cubans separately entered into the German Embassy and the Chilean Consulate, but in none of these cases have Cuban authorities allowed the perpetrators of these illegal acts to leave the country. A recent statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry was explicit enough to make potential violators give up their goal of violating the norms that regulate diplomatic sites worldwide. This is not the first time groups have tried to use embassies or ambassador's residences as springboards for their immediate exit from Cuba because they believe that the fanfare of the act itself and the political character they want to give it will ease the way. The Cuban authorities' position has always been to firmly deny such demands. In these new cases, as on previous occasions, the Cuban authorities have insisted that people who commit such crimes may return to their homes without facing charges, although the perpetrators will not be exempt from punishment for previous crimes or for crimes committed during the forced entry into a diplomatic site. The previously mentioned Cuban Foreign Ministry statement was even more dynamic in confirming that anyone who enters a diplomatic site by force will never be authorized to leave the country, even if they later abandon the site. By stating clearly that people involved in such acts permanently lose the right to leave the country, the Cuban Government has taken the necessary steps to better protect embassies which, it seems, have become the target of individuals who would like to leave the island through this ill-suited path without being politically persecuted. As Belgian, German, and Chilean diplomats have seen, the people they are harboring are not the object of political persecution. Moreover, it is very clear that these individuals are additions to a long list of Cubans who want to emigrate to the United States, but the U.S. Interests Section in Havana continues to grant visas with an eyedropper, denying visas to most of applicants. With the Foreign Ministry's recent statement, Cuba has stressed its traditional policy of not giving in to pressure exerted by people who purport to emigrate by illegal and even violent means.
