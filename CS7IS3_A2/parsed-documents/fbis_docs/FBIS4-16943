The results of the poll show that Premier Sangheli is preferred by 46 percent and Speaker Petru Lucinschi by 31 percent of respondents. In third place of the poll is situated Nicolae Andronic, vice-president of the Moldovan Parliament, preferred by 23 percent of those interviewed. The same poll also charts the popularity of the Parliamentary factions. The Democratic Agrarian Party [PDAM] is the most popular, 67 percent preferred it. The Socialist Party and "Unitate-Edinstvo" Movement received, respectively, 29 percent and 4 percent. The unionist forces have a low popularity compared with the electoral period. This is prompted by an apparent lack of constructive activity. Until now the right wing opposition confined itself only to "undivided rejection and tough, emotive and unfounded attacks against the deputies of the majority faction," states the commentary in "MOLODEZH MOLDOVY."
