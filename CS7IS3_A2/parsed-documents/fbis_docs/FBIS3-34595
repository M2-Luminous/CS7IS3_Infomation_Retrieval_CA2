I wonder if it is the result of catching one of the mysterious diseases unleashed by the Gulf War, or if it is a manifestation of early senility. A few days ago, he came up with what is said to be a carefully drafted report he will submit to Congress. In this report, he claims Iraq has continued to produce nuclear weapons. In his fits of imagination, however, Clinton fails to substantiate his charges by identifying the place where these weapons are produced, or mentioning the components of these weapons allegedly produced by Iraq. The senility charge against Clinton is substantiated by the fact that he has begun to see things nobody else sees. He is urging others to believe claims he himself, before others, knows to be baseless things, the products of his own imagination. Otherwise, how could Iraq produce weapons, traces of the components of which are not found on its territory, as international experts have acknowledged? There are international monitoring cameras installed at its plants. Moreover, there are UN helicopters monitoring banned activities. Clinton's task is currently confined to anti-Iraq instigation. This seems to be his personal obsession. Still, overindulgence in imagination will eventually make him unstable. He will eventually become a hostage to a chronic disease, to depression and to allergy to Iraq's recovery, that will be promoted day in and day out. The end result is that Clinton will continue to grow weak and shrivel, regardless of the lies he promotes.
