FR940216-0-00139 FR940216-0-00010 Thus, for example, all gasoline produced or imported on or after December 1, 1994 will have to be designated as reformulated or conventional. If it is designated as reformulated it will have to comply with reformulated gasoline standards. If it does not comply with reformulated gasoline standards, it will have to be designated as conventional, segregated from reformulated gasoline, and clearly labeled as conventional gasoline and not intended for use in any covered area. In the case of reporting requirements, EPA intends that no quarterly or averaging reports will be submitted in 1994, and that the first quarterly report in 1995, that must be submitted by May 31, 1995, will be the first reformulated gasoline report. As a result, all batch-specific information for gasoline produced during 1994 should be included in the first quarter 1995 report. A provision is included in the final rule to this effect, at ยง80.75(a)(3). Similarly, EPA does not intend that a separate attest engagement must be performed at the conclusion of 1994, but that the 1995 attest engagement must include all gasoline produced or imported in 1994. EPA also has included a provision in the final rule, at ยง80.67(i), to specify the manner in which standards are met for reformulated gasoline produced to average (as opposed to per-gallon) standards during 1994. Proposed provisions dealing with averaging did not address this category of reformulated gasoline, because the averaging proposals only addressed gasoline produced beginning in January 1995. The provision in the final rule specifies that reformulated gasoline that is produced or imported during 1994 but that is intended to be used in 1995 may meet the reformulated gasoline standards on average, provided that the refiner or importer satisfies the gasoline quality survey prerequisite during 1995. The provision further specifies that any such average compliance reformulated gasoline must be grouped with gasoline produced or imported during 1995 for purposes of compliance calculations, as well as reporting. As a result of the requirement that for each parameter only the per-gallon or only the average standard may be used during each averaging period, the compliance approach used for each parameter in 1994 (per-gallon vs. average) must also be used for all of 1995. EPA believes this approach for average compliance gasoline produced in 1994 is appropriate, because it represents the alternative that preserves the opportunity for refiners and importers to meet standards on average for this category of gasoline, with the smallest regulatory burden for regulated parties and for EPA. EPA considered, and rejected, the alternative of allowing parties to use only the per-gallon standards during 1994, because of the adverse impact on flexibility of such a restriction. EPA also rejected the option of requiring that average standards must be met separately for gasoline produced or imported during 1994. 71 EPA believes there would be no significant environmental consequence of combining 1994-gasoline with 1995-gasoline for averaging purposes, but that the regulatory burden of separate accounting for 1994-gasoline would be significant. The simple model standards that will apply for gasoline produced or imported during 1994 are limited to oxygen, benzene, and toxics emissions performance, because this gasoline will not be VOC-controlled. These parameters are regulated because of toxic pollution concerns, and have the relatively long averaging period of twelve months because the threat of toxic pollution is long-term, cumulative in nature. EPA believes that combining the limited volume of 1994-gasoline with 1995-gasoline is consistent with the long-term averaging approach to toxics generally. 71 A refiner or importer who produces or imports reformulated gasoline using the average standards, but who uses only the per-gallon standards during 1995, would be required to meet the average standards using the 1994-gasoline only.
