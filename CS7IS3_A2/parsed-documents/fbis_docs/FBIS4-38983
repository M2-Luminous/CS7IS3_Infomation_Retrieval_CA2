I am convinced that if the Supreme Council of the previous convocation had approached this issue in a similar way then we probably would not have had so many problems today. Recent events that have taken place in the Republic of Crimea are causing serious anxiety and worry both in Ukraine and beyond it, and in Europe as well as in the world community. At issue is not only the safeguarding of Ukraine's territorial integrity but the preservation of peace and security, above all, on the European continent. The present situation which is unfolding in the Republic of Crimea requires a profound and detailed discussion by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, and I support the speeches made here today. They also demand that the Supreme Council adopt decisions appropriate to the situation. As you know, on 10 May this year, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution on suspending the actions of the law of the Republic of Crimea on restoring the constitutional bases of Crimea's statehood. It was proposed that the Crimean Supreme Council should, within 10 days, bring the Crimean Constitution into line with the Constitution of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine on the division of powers between the bodies of state powers of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine's Supreme Council created a commission in order to hold talks with Crimea's Supreme Council on this issue. Talks were held between the delegations of both Supreme Councils, according to the results of which the delegations agreed to form a joint working group to elaborate the agreed proposals of Ukraine's Supreme Council and Crimea's Supreme Council. In addition, according to the results of these talks, it was proposed that the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils should, within three days, discuss suspending the acts adopted on 20 May this year for the duration of the working group's activities. The 10-day period has elapsed; however, Crimea's Supreme Council has not brought Crimea's Constitution into line with Ukraine's Constitution. Therefore, the power bodies of the Republic of Crimea are continuing the policy of ignoring the Ukrainian Constitution, our state's legislation, Supreme Council resolutions, and generally recognized principles and norms of international law. The question arises: Is this an accident or is it connected with the failure by the Crimean powers to understand the situation, or could it be a reflection of the strategic policy which the leadership of the Republic of Crimea is implementing? Our assessment testifies to the fact that this is not an accident. The point is not in a good or a bad president but lies elsewhere. A political force -- a party -- came to power in Crimea that proclaimed the secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine and the return of the Republic of Crimea to Russia as its strategic course. This is the strategic course. This strategic course is divided into stages. The first stage is the adoption of a constitution that, in essence, would mean or would let everyone understand or draw the conclusion that Crimea is an independent state and that, as such, it can decide on its future on a contractual basis. In other words, it can decide on it in a constitutional way, so to say, proceeding, however, from the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea only and ignoring the laws and the Constitution of Ukraine. There is yet another way that is also being discussed. I would like us to discuss about this openly today. This way is the restoration of the former Soviet Union -- the fact of which is exactly the solution to all problems. In other words, all the problems would be removed because there would be no states. Their status would be changed. The problem of their territorial integrity, sovereignty and so on, would acquire quite a different nature, or -- let us say this openly -- states would cease to exist as such. These are the two ways as they are viewed in Crimea. Why are they insisting on the first way? Because they are not convinced that it would be such a simple issue for Crimea to return to the Soviet Union and, speaking openly, it is not such a simple and realistic option within the composition of states of the former USSR. I stress: Any kind of explanations by the power structures of Crimea that they are acting in this way simply because Ukraine or its powers are so principled has absolutely no basis to it. This is meant for naive people. They say that if Kravchuk had not adopted these decrees on reconstituting the structures of the state security bodies -- the Internal Affairs Ministry -- then, they say, perhaps the Supreme Council of Crimea would not have adopted the law. Such an explanation is being proffered. Furthermore, they say that if President Kravchuk had not implemented the Supreme Council resolution -- incidentally the Supreme Council gave me a month to do this -- on creating a representation in Crimea, the situation would not have become so exacerbated. So, these are the explanations which some of them use to taunt us. But this is not the point. I stress, the point is in the implementation of a strategic policy by a force that has come to power. These explanations are meant for the people and not as a serious policy. Please tell me why the Crimean authorities react so sharply to any Ukrainian -- I stress Ukrainian -- presence in Crimea? It is because they want to prove unambiguously to everybody that Crimea and Ukraine have nothing in common with each other. They say that there is something in the constitution which could be interpreted differently. Once again, however, this is meant for the people. They say to Ukraine: You want to satisfy your ambitions that Crimea is in the composition of Ukraine; then, de jure, we could write something which is ambiguous but de facto you are not there anymore: you are not present in the power bodies nor in relation to any specific issue. This is the reality, and it is being consistently implemented step by step in relation to the armed forces, dual citizenship, and citizenship. If you analyze all these problems then the result is unambiguous, and I came to this conclusion at the very beginning. It is therefore clear today that we need to define our position in, as they say, an unambiguous way. Or we could, as some people are proposing, agree to anything just to maintain peace and quiet, and I am also in favor of this. But I am in favor of peace and quiet in relation to one thing only -- to place Crimea within the framework of the Constitution and laws. If we can do this -- and we are obliged to place Crimea within the framework of the constitution and laws -- then all other issues will be resolved. I repeat: All other issues will be resolved. There will be compromises, flexibility, and other things, and everything will be done by Ukraine's executive authorities and the Ukrainian president in order to find accord, cooperation, and mutual understanding. But if this basic and fundamental issue -- to the effect that Crimea is in the framework of Ukraine's constitution and laws -- is not finally resolved, then none of the other issues will be resolved. This is the founding principle and we should begin from this. What is happening in Crimea today is, I repeat, a very dangerous precedent. We should give it a clear legal assessment. The leadership of the Supreme Council of Crimea ignores the fact that the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, with broad rights in the socioeconomic and cultural spheres, and in the sphere of organizing social life. At the same time, the Republic of Crimea, as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not a bearer of state sovereignty and, in accordance with our constitution, cannot enter into political relations with foreign states. The renewal of the principles within the Crimean constitution that the Republic of Crimea builds its relations with Ukraine on a contractual basis contravenes the autonomy's constitutional status. They often cite the fact that in the Russian Federation there are contractual relations between the Federation and subjects of the Federation, particularly in Tatarstan. If you familiarize yourself with this document which we have here and which could be given to you -- it is not a secret document, it has been published and so on -- yes, this is an agreement, but even in the agreement which they are citing, the authorities of the federal power are clearly defined: the Army, the internal affairs bodies, and the security bodies all belong to the authority of the federal power. In Crimea they want these areas to be completely within the competence of Crimea. This is nothing but a collapse of the entire defense system, a collapse of Ukraine's sovereignty as a state and those forces which should defend the inviolability of borders of the state's sovereignty and integrity. What is being adopted by the Supreme Council and the president of Crimea is a practical transformation of autonomy into a bearer of state sovereignty and its secession from the composition of Ukraine, despite the slogans which may conceal this. In a legal sense it is necessary to stress that the constitution of Ukraine is valid throughout Ukraine, including the territory of the Republic of Crimea. The autonomy's constitution cannot contravene the constitution of Ukraine. The territory of Ukraine, which also includes the territory of Crimea, is single, indivisible, inviolable, and integral. Any changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders are not permitted without the agreement of the people of Ukraine. We all, both the executive and the legislative powers, should defend the integrity, inviolability, and indivisibility of our state. I hope that nobody has any doubt about this here. In connection with the attempts to introduce its own citizenship within the Republic of Crimea, I stress: The Republic of Crimea does not have its own citizenship which is separate from Ukraine's. This is not envisaged anywhere. Incidentally, I do not know, but perhaps someone has information about world practice where, for example, part of a state has its own citizenship. [Word indistinct] legal assessment requires a decision by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea with regard to the subordination of Ukraine's security services, internal affairs bodies, and other armed formations. In accordance with the law of Ukraine on the division of powers between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, and other laws of Ukraine, these issues cannot be decided by the higher bodies of state power of the Republic of Crimea. They are decided solely by Ukraine. Blatant violations of Ukraine's Consitution, of Ukraine's legislation, and of international legal norms are being carried out by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea, despite the fact that the higher bodies of state power of Ukraine, I stress, have created exceptionally broad possibilities for independently resolving the most important problems for the peninsula's population. It was the Supreme Council of Ukraine itself that gave the Crimean oblast the status of autonomy. Laws were adopted on the division of powers between the bodies of power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. A year ago -- as long ago as June 1993 -- the president of Ukraine signed a decree on an open economic system for the territory of the Republic of Crimea. Following this decree -- and this is very important -- we gave the Republic of Crimea the possibility of acting within broad legal limits in the economic sphere, I stress within broad legal limits. The Republic of Crimea requested that the Ukrainian Government change the budgetary relations, and the Government fully accepted the proposals submitted by the Republic of Crimea. Therefore, today this issue has been taken off the agenda, in the sense that Crimea's budget has certain rights, although it is true that Crimea today does not fulfil its obligations in relation to Ukraine's budget, and does not pay what it should pay according to the norms and (?payments) of the budget's clauses. Second, the president of Crimea issued a host of decrees on currency regulation and on taxation, which placed the Republic of Crimea in an appropriate regional condition. We knew that there were certain violations, but we did not demand that they should be repealed because we wanted to give the Crimea the chance to act autonomously in the economic sphere if the Crimeans themselves wanted this. I stress, there are no poblems today with regard to any restrictions in Crimea's economic sphere. Moreover, we see that this is leading to certain complications in economic relations, which has affected money and other issues from one region to another. Now we are also thinking about how we can take certain steps on a Ukrainian-wide scale. I will tell you: I have instructed the Government to prepare a whole package of documents on changing the taxation system, which will be sent to the oblasts for analysis, and then passed to the Ukrainian Supreme Council for adoption. Concern is being caused by the fact that in order to carry out its economic and political strategy, the senior leadership of the Republic of Crimea is attracting, on a wide basis, specialists and personnel from Russia. I think there is even a certain contempt for local cadres, and there are such experts in Crimea who are experienced and who could take charge of the most important posts in the republic. However, the problem is set in such a way as to make it seem as though these cadres are not capable, and therefore one needs to attract personnel only from Russia. I am not even talking about certain violations here with regard to the principle of Ukraine's law on citizenship. I granted Premier Yevhen Saburov Ukrainian citizenship, but this was an exception. I have the right to do this, but it is an exception. But what about the others? There are no exceptions. So once again, even here there are certain deviations from Ukrainian laws. This is the practical and legal aspect, but the moral and ethnic aspect of this lies in the fact that there is a direct contempt for cadres who were raised in Crimea. This is a direct contempt. A number of resolutions on guaranteeing the socio-economic development of the peninsula were adopted by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers. Among them are resolutions on the division of property in state ownership, general state ownership, and the property of the Republic of Crimea. Therefore, I conclude that all issues pertaining to the economy which the Republic of Crimea puts forward are being tackled by the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Government. Taking into account that, during the last month the leadership of the Republic of Crimea has adopted a number of acts that contravene the Ukrainian Constitution and Ukrainian legislation, the president of Ukraine, as guarantor of the Constitution, has repealed a number of decrees issued by the Crimean president. You are aware of these decrees. Taking into account the considerable complexity of the crime situation in the Republic of Crimea and the growth in organized crime and serious crimes, a decree issued by the president of Ukraine reorganized the security service, the internal affairs and justice bodies, and the main directorates of the relevant bodies of Ukrainian state executive power in the Republic of Crimea. Taking into account all these steps by the executive authority, it must be noted that the situation that has arisen in the Republic of Crimea requires the adoption of appropriate acts by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The situation whereby a legal uncertainty exists in relations between Ukraine and its autonomous part cannot remain indefinitely. We cannot permit a further exacerbation of the situation on the peninsula itself. Proceeding namely from these deliberations, I propose the following: First, to ensure -- and what is more, I would like it do be done without delay -- the formation of a Constitutional Court of Ukraine. The decisions of the Supreme Council of Crimea which contradict Ukraine's Constitution and legislation must be abrogated by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. However, the following variant is also possible: when the Supreme Council itself abrogates the decisions by the Supreme Council of Crimea, but then amendments should be introduced to the Constitution. The Constitution does not envisage an abrogation. It was envisaged to stop the effect of these decisions by the Crimean parliament. Read carefully. So, we stop them. Then you have already stopped them -- but for how long? I underscore that it should be clearly determined who is to abrogate. It is the Constitutional Court which abrogates. On my part, I can submit candidatures for the Constitutional Court of Ukraine very soon. Second, it is expedient to introduce amendments and additions to the Law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state power bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. This law must determine, in a more exact and specific manner, the competence of the autonomy, expand plenary powers -- however, within the limits of the recognition of the main principal postulate that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. And it is necessary to take into account the changes which have already taken place. This is because the election of the president of Crimea requires the introduction of relevant legal changes to the law on the delimitation of powers between the state power bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. By the way, it would be good for us to determine our stand in relation to actions by the Republic of Crimea concerning this law. You will remember, when the Supreme Council was adopting it, the following provision was entered into the resolution: that it comes into effect when the Republic of Crimea brings its constitution in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. But it has not been changed to date. Moreover, such amendments have been introduced which entirely ignore, or mainly ignore, the Constitution and laws of Ukraine. Third, I believe the following must also be done: to introduce amendments and additions to the laws of Ukraine on the security service of Ukraine, and on the militia, which was adopted back in 1990, and other enactments which regulate the activities of so-called power-wielding structures within the Republic of Crimea. The situation there at present is not simple, as far as the power-wielding structures are concerned -- the militia first and foremost. In the current conditions, in order to preserve peace and quiet on the peninsula, these structures within the Republic of Crimea must be subordinate solely to the center, as is the case in any state. We cannot and we have no right to allow the bodies called upon to ensure the protection of public order, the safety of the citizens and the state, to be turned into political organizations. Every power institution should exercise the powers established for it by law. It is necessary to build budgetary relations between the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Crimean Government on a legal basis. We have made such a decision at a governmental level, but this must be regulated by law. Next, with the aim of establishing contacts between the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the Supreme Council of Crimea, and more efficient parliamentary control over the situation in the Republic of Crimea, I would propose setting up a subcommission within one of the commissions that have already been set up at the Supreme Council. This subcommission would deal exclusively with Crimean issues at the Supreme Council of Ukraine. One can agree to the proposal by individual people's deputies of Ukraine on inaugurating the post of a Ukrainian vice premier dealing with territorial issues, taking into account that not only Crimean problems exist, but that, first and foremost, territorial problems exist and will exist in the economic sphere, too. I believe this is of great importance. Completion of the negotiating process with Russia on dividing the Black Sea Fleet is of principal importance for the settlement of the Crimean issue. Apart from proportions and the principles of division, this issue has two more aspects. First, it is necessary to solve the issue of taking the two fleets to different bases and, second, to determine clearly and legally the status of the Russian fleet, which will be temporarily based on Ukraine's territory. To determine the status. The solution of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will have a significant positive influence on developments in Crimea and will ease tensions in Ukrainian-Russian relations. The efforts of the Ukrainian delegation, led by Acting Premier Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, at the negotiations with Russian Premier Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin in Moscow on 23-25 May this year were targeted at achieving this very goal. The stand of the Ukrainian side at these negotiations took into account the fact that, in the present-day conditions, Russia objectively has no real alternatives to basing its fleet on the Black Sea. It has no alternatives. We accept this. Ukraine is striving toward such a decision on the Black Sea Fleet issue which, as a whole, would correspond to our national interests and take into account in real terms Russia's needs to ensure its security in a southerly direction. However, it is clear that this issue will not be always be tackled in the same way. Russia must set up a base for its fleet on its own territory. This is how our delegation posed this question. An agreement began to take shape on the fleet issues after the negotiations in Moscow on 23-25 May. This refers to such issues as the division of the floating means, on a principle, according to which, Ukraine takes the necessary number of ships; compensation for that part of the ships which Ukraine does not need today, and for the use of certain Ukrainian territories by Russia for the temporary basing of its fleet; determining the conditions of granting part of the shore-based infrastructure of Crimea to Russia on lease to ensure the needs of its fleet; and the division of the coastal defense forces, marine infantry, and land-based naval aviation which is part of the Black Sea Fleet. Among these issues is the determining of the order of settling accounts for the ships and vessels which had been written off by the Black Sea Fleet during the period after 3 August 1992. An agreement was reached at the negotiations to continue the talks within the next two weeks on those issues which have not been settled. Therefore, esteemed people's deputies, the regulation of the Crimean problem is of vital important for Ukraine, first and foremost for the Republic of Crimea itself. This is an issue of great politics today, and it concerns not only Ukraine. It is today a problem on a European, even a world scale. Today we are suffering both political and economic losses, and have not yet found a wise solution to the Crimean problem for the sake of peace on the continent, and for the sake of establishing friendly and partnership relations with our neighbors. If we do not solve this problem as the future demands, then the consequences will be even more dangerous. In my opinion, the way to resolve this problem is through strict adherence to the constitutional regime, both by the power structures of Ukraine and correspondingly by the structures of the Republic of Crimea. In setting out my views and conclusions, I am counting on the Supreme Council supporting the submitted proposals. Thank you for your attention.
