Under the new situation in which the socialist market economy system is being promoted and established, this is an important measure to strengthen macroeconomic management in order to maintain people's living conditions and deepen price reform. Maintaining relatively stable prices of basic necessities and services for residents has a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people, as well as on economic development, the deepening of reform, and social stability. Among commodities and services included in the "circular" by the State Council for supervision and examination, most have had price restrictions lifted and have been handed over to local governments for management. Of these, most are basic necessities such as the "shopping basket," "rice bag," and "stove," which account for a relatively big proportion of residents' expenditure. Changes in the prices of these commodities and services have already become a focus of concern among the masses. To stabilize the prices of basic necessities and services for residents, the party and government have already adopted a series of measures, such as increasing effective supply, strengthening macro regulation and control, and, in particular, grasping agriculture and the "shopping basket" project. This time, the State Council has decided to carry out supervision and examination of the prices of 20 commodities and services, and this is another practical thing done by the party and government for the masses of people. At present, the prices of an absolute majority of commodities and services have had restrictions lifted, and this is an important achievement of price reform. However, having lifted restrictions on prices does not mean that the duty of price reform has already been accomplished. According to the goals and demands of the reform of the economic system decided at the 14th party congress, the duty of price reform is to establish pricing mechanisms in which prices are mainly formed by market on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to establish a sound and effective system for the government to regulate and control market prices. Although we have done a great deal of work in this area over the years, we still lag behind the goals set by reform. Recently, the rise in the general level of prices in the whole country has been relatively big, and the market price order has been chaotic. One of the reasons is because corresponding reforms in the macroeconomic regulation and control and price regulation and control systems have not followed suit, and because there is no effective regulatory and control measure to deal with the great increases in commodities prices after the lifting of price restrictions. The announcement by the State Council on implementing the "circular" is a measure for the government to guide and moderately intervene in market prices after the lifting of restrictions on prices, and, with this, to promote and establish a price regulation and control system. This is another practical step in taking the initiative to adapt to the development needs of the socialist market economy and deepen price reform. The price regulatory and control measures mentioned in the "circular" have a precondition, that is, respect for enterprises' right to decide prices at their own discretion. The focus of the supervision and examination is not to stop enterprises from exercising their power to fix prices of commodities and services which have already had price restrictions lifted; it is to carry out appropriate restrictions on the strength and frequency of price increases for certain commodities within a certain period of time, and the purpose is to prevent prices from soaring. The "circular" has set out the general principle and demand of when the government carries out price intervention, whereas concrete implementation procedures will be worked out by local departments in charge of prices according to actual conditions in localities and will be implemented after securing approval from local people's governments. A price regulation and control system adapted to the needs of a socialist market economy must be perfected step by step during the practice of reform. Establishing a system of supervision and examination of the prices of basic necessities and services for residents is an exploration into establishing a new system of price regulation and control. We believe that with common efforts by various localities and relevant quarters, and with the support of the broad masses of the people, the implementation of this system will surely play a positive role in deepening reform, stabilizing the overall situation, and maintaining people's living conditions.
