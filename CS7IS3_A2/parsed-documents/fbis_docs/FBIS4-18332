He will take over at the head of this large unit from General Bertrand de la Presle who, a few days ago, himself took over from General Jean Cot as head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops in the former Yugoslavia. We all remember the "Philippe of Bosnia," or "General Courage" of one year ago. General Morillon, with the backing of Paris, took the front seat in a perilous mission to evacuate thousands of wounded people from the Muslim enclaves of Cerska and Srebenica. He did this in the face of hostile Serbian besiegers. He also did this, it should be admitted, scorning UN guidelines for "good" conduct. We all remember his voice, serious, warm, and full of emotion, and his words of resistance transmitted essentially to the West on the only radio that then connected him with the outside world. General Morillon had to leave Bosnia a few months later when, in the summer, General Cot was asked to take charge of the UNPROFOR troops. After being granted leave for recuperation and to write "an account of the most absurd war" entitled To Believe and To Dare, the Chronicle of Sarajevo, he was employed as an adviser to the Defense Ministry. This was a holding post for a soldier today aged 50. The initial plan of the French chiefs of staff was reported to be that General Morillon, with his experience of leading men and peacekeeping operations, should be made available to the United Nations to strengthen the limited resources of the international organization's chiefs of staff in New York, a body that is far too small. Butrus Butrus-Ghali did not accept France's proposal, doubtless because he did not want to displease certain diplomats, whom he could have upset not so much from the point of view of their comfort, but rather their very anglo-saxon habits and style. Tenth Anniversary The FAR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. Created when the Land Army was still composed of three corps, it replied to a major concern that was largely political: demonstrating France's desire to be, in the event of major conflict in central Europe, not just solidly behind the allies but immediately at their side. The force had to be capable of being deployed "quickly and far." Now, this idea of rapid deployment is gaining ground. It lies at the heart of the thinking behind the new white paper on defense. Since the threat from central Europe has diminished, the Land Army has, to some extent, been called upon to "deploy itself far and wide" since all of its operational resources -- 120,000 men in eight or nine divisions -- must be capable of "reaching out" over long distances. The FAR will thus increasingly share its unique mission with the mechanized armored corps. As a reserve force, it will retain its airborne capacity and as a result will be equipped with lighter resources. It will comprise 45,000 men and, for a few weeks, will still consist of five divisions: the 11th Parachute Division, the 6th Light Armored Division, the 9th Marine Infantry Division, the 4th Airborne Division; and the 27th Alpine Division. It is the latter which, on 1 July, will be subordinated to the 3rd Army Corps where, with increased equipment, it will become the 27th Mountain Infantry Division.
