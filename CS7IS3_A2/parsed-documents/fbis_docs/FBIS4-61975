This was said in a statement circulated by the movement today. The statement underlined that during the inter-Tajik talks in Moscow in April the opposition delegation had put forward a draft agreement on a temporary cease-fire. However, the "other party had not wanted even to discuss the draft which proved the destructive position taken by the Dushanbe regime." The statement also pointed out that the Tajik opposition did not threaten security of Tajikistan, Russia, and CIS states. "We, Tajik citizens temporarily situated beyond the borders of our Republic, want to go back to our Motherland and live in our houses," the statement said. "Real threat for Tajikistan and other CIS states stems from the forces hampering the peace settlement of the conflict," the statement emphasized. It also stressed that the opposition sought political settlement of the conflict. "We have nothing against the CIS Joint Peacekeeping Forces stationed in Tajikistan for defense from external offensives." "Our struggle is not aimed against any particular country. This is a conflict between the Tajik opposition and a narrow circle of people made us leave our Republic," the statement underlined.
