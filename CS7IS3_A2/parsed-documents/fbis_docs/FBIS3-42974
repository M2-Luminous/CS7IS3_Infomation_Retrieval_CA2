Maglevanyy, Center of Scientific Organization of Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy; UDC 334:669.2] [Text] Russia's metallurgical complex consisting of hundreds of independent enterprises and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy organizations represents 24 large subbranches of the industry each of which has clearly defined specific features of production, its own practices, equipment, units and machines, and specially trained personnel. In essence, each subbranch is an independent base branch of the industry with a high value of fixed capital. Mining operations have a discrete and cyclic character and depend on the systematically changing natural conditions (the tempo and scale of geological exploration efforts, the availability of mineral deposits and their quality, the deposit occurrence conditions and location, etc.). Most ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are characterized by a continuity of production processes and the availability of numerous installations with a high unit capacity closely interrelated in a single production process. Furthermore, individual subindustries and enterprises are linked to each other by constant cooperative shipments. The high capital-to-output ratio of mining and metallurgical production and a continuous increase (in recent years) in the fast metal production tempo without sufficient capital investments for replacing the fixed capital led to a sharp drop in operating ore extraction production capacities and wear and obsolescence of the capital stock. The production processes used in production systems operating in metallurgy can explain the rather complicated and tense environmental situation which developed in various vast Russian regions. Suffice it to say that atmospheric discharges of harmful substances by metallurgical complex enterprises reach 27% of all Russian enterprise discharges while contaminated water effluents exceed 15%. The need to address a broad range of global issues related to decreasing harmful substance discharges over large territories and air and water space and improving the working conditions and daily life of metallurgical enterprise workers led to considerable increases in the cost of production and a drop in the effectiveness and profitability of individual productions, enterprises, and subindustries since improvements in the air and water quality involve considerable expenditures. Thus, operating metallurgical complex enterprises are characterized by the high cost of fixed capital and its considerable wear and obsolescence (more than 50%), vast outlays for solving environmental and social problems, and the existence of marginally profitable or unprofitable infrastructure both at enterprises and individual subindustries. The economic reforms which have been carried out in recent years and involve changes in managing the enterprises and the industry as a whole, improving cost accounting, self-financing, raw material and metal price deregulation, profit taxation, and limitations in the wage fund did not sufficiently take into account (or to be more precise, did not take into account at all) these very important characteristics of mining, dressing, mining-metallurgical, and processing enterprises in Russia's basic industry of the national economy--metallurgy. As a result, instead of stabilization and an increase in the production effectiveness, we are witnessing its sharp decrease, while the mining extractive and metallurgical enterprises which produce metals and items crucial for other enterprises and industries have become marginally profitable or unprofitable. The situation in the metallurgical complex is continuing to deteriorate, pig iron and steel production and smelting are dropping, rolled stock and steel pipe production is declining, and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are in a critical state due to a deterioration of their supplies of raw material resources and intensive retirement of ore capacities from operation. An analysis of the status quo in metallurgy demonstrates that by late 1992, the drop in the production of individual types of metals will reach 50% compared to the preceding year which, in turn, will lead to an even greater reduction in the production volume in mechanical engineering and the output of industrial goods for consumer use. The principal reasons of the declining production in metallurgy are shortfalls in the shipments of coking coal, a considerable scarcity of scrap metal due to the absence of market mechanisms for its collection and an increasing volume of its imports, a sharp decrease in mining and metallurgical equipment shipments, a noticeable and ever-increasing gap between the economic and business links under intergovernmental, interbranch, and industry-wide cooperation, and the lack of economic and social incentives for stabilizing and increasing the production volume and stable financial conditions of the enterprises. The measures taken in 1992 to deepen the economic reforms which involve divestment and privatization of enterprises pursuant to the state privatization program and Russian Federation Presidential Decree No. 721 of 1 Jul 92 which cite as an example the critical situation which has developed in the metallurgical complex lead to a rather definite conclusion: the economic reforms already underway call for a radical correction in order to take into account the characteristic features of the basic branches of industry without which future realization of the measures to expand and deepen the privatization processes becomes questionable and reinforces the continuing slide and decrease in the production effectiveness. The state privatization program of state and municipal enterprises in 1992 is largely aimed at privatizing small- and medium-size enterprises in the retail trade, consumer services, and transportation spheres whose balance sheets show a relatively low cost of property and does not take into account the characteristic features of large enterprises which include most of metallurgical complex enterprises. Furthermore, the cost of property has risen substantially by the end of 1992 due to a multiple increase in the cost of working capital which, in a number of cases, exceeded the cost of fixed capital by tens and hundreds of times. This jump-like increase in the cost of enterprise property limited the ability of the employees to buy out this property and required a more detailed analysis and economic feasibility of the issues related to assessing the cost of property, classifying the enterprise infrastructure objects according to various forms of property, and taking into account the interests of kindred industries which are a part of a consolidated production process with the privatized enterprise in buying out a proportion of shares of the joint stock company formed on the basis of this enterprise. With respect to the foregoing, the deadlines set up by the presidential decree for transforming state enterprises into publicly traded joint stock companies (by 1 Nov 92) turned out to be unrealistic and led to hasty, economically unjustified, and at times inefficient decisions. Thus, out of the total number of metallurgical complex enterprises and organizations already transformed into joint stock companies in 1992, no more than 25% of such entities met the deadline (1 Oct 92) in holding employee meetings (conferences) and submitting the necessary privatization documents to the Russian Federation government, Russian Federation State Committee on Property, and committees for controlling the property of local administrations. Among the large metallurgical complex enterprises which successfully, and in a timely fashion, completed the preparation and submission of the necessary documents (privatization plans, property assessment documents, and joint stock company articles of incorporation) to appropriate state property control bodies for converting them into publicly traded joint stock companies, one should especially note the Uralruda Production Mining Association, the Mikaylovsk Mining Ore Dressing Complex, the Cherepovets Integrated Iron and Steel Works, the Berezniki Titanium-Magnesium Works, the Achinsk Alumina Combine, the Khrustalnyy Mining Ore Dressing Works, the Pervouralsk Tube Making, Chelyabinsk Tube Rolling, and Uralsk and Irkutsk Aluminum Plants, the Krasnyy Vyborzhets Leningrad Production Association for Nonferrous Metal Treatment, and others. A number of metallurgical enterprises has been privatized and registered in appropriate bodies and are carrying out productive and economic activity in the framework of a publicly traded joint stock company (the Tulachermet Scientific Production Association, the Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, the Kandalaksha Aluminum Smeltery, the Domodedovo Refractory Plant, and the Solnechnogorsk Metallurgical Screen Plant). We should note that the preliminary technical and economic analyses and subsequent feasibility studies and timely and proper preparation of founding documents for privatization at most of these enterprises were carried out with the help of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy, Central Scientific Research Institute of Nonferrous Metallurgy Economics and Information, Center for Scientific Organization of Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy, and other scientific research organizations. Yet for a number of reasons, particularly due to the absence of the necessary regulatory documents, e.g., statutes of enterprise employee stock funds (FARP), the procedure for transferring blocks of shares to trusts, the rate of land taxes, mineral use taxes, etc., privatization documents submitted on time for consideration and approval by the majority of enterprises are being considered past the deadlines established by the presidential decree. The unsolved problems in the banking and credit system and the delinquency in payments for supplier products have largely prevented timely preparation of documents for transforming enterprises into joint stock companies. The abnormal situation which has developed due to nonpayment at mining and metallurgical enterprises and the forthcoming surge in the injection of money due to the energy resource price liberalization will call for urgently addressing the issues of replenishing the working capital, indexing the cost of property, eliminating the cash deficit at the enterprises, expanding the checking and noncash transactions, accelerating the interbank clearing, and increasing the responsibility of the banks which, in contrast to enterprises, are successfully functioning and flourishing in their financial and economic activity. A classification of metallurgical complex enterprises according to the possibility of their privatization in 1992 pursuant to the state privatization program demonstrates that most of these enterprises (about 67%) must be privatized in coordination with local property management committees. The remaining enterprises (except for those which have already been transformed into joint stock companies) must be privatized in coordination with the Russian Federation State Committee on Property (20%) and Russian Federation government (12%). The experience of local property management bodies considering the privatization documents submitted by enterprises attests that the privatization committees set up within these bodies are physically incapable of properly and in a timely fashion considering and coordinating the large volume of articles of incorporation and take into account the industrial, production-technical, and socioeconomic characteristics of the enterprise activity. The fact that authoritative bodies represented by the Metallurgical Industry Department (today--Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy), namely such structures as concerns, companies, associations, joint stock companies, and scientific research institutes have been virtually prevented from developing the organizational-technical and economic measures to transform state enterprises into joint stock companies, is a serious drawback in managing the privatization efforts. As a result, the privatization plans being developed by the enterprises themselves do not include the most important measures aimed at increasing the operating efficiency of the enterprises and developing incentives for a production volume stabilization and increase and for a stable financial position, i.e., enterprise transformation into joint stock companies and privatization become an end in itself. An analysis of enterprise privatization efforts in the industry shows that the enterprises which possess sufficient resources to set up a privatization fund and which have formed this fund in a timely fashion and introduced personal privatization accounts for employees are the ones that prepared and submitted privatization documents on time and selected benefits version, II which is the most profitable and acceptable to the employees. From the total number of enterprises prepared for transformation into joint stock companies, almost three-quarters selected benefits version II which ensures redemption of 51% of the entire block of shares and makes it possible to guarantee the controlling block of shares for the enterprise. Highly profitable aluminum production enterprises, tube mills, and nonferrous metal processing plants are dominant in this group of enterprises. At privatized enterprises with marginal profitability and limited resources to set up sufficient privatization funds ensuring redemption of the controlling block of shares, 22% of employee groups selected version I benefits. This version was selected by employees of the Mikhaylovsk and Lovozerskiy Mining Ore Dressing Combines, the Northern Onega Mine, the Ufaleynikel Production Association, Berezniki Titanium-Magnesium Works, Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, and others. Only the employees at individual small enterprises (the Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant and the Krasnoyarsk Vtortsvetmet Secondary Nonferrous Metals State Enterprise) selected benefits version III which provides for giving a small group of enterprise employees (under certain contractual conditions) the right and possibilities to carry out the privatization plan. Several employee groups which leased the property of small state enterprises expressed the desire to convert to a limited liability partnership and buy it out. For most of the remaining metallurgical complex enterprises, the conditions of their transformation into joint stock companies provided by the state privatization program do not enable the employees to buy out a large proportion of state property shares since, on the one hand, the enterprises do not possess a sufficient privatization fund formed primarily due to a surplus of economic incentive funds and after-tax profits, while on the other--employees at the enterprises selecting benefits version I are limited to 20 minimum monthly wages in the case of a gratuitous transfer of a part of preferred shares and when selling regular shares at a discount--to 6 minimum monthly wages per employee. The option of purchasing 51% of shares is virtually unrealistic for large metallurgical enterprises with the high cost of capital stock since the selling price of such shares in accordance with the statutes of closed subscription of shares under state and municipal enterprise privatization approved by the Russian Federation State Committee on Property increases by a factor of 1.7. The fact that the privatization program does not call for the possibility of privatized enterprise share redemption at par value by juridical persons whose share of state property exceeds 25% decreases the activity and efficacy of the program and makes it impossible to involve the suppliers and consumers closely related by cooperative deliveries in redeeming the shares of the entities they are interested in. The experience of enterprise privatization plan development with respect to searching for the resources to redeem shares demonstrates that most enterprises have forwarded to the privatization fund resources from their profits at the expense of other important profit utilization applications. As a result, financing of social programs and investments for the development of production and new equipment has been sharply reduced or terminated at these enterprises altogether. We should note that to a certain extent, the Russian Federation Presidential Decree ``On Developing the System of Privatization Vouchers in the Russian Federation'' published in October 1992 solves this problem; it stipulates that in selling the privatized enterprise stock, the total number of shares to be sold for privatization vouchers to the joint stock companies developed in the course of privatization by converting state enterprises which are a property of the Russian Federation is equal to 80% and for enterprises which are a property of the constituent republics within the Russian Federation--35% of the total number of ordinary and type B preferred shares. Moreover, pursuant to the resolution of these republics' supreme councils, the total number of shares to be sold for privatization vouchers may be increased to 80%. This measures makes it possible considerably to expand the privatization scale if the enterprises do not have sufficient resources to set up privatization funds, reduce the use of profits for these purposes, and direct profits to social needs and production development. A number of unsolved problems which lower the employee incentive to accelerate privatization has been revealed in the course of assessing the capital stock cost at mining, ore dressing, and mining and metallurgical enterprises in order to determine their authorized capital. An important characteristic of property formation in this group of enterprises is the considerable proportion of the exploratory, capital, and preparatory operations in mining in the cost of capital stock. This is a peculiar type of property, and it does not appear possible either to sell it or use it for other purposes in the subsequent period since this property is subject to liquidation and write-off after a certain time (as the deposit is being depleted). Consequently, it appears necessary to subtract the cost of this peculiar property in determining the authorized capital in order to accelerate the development of joint stock companies on the basis of marginally profitable mining extracting enterprises and providing an even playing field for them among other enterprises. It is also necessary to subtract from the authorized capital the cost of environmental protection installations which is reflected in the cost of fixed capital since maintenance of these facilities involves considerable outlays yet does not guarantee profits while not only the enterprise employees, but also the entire population of the region derive benefit from their operation. The aforementioned facilities must be transferred to the balance sheet of joint stock companies without compensation under an appropriate agreement. The issues related to increasing the competitiveness of metal products in the external market, expanding the enterprises' export possibilities, developing production of scarce import substituting products, developing an ore and raw material base for stabilizing the enterprise operation, and creating new technologies and equipment which have been completely ignored in the enterprise privatization plans are especially acute at the privatized enterprises of the metallurgical complex. At the stage of enterprise conversion to joint stock companies, it is necessary to develop special programs (business plans) to implement these high-priority trends and set up the sources and volumes of their financing, including the method of setting up subsidiary joint stock companies. Holding companies as well as trust companies which possess blocks of stock (a share) which belong to the government and carry out these necessary investments in order to implement these programs due to the dividends derived from these shares could become the institutional management framework for the corresponding programs in various subindustries. Business plans must become part and parcel of enterprise privatization plans and should be considered and approved by the Russian Federation Government and State Committee on Property and by appropriate property management committees. Conversion of large metallurgical complex enterprises into joint stock companies requires time, serious preparation, and an accounting of the characteristic features of the industries, the character of operations, and the outlook for the technical and economic development of each enterprise.
