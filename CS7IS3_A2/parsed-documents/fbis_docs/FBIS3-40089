Its intent is that all sectors of society have an increased awareness of the social problems of our young people, and implement efficient social administration and deal with the problems at an early stage. As a general observation, the main trend of the Chinese youth campaign will show both healthy and stable development in 1994; the social problems connected with youth are not sufficient to cause the eruption of a societal crisis, but neither can they be regarded as unimportant. In 1994, the susceptible points of society's youth problems will be concentrated in the economic area. Due to the pressures of the decrease in the domestic economic growth rate during the year, youth benefits seeking space will tend to be relatively narrow within a certain period of time. Once the macroscopic activity of reforming the economic and political systems is begun, it becomes impossible to accomplish immediately the principle of fairness in social distribution. So when a part of youths' benefits are threatened, they will either get the idea of seeking society's protection, or else fall into an unbalanced psychological state that puts them in a contradictory mood. The possibility that economic problems will produce negative social events will increase. The Blue Collar Tide Will Cause a Million Young Peasants To Leave Their Villages and Fields Experts forecast that in 1994, the tide of blue collar workers in which young peasants are the dominant factor will increase by more than 20 percent over the previous year, which would be about 8 million people. Due to the widening gap between industry and agriculture, with less profit in farming, the peasants' enthusiasm has been damaged, and finding outside employment has become the major way of earning a living for rural youth. In Lin County, Henan, which has the greatest number of peasants seeking work elsewhere, "a construction army of one million has gone out from Taihang Mountain," which can bring several hundred million yuan into the county every year. Meanwhile, young peasants leaving their villages and fields on a large scale could be fatal to an agricultural labor resource which were not of a high quality before. Analysis shows that in 1994, the region which will be under attack by the tide of peasant laborers will still be Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the coastal open cities, these crowded cities cannot bear such a heavy burden any longer. Shortages of funds have caused sharp cutbacks in construction projects, leaving a large group of peasants with no work to do, so they will become a blind flow of people. These circulating peasant laborers are carried by rail. If in 1994 rail travel continues to be as rough as it has been, it is possible that extremist activities directed at railroad departments may occur in individual areas where there are tie-ups. Protection of the rights and interests of young peasant laborers is steadily becoming a greater problem, as nearly every day brings new instances of illegal employment of workers and threats to the rights and interests of young peasant workers. In Beijing's Chongwenmen illegal labor market, traders in human beings abducted and sold to Qingzhou, Shanxi, more than 1,800 young female peasants who had gone to Beijing to find jobs. It can be said that this large-scale transfer of the surplus rural labor force will be a troublesome problem in urban and rural construction and administration in 1994. Whether we let it go or block it, whether we transfer it to other places or try to accept it locally, there should be a scientific and practical plan for resolution. Protection of Young Workers' Rights and Interests Is Leading To Disputes Between Labor and Capital As enterprises increase their reform, smashing the old system, implementing various contract systems, joint-stock systems, and perfected reorganization, it is urgent that the rights and interests of both employers and employees undergo major adjustment. Because enterprise reform is at present still incomplete, the rights and interests of enterprises and young workers are still not in conformity, leading to frequent conflicts. In state-owned enterprises, disagreements between young workers and enterprises are concentrated chiefly in the system for using labor; in foreign capital enterprises, the disputes lie for the most part in the area of interpreting and implementing contracts; in privately owned enterprises, disputes mostly center around threats to rights and interests. During the first half of the year, the Shanghai Labor Arbitration Department handled a total of 319 cases, an increase of 43.7 percent over the same period last year. In foreign capital enterprises throughout the country, there were 2,000 worker strikes during the first quarter of 1993 alone. Many young employees of privately run enterprises went to court seeking legal protection for their rights. Of these, the abuse suffered by the Chinese crew of the foreign ship "Acadia" was a shock to society. It is forecast that in 1994 cases to labor arbitration departments seeking legal resolution will tend to increase. It is a matter of urgency to accelerate the formulation of labor laws and regulations, providing a legal foundation to protect the rights and interests of both enterprises and young people from encroachment and threat. This will avoid and reduce this destabilizing factor in society. Guard Against Secular, Aristocratic, and Mercenary Tendencies on Campus According to a survey, more than 60 percent of college students and young teachers lack confidence about going into society, establishing themselves and building the country through what they have learned. Two-thirds of those surveyed considered teaching, scientific research, and public affairs as dangerous roads to take. This kind of phenomenon may include the dissatisfied mood of intelligent young people who have lost a balanced state of mind. What deserves more vigilance is the depreciation of knowledge that has led to secular, aristocratic, and mercenary tendencies on campus. Secularization is expressed in a lack of concern for politics, pandering to popular culture, and viewing popular taste as fashion. Aristocratic tendencies are expressed as a lack of concern for the masses, and regarding the main stream of Chinese culture of China with contempt. Mercenary tendencies appear when the value judgements of intelligent people tend toward material desires and money in a great degree, their awareness of civilization's development shaken. The campus definitely provides an excellent base for supplying the talent China needs to succeed in its strategy of catching up with world trends by the end of this century. However, the current situation is that people engaged in business, teaching, and studying lack vigor, with future problems difficult to foresee. Reliance on morality alone to solve this problem is far from sufficient; it is urgent that the State invest more in education and provide favorable policies for education. Rising Prices Affect Young People's Financial Benefits Economists forecast that the inflation rate for the cost of living in 1994 will still be around 10 percent, and the government will put its limited financial resources into projects which are related to the nation's strength, such as in agriculture, transport, and energy. At the consumer level, it is the young people who will feel the greatest effects from rising prices. Statistical documents show that among young people, it is farming peasants and the working class who will feel a money pinch most acutely; government workers and young intellectuals will see a continual increase in the gap between their income and the average income in society, directly affecting their standard of living and their recognition of reform. An investigation by the Beijing Zero Point Survey Company showed that worries about rising prices was undermining the morale of residents of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Although experts do not foresee the reappearance of panic buying, as in 1988, there could be an abnormal reaction from young people, the group which will suffer the greater loss in benefits. In addition, the occurrence of negative events in some inland areas is not beyond the realm of possibility. As we are consciously breathing life into the education of our youth and into reform, we should also set our hand to social security work on young people's special benefits. This will help young people who are having problems in their lives get past the difficult stage, as well as assisting the government in formulating relevant youth social security laws and regulations, setting a minimum wage, a minimum cost of living, subsidies for financial emergencies, and related welfare. Big Income Gap Leads Youth to an Unbalanced State of Mind Regarding Society's Fairness In recent years, the gap between people's incomes in China has been growing steadily, taking shape on three obvious levels: individual and private operators of businesses, company managers and foreign trade agents, entertainment and sports stars have become the wealthy class; salaried workers who are satisfied with their lives; peasants, unemployed people, and retirees have become the poor class. The average between the lowest and highest incomes in the three classes is 1:15 to 1:20. At present, in the world's developed nations, the income gap usually stays at the rate of 1:10. The statistics show that less than one-third of those at society's highest income level are young people, but in their activities, especially their consumption activities, these act as a strong role model for others of their generation. A significant number of low income youth sometimes have inner doubts about "whether social distribution is fair." They cannot concentrate on their studies or work, and some even take the "shortcut" of breaking the law. Although the problem of large gaps in personal income will be adjusted by personal income taxes in 1994, it takes time to establish a distribution system which is acceptable to the public. Unfair distribution is still a factor which could potentially affect young workers' enthusiasm for work. It Is Urgent We Strengthen Youth's Overall National Knowledge and Unified Ethnic Knowledge Political education in recent years has largely ignored overall knowledge of the nation and unified ethnic knowledge; rather, the reality has been that a tendency to local protectionism has certainly developed. In 1994, opposing foreign forces on our borders will continue to make trouble in Tibet and Turkestan. Our northwest will still be a sensitive area of ethnic conflicts and religious disputes. There will continue to be antagonisms concerning rights in the South China Sea, Taiwan Independence, and the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong. We should strengthen the overall national knowledge of youth, telling them repeatedly that China is the family of every Chinese, the joy of the Chinese nation, and it is not correct to go the way of developing only a certain area or a certain nationality in isolation. The present generation of youth should keep a clear mind, definitely preserving the unity of state and nation, and struggling against all types of divisional actions by opposing forces both within and outside of China. Criminal Actions of Youth Are Obviously Directed at the Economic Area This year and next, criminal actions of youth have obviously been directed at economic activities. Among these, economic disputes which lead to hooligans fighting with weapons, and cases of retaliation for injury have shown a sharply increasing trend. All crimes, such as robberies on the road or on buses, the abduction and sale of human beings in inland areas, prostitution, drug dealing, and smuggling along the coast, have the obvious intent of obtaining money. We can predict that there will be new youth crime problems in 1994. The youth black society group will spread to the economic area; crimes of theft will rise among high school students; there will be an increase in the flow of people blindly fleeing crime; and fraud cases in economic activities will tend to be serious. We should pay special attention to the problem of crime among youth who are "the group outside the system," and the trend of youth and teenage crimes to occur at a lower age. Every segment of society should jointly look for scientific countermeasures for dealing with this, to create an excellent social environment for further reform and opening up.
