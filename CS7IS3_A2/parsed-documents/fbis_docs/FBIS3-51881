Panama now must face the fact that the treaties will expire on the year 2000. No one has had the courage to speak up as Professor Carles has with regard to the bases, which are assets. We would like Prof. Carles to tell us what he will do with regard to the bases, what will be his government's initiative should he become president. [Carles] Definitely, I believe the next government will face a very important period, perhaps the most important in the country's history. One of its main issues will be the operation and functioning of the Canal, the appropriate use of the reverted areas, and the decision on possible negotiations with the United States for leasing some of the sites the U.S. Army has occupied until now, and which must be vacated, according to the treaties. I think we must stop talking nonsense. The United States has rights according to the neutrality treaty signed by Omar Torrijos -- and the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD -- with the Carter administration. The U.S. Government has the following privileges according to the Nunn and DeConcini amendments: expeditious transit, which according to them means to be at the head of the line, and second, it has a right to intervene and return to Panama whenever it feels there is a justified reason, which it can easily interpret its own way. I believe if someone occupying the basement or the attic my house must leave because his contract expires, but at the same time he can enter my house any time he wants because I authorized it, then it would be better for me to offer him a corner of my patio, but demanding certain concessions. You see, the Americans.... [pauses] please, gentlemen, let's face it: Omar Torrijos himself said so, he placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella. Why? Because he did not dare speak the truth. He gave the Americans the privilege of entering Panama whenever they fell like -- because they are the ones who will determine the circumstances -- in perpetuity, from here to eternity. So, what's the problem? What we could do is tell them: We will lease you a piece of land at Howard airfield, or part of Kobbe. In exchange for that, you will authorize the entrance of Panamanian products, of thousands of tons of sugar, which will create jobs for so many people in the central provinces; thousands of tons of beef, which will benefit so many cattlemen in the interior of the country; more coffee, fruits, tobacco; guarantee the placement of banana shipments. We could also open markets for the Panamanian textile industry, which would help thousands of female operators who can sew top quality garments. We could sell guayaberas, shirts, underwear, pajamas in the United States if we have the quotas. What we could do is exchange a lease contract to operate Howard, for example, for a concession that would permit the hiring of 25,000 to 30,000 Panamanians in textile factories currently not being used at full-capacity. That is what we must look for, gentlemen. Employment for our youths and opportunities for investment and production. We must say this frankly. We want to negotiate with the Americans. Why talk about nationalism and sovereignty? Torrijos, the Panamanian officers and the PRD were always talking about nationalism and sovereignty, when in fact one of them was a CIA employee, and the other one negotiated a treaty that placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella. [Pinzon] Would you immediately appoint a commission to take the initiative, to seek a formula, instead of waiting for them to act? [Carles] Definitely. I already have chosen the three persons who would go to the United States to make contact with U.S. authorities. Don't listen to those who are saying that the gringos are not interested. They say.... [pauses] it is true that some diplomatic officials have said they are not interested, but what do the military forces have to say after all? Who decides? Torrijos already placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella. That treaty was signed by Carter and Torrijos. [Pinzon] I believe that treaty also allowed them to intervene in 1989, in addition to the blunder committed by the drug trafficker. [Carles] Of course. [Julio] There is another interesting topic after the U.S. bases, which the thesis presented by Prof. Carles undoubtedly creates and fosters new hopes in the people that there will be new job opportunities. Prof. Carles, I have witnessed several meetings you have held with Indian leaders. The current problems faced by the Indian communities have turned chaotic, critical, disastrous. The Panamanian Indians claim they have been neglected. You have met with the main leaders of the various Indian communities. What can you tell us about those meetings? [Carles] Indians are as Panamanian as we are. They have acquired representativeness, and they are very proud of their customs, traditions, and language, which we must respect and promote. They must feel that they are Panamanians, with their own characteristics. That occurs everywhere in the world. Families, even among us, maintain certain traditions, customs, and speak their native language. Once they join the country, respect the laws, and feel that they are Panamanian citizens, we must help them, especially with public services. The government must take care of their needs in education, health, housing, transportation, security, and protect them from vices, drugs, abuses, and criminals. That occurs in Indian communities in San Blas, Darien, Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, and parts of Veraguas. We must respect them, support them, and help them join society. The Panamanian Government -- not now, but during the past few years -- has sketched programs with other countries and international indigenous organizations. The funds, however, are not properly used. Those groups of Panamanians are deceived, as their needs for public services are not met. Millions of dollars were squandered under the military governments to make Indian communities believe they were receiving help. This happened in Veraguas, Chiriqui, and San Blas. We must tell those Panamanians: We have a plan for you, in which you can participate, and we will do it the right way. Forget it, politics is not eternal. Political campaigns are one thing, and another is working to find permanent solutions to the problems. I have told those Panamanians in the indigenous groups that I will struggle on their side, respecting their Indian identity. I will help them, not doing what they themselves must do, but support them. It is better not to adopt paternalism, which creates dependency and in the long run does more harm than good, because it corrupts. The Indians and the state.... [pauses] in this case I could get funds from many international organizations, but they must start preparing to work in reforestation activities, environmental protection, ecology. They are a valuable resource, their living conditions are important from the standpoint of ecotourism and tourist attraction. They must participate, and not think that others will do the work for them. There is a very interesting and important group residing here, which includes doctors, lawyers, sociologists, economists -- people who know. But they must start thinking in terms of Panamanians who are going to help their ethnic fellow men. The state must work together with the most capable and well-trained Indians; with those that deserve official support. [passage omitted]
