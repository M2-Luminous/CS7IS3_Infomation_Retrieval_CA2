[passage omitted] Intensive and close contacts are apparently being used between Bonn and Tehran to stop the death sentence from being carried out. This does not appear impossible, according to informed sources. The German Foreign Ministry merely confirmed that the formal petition for pardon had only been possible once the long legal procedure ended with the Supreme Court rejecting the appeal.
