FBIS4-54174 "dreas102_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 North Korea Japan Urged To Reveal Quantity of `Hidden' Plutonium Japan Urged To Reveal Quantity of `Hidden' Plutonium SK2605101894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1008 GMT 26 May 94 SK2605101894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Trick of Nuclear Criminal"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries recently staged the drama of "opening" to Western reporters the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant where 70 kg of plutonium had been discovered some time ago, a report from Tokyo says. This is a trick to fool the unbiased opinion guarding against Japan which is accelerating its conversion into a nuclear power in full scale. When foreign reporters asked why the secret of the accumulation of a large amount of plutonium was not disclosed for six years," the authorities "did not utter a word in answer". The nuclear criminal who was caught red-handed in wantonly violating the universally accepted international law cannot be absolved from its crime, even if he "opened" the nuclear fuel-making plant to the public. Still more ridiculous is that this nuclear criminal, shamelessly enough, has become noisier in crying over the fictitious "nuclear weapons development" by the DPRK. This is a crafty ruse to justify Japan's moves to become a nuclear power, which has become a target of the accusing finger of the international community and divert elsewhere the world's attention from it. Judging from the fact that many nuclear reactors of Japan have been operating for scores of years, it is as clear as noonday that the exposed amount of plutonium is only a tiny part of the total amount of concealed plutonium. The Japanese authorities must not resort to a trick to mislead public opinion but clearly open to the international community the total amount of plutonium hidden nationwide, and promptly stop nuclear armament.
