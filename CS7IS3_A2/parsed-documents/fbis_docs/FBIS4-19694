Syrian Internal Affairs Minister Muhammad Harbah has said: "We shall not allow the PKK to exist in our country. We shall uproot that organization together. Harbah also said that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in Syria and that they have been informed that he is in Greece. According to the record on the talks Mentese and Harbah held, the two officials exchanged the following views: Mentese: Turkey and Syria have favorable relations. Turkey wishes to maintain them. Harbah: We wish to have our relations improved. Furthermore, we wish to bring to light all matters that have been in the dark until now. We must trust each other more. Mentese: The Turkish officials are aware that the PKK's terrorist activities in Turkey are organized in Syria. We have reliable intelligence reports that confirm that state of affairs. We ask you not to allow the PKK to shelter in your country. Harbah: We agree that the PKK was involved in various activities in Syria until 1992. However, our relations entered a new phase after then Internal Affairs Minister Ismet Sezgin visited Damascus on 17 April 1992. We favor friendship and fraternal relations between our two countries. Mentese: That is exactly what Turkey wants. However, you must prove your friendship and fraternal relations. Here is a clipping from a newspaper. It says that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan met with three Turkish journalists in Barr Ilyas, which is under Syria's control. That means that the PKK leader is in this region. Harbah: The reports that PKK leaders are in our region are wrong. An effort is being made to create the impression that the leading PKK cadres are either in Syria or in the region we control in Lebanon in order to disrupt the relations between Syria and Turkey. Mentese: We will give you other documents that confirm that Abdullah Ocalan is in this region. We will give you the addresses of several places and telephone numbers. We know that the leader of a terrorist organization cannot remain in the region without your being informed of his presence. That Ocalan is in the region is a strong possibility. Harbah: We have received information that Ocalan is in Greece. We will definitely not allow the PKK to organize conferences or meet with journalists in Syria. We can guarantee that. Mentese: The PKK is a threat to Turkey and the region. A part of Syria is included in the territory of the state the Kurdish organizations wish to establish. You will suffer as much as Turkey does. Harbah: We are also worried about that. The establishment of a Kurdish state in the region would be as harmful for you as it would be for us. Syria's most fertile lands are included in the territory of the state they wish to establish. We support Turkey's territorial integrity. The political will in Syria supports Turkey's territorial integrity. Ethnic communities are a threat to Syria as much as they are to our neighbors. We will remove the PKK's roots together. Mentese: The Turkish public and the media are very sensitive about the PKK problem. We have the right to expect our neighbors to maintain a similar approach. Harbah: We are not satisfied with the Turkish newspapers. They publish reports against Syria. Do we not do anything positive? Mentese: Freedom of the press exists in Turkey. We cannot interfere in their reports. That is out of the question. The documents discovered in the possession of several terrorists arrested in Silopi some time ago reveal that the PKK sent arms and rocket launchers to Turkey through Syria. We will give those documents to you. Harbah: Not a single firearm can be transferred from one place to another in Syria without the government being informed. Nevertheless, what you have said will be investigated. Nahit Mentese held talks with President al-Asad for three hours on the last day of his visit. Mentese explained the support the PKK and its leading members receive in Syria and stressed that the effort to improve the cooperation between Ankara and Damascus will be very useful for the two countries.
