The highest numbers were employed in the health protection and education systems, where, according to official statistics, the role of the private sector continues to be minimal. The prevalence of the public sector over the private one also continues to exist in transportation and industries, even though, when it comes to the latter, the public sector's role continues to decrease. The trade and construction industries have clearly been mostly privatized. Within the so-called material production area, (without taking ownership distinctions into account), 5.9 million people worked in the last quarter of 1993, with the highest number (3.2 million people) in industries. Out of the 2.8 million people outside of the material-production sector, 1.1 million were employed in the education system, 815,000 in health service, 323,000 in state administration and the justice system, and 241,000 in finance and insurance. Salaries in the nonmaterial sector were lower by as much as 11.1 percent than salaries in the material sector--that was the biggest difference in three years. The biggest differences were reported with regard to salaries in health protection and in education: They were lower by 15.5 percent than salaries of those employed in enterprises. On the other hand, average salaries in the state administration exceeded those in enterprises by 33 percent, but that means a relative deterioration of the ratios: In 1992, salaries of clerks were higher by almost 40 percent than the average salary paid out in enterprises. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the average salary in the material sector amounted to 4.7 million zlotys [Z], while the average salary outside of the sector was Z4.1 million, including Z3.6 million in education and health services, and Z5.4 million per month in science. In industries, where the average salary was almost Z5 million per month, very big differences were reported between individual branches: Z9 million (without annual awards) in the excavation industry, but only Z4.3 million per month, on average, in the processing industry. Out of the material sector, the lowest salaries were reported in agriculture--Z3.5 million--while those in forestry were not much higher--Z3.7 million per month. The average employee retirement pension was Z2.8 million before taxes and 2.3 million per month after taxes. Regarding agricultural retirement pensions, the numbers were Z1.5 million and Z1.3 million per month, respectively. Employee pensions [renta pracownicza] were Z1.7 million and 1.3 million per month, respectively. Last year, we had as many as 8.730 million senior citizens [emeryci] and pensioners [rencisci].
