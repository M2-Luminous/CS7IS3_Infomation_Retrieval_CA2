The president's cavalcade was led by 20 military motorcyclists as it cruised past a guard of honour comprising all three combative arms of the National Defence Force. Over 100 neatly-ranked infantrymen presented arms to order as Mr Mandela and his daughter Princess Zenani Dlamini took the national salute from the red-carpeted steps of the great hall of Parliament. The crash of their boots had scarcely died away when a navy band broke into the strains of "Die Stem", followed by "Nkosi Sikele Iafrika" [God Bless Africa]. A ramrod stiff, stern-faced Mr Mandela -- the former commander of the military wing of the once-outlawed African National Congress -- crooked his right arm across his chest as he took the national salute. The troops stood unflinchingly, their white ceremonial gloves, gaiters, red cravats and epaulettes adding colour to camouflage fatigues and the grey cobbles of Stalplein. Six Impala trainers then roared in low from the north, trailing plumes of red, white, green, yellow and grey smoke, wheeling away towards Kloof Nek. The national anthems over, Mr Mandela and Princess Zenani were accompanied into the building past an air force guard of honour by army Colonel Tom Marx and navy Captain Steve Stead, both officers in ceremonial regalia. First to arrive at Parliament were Second Deputy President Mr F W de Klerk, followed by First Deputy President Mr Thabo Mbeki. Meanwhile, as security men kept watch from nearby rooftops with binoculars and mingled with onlookers, a crowd had gathered at the Parliament street gate, singing freedom songs and blocking the road. An army captain at the scene appeared unruffled by the unexpected obstacle across his troops' line of advance, instead ordering them to retreat towards Stalplein whence they had come. And as Mr Mandela stood up inside to make history, a sergeant-major abruptly started mustering his troops who marched off the scene to time marked by bellows that echoed off the offices of power.
