The behavior of the country's trade balance will depend on whether or not Mexico's businessmen are capable of taking advantage of free trade with the United States and Canada. Serra Puche noted the U.S. economy is on a firm path to recovery and U.S. consumers will demand Mexican products more and more. The secretary explained NAFTA's first month in operation. [Begin Serra Puche recording] There are no definite trade figures for this first month of January because it takes more than one month to prepare reports, but I do have day-by-day reports indicating operations are under control and the problems that arose at the start were of a customs nature, and they are being resolved. [end recording] Serra Puche was interviewed following his private meeting with Mexican Telephones System [Telmex] officials and U.S., Canadian, and European investors. During the meeting, it became evident that in the past few years, Telmex invested 20 billion new pesos and this allowed telephone services to be installed in 8,000 rural towns. [Begin recording of Telmex Director Juan Antonio Perez] This coming year we will maintain the investment rhythm of the past few years: approximately $2.2 billion. [end recording]
