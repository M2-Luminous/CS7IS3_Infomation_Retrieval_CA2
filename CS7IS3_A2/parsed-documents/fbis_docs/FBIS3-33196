The release of Indians who are "imprisoned without justification" is one of the main demands of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), which has been in a state of revolt since 1 January. The released Indians have not been charged with belonging to the EZLN, although the press thinks their release seeks to diminish the conflict of interests between the rebel group and the government prior to the peace dialogue. Arturo Nazar, president of the Chiapas Supreme Tribunal of Justice, said the decision to release the prisoners -- all of whom were charged with common crimes -- was made after a thorough analysis of the cases. Human rights groups said the Indians were charged months ago with robbery, theft of public funds, attacking other people, damaging property, raiding homes, and extortion, even though in some cases they were not even tried. "The peasants and Indians were released according to the Law of Suspended Sentence and for having served part of their sentences, and not because of the peace dialogue," Nazar pointed out. When the conflict first began, the Mexican Armed Forces arrested 70 alleged Zapatists and accused them of bearing firearms which are for the exclusive use of the Army, homicide, and association with criminal intent. On 28 January, the Tribunal of Justice released 38 Zapatists following demands by the Zapatists and only one week later Congress approved an Amnesty Law for the armed groups. At that time, each one of the accused paid $330 for his release. The money came from the Auxiliary Fund for the Administration of State Justice. There are still 32 Zapatists imprisoned at the Cerro Hueco Prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas State, some 700 km southeast of Mexico City. They should have been released after the rebels freed former Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. The release of those 32 prisoners was requested by the rebels when they liberated Castellanos last Wednesday, but this request has not been met. Castallanos was taken hostage by the Zapatists on 2 January. He was accused of starting a repression campaign against the Indians and of promoting and supporting the "ladinos" (whites) in committing injustices against the Indians. Around mid-January, the Mexican Congress approved an Amnesty Law for the Chiapas rebels and other groups who might rise up in arms on the condition they turn in their weapons. According to Juan Manuel Ulloa, delegate in Chiapas of the Office of the Attorney General of the republic, the 32 imprisoned Zapatists cannot receive the amnesty benefits because the EZLN General Command has not yet turned in its weapons, even though Castellanos has been released. It is expected the Zapatists will remind Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, in the dialogue which begins today, of the promise to release the imprisoned rebels, and that they will demand compliance, in one way or another, with the commitments agreed to before the negotiations begin. The EZLN rose up in arms against the hunger and poverty to which 1 million Indians of the state have been subjected for years, and against the agrarian policy and repression in Chipas. During the first 12 days of the armed conflict, the EZLN waged combats with the Armed Forces that left at least 108 killed, 500 wounded, and 20,000 evicted from their communities.
