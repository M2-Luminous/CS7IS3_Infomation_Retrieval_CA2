He claimed that this was proven by the arrest, early this morning, of Manuel Zamudio Gonzalez, a member of the force, in the settlement of Tizayuca. He was carrying 700 kg of marijuana on a pickup truck, intending to sell it in the northern part of the country. The attorney general noted: "We shall be very watchful to ensure that the maximum penalty is imposed on him." He made the preceding statement at a press conference, after a work meeting with Governor Jesus Murillo Karam, at the Government Palace. There they agreed to undertake joint security action in the state, doing whatever is necessary to combat crime permanently. In this regard, the attorney general announced that a group of workers from the department headed by him would publish, within a week, the plan to be implemented in order to achieve results and provide greater tranquillity to Hidalgo residents. However, he emphasized that Hidalgo is among the states with the lowest crime rates in the entire country; adding that, even in the case of drug smuggling, it has one of the lowest incidences.
