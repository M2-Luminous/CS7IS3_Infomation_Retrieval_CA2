It has been welcomed, in a word. As soon as negotiations began on a possible agreement, however, it emerged that representatives of various political forces will find it rather difficult to come to terms on this score. To be sure, immediately voices began to be heard: "What is the point of launching this burdensome undertaking in the first place?" Indeed, is it impossible to pursue reform without a civic accord agreement? Of course, it is not. Yet is it necessary to prove how much more difficult this will be in the conditions of confrontation and political hysteria and without a mechanism for coordinating social interests? In my opinion, we have had our share of such difficulties and can now sum up the results. The reforms have been moving not dynamically and consistently enough primarily owing to political instability. Hence the forced deviations from reform in the sphere of economics, the wary attitude by Western investors, the inefficiency of some power institutions, and many other things. It is specially dangerous that not only politicians have found themselves on different sides of the barricades, but that society itself has begun to divide into conflicting camps. Do we have the right to pass up the opportunity to pacify society and provide it peaceful living conditions? This chance, I am sure, exists today. Parliamentary elections have been held; there are two years to go before presidential elections; a new constitution has been adopted and put into effect; the Federal Assembly is beginning to function in a steady rhythm.... Yet all of this, alas, against the backdrop of an economic and social crisis. But if we unleash a war of public rallies and provoke a wave of strikes, will bread become cheaper or will pensioners enjoy better living standards? Yes, the process of preparing and signing the accord -- and this is precisely a process -- will not be easy. Its implementation will be still more difficult. Yet the way work on the document has been proceeding in the past few days shows that the efforts by all the sides concerned are not in vain. It will be recalled that the first version of the accord, prepared by a working group, aroused serious objections in the course of discussion in the Public Chamber. Some thought that the document should describe in detail which principles should underlie economic policy and specifically how reform will develop. No question: It would be good to agree on this.... Yet, after all, our task is to ensure the broadest possible circle of parties to the agreement, attracting sensible political figures of all orientations. This is why the conciliation pact is of a fairly general character. Yet even the most general formulas did not come about easily. Some thought the accord was too rigid; others, on the contrary, considered it too vague.... Yes, this has been a process of mutual concessions and search for conciliatory formulas and compromise; and how can it possibly be otherwise? Here is just one example. The original version envisioned sanctions in the event of a violation of the accord's provisions by one of the sides. In particular, the Conciliation Commission was to be granted the right to initiate the question of excluding the corresponding participant from among the signatories or to move proposals on measures of political responsibility, including the dismissal of "transgressors" from leading positions and stripping them of deputy status. Later on we abandoned such a rigid approach, and this immediately allowed the range of the agreement's supporters to be broadened. Nonetheless, even today the document contains several provisions which are evoking sharp disagreement by a number of opposition movements. This is primarily the point obligating all sides to refrain from demands to introduce such amendments into the Constitution which could destabilize the situation in society. Or the obligation not to initiate political campaigns with the aim of holding early elections to federal power bodies. But here, in my opinion, lies the line which cannot be passed in the search for compromise. If we renounce these provisions, the document -- even if signed by all the participants in the political process without exception -- will be nothing more than a mere declaration. Is there a danger that not all opposition parties will sign the agreement of public accord? To be sure, there is. But I would not regard this prospect as tragic. There is one circumstance which, in my view, should compel all sensible politicians sooner or later to put their signatures under this document. Possibly, with their remarks and qualifications (it will be recalled that the agreement is open to accession at any time). It is hardly likely that the president's most principled opponents will want to stay aside from the process of reconciling social interests and elaborating a coordinated policy. And in this sense the agreement will be just a starting point. It will set in motion a mechanism that will be in operation for the next two years: conferences, "roundtables," and temporary working groups with representatives of parties to the agreement. As for those who will not want to conduct a peaceful dialogue.... Well, society must know the names of these leaders and the parties they represent. I think that this will also be useful: It should not be forgotten that not so much time is left before the next presidential elections.
