FBIS4-52899 "dreas094_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 South Korea Official Predicts Chances of U.S.-DPRK Talks `High' Official Predicts Chances of U.S.-DPRK Talks `High' SK1405075494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0747 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405075494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Chances are high that the United States and North Korea will meet in a third round of high-level talks, though North Korea has started refueling at a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, a ranking government official said this weekend. The official, noting the new U.S.-North Korea meeting is related to the regular and additional inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as requested in the U.N. Security Council president's recent statement on North Korea, said if the IAEA inspectors arriving in North Korea Tuesday [17 May] conduct inspections as scheduled, a third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks are highly likely to be held. Seoul and Washington reportedly interpret Pyongyang's start of refueling at the 5-mw reactor not as the start of fuel rod replacement but as the start of preparations for fuel rod replacement. Fuel rod replacement requires at least 15 days of reactor cooling. If North Korea is found to have started replacing fuel rods during the coming IAEA inspection, the United States would not hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea, the official said. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert Gallucci had told Chairman Kim Tae-chung that the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would be held in weeks during their meeting in Washington on Wednesday. When Kim stressed the need for a package-deal approach to the North Korean nuclear issue, Gallucci expressed his approval, the foundation added.
