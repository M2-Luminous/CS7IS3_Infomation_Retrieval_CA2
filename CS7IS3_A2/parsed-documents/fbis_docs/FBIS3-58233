UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was the guest of the Assembly's Foreign Affairs Commission and of the Commission chairman, Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Luc Lemonnier asked the UN secretary general who would give the go-ahead should NATO army officials ask for permission to use artillery or air strikes against Serbian guns in Bosnia. Butrus Butrus-Ghali's answer was as follows: [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording] It is not for the generals to ask me for permission, it is for the secretary general's special representative, who is responsible for three distinct operations. The first is the military operation, the second is the humanitarian operation -- we look after 2 million refugees -- and the third corresponds to the negotiations which are currently under way in Geneva, or which may take place in Bonn over the next few days. Everything is contingent upon these three elements. If the secretary general's special representative asks, I will be only too pleased to accept this request. The political power belongs to the Security Council, which gives a mandate. The Security Council may give a mandate to NATO, just as it may not give any mandate. The decision lies with the Security Council, i,e., the 15 members of the Security Council; i.e., the five permanent members who have a right of veto. They are the ones who will decide.
