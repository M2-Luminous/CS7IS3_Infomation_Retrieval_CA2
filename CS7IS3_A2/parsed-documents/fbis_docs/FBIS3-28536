[passage omitted] Malaysia yesterday agreed ta have the Thai-Malaysia Border Socio Economic Development Committee conduct the study. Malaysian Defence Minister Dato Seri Mohammad Najib bin Tun Hayi Abdul Razak said after yesterday's committee meeting in Bangkok that the committee would be responsible for the study. [passage omitted] A senior Thai military officer said: "Malaysia has not accepted our proposal, but it has positively responded to it. It might be a time before a conclusion can be reached on the topic." The Thais led by Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak also urged Malaysia to add more ferries to the existing ferry service at Takbai-Pengkalan Kubor. Both Dato Deri Mohammad Abdul Razak and Gen Wichit hailed the success of the meeting at which both sides reviewed the committee's performance and assigned new tasks. Gen Wichit said both countries agreed to set a time frame, likely to be mid-1994, to review some topics which should be amended to cope with the changing situation because a threat from the communists (Communist Party of Malaya) had been eliminated. Fourth Army Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, who also chairs the Thai-Malaysia Regional Border Committee, said Malaysia had stressed several times that it would not allow terrorists to use its territory as a base to cause trouble. During a meeting chaired by supreme commanders from both sides last October, Malaysia turned down a Thai proposal to class "separatist movements" as both countries' common enemy, under a border treaty. However, during that meeting, Malaysia said it would provide full cooperation with Thailand to resolve the problem and it would not allow separatists to take refuge in Malaysia. "By the middle of this year a second high-level meeting will be held in Malaysia and then we will know the scope of the treaty amendment. "Any amendment will benefit the two countries," said Maj-Gen Pricha Rungsawan, commander of the General Border Committee's Office.
