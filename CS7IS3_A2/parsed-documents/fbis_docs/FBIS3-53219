Parallel to this decision, the Zionist regime has taken the unexpected step of calling on European countries to help 'Arafat's faction and the compromising PLO faction in crushing the intifadah. Irrespective of all the objectives that Israel expects this new plan to achieve, all facts show that the situation in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza and Jericho, are detrimental to both 'Arafat and Israel. Under such conditions, arming 'Arafat's mercenaries to crush the intifadah and Hamas is the biggest mistake that the enemy has made. The Islamic forces will have more golden opportunities to more easily acquire the arms that they need for their anti-occupational operations. The truth is that the Zionists have lost control of the situation in occupied Palestine, and with their current action they show how disappointed they are with their past efforts and are even prepared to arm people who can easily change stances and act against the Zionists. Even though having arms in the occupied territories under the current conditions can solve many of the Palestinians' complicated problems in their confrontation with the occupying enemy, nevertheless the more major issue that reveals the vulnerability of Israel and 'Arafat's compromising faction is that even among his ranks there are many who are dissatisfied with the situation and do not endorse the continuous treacheries of 'Arafat and the other compromising leaders of the PLO. Naturally, these people are waiting for suitable opportunities to be able to avenge themselves and the Palestinian people on occupying Israel. It is precisely because of this that, despite 'Arafat's treason and the concordance between some of the compromising heads of the PLO and the Zionists, not a great deal has changed in Israel's favor and developments in the occupied territories leave much to be desired for the occupiers. The Zionists are digging their own graves today and this golden opportunity for the Palestinians to acquire arms can herald a more bitter tomorrow for the occupiers. This disgraceful game between Israel and 'Arafat is so idiotic that it has been defeated and has disgraced the enemies of Islam in dear Palestine even in its initial stage. Who knows? Maybe it is written that the Zionists will be killed by bullets that are fired from their own guns!
