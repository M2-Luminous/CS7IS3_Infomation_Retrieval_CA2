Many conflicting reports were published about this conference. According to one report, he said that he did not want to unsettle the government, and that he wanted to support the present democratic process. Another report states that he said he wanted to establish a coalition of as many political parties as possible to establish a front against the present government, and will do anything to remove this government. According to this report, he also said that the government's invitation to him to hold talks is a deception and a spurious suggestion. He did not consider the government sincere about this. He further said that the alleged attack on him was part of the government's conspiracy against him. He mentioned Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's name, accusing her of this attack. Mr. Sharif's younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, also spoke in the same tone. He went as far as saying that Aasif Ali Zardari, the prime minister's husband, stayed at the Chamba House the last time he visited Lahore. At that time, plans were made to attack Nawaz Sharif. The Sharif brothers refused to accept the attack on Nawaz Sharif as an accident, and declared that there was a major conspiracy behind it. The fact is that Nawaz Sharif received some complaints from his election workers about the polling station at Dyal Singh College. He went to investigate the complaint on site. His supporters and bodyguards fired some shots in the air, and when Mr. Nawaz Sharif arrived, the workers associated with the MSF [Muslim Students Federation] and the Muslim League (J) fired some shots. There was an exchange of fire between them and Nawaz Sharif's bodyguards. As I mentioned in my column yesterday, the statement of a senior police officer present there is very important in this context. He said that this incident did not appear to be planned; it was an incident that turned into a crisis, and firing was exchanged. According to him, it was totally wrong and deplorable to call it a conspiracy to murder Nawaz Sharif. Trying to accuse Aasif Zardari or Madam Benazir Bhutto is making a mountain out of a molehill, and is an outrageous act. Nawaz Sharif was upset about the Thursday incident, which is understandable. However, saying that the proposal to hold talks, which was made before this incident, is a deception, a fraud, or a lure only shows that he has no intention of participating in the proposed talks. Nawaz Sharif says that Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear program during her last administration, and he fears that she will roll back the program now. Can a well-informed man like Nawaz Sharif, who has been prime minister of this country for two and one-half years, say with confidence that a prime minister has ever been so powerful as to decide to freeze the nuclear program? During her last administration, the military and the president did not take Madam Bhutto into confidence, and she has complained herself that the nuclear program was accelerated one step in the spring of 1990 without her knowledge. Against this background, is it possible that Madam Bhutto could freeze the nuclear program on her own? Mian Nawaz Sharif knows well that this is not possible. The fact is that General Ziaul Haq and Ishaq Khan had been in total control of the nuclear program after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After the position of prime minister was recreated, it had no control over the nuclear program. All the major decisions made about the nuclear program were based on the military and the president's agreements. Madam Bhutto's mention of freezing the program at the July 1990 level means that the people who were in power made this decision. Benazir alone could not have made this decision. Nawaz Sharif and his advisers are still making noise about Madam Bhutto rolling back the nuclear program, or that she will do so. We would like to ask these esteemed persons if they honestly believe that Madam Bhutto, even if she wants to, can roll back the nuclear program. There is only one answer to this question, and that is in the negative. The nuclear program in Pakistan is controlled and supervised jointly by the top leaders. If the prime minister wants, she cannot make such a decision on her own. I would like to explain this issue a little further. No step can be taken on the nuclear program without the approval and satisfaction of the armed forces. Therefore, the propaganda and noise that Madam Bhutto is ignoring national interests and is rolling back the nuclear program is totally baseless, meaningless, and incomprehensible. The Pakistani people should ignore the noise and tumult raised by the opposition and should not worry. Any decision made about this will be made with everyone's advice and with the nation's interests in mind. The decision to freeze the program was also a joint one. That is why Nawaz Sharif could not inform the nation about it being frozen, and nor could he make a decision to reverse this freeze. In his press conference in Islamabad, he said that he received the program when it was already frozen, and that what he did was in the interests of the nation. It is clear that the statements issued by Special Assistant Chowdhery Nisar Ali, Chairman of the Senate Wasim Sajjad, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs Akram Zaki, and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Sheharyar Khan in the United States, and the assurances they gave, were all based on the collective decisions. Muin Qureshi has also mentioned putting a cap on the nuclear program, which also reflects cooperative decisions. Pakistan's nuclear program is presently where the joint decision of our leaders wanted it to be. Any future decisions will also reflect the agreement of all. Nawaz Sharif and his associates said during the 1988 and 1990 elections that Madam Bhutto will sacrifice national interests over the Kashmir and the nuclear program. They are repeating this again. But their claims are baseless and contrary to common sense. It is against the government of Pakistan's government, and their purpose is just to have some cheap propaganda. It does not reflect sagacity or a mature viewpoint. Continuing it is not in the interests of our country. The opposition has the right to criticize the government, but not at the cost of our national interests. They should, of course, criticize the internal policies of Madam Bhutto, make them look bad and unsuccessful. However, they should not try to make the issues that were decided by common agreement, suspect or questionable. This will not help our country, and it will not help them either.
