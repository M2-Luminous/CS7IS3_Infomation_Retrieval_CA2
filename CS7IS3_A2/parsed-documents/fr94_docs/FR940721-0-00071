FR940721-0-00071 FR940721-0-00014 As discussed earlier in this preamble, NADA argued that existing labels including the Monroney and fuel economy labels create safety concerns for vehicles which are test driven prior to their delivery to first purchasers, because the labels obstruct visibility. Noting that the agency indicated in the NPRM that dealers would not be allowed to remove a parts content label except in the event that it becomes mutilated or damaged, that organization urged the agency to prohibit the placement of separate parts content labels on vehicle windows. NADA stated that the final rule should specify that dealers may remove labels prior to sale when instructed by a manufacturer to replace them with substitutes containing updated or corrected information. AIADA repeated its earlier argument that dealers should be permitted to remove the label from a vehicle if state law requires it, such as when dealers are operating demonstrator vehicles, or when dealers move cars in an intra-dealer exchange. After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that there is no basis to change its view, discussed in the NPRM, that section 210 prohibits temporary removal of labels for test drives. The Justice Department concurs in this view. Section 210 specifically requires each dealer to ``cause to be maintained, on each such vehicle ,'' the required label. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the required label must be maintained by dealers ``on each *␣*␣* vehicle.'' Moreover, the similarity of the language in section 210 for the content label with that for the Monroney and fuel economy labels indicates that the same result should be obtained. The commenters did not present any legal analysis challenging the legal analysis presented in the NPRM or suggesting that the Justice Department analysis is incorrect. The final rule does clarify that dealers may replace labels with substitutes containing corrected information when instructed to do so by a manufacturer. It is unnecessary to specify that labels may be replaced for updated information, since the information specified on the label is not subject to change (except for purposes of correction). F. Authority To Exclude Vehicles With Low or High U.S./Canadian Content NHTSA stated in the NPRM that, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, it was considering providing manufacturers with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead of determining and providing the precise amount of such content. The agency addressed this issue as follows in the NPRM: Several manufacturers requested more limited labeling requirements for manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles that contain minimal U.S./Canadian content. In effect, the label would state that the vehicle contained less than a certain percentage of U.S./Canadian content. It would also state the final assembly point, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Volvo suggested the simplified procedure be implemented for imported vehicles containing under 15 percent U.S./Canadian content. The AAMA agreed with the 15 percent level, stating that Congress appeared to indicate that higher percentages of U.S./Canadian content were significant for purposes of labeling. Volkswagen and the AIAM, however, suggested a level of 35 percent, stating that lower levels would not affect enough vehicles to make implementation of the special provisions worthwhile. Lamborghini, in its testimony at the public meeting in December 1992, suggested a cutoff of 20 percent. As a practical matter, NHTSA agrees that once the domestic content gets below a certain point, the precise amount of that content becomes immaterial, i.e ., the vehicle is foreign and small differences in domestic content are not likely to be relevant to consumer purchasing decisions. Therefore, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, the agency is considering providing manufacturers with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead of determining and providing the precise amount of such content. The primary benefit of this option would be to eliminate manufacturer costs associated with keeping precise records and making precise calculations about the U.S./Canadian content of a vehicle, when the manufacturer knows such content is very low. Under this option, manufacturers would still be required to provide items 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the label, i.e. , major foreign sources of vehicle equipment, place of final assembly and countries of origin of the engine/transmission. 58 FR 61053&hyph;54. However, NHTSA also noted that such an option would represent a limited exclusion from one of section 210's labeling requirements. The agency stated that as part of considering this option, as well as possible special requirements discussed below for multi-stage and low volume manufacturers, it was in the process of determining whether it had authority to provide limited exclusions from section 210's labeling requirements. NHTSA stated that it would complete its evaluation before reaching a final decision about possible exclusions. 58 FR 61054.
