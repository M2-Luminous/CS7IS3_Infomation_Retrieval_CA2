Chuan said his hands-off politics is acceptable in a democratic system and he would prove it workable, even though the mass media often accused him of remaining aloof from the problems of the other coalition partners. "I have always to keep in mind how a coalition government of five partners can stay together and work together," Chuan told THE NATION in an end-of-year interview. "I have to respect every Cabinet member and entrust them all with power and responsibilities in their respective ministries. I don't have the time to do everything myself." However, as premier, he would share the responsibility if any Cabinet members failed to perform to expectation. Two incidents during the past year which led to criticism that Chuan was staying aloof from problems were the controversial removal of Pol Gen [Police General] Sawat Amonwiwat as police chief and the suspension of Permanent Secretary for Commerce Phatchara Itsrasena. Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut catalyzed a series of controversies and protests from policemen when he initially seconded Sawat to an inactive post and eventually fired him. After nearly a month of squabbling Chuan finally intervened, and Sawat was reinstated and immediately transferred to the post of inspector general at the Interior Ministry. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon suspended Phatchara from duty pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed against him by an oil importing company. Chuan said he could not step in immediately whenever problems occurred because he had to allow the respective ministers to try to solve the matters first. "It's rather had to work as a coalition government. We have to respect our working partners and when problems happen we have to share responsibility," Chuan said. "In fact, I've helped settle problems in other agencies several times. But I've had to keep a low profile and not seek publicity. "If I had solved other people's problems and then announced that those particular ministries had problems which I had cleared up, the respective ministers would lose face. I won't do that." He said sometimes the partners' platforms might contradict each other, but a compromise could be reached if all parties adhered to the government's announced policies. But Chuan said he did wish he had known in advance of Uthai's decision to suspend Phatchara, as he would have objected. "The only issue that I have not known of in advance is the suspension of Phatchara on grounds that a lawsuit had been filed against him. Had I known, I would not have allowed it." The prime minister said he has faith in democracy, and believes it will always provide the means to solve the country's problems. "As long as we don't create the conditions, like corruption, history will not repeat itself. Now, people well understand the democratic system and everybody feels involved in it. The people feel much closer to an elected government." Chuan said the past year had proved that rumours about a House dissolution remained only "rumours". "I've always told the public not to believe rumours. Only I can seek a Royal command to dissolve the House and it's never occurred to me to do it," Chuan said. "Rumours about a House dissolution spread several times in the past year and only proved that rumours are rumours." The prime minister blamed speculators for spreading the rumours in a bid to force share prices down so they could buy cheap stocks. On the economics front, the prime minister said the government had been successful in running the country during the past year, shoring up the business sector's confidence. This confidence and the healthy economic situation in the world market had contributed to the country's growth. This year, he said, the government will work to maintain and increase that growth.
