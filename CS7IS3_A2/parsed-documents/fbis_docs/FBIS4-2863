But, if the government wants to continue calling the tune and keep the dancers on their feet, it has to watch out for inflation and the ailing State-owned enterprises. "Against a background of bold reform moves and high inflation, a slight slowdown in the economy is good news," said Liu Li, an analyst on macro-economic performance with the State Economic & Trade Commission. "It may ease worries that an overheated environment could undermine the success of the prospective financial reform package." Ever since last September when central government went for an easy money policy, economists have been afraid that the economy may be on the way to overheating. But, despite their deep worries, they prefer a step-by-step slowdown in the economy to a sudden application of the brakes -- the economic instability caused by an emergency stop is the last thing they want to see. And now the first signs of the hoped for slowdown are becoming apparent. In the period from January to March the industry grew by 18.6 percent, which was more than 3 percentage points down on the same period last year. And conditions are favourable to the government side in the battle against inflation. Consumer market are fairly stable which is helping the government to hold down price hikes. Retail sales in the first quarter were 25 percent up on the same period last year, a 5 percent rise after inflation. And in spite of low interest rates, residents continue to put their money in the banks. According to Liu, bank savings ballooned to 1,660 billion yuan ($190.8 billion). This represents deposits of 180 billion yuan ($20.7 billion) since the end of last year. During the first few months of last year, by comparison, depositors were cashing in their savings to protect themselves from inflation. "The wide range of goods in the shops has boosted consumer confidence, and they have learnt from 1988's panic buying and are more reasonable when going shopping," said the analyst. It is widely believed that a nationwide buying spree is now impossible. In 1988 when China first witnessed successive months of double- digit inflation rates, it was spend, spend, spend. But this year, more and more people are making fixed-term deposits at the expense of current accounts, as is shown by the downturn in the curve which traces the ratio between the two. This new savings trend shows that people trust in the government's determination to fight inflation. When inflation prospects were gloomy in 1988 and in the second half of last year, people went for current account deposits and the ratio curve peaked. Furthermore, by the end of last month banks had clawed back the 140 billion yuan ($16.1 billion) which was issued around Spring Festival. The reduction in the money supply will help to pull down inflation. And the balance of foreign exchange at the end of March is expected to exceed $30 billion, compared with only $21 billion at the beginning of this year. "The economy is heading for a healthy status and a soft landing is in prospect," said Li Guobin, an analyst at the State Information Centre. And industrial growth is going to fall off, he said. Enterprises will continue to suffer money shortages, as is shown by the declining ratio between business savings and industrial output. And as consumer savings increase, sales will wane, increasing stockpiles. Businesses are not optimistic about the immediate future of their markets. And the government's tight credit policy will also cool down the economy. Central financing of capital construction has decreased 23 percent in the first quarter, according to Liu. But, although money supply is being squeezed, inflation seems to continue to grow. Li said that the consumer prices index in the first quarter was up 20 percent. And inflation will continue to be a major problem in the second quarter of this year, making it difficult to predict the course of this year's economic development. Leading economist Wu Jinglian said that central government must stick to its anti-inflation policy. Another knotty problem is the declining performance of State- owned enterprises. According to Liu Li, 45.9 percent of State-owned enterprises were in the red at the end of February. One third of State-owned enterprises suffered losses last year. Economists are worried that the ailing enterprises may delay banking reform. For, once the State banks are commercialized, they will grant loans according to business performance, rather than losing their money in the black hole of unprofitable white elephants. Meanwhile, the gap between the booming coastal and inland regions is widening. In the first quarter, seven provinces in the east and south -- Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong- contributed 12.2 percentage points to the nation's 18.6-percent industrial growth. And the country's economic progress cannot be secured if its regions continue to dance to different beats.
