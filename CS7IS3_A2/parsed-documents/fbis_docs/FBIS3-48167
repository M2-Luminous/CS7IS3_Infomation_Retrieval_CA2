In the two-day livestock negotiations with the ROK in Washington on 19 January, the United States demanded that the ROK ensure that apart from beef, a minimum volume of cattle, be imported each year since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] schedule of concessions provide for zero percent tariff for cattle and since the cattle market is to open from 1 July 1997. The United States also requested that the ROK ease its government restrictions prohibiting the local meet-processing firms from processing and selling beef imported through the simultaneous buying and selling system (SBS) as packaged beef. The ROK side, however, is reported to have told the U.S. side that it is difficult for the ROK to set quotas on live cattle and that for the time being, the ROK has to maintain restrictions on the sale of packaged meat by meat-processing firms that are members of consumer organizations. Participating as senior delegates in the Washington negotiation were Yi Yong-nae, agricultural attache of the ROK Embassy in the United States from the ROK side and Jim Grueff, chief of the Uruguay Round [Multilateral Trade Policy Affairs] section of the Agricultural Department from the U.S. side.
