The radioactive and toxic waste is being dumped on two locations on Mt. Papuk, Jarcevic specified. Croatia drove out all Serbs from western Slavonia in 1991 in its war of secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. Jarcevic said he wrote a letter last month to UN expert William Fenrick informing him about the hazard the dumps posed to the environment. The copy of the letter was sent to the office of the UN secretary-general. In the letter addressed to Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday, whose copy was sent to TANJUG, Jarcevic expresses regret and puzzlement at not receiving a reply from the UN secretary-general, ``all the more so as the dumps pose danger not only to the people of the RSK but to UN troops deployed near the danger zone too.'' The RSK was formed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated areas in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. The RSK was placed under UN protection in March 1992 and 14,000 UN peacekeepers are currently stationed there. In his letter to the secretary-general, Jarcevic enclosed the topographical map of the two locations and roads leading to them, and insisted that the UN civilian police investigate the matter and report the findings to the Security Council.
