Speaker of the Dniester local parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa returned on Thursday from a business trip to Moscow, where he failed to settle the coupon issue with Russian authorities. The coupons were printed late last year at Russia's Goznak mint on Tiraspol's order and cost the region 1.5 billion Russian roubles. The move was prompted by Moldova's decision to introduce its own national currency, the lei, which the Dniester authorities refused to recognize and ordered to keep Soviet roubles in circulation. This sent inlfation soaring and brought the regional economy on the verge of collapse. In addition to it, the situation changed considerably following last October's events in Moscow. Seeking not to sour relations with Moldova, the Russian leadership decided to hold up the transfer of the coupons to Tiraspol. Early this year, Russia's supreme arbitration court ruled to satisfy the claim of the Dniester region and obliged the manufacturer to hand over the coupons to the customer. However, this has not been done so far. According to well-informed sources in Tiraspol, Moscow demands that the Dniester leadership coordinate its actions with Kishinev. The Moldovan authorities believe that Dniester's own currency will complicate the process of settlement, which is expected to be discussed at next week's round of Moldovan-Dniester talks. The talks will be mediated by the Russian president's special envoy Vladlen Vasev.
