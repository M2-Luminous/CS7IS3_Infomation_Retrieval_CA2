He indicated that there is very little possibility that the U.S. visit can materialize before the OECD executive ministerial committee meeting in early June. This source also disclosed that Kakizawa told U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor during a telephone conversation on the same evening that an early trip to the United States would be unlikely, and that the two men agreed that Japan and the United States should consider holding a foreign ministerial meeting during the OECD meeting in Paris on 7 and 8 June.
