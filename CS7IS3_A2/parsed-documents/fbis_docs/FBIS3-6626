Touching on the first drop in the cabinet's support rate below 50 percent as indicated in the two opinion polls conducted by the JNN [Japan News Network] data bank, composed of such agencies as the TBS [Tokyo Broadcasting System] and by the JIJI News Agency, Hosokawa said: "It must have been affected by such troubles as the National Welfare Tax and the cabinet reshuffle. Also, the rice issue (concerning the shortage of rice at stores). Various factors are involved." Then, he continued to say: "I have no other choice but to carry on without paying much attention to this. I believe what I am supposed to do is to pay attention to what I am doing now."
