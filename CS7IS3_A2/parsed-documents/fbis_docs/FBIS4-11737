The Iranian pilot had contacted both towers prior to the disaster. This plane crash is still shrouded in mystery while Iranian officials are under increasing public pressure to identify those responsible for this atrocity which resulted in the martyrdom of 32 innocent Iranians returning home for the New Year. Iranians are outraged at this savage terrorist act and demand cooperation of all parties concerned in efforts to identify the culprits and to bring them to justice. The Armenians of Karabakh and the Azeris accuse each other of responsibility in this heinous crime against Iranian citizens. However, the evidence so far points to the Armenians as the most likely perpetrators of this cowardly act, therefore it is incumbent upon the Armenian authorities to prove otherwise. The C-130 tragedy along with the rampant and pointless killings by both sides make it necessary to find a final and comprehensive solution to this destructive armed conflict. Despite political pressures from the Armenians and the Azeris and their respective supporters on the international level, Iran's mediating efforts so far have been based purely on the Islamic Republic's desire for peace in the region and its absolute impartiality in this dispute. Iran believes that the ongoing Armenian-Azeri land dispute has sapped both countries' economic and political energies which will sooner or later result in the two countries' dependence on big foreign powers. International organizations' slow pace in resolving such disputes make them ineffective in solving this particular crisis. Only the bilateral political resolve of Armenians and the Azeris together with the mediation of well intentioned regional countries could put an end to this senseless mass killing. Both sides should also consider the fact that if such flagrant acts of terrorism continue, neighboring countries such as the Islamic Republic will have no choice but to react accordingly in order to protect their citizens.
