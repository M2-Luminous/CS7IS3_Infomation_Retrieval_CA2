Time is pressing, the hunt for alliances is gaining pace, and there are increasingly frenetic hypotheses and rumors about agreements among the forces in the arena. If it is impossible to unite, then at least an attempt can be made to divide rival troops. One of the many rumors current in Milan yesterday was of an imminent meeting between Roberto Formigoni -- who has been ratified by the PPI [Italian Popular Party] Lombard assembly as its regional coordinator -- and [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi. Furthermore, it was rumored that the reason for the meeting was the difficulty of conducting a dialogue between Berlusconi and the League. The gist of the message is supposedly a request something like this: Silvio, forget about the Lombards, and come with us. [Gorodisky] Mr. Formigoni, is the PPI leaving the door open to Forza Italia's leader? [Formigoni] I see no open doors. I see only that Berlusconi has decided to trample [League Secretary] Bossi. And frankly I am surprised. I also regret it -- a friend who has leapt into the lion's mouth. [Gorodisky] Are you close friends? [Formigoni] No. We are bound by ties of esteem and the affection that all Milan supporters have for the soccer club's chairman. [Gorodisky] Meanwhile Milan's chairman has come to an understanding with the Democratic Christians, Costa's Center Union, and the new Federation of Reformist and Libertarian Socialists -- Del Turco's grouping. [Formigoni] That seems to me to be an agreement with individuals, not with movements. [Gorodisky] Be that as it may, Berlusconi is no longer on his own.... [Formigoni] What does that have to do with anything? We are a party; we are in earnest. In Lombardy we command 20 percent of the votes: Not many people can say as much. We reach agreements on the basis of political arguments, not with individuals. Politics is consensus. This is not a good situation, admittedly. But we have already contributed some good building bricks to our new edifice -- Segni's Pact, some of the Socialists, half of the PRI [Italian Republican Party], half of the Liberals.... [Gorodisky] What do you think of Forza Italia's election campaign? [Formigoni] I think it is sad. And it is on television.... I watch television as little as possible. [Gorodisky] Are you thinking of standing as a candidate? [Formigoni] That will be decided by the grassroots. I declare my willingness to stand. [Gorodisky] An agreement between Berlusconi and the League seems to face many obstacles. Might you reconsider conducting a dialogue with Bossi? [Formigoni] Never. The League has opted to become the MSI [Italian Social Movement] of the year 2000. We tried, then Bossi decided to espouse the most extreme wing of the movement, and broke away from us. There is not the faintest glimmer of hope left. Of course, it is a different matter with regard to the League's voters. We know that they are starting to appreciate the center that is renewing itself, our proposals. [Gorodisky] The implication seems to be that if Berlusconi were to change a little.... [Formigoni] Look, all I know is that he was determined to make the center, the liberal democrats, compact, but that after two days, there he is, relegated to the right corner. I am just watching him.
