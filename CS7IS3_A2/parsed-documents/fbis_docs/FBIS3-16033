The Abkhazian Information and Press Ministry released today a statement by the separatist parliament stressing that the decision by Georgian lawmakers proved to their ignoring legal norms. "The existing constitutions of Georgia and of Abkhazia do not provide for dissolution of Abkhazia's supreme legislature by the Georgian Parliament", the statement said. "By taking this decision, lawmakers probably sought to disrupt negotiations for a peaceful settlement in Abkhazia", it noted. The Abkhazian Parliament reiterated its commitment to a peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It claimed that the decisions passed by the Georgian legislature had nothing to do with the Republic of Abkhazia and only led to spiralling tensions in Georgian-Abkhazian relations.
