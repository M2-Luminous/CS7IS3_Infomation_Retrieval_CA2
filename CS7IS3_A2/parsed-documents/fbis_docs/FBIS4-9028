Over the past four years, the army staff has been reduced from 156,000 to 100,000, and soldiers are now imbued with what the defence minister describes as a national spirit. The recent changes are summed up in a book published earlier this year under the title "Four Years of National Defence: 1990-1994". Jozsef Antall's government gave priority to restoring Hungary's sovereignty and withdrawing the country from the alliance system that hindered this endeavour. In 1991, at a Hungarian initiative, Warsaw Treaty member states met in Budapest to wind up the military alliance. Defence Minister Lajos Fur, who presented the book to the press, recalled that dissolution talks brought some heavy clashes between the Hungarian delegation, and Warsaw Treaty leaders and Soviet military commanders. Soviet troops, stationed in Hungary for 45 years and numbering 60,000 in the last phase of their stay here, were withdrawn under an agreement concluded by Miklos Nemeth's government in March 1990. The last Soviet soldier left Hungary on June 19, 1981. According to current military leadership, four years ago the Hungarian Army was oversized and had an aggressive nature, while its technological, organizational and moral standards were deteriorating. In the first phase, the new leadership formulated a security policy which no longer implies an enemy image. The development of Hungary's defence was subordinated to the interests of the nation and started from geopolitical realities. Hungary has concluded military cooperation agreements with the majority of its neighbours. Despite cool relations with Romania, the two countries' military leaders are in permanent contact and assure a successful implementation of the Open Skies treaty. Hungary maintains regular relations with NATO, and was the fifth country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement. The real value of funds earmarked for national defence from the state coffer has decreased since the mid-1980s. As this trend continued after the collapse of the communist regime in 1990, the defence budget did not meet the need for standard maintenance of the armed forces. Presently, less than 2 percent of the gross domestic product is earmarked for defence. The withdrawal of Soviet troops has particularly weakened Hungary's anti-aircraft defence. To improve the situation, Russia repaid part of the former Soviet debts to Hungary in 1993 by 28 MiG- 29 jets valued at $850 million. Last year, Germany transferred military components from the arsenal of the one-time East German Army to Hungary free of charge, with a value of DM 150 million. This year, Hungary expects to get helicopter parts from Germany. Hungary's new defence law was enacted, in consensus, last December. The law left the 12-month compulsory military service unchaged, but reduced the period of unarmed military service from 15 to 12 months. Civilian service, where soldiers receive basic military training and then work in their trade under a contract between their companies and the army, has been cut from 22 to 18 months. Fathers of two children are called up only for six months, while those of three or more are entirely exempted from military service. In January, military chaplains began to work in the Hungarian Army, while in March, approximately 500 officers began to provide human services, including moral education and social-welfare support.
