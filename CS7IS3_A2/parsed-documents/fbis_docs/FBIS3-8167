How should one otherwise interpret the words of Warren Christopher that the agreement in the State Department shows how much can be achieved, after bitter years of violence, when two sides sit behind a negotiating table and decide to reach an agreement. By running after the carrot, the leaders of the two peoples deserved to get the stick, which they did, and any sort of submissiveness ultimately deserves to be despised. However, it nevertheless seems that the things have been pushed too far, be it in the demonstration of power and in the manifestation of weakness. The two peoples that have been bleeding and dying did not deserve this, irrespective of their leaders. It would certainly be better for the Croats to have sanctions imposed against them, and for the Muslims to be told once and for all not to expect a single cent or bullet in aid, than to sign an agreement to live together again. Had the Americans really wanted peace, they would have condemned Granic, Silajdzic, and Zubak to share the same bachelor pad until the end of their lives, and build a China wall between the two peoples. Parallel to the realization of their political interests, the Americans also love to amuse themselves in the Bosnian arena and that is why they are offering new bloodshed in the name of peace. Just like a chess player after a lost match who is analyzing the positions and wondering where he went wrong, placing the figures on the same positions again, and demanding an impossible victory, the Americans are again trying out an option that has already flopped -- a coalition of the Croats and the Muslims. However, it is incomparably more difficult on this occasion as, in the meantime, much blood has been shed and the hatred is enormous. Forgetting that love cannot be administered or agreed on, as opposed to hatred, which can be instigated, the Americans would now like to mix up the Mostar Croats and Muslims just like chess pieces on the board, exorcising memories, pain, and despair from their heads and souls. Forget everything and love each other, the Americans advise them and those in central Bosnia -- the exiled, the displaced, and the mutilated. They should all forget everything. It is not theirs to think and feel, as pawns do not feel. There are no more grenades, but the most dangerous weapon -- the door. This is the most poisonous weapon -- when, at midnight or at four o'clock in the morning, uniformed people come to the door and beat, tie-up, kill, and chase people away. This weapon is also dangerous for the nervous system and is used only when people live together. There will be no more of this, love each other, the Americans recommend. We should not worry. Live people are not pawns. There have been rumors that, even after the signing of the agreement, the clashes will not stop. Because of the fear of doors, the grenade is being used as a weapon.
