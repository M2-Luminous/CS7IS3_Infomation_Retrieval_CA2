On Thursday day, during a short stop in Moscow on his way from Cairo to St. Petersburg he reported that two dates had been preliminary discussed by the parties. "Moscow is in favor of an earlier date (May 13) in order to prevent escalation of hostilities in Bosnia," said Kozyrev. He underlined that achievement of an agreement on cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and deployment of UN forces between the parties involved in this conflict is the major issue of the agenda. Speaking about the situation in the Middle East after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements on Gaza Strip and Jericho Wednesday in Cairo, Kozyrev noted that on the one hand, Moscow intends to assist in implementation and development of these agreements, and, on the other hand, it wants to assist in establishing a Syrian-Israeli dialogue. Meanwhile, during his conversation with our Interfax correspondent a Russian diplomat in Cairo, who preferred to stay anonymous, expressed his opinion that a breakthrough on the Syrian-Israeli direction can be reached by means of "a quiet diplomacy" and, probably, on a bilateral ground as it was during the dialogue between Israel and the PLO. At the conference to be held in Geneva on May 13 the heads of Russian and American diplomacies, the European Union and the U.N. will address the warring sides in Bosnia with a joint appeal to sign an agreement to cease hostile actions and start drafting a document on a comprehensive solution to the conflict. Interfax learned this on Thursday from a senior Russian diplomat. According to him, a contact group, which includes experts from Russia (Interfax's note: Russia is represented there by a high- ranking member of its Foreign Ministry, Aleksey Nikiforov), the USA, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and the U.N., has been instructed to finalize a draft agreement on ceasing hostile actions. "The document has to be a compromise and take into account the wishes of both warring sides. With this aim in view the contact group is cruising between Pale and Sarajevo. On Friday it is expected to arrive in Zagreb," the diplomat said. According to him, the contact group is facing a complicated task. "Neither the Serbs nor the Muslims in Bosnia seem to want to heed anything, but their own arguments. This does not give rise to optimism, of course," he said. As Interfax's interviewee conceded, tensions around the Bosnian city of Brcko remain high. Nevertheless he said that the situation should not be dramatized. "A concentration of Serb and Muslim troops was noted around Brcko, but noticeable actions have been observed from neither side. Maybe the call for refraining from provocations made by the chairman of the U.N. Security Council had an effect on them. However there is another explanation for their restraint: the mountainous terrain and the abundance of rivers and rivulets rule out the possibility of large-scale military actions in the area of Brcko," he said. The diplomat qualified the statement made in Cairo by Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and by the U.S. secretary of State, Warren Christopher, as fundamentally important. The two men called for taking immediate steps to ease tensions and prevent offensive military actions in the area of Brcko, and for withdrawing all troops from the fixed areas around Gorazde." Kozyrev and Christopher also called for immediately resuming talks without preliminary conditions with a view to achieving a comprehensive settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
