FR940725-0-00079 FR940725-0-00012 40 CFR Part 52 [CO33&hyph;1&hyph;6406; and CO5&hyph;1&hyph;6386; FRL&hyph;5003&hyph;7] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM 10 Implementation Plan and Oxygenated Gasoline Program for Colorado AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, EPA is finalizing two separate proposed actions: EPA is finalizing the limited approval of the control measures which were contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Colorado to achieve attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). EPA is approving these control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the federally approved SIP for Colorado. (At this time, EPA is not approving the control measures limiting the emissions from Purina Mills and Electron Corporation. EPA will act on these measures at a later date.) The SIP revisions were submitted by Colorado to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Denver. Approval of these measures makes them federally enforceable. The EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, on the revisions as a whole at a later date. EPA is also approving revisions to Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated gasoline program) submitted on August 6, 1990, and November 27, 1992, implementing and amending oxygenated gasoline programs in the Fort Collins-Loveland, Colorado Springs, and Boulder-Denver Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) as required by Section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). This action is being taken under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on August 24, 1994.

Denver PM10 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Denver, Colorado area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.306 (specifying PM 10 nonattainment designation for the Denver metropolitan area). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act 2 . 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM 10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (see Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally, and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing it's interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas ( i.e., those areas designated nonattainment for PM10 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: (1) Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM), (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;
