This followed the iniquitous aggression by the forces of the Republican Guard, the Central Security, and the military police against the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp in Dhamar town where this daring brigade confronted, with rare heroism and outstanding bravery, the multitudes of these aggressive forces and inflicted a crushing defeat on them. At exactly 9 o'clock on 4 May, a unit of the Central Security carried out an act of aggression against Sawlaban Camp and an attack on Aden international airport in an attempt to occupy it or destroy it. However, this attempt quickly failed. Our forces managed to settle the situation quickly in their favor, and the battalion of military police refused to obey the orders of Sanaa to fight against their brothers, the sons of all the Yemeni people. All the battalion's members joined our forces. [passage omitted] And in a dangerous development of the military and political situation, the adventurist gang in Sanaa resorted to using military aircraft. The citizens of Aden this morning were surprised by a pair of warplanes attacking Aden international airport, but our vigilant air defenses confronted this attack which did not achieve any success worth mentioning. In response, our fighter aircraft attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz, and al-Hudaydah airport, paralyzing these airports to stop them from being used by this (?reckless) gang in its bloody criminal acts against our people. While the Defense Ministry decisively confronts the adventurist acts of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family, it notes with extreme gratification that many members of our armed forces and units who are under the control of the Sanaa gang, have refused to fight against their brothers. Another large number joined our forces who are defending unity and democracy. [passage omitted]
