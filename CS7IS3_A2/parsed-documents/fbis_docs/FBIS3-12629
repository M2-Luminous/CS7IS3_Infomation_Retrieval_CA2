The two countries--the former Soviet Union and China--used to be of great importance to North Korea if not for providing it with economic assistance, then for the moral support they afforded it. These two countries gave North Korea the feeling that it was part of a greater cause, or a greater game, namely the now extinct game of communism. What brings the long-term or continued existence of the North Korean regime specially under question is the fact that it is surrounded on all sides by a number of countries with dynamic economies by world standards; countries which are continuing to experience growth despite the debilitating and lingering world economic recession. Even Vietnam with its former moribund economy is registering great economic improvements and attracting foreign investments. Therefore, if the realities in East Asia are any indication, the North Korean regime won't exist for long in its present political isolationist form. But the change or changes in the North Korean regime will not come, no matter how much the pressure from without or within, as long as its present leadership is alive. President Kim Il-song is a well established political institution in that country. He is, and will always be, the liberator of the "fatherland" from Japanese and American colonialisms. This latter qualification, the fact of being a political institution and a liberator also applies to President Fidel Castro of Cuba. The two are leaders with unshaking unwavering popular support behind them which no amount of foreign propaganda can weaken. The past heroic struggles of these two leaders for the "liberation" of their countries are reasons enough for their continued rule, just as long as they live. As far as North Korea's other half, i.e. South Korea, is concerned, there have been tension and sporadic friction between the two, but everything considered they have managed to bear one another and coexist for some half a century. But now, all of a sudden, it has been about a year maybe, that the question of North Korea's nuclear arms possession has become a hot, menacing and destabilizing issue. Despite being a topic of frontpage controversy and accusations, Washington has not given any concrete proof on what it claims and the whole thing seems to have been based on conjecture. The whole crisis surrounding the possession of nuclear arms by North Korea looks like a continued and artificial one. And there can be a number of reasons why the Americans are raising tension in the Korean Peninsula, and for that matter in East Asia, and in the meantime worrying everyone. Japan seems to have taken the whole deal seriously and is deeply concerned. Washington is subjecting the North Korean regime to so much pressure, it is good Pyongyang has not gone berserk. And if it goes berserk it should not surprise anyone. The idea of regarding the application of sanctions by the Americans and their allies as a "declaration of war" might be an indication of that. Washington is putting pressure in North Korea to open up its nuclear sites to inspection to make sure Pyongyang is no threat at all and that it is one hundred percent helpless. But to the North Korean regime, the idea of possessing nuclear arms is tantamount to prestige and a means of having its existence recognized. Therefore, no matter how much the threat of force and application of economic sanctions, North Korea will not open up its nuclear sites to inspection. For what is North Korea in the absence of even the perceived possession of nuclear arms?
