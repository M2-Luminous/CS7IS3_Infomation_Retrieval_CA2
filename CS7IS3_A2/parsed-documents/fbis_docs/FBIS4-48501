FBIS4-48501 "drafr098_d_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Malawi Congress Party Official Comments on Elections Congress Party Official Comments on Elections MB1905152194 London BBC World Service in English 0600 GMT 19 May 94 MB1905152194 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Network Africa" program] [Text] The man often assumed to be the power behind the throne in Malawi is Minister of State in the Presidency's Office John Tembo. On the line last night, I asked him whether him whether the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] had yet conceded defeat. [Begin recording] [Tembo] Actually, depending on the figures which were coming in yesterday, UDF [United Democratic Front] were ahead in polling. The figures were in their favor; but naturally the final figures were not out yet. We should be getting them sometime this morning or late afternoon today. Our reaction to it is that there is a normal electoral process and we accept the victory of the UDF or any other party which wins in this election. It is part of a system which we set in motion to do. [Unidentified reporter] But surely, if this trend does continue and the UDF indeed win, it must come as rather a bitter blow to you that the MCP has suffered such a heavy defeat? [Tembo] Well, naturally any party which loses, it feels sad, but if you accept, in a multiparty system, a democratic process and the right for people to choose a party of their choice, you must also accept that you can lose or win and the Malawi Congress will accept. [Reporter] So, why do you think the results have been so bad in fact? [Tembo] Well, I don't consider them that bad. I mean, considering the fact that the Malawi Congress Party has been in power for the last 30 years. It is natural that people in the transition we are going through, not only in Malawi but elsewhere, have the right to choose the party they want to govern them at that time. So, it is not really a shock or that bad. [Reporter] Overall, have you been happy with the conduct of the election, that it has indeed been a peaceful and free and fair vote? [Tembo] Yes, so far as the process is concerned, it has been very free and very fair. There has been no problem. No report of any intimidation. There is no report of any problem at any station. There has been some report of confusion in some polling stations because of the existence of two (?discarded) boxes, but otherwise it has been very, very quiet, and the atmosphere has been extremely good.
