FR940928-1-00012 FR940928-1-00003 B. Part D Requirements Before the San Francisco Bay Area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D of the Act. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a)(1) or table 3 of section 186(a). The San Francisco Bay Area was classified under table 1 of section 181(a)(1) as a moderate ozone nonattainment area (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.305). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176, as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D. B.1. Subpart 1 of part D_Section 172(c) Plan Provisions. Under section 172(b), the Administrator established that States containing nonattainment areas shall submit a plan or plan revision meeting the applicable requirements of section 172(c) no later than three years after an area is designated as nonattainment, i.e., unless EPA establishes an earlier date. EPA has determined that the section 172(c)(2) reasonable further progress (RFP) (with parallel requirements for a moderate ozone nonattainment area under subpart 2 of part D, due November 15, 1993) was not applicable at the time the State of California submitted the San Francisco Bay Area redesignation request on November 12, 1993. Also, the 172(c)(9) contingency measures and additional 172(c)(1) non-RACT reasonable available control measures (RACM) beyond what may already be required in the SIP are no longer necessary, since no earlier date was set for these measures and as RFP was not due until November 15, 1993. As discussed below in section B3., subpart 2 of part D, the BAAQMD is in the process of revising certain VOC RACT rules to meet the Clean Air Act requirements. The 172(c)(3) emissions inventory requirement has been met by the submission and proposed approval of the 1990 base year inventory required under subpart 2 of part D, section 182(a)(1).
