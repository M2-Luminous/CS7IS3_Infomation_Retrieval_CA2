FR941206-0-00063 FR941206-0-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 9 and 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5115&hyph;8] RIN 2060&hyph;AC28 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Ethylene Oxide Commercial Sterilization and Fumigation Operations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for ethylene oxide commercial sterilization and fumigation operations were proposed in the Federal Register on March 7, 1994. This Federal Register action announces the EPA's final decisions on the rule. This action promulgates NESHAP for ethylene oxide commercial sterilization and fumigation operations. These standards implement section 112 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and are based on the Administrator's determination that commercial sterilization and fumigation operations emit ethylene oxide, a pollutant identified in the Act list of 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The intent of the standards is to protect public health by requiring existing and new major sources to control emissions to the level achievable by the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and by requiring existing and new area sources to control emissions using generally available control technology (GACT). These standards are consistent with section 112(d) of the Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective December 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 6, 1994. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section concerning judicial review. ADDRESSES: Background Information Document. The background information document (BID) for the promulgated standards may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia 22161, telephone number (703) 487&hyph;4650. Please refer to ``Ethylene Oxide Emissions from Commercial Sterilization/Fumigation Operations_Background Information for Final Standards,'' NTIS number EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;94&hyph;084b. The BID contains: (1) A summary of all the public comments made on the proposed standards and the Administrator's response to the comments, and (2) a summary of the changes made to the standards since proposal. Electronic versions of the promulgation BID as well as this final rule are available for download from the EPA's Technology Transfer Network (TTN), a network of electronic bulletin boards developed and operated by the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The TTN provides information and technology exchange in various areas of air pollution control. The service is free, except for the cost of a phone call. Dial (919) 541&hyph;5742 for data transfer of up to a 14,400 bits per second (bps). If more information on TTN is needed, contact the systems operator at (919) 541&hyph;5384. Docket.
