One can recall that Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri has tried to bring Burma to the ASEAN meeting as an observer. Thailand has openly made known its position on this matter. No one knows whether the invitation, which is common knowledge, to Burma was in exchange for something from that country. However, the foreign minister's visit to Burma was followed by an increase in trade contracts between the two countries. More important, several hundred Thai fishermen were released by Burma. In any event, the foreign minister has not relaxed his drive. He has tried to lobby fellow ASEAN countries to see the merit of inviting Burma to the ASEAN meeting with full observer status. He said during a recent official visit to Manila that he saw no complications in inviting Burma for consultations with ASEAN. The Thai foreign minister's stand is clear. It is difficult to understand the eagerness on the part of Thailand when other ASEAN countries do not seem to be concerned if Burma avoids involvement in ASEAN at this time. Singapore did not invite Burma as an observer to the ASEAN ministerial meeting it hosted last year. A result of Singapore's skillful diplomacy is that it was able to avoid negative comments from the countries which were applying pressure against Burma. Vietnam attended the Singapore meeting last year as an observer, signifying a degree of acceptance of that country by ASEAN. However, during his recent visit to Vietnam Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that country should not consider joining ASEAN for another year or two. Thailand's diplomatic skills trail those of Singapore. At this point we should make known our position that the time is now right for Vietnam to join ASEAN. The Vietnamese administrative system can hardly be an obstruction. The Burmese system is just as lamentable; how can Thailand justify its endeavor in favor of Burma? Thailand cannot avoid strong criticism on this matter. The long-term repercussion will be considerable because we will be on the opposite side of the superpowers who are applying pressure against Burma. We cannot even correctly choose sides; what else is there to say about this bungling? A point to be concerned with is losing face if Thailand's eagerness does not receive the expected response. So far we have not heard about the Burmese position regarding how eager it is to accept an ASEAN invitation. It is likely that this year Burma will be occupied with its domestic problems more so than it might be with ASEAN matters because it knows that its acceptance will not be easy. Burma has seen the Vietnam case as an example, and it will be forced to think even harder. Burma will be pressured by many events. One will be the fact that the ASEAN ministerial meeting will be held in July, the same month that Aung San Suu Kyi's detention is scheduled to end. There are rumors that Suu Kyi's detention will be extended. A refusal to release her will essentially disqualify Burma from joining the international community. Pressure from the United States, the UK, and the European Union will increase, and an ASEAN action concerning Burma could lead to a future confrontation with those countries. Thailand will not be able avoid their dissatisfaction because it led the campaign to invite Burma. There is an ambitious anticipation that because the group in power allowed a U.S. congressman to meet Suu Kyi, a settlement between her and the Burmese Government is possible. THE ECONOMIST even ridiculed Congressman Richardson's grandeur about a meeting between Suu Kyi and Khin Nyunt "even if they only discuss the weather." Another problem facing Burma is peace talks with minority groups. These talks will never reach concrete agreements as in the accord with the Kachins. On this subject, Thailand was accused of forcing minority groups to negotiate and accept conditions set by the military dictatorship in Rangoon. Burma will be forced to exert efforts to achieve concrete achievements in these areas. To join ASEAN merely to show that it has become part of the international community will not help Burma solve the minority problem. The drafting of the Constitution by the Rangoon power holders is a joke, not only because there are conditions that retain the military leadership role, but the Burmese military dictatorship has already started to arrest people who oppose the drafting and the conditions. The constitution will fuel new, violent political confrontation, and chaos will be unending. What qualifications does Burma have for Thailand to invite its participation in ASEAN? By offering an invitation, Thailand will be viewed as engaging in trade and association with that country only to exploit it for short-term and unethical reasons. It is anticipated that as the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July approaches, U.S. pressure against Burma will increase. The U.S. policy toward Burma will be more aggressive in conjunction with pressure from U.S. allies such as the UK, France, Australia, the Scandinavian countries, the European Union, Japan, and the United Nations. The main demands of the group applying pressure against Burma are the unconditional release of Suu Kyi and the return of legitimate power to the group which won the general election in 1990, improved human rights, and the formation of a democratic government acceptable to the world community. Burma has apparently done nothing in these areas. In the eyes of the world, the so-called "constructive engagement" has not done anything constructive for Burma, only constructive business dealings. One cannot understand why there is such eagerness to invite Burma to the upcoming ASEAN meeting. Will this investment turn out to be too expensive? Where can Thailand hide its face if Burma feels that it should tackle its problems first and reject the invitation?
