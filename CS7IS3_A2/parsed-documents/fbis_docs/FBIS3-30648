According to the amendments, the act will be extended to apply to farming cooperatives and will no longer require cooperative members to have contributed land of proven title in order to qualify for tied soft loans. The Parliamentary Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) voted against the amendments, arguing that their passage legitimizes the cooperatives set up by the "nomenklatura" of the disbanded cooperative farms. The National Assembly Committee on Agriculture today heard a report from Deputy Agriculture Minister Todor Markov on the performance of liquidation councils (which were set up under the Agricultural Land Tenure Act to wind up the cooperative farms and distribute their assets). According to Mr. Markov, of a total of 2,082 liquidation councils nationwide, only three have completed their work, and another 185 are ready to wrap up their business. The members of the parliamentary committee said that the Agriculture Ministry should prepare an accurate timetable for the completion of liquidation councils' work. The National Assembly Budgetary and Finance Committee today approved in principle the 1994 national budget bill. The SDS MP's on the committee voted against the bill. The Legislative Committee discussed a bill establishing terms and a procedure for the use of surveillance methods. Parliament today passed by an overwhelming majority amendments to the Persons and Family Act, introducing a new procedure for non- profit corporations engaged in religious or religious education activities, which will now have to register at court after advance clearance from the government. During the debate, MP's of different parliamentary groups emphasized that the act has to be amended because of the invasion of a number of religious cults, some of which abuse civil rights by their activities. Under the amended version, any juristic person engaged in religious activities must reregister within three months or risk discontinuation of its activity.
