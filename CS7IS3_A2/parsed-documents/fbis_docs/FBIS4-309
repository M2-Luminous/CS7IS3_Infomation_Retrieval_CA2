That is the unanimous view of the two negotiating teams, who said that the question of national reconciliation will be dealt with at a latter date. Meanwhile, Dr. Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team, told journalists in Lusaka today that understanding has been reached with the regime regarding ministerial and provincial government posts. Valentim said UNITA has already agreed in principle with the portfolios offered to UNITA, namely the ministries of health, hotels, public works, and commerce as well as deputy minister posts. For a sound national reconciliation policy Dr. Valentim said UNITA has proposed to the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] that UNITA should govern Huambo and Benguela Provinces. He added that UNITA officials should serve as deputy ministers of interior and finance. Jorge Valentim said he was unaware of the proposals presented by the Luanda government emissaries who were in Lusaka recently. He said if there were any proposals, these were presented to the mediator. Meanwhile, the government negotiating team left for Luanda yesterday; the reason is not known.
