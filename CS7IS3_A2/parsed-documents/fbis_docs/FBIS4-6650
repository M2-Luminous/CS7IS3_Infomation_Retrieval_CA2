At a press conference after what she said was probably the last regular meeting of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, Kubota said the reported idea of such a post "is possible if the purpose is made clear." "That purpose isn't clear to me," said Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). But she added, "It may be possible. The economy is a broad field." The idea of a broadly defined economic affairs minister was reported in Tuesday's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, which quoted a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader. The party is headed by Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, believed to replace Hosokawa as premier. Kubota also said the economy "is going in a brighter direction" but repeated concern about such uncertainties as the high yen and the possible effects of drawn-out political turmoil on the budget. She said the economy is at "the most important point in trying to get to its feet." Kubota also said her Social Democratic Party should not agree to raising the consumption tax at the outset of coalition talks on a promised overhaul of Japan's tax system.
