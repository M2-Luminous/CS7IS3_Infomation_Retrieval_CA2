FBIS4-48584 "drafr099_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 22 May South African Press Review for 22 May MB2205141294 MB2205141294 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Land Deal -- "President Mandela has acknowledged his need to lean on the experience of Mr F W de Klerk and the Nationalists," however the "sly transfer of 1.2 million hectares" of land in KwaZulu/Natal to the Zulu king "serves as a warning: Mr Mandela had better be careful what lessons Mr de Klerk is permitted to pass on to the new South Africa," an editorial in Johannesburg's SUNDAY TIMES in English on 22 May on page 22 notes. While Mr de Klerk has denied "the transaction was sly," it was "his duty to announce to the public any transaction of this magnitude," "that he did not do so was contemptible, but, alas, all too typical of the wicked regime of the Nationalists." "The Nationalists have made an art form of looting by law," as "the country is drowning in debt, and people who helped run up that debt are leaving office as virtual millionares -- and returning to office." The "'experience' that the National Party brings to government: a contemptible value system, ruthless greed in the exploitation of pensions and public monies, and great skill at manipulating legalities to achieve tricky ends. The Zulu land deal is a typical example, and in defending it Mr de Klerk simply confirms the need for the new government to treat his 'experience' with care, lest it poison the entire administration sand defeat the democratic purposes of the new government." BEELD Reconstruction, Develoipment Program -- A doubly expensive RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] will not impress investors, is the reaction on a page 12 editorial in BEELD of 19 May in Afrikaans to reports that the ANC's estimation of the cost of the RDP has increased from 39 billion rands before the election to between 80 billion and 90 billion rands. "Such a radical modification of a program, which President Nelson Mandela has dubbed 'our economic Bible,' will cause people to wonder whether the new government realizes the realities of the country, and whether it will take the right decisions on that basis." "The ANC apparently has in its possession an unpublished report on the RDP in which key issues are hopefully handled. This report must be published as soon as possible." The editorial points out that possible investors in South Africa will hold their money back until they are satisfied that the government is able to manage the economy responsibly. The recent performance by the shares and capital markets, and the record weakening of the rand reflect the view of investors. "If the amount of the RDP has doubled within a matter of weeks, one wonders whether it will double a few times more in the future." Rwanda Decision -- A second editorial in the 19 May BEELD titled "South Africa Not Heading for Rwanda" commends the decision by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo that South Africa will not make troops available to the UN for peace operations in Rwanda. "It must be understood that the new government, now that South Africa is no longer a reject in the international arena, wants to do something in the short term to underline its new status and its leadership role in Africa. But such actions will have to be carefully and thoroughly assessed first, because the disadvantages could easily outweigh the advantages considerably within a short space of time." "The very first priority is that the South African National Defense Force should become a solid, well oiled instrument capable of becoming a peaceful foreign policy instrument." ILANGA Get to work -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 19-21 May in a page 8 editorial says: "Now that we are steeped in this time of change in the entire country, including KwaZulu/Natal, everyone needs to undergo an attitude change, to realize that this time of change means buckling down to hard work in this country. It would be unfortunate to have people who think it all means getting laid back and doing nothing. On the contrary, this is the time for each and everyone to work harder than ever before in an effort to rebuilt our country. Now is the real start of the struggle for freedom. Let the employees work harder now than before, the teacher teach with more dedication than ever, the nurse seek to give patients the best care possible. Let the scholar study harder than ever before. Whatever you find to do, do it to the best of your ability to raise the standard of the country and your own as well." "This time of change throws us the great challenge of standing firm to fight the enemies of freedom of both black and white. These enemies are poverty, disease and ignorance. Let us all mobilize to rebuild our country."
