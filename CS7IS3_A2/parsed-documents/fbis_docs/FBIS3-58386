Launching the appeal, the federation said the funds are needed to plan and finance humanitarian aid to some 13.2 million people in 46 countries. "With the end of the Cold War disasters of all kinds have become more frequent and more complex, affecting a growing number of people whose already precarious situation gets worse each year," said Secretary-General Georges Weber. Europe and in particular the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus and states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union head the list of targets, requiring 200 million francs to aid 8.6 million people. In Africa the federation will need 90 million francs to finance its operations for three million people in 16 countries. "With this appeal we must address the daily needs of the victims of forgotten disasters -- disasters which are often more devastating, more long term and more related to violent conflict than natural disaster," said Stephen Davey, under-secretary general for operations.
