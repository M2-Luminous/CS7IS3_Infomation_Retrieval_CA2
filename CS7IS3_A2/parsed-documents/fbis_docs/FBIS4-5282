In particular, concerns about the government's handling of the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear inspection issue are all the more serious because this issue, in a sense, involves the cabinet's crisis management capabilities. Here, we would like to bring up a few measures that Japan may be expected to take in case the UN Security Council should decide on imposing economic sanctions. They are: suspension of remittances, trade control, control of exchanges, and actions taken to prevent maritime activities. The Remittance Issue The United States has severely criticized remittances from Japan to North Korea, maintaining the money "has been used to develop nuclear weapons." Reportedly, a total of 60-80 billion yen is remitted every year, but the actual details are unknown. It is stipulated in the Act on Control of Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade [ACFEFT] that payment can be prohibited "when it is deemed necessary to faithfully perform international treaties signed by our country or other international commitments." In practice, the act is implemented through the Ministry of Finance [MOF] issuing notifications on the basis of regulations on controlling foreign exchange. Moreover, even if these regulations are enforced, it will be very difficult to control remittance through third countries such as China. Regarding keitai-sokin [remittance by asking visitors to carry money into the country], it is said that "control cannot be effectively enforced unless visits are also prohibited" (stated by a senior MOF official). If the government should enforce stricter checking of Korean residents in Japan, there is a danger the issue may develop into a serious human rights issue. It has been firmly stated that enforcement of such regulations should be based on the "UN resolution." It has also been pointed out that if China should exercise its veto right, and if Japan, the United States, and the ROK should decide on imposing their own sanctions, "control would hardly be effective" (stated by a senior MOF official). Trade Control It is stipulated in the ACFEFT that "if it should be deemed that maintenance of international peace and security is hampered," the government can control foreign trade by authorizing the minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] to issue permits. MITI takes the position that "there are no legal impediments at all to imposing sanctions connected with trade." Should the United Nations decide on commodities on which sanctions will be imposed, the government will deal with the issue by enforcing the ordinance on controlling export and import trade. In 1993, Japan exported to the DPRK such commodities as textile products, vehicles, and household appliances, amounting to approximately $220 million, and imported from the DPRK such commodities as men's suits, mushrooms, and fish amounting to approximately $250 million. "Since both exports and imports amounted to a relatively small sum, it will not decisively damage the DPRK even if its contacts with Japan were cut off" (stated by a MITI source). Total DPRK exports reached $1.29 billion while imports reached $1.52 billion (according to an estimate of the Japan External Trade Organization [JETRO] in 1992). Major trade partners are China, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Its trade with the former Soviet Union, including crude oil, has dropped sharply since 1991. It has been noted that "since North Korea is suffering from a serious shortage of energy and foodstuffs, it would be a serious blow if sanctions were to be imposed on such commodities as oil and grains" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Since most of these commodities are imported through China, it is expected that the "efficiency of the sanctions will depend largely on how China deals with the issue." Control of Exchanges In 1992, 15,129 Korean residents in Japan reentered Japan after visiting North Korea, and 4,287 Japanese visited North Korea. Meanwhile, a total of 756 Koreans from North Korea visited Japan. Due to the Rangoon incident in 1983, as well as the Korean Airlines aircraft explosion accident in 1991, the government has taken the following measures: prohibition of contacts with North Korean diplomats, and of government officials' visits to North Korea; stricter examination of applications by North Korean civilians for entry into Japan; and prohibition of exchanges of flights by chartered planes between the two countries. The government is also studying the possibility of rejecting reentry to Japan of those Korean residents of Japan who are currently visiting their home towns in North Korea. However, it has been pointed out that "it will be against humanity to reject reentry to those Koreans who have resided in Japan as members of Japanese society." Therefore, "it will be impossible to prohibit Korean residents from visiting their home towns." Actions To Prevent Maritime Activities If the United Nations adopts a resolution that, for the purpose of ensuring economic sanctions, moves should be made to prevent maritime activities, it can be expected that the U.S. fleet and other units will request Japan's logistic support such as refueling. In this case, however, it is pointed out that "the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law should be revised so as to clearly state the SDF's authority" (according to a Defense Agency [DA] source). It is also anticipated that Japan and the United States may sign an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACAS)." Moreover, since no existing laws have any regulations on conducting maritime inspections, such as boarding investigations, it will be impossible to carry out such inspections "unless there should be legislation of new laws similar to the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Bill" (according to the same DA source). Nevertheless, in that case, it is feared the new law may be contrary to the Constitution, which prohibits acts of collective self-defense.
