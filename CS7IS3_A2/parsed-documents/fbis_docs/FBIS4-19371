This Turkish interest in Greek-Albanian relations should be noted because it could be useful in the interpretation of various problems or events, the spokesman said. Today, on the pretext of the latest developments in Albania, Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] also appeared provocative. Skopje attacked the Greek Government and described our country as a source of problems in the Balkans. Greece was also accused of seeking clashes between the Albanians of Skopje and Skopjeans.
