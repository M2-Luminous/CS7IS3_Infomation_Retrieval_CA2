FR941117-2-00152 FR941117-2-00102 Maritime Administration [Docket 5&hyph;913] SeaRiver Maritime, Inc.; Notice of Application for Approval To Transfer Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement, Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439 From the Bankruptcy Estate of Equity Carriers, Inc. and To Operate the S/R ``Mediterranean'' in the Foreign Trade With Operating-Differential Subsidy SeaRiver Maritime, Inc. (SeaRiver), by letter of September 29, 1994, advises that it has purchased Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement, Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439 from the bankruptcy estate of Equity Carriers, Inc., and that its purchase agreement with the bankruptcy estate is subject to: •Maritime Administration (MARAD) approval of the transfer of Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439, •MARAD obtaining approval of funding for at least one of the three operating subsidies comprising Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439 for the balance of the period of Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439, which expires on May 23, 2001, and •MARAD and SeaRiver agreement to necessary amendments to Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439. SeaRiver advises that the purpose of its petition to MARAD is to request approval of the transfer of Contract MA/MSB&hyph;439 to SeaRiver and to obtain confirmation that funding will be available for subsidizing the worldwide transportation of crude oil in bulk in the foreign commerce of the United States and between foreign ports on the S/R MEDITERRANEAN (Vessel), a 211,000 DWI tanker, which sustained bottom damage in 1989 when it ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound. Following completion of repairs in 1990 and due to an expected decline in ANS transportation requirements, the Vessel was temporarily placed in foreign service and renamed accordingly. Subsequently, under a provision of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the vessel was, and remains, prohibited from operating in Prince William Sound, thereby denying the Vessel from operating in the only Jones Act trade for which it is operationally and economically suited. SeaRiver advises that since September 1990, therefore, the Vessel has operated in foreign service. In the four years of foreign operations, the Vessel has completed more than 60 voyages primarily transporting mid-East crude oil to European discharge ports. SeaRiver states that the Vessel's performance in this service has been exemplary, and the Vessel and its crew are highly regarded in the many foreign ports which it has entered. Moreover, as the only modern U.S. tanker consistently operating abroad, the Vessel and her crew have demonstrated and fostered the best traditions of the American flag merchant marine. SeaRiver advises that the Vessel is competing against low-cost foreign-flag operators for foreign commerce in a depressed-rate trade, which is not covering operating costs of foreign flag tankers with significantly lower operating costs than U.S. flag vessels. However, the Vessel is precluded from operating in the domestically protected trade for which it was primarily built. SeaRiver advises that given the losses sustained and the prospect of continuing losses on the operation of the Vessel, SeaRiver has to consider alternatives including lay-up and sale. The other viable and beneficial alternative is the granting of operating-differential subsidy (ODS) to support continued operation of the Vessel in foreign commerce. SeaRiver states that it is wholly-owned affiliate of Exxon Corporation (Exxon). SeaRiver is a ``stand alone'' company which has the responsibility to the shareholders to ensure that SeaRiver maintains its leadership presence as a technically proficient, high quality owner/operator of U.S.-flag vessels transporting crude and petroleum products. SeaRiver states that providing ODS will ensure that this modern state-of-the-art and technologically advanced Vessel will continue to operate and will provide for continuing employment for about 50 skilled, dedicated American seafarers. SeaRiver states that it owns and operates oceangoing tankers, tugs/towboats and barges. It has an ocean fleet of 12 tankers totaling 1,200 thousand DWT and an inland fleet of 16 tugs and towboats and 50 barges. SeaRiver advises that its principal operations involve the transportation of crude oil, petroleum feedstocks, and finished petroleum and chemical products and tug assist service. SeaRiver's principal operations are listed below: •Alaskan crude from Valdez, Alaska, to U.S. west coast destinations; •Motor gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel, and other petroleum fuel products to U.S. ports from Baytown, Texas; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; •Lubricating oils, solvents, and other specialty products from Baytown and Baton Rouge to east coast and inland destinations;
