"The National Party is not the only party suffering because the ANC cannot control its supporters. It will also be interesting to see if Mr Mandela takes action against his supporters who don't heed his words. A large number of ANC supporters have been found guilty of various crimes, like smuggling weapons and murder, and no steps have yet been taken against them." He hoped to make known details of a pact with neighbouring "Frontline" states soon about arms smuggling into South Africa. "We are negotiating with Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho, and although these things take time we are making progress."
