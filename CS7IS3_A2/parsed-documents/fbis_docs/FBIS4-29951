The "deepening fluidity" in the political world touched off over whom to select as his successor has subsided for the time being through the birth of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. However, the signs of dissolution of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] facing the danger of split have not disappeared. Our present regime is like a patchwork in which pieces of cloth are coercively stitched together. Thread frays show horribly, and tears and rips are likely to appear here and there before long. The following is a report on the present political world pivoting around the new regime. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa again did not appear. The time was 1500 on 22 April. The place was a large lecture hall on the fifth floor of the No. 1 Annex to the lower house. A press conference was held there to announce the decision to support Mr. Hata. Seated on a chair reserved for Mr. Ozawa was Secretary Moriyoshi Sato. He was there in place of Mr. Ozawa. He said: "I was in a sauna bath when there was a sudden call asking me to `be here because Mr. Ozawa needs a member to accompany him.' Why is it I who should be here?" A very similar scene was also seen at a press conference held in June 1993 at Akasaka Prince Hotel to announce the start of Shinseito. Mr. Ozawa hammers out policies while Mr. Hata, who is good at putting up a front, is used for performances. This Shinseito strategy is seen transparently through these events. "Among Japanese politicians, on whom should we rely?" asked James Foster, councilor in charge of economic affairs in the U.S. Embassy, when he was visiting the office of former Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda in the Members' Office Building of the lower house at 1600 on 3 April after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken off. Former Justicie Minister Gotoda answered immediately that "it would be Ozawa." Mr. Foster responded with a nod, saying that "that is also what I have thought." It is becoming a matter of common knowledge that the United States intends to make Mr. Ozawa the contact for behind-the-scenes negotiations. Over the automobile issue which is said to symbolize Japan-U.S. economic friction, it is said that Mr. Ozawa is continuing negotiations below the surface of the water, using transport bureaucrats. According to a person concerned, talks are frequently held between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale and Mr. Ozawa. There is a person who foresaw close Hata-Ozawa relations a fairly long time ago. On the afternoon of 20 March 1992, about 30 people concerned with the political world crowded into a sickroom of Showa University Hospital. The sickroom was filled to overflowing, and the visitors even crowded the hallway. At bedside was Mr. Hata who kept placing his hand on the left breast of a man lying in his sickbed. At 1555, Mr. Hata confirmed the cessation of the man's heartbeat. The man was Mr. Takashi Yamasaki (then 61). He served two generations of the Hata family--Mr. Hata and his father, the late Bushiro Hata--for over 30 years. A person close to Mr. Yamasaki says: "Yamasaki handled every minor detail in the Hata office. I think that, but for him, there would never be today's Hata." He worked as chairman of the Society of Secretaries belonging to the Tanaka faction's Mokuyo Club and the Takeshita faction's Keiseikai. He was a secretary of great caliber who is said to have often managed elections for entire factions. During his lifetime, Mr. Yamasaki used to tell his friends that "it is my dream to make Hata a prime minister." However, when questioned, "Do you really think he will be able to become prime minister?" he is said to have replied: "I might be expecting too much. He might be a lower house speaker type." As to Mr. Ozawa, he used to say that "he is a man with terrible guts." However, there is also a possibility that the relationship of the two may suffer a subtle change through Hata's assumption of the office of prime minister. At a session of the upper house Budget Committee on 10 December 1992, the face of Mr. Hata, who kept answering questions with a gentle look, suddenly flushed. This happened when Mr. Yoshinori Yoshioka (Japan Communist Party [JCP]) queried him about Mr. Ozawa, saying that Ozawa had a hand in secret talks of the GATT's new multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) on opening the rice market. Mr. Hata stressed the difference of views between the two, saying "I wonder why Mr. Ozawa met with someone like that and how he could have useful talks." Hata himself once said that "Ozawa is a scriptwriter and I am an actor." However, he recently confided to his close friend: "In fact, we do not meet each other very often. We are both busy." Dogged always by the shadow of Mr. Ozawa, the Hosokawa cabinet was criticized as a "regime with a deepening dual structure." What path will the Hata cabinet choose? [24 Apr 94 p 23] [Text] "All were well-worn bills tied up in a bundle with rubber bands. We received them twice--10 million yen each time." This is what a secretary to a freshman Diet member who received monetary assistance from the party in the July 1993 general election confided to people close to him. Needless to say, the head of Shinseito is Tsutomu Hata. At a session of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform held on 5 November 1993, Hidekatsu Yoshii (JCP), a committee member, asked: "You are surely saying that no other than officially approved expenses (5 million yen) were handed, are you not?" "Yes, I am," answered [then] Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata. Shinseito had announced that it pegged on its own the officially approved expenses at 5 million yen. Testimony by candidates' secretaries indicated that, other than this amount, there were also 15 million yen of election funds. The party had 69 candidates. Yoshii, the committee member, queried further, asking: "The total comes up to more than 1 billion yen (at an offhand estimate). What is the source of the funds?" Mr. Hata wholly denied his allegations. Now that he has become the prime minister, he will undoubtedly be asked to explain one more time on this issue. "Hata B"... In March 1993, MAINICHI SHIMBUN obtained a list of politicians receiving contributions from Shimizu Corp., a major general construction firm (general contractor), and Hata's name was on the list. Recipients of 10 million yen belonging to the highest SA [special A] rank were only former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Among those listed in the A rank deserving of 5 million yen were former Prime Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone and, along with them, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. Those belonging to the B rank like Hata were listed as 3 million yen recipients. A Hata aide said that "the issue would be investigated" when the list was made public, but no reply has yet been made. General Contractors' Contributions to Hata and Ozawa Shrouded in Mystery Monetary scandals related to Mr. Hata have not surfaced despite his past affiliations with the LDP's Tanaka faction and Keiseikai, which could not rid themselves of the collusion between money and politics. However, we see a sign that the LDP's zoku Dietmen system, which has been called the hotbed of the party's collusion with business circles, is even reviving within Shinseito which has grabbed power [zoku--a group of Diet members who exercise in a particular field policymaking expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy deliberation committee]. Early this year when the Special Investigation Department of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office was conducting its final probe into the involvement of the political world as part of the so-called general contractor graft scandal, the department summoned former leaders and executives of Hazama Corp. (main office at Minato ward, Tokyo) to hear their testimonies in strict secrecy. They were summoned because among data confiscated by the Special Investigation Department from the Hazama main office were records indicating that an amount of 10 million yen was disbursed to Mr. Ozawa's camp in the middle of December 1991. Ozawa's camp totally denies receiving the contribution. In addition, it was also discovered that Ozawa had received a donation of 5 million yen from Kajima Corp. At a press conference on 8 November 1993, answering a question if the donation did not conflict with the Regulation of Money for Political Activities Act, he simply said that "the donation was handled legitimately" and did not mention a bit about the way the donation was dealt with, saying that "it is not legally asked" to specify handling methods. Shinseito lower house member Toshihiro Nikai is said to be Ozawa's confidant. In the "National Association of Tourist Organizations" (Minato ward, Tokyo) made up of 5,200 medium-sized and small tourist companies, you will see calendars carrying a big picture of Mr. Nikai hung up in every quarter. When Mr. Nikai became parliamentary vice minister for transport in August 1993, he resigned as chairman of the association. However, he recently became the association's "honorary chairman" on 18 April. The reason for his earlier resignation was that "it is against the cabinet rules on concurrent positions for him--the Transport Ministry's second-highest leader--to additionally become the head of an organization which is under the ministry's supervision" (the Transport Ministry's Tourism Department). However, putting a generous construction on the rules, a decision was later made that "it is all right if the [additional] post is served without pay and without the right of decision" (the same source). Mr. Nikai inaugurated the "100-Person Committee Considering Japan's Tourism" in February. He enrolled into the membership the top-class organizations under the Transport Ministry's supervision such as the JR [Japan Railways] companies, major travel agencies, and the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. He placed the committee's Secretariat in the National Association of Tourist Organizations. The April issue of the association organ, in its last page, carries a colored ad by an airline company. An association worker admits that "airline companies can hardly refuse to place an ad because the parliamentary vice minister for transport is the honorary chairman of this organization." The rules on concurrent positions remain ambiguous. On 24 June 1993, the day after Shinseito was inaugurated, Mr. Hata attended a party held by the party's Diet members in the New Otani Hotel. Faced with a barrage of questions from reporters as to such an old money-collecting method used since the LDP, he said in a harsh tone that "you are always talking about such things, and that is why you are dead wrong." An LDP member is heard asking to himself in a whisper: "We were criticized about the relations between politics and money, and what makes them different from us?" [25 Apr 94 p 23] [Text] "I did not expect him to go so far as to call it a `war of aggression.'" On 10 August 1993, year, speaking at his first press conference since his inauguration, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated that the Pacific War was a "war of aggression," thereby becoming the first prime minister to do so. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata disclosed: "I proposed to Mr. Hosokawa that he show clearly that Japan has searched its soul deeply over its past and that it intends to tell right from wrong in a clear-cut manner in this regard for a fresh start. But I did not expect him to say that much..." On the anniversary of the end of the war five days later, Mr. Hata did not make an appearance at the Yasukuni Shrine in Kudan, Tokyo. However, he already had paid a visit to the shrine on the previous day, shunning the public eye. When Hata attended a national memorial ceremony for the war dead, he was unexpectedly asked by reporters about his visit to the shrine. Taken by surprise, he asked back in a harsh tone: "How did you know that?" When asked, "Did you make the visit as a private individual or a public figure?" he declined to answer, saying that "this matter becomes an issue in foreign countries because you ask such questions." Hata cannot become as reformist as Hosokawa on how to view the Pacific War. He is the type who is "everybody's friend." With this nature, how is he going to cope with the peace and defense issue on which the people are widely divided? Shinseito which heads the ruling coalition has inaugurated the Society for Visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata and others attended the shrine's Spring Festival on the morning of 21 April. Shinseito is thus showing its unpainted face as a "conservative party." Until his secession from the LDP, Tsutomu Hata also worked as chairman of the "Society of Diet Members Who Visit Yasukuni Shrine Together" (membership: 210 lower house and upper house members). A commencement ceremony was held in the National Defense Academy (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) on 20 March. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi of Shinseito delivered an address. In contrast to Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's stress on the "construction of a substantial nation," Director General Aichi emphasized the Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ogawa-style theory of the state, saying that "we are asked to fulfill the responsibility and role commensurate with our international status." A leading Defense Agency official makes the following remark in this connection: "Two days before the commencement ceremony, Mr. Aichi took a look at the draft of the address Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura was scheduled to make, and then he himself composed his speech as director general on the manuscript paper we provided for him." "We will be unable to take any step unless we prepare amendments to some domestic laws in the form of emergency defense legislation." This is what Mr. Ozawa said at a series of meetings attended by delegates of ruling coalition parties. Though deleted later, the term "collective measures" which reminds us of the "right of collective self-defense" was also incorporated into a draft agreement at one time. Some expressions [in the agreement] were corrected in the face of resistance by the SDPJ, which asked, "Do you all mean to say that you do not need both the Constitution and the SDPJ?" Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said: "We carried our point after all, and there is no room for interpreting any items agreed on as conducive to emergency defense legislation." However, other ruling coalition leaders show a cold response, saying that "there is no change in substance." The prime minister cannot escape the criticism that he is performing only for show; nevertheless, he made the "announcement on the war of aggression" and delivered his speech in ordinary, casual suits at a Self-Defense Forces military parade, thereby bringing the people to keenly feel a stream of change from the LDP position on the security and defense issue. However, Shinseito led by Mr. Ozawa appears to be pursuing a "major country" policy line more than the LDP regime. How will Mr. Hata steer the ship of state? His longtime friend Takashi Kosugi, an LDP lower house member, discloses: "His theory of the state is not clear in outline. He lends his ear to various opinions in a flexible manner, but he does not make self-assertions. It might be said that he goes with the general trend of the times. After all, he might follow the way Ozawa thinks. In this respect, I feel slightly uneasy." Frays of patches show horribly in the coalition government as in a patchwork finished poorly, and such a coalition government is to make a start on 25 April.
