FR941003-2-00081 FR941003-2-00048 [Docket No. 50&hyph;440] The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and, Toledo Edison Company; Exemption I The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and, Toledo Edison Company (the licensees) hold Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;58, which authorizes operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), Unit No. 1. The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. This facility is a boiling water reactor located on the shore of Lake Erie in Lake County, Ohio, approximately 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, and approximately 23 miles southwest of Ashtabula, Ohio. II Subsection (a) of 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality Accident Requirements,'' requires that each licensee authorized to possess special nuclear material shall maintain in each area where such material is handled, used, or stored, an appropriate criticality monitoring system. In accordance with Subsection (a)(1) of 10 CFR 70.24, coverage of all such areas at PNPP, Unit No. 1, shall be provided by two criticality detectors. However, exemptions may be requested pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24(d), provided that the licensee believes that good cause exists for the exemption. In particular, Regulatory Guide 8.12, Revision 2, ``Criticality Accident Alarm System,'' states that it is appropriate to request an exemption from 10 CFR 70.24 if an evaluation determines that a potential for criticality does not exist, as for example where geometric spacing is used to preclude criticality. By letter dated February 28, 1992, the license requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24. A previous exemption from the provisions of 10 CFR 70.24 for the storage of special nuclear material, including reactor fuel assemblies (maximum amount of 2,602 kg of U&hyph;235 in uranium enriched to no more than 3.00 weight percent (w/o)), was granted to PNPP in NRC Material License No. SNM&hyph;1928. The materials license was issued on March 7, 1985, and expired upon conversion of the construction permit to an operating license on November 13, 1986. The bases for the current exemption request is the same as for the original 1985 request. Specifically, the licensees proposed to handle and store unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building in the new fuel pool without having a criticality monitoring system with two separate criticality detectors as required by 10 CFR 70.24. The bases for the exemption is that the potential for accident critically is precluded because of the geometric spacing of fuel in the storage pool and administrative controls imposed in fuel handling procedures from the time the fuel is removed from approved shipping containers, until it is placed in specially designed storage racks. Administrative control encompass placing the assemblies in the fuel inspection stand, receipt inspection activities, and lifting and placement of the assemblies into specified locations into the new fuel storage vaults. Design of the new fuel racks precludes criticality, i.e., an effective multiplication factor of 0.95 or less in the normal dry condition or abnormal completely water flooded condition. Criticality during optimal moderation (foam, small droplets, spray, or fogging) is precluded by storing new fuel assemblies in the new fuel vaults in alternate rows and columns. Administrative controls will prevent placement of each fuel assembly in adjacent storage cells. Restrictions on this exemption ensure that personnel are trained, equipment is operable, an assembly storage plan is developed, reviewed, and approved, and verification is undertaken by the Reactor Engineer or licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the completion of each fuel assembly transfer to ensure criticality is precluded. These restrictions are listed in the enclosure as items 1, 2, 3, and 4. Restriction 5 requires performing and maintaining criticality analyses documenting that the maximum effective multiplication factor for each fuel assembly does not exceed 0.95 when optimally moderated and fully reflected by water. Restriction 6 limits maximum fuel enrichment to 5 w/o of U&hyph;235 independent of the results of analyses performed in accordance with Restriction 5. Fuel assemblies, when stored in their shipping containers, shall be stacked no more than three containers high (Restriction 7). No more than three fuel assemblies shall be outside their shipping containers or storage racks at any one time (Restriction 8). The minimum edge-to-edge distance between the group of three fuel assemblies and all other fuel assemblies shall be 12 inches (Restriction 9). Based upon the information provided, there is reasonable assurance that unirradiated fuel will remain subcritical because of the new fuel pool design and administrative controls. The special circumstances for granting an exemption to 10 CFR 70.24 are met because criticality is precluded with the present design configuration, Technical Specification requirements, and the restrictions placed upon the exemption. Therefore, the staff concludes that the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24 for unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building is acceptable and should be granted. This exemption is subject to the restrictions listed in the enclosure. III Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24, an exemption is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section II above from 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality Accident Requirements,'' such that the licensee is exempt from providing two criticality detectors. This exemption is subjection to the restrictions in the enclosure. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 47363). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, the 26th day of September 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Jack W. Roe, Director, Division of Reactor Projects III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24343 Filed 9&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
