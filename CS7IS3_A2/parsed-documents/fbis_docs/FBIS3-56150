"The meeting of the Russian and American presidents began in an atmosphere of genuine partnership," TRUD writes, commenting on the Moscow talks. An atmosphere of confidence was established right from the beginning of the official visit, the newspaper points out further, quoting Bill Clinton as saying that it is necessary for the two countries to cooperate for the sake of Russia's future, the future of the whole world. The essence of the cooperation is in the creation of a new security structure in Europe, as well as the advance of democratic values and a free economic system, the U.S. President said. Commenting on the results of Clinton's consultative meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on intercontinental ballistic missiles, the newspaper writes that "the meeting set the beginning of a new stage in the Ukrainian-American relations and opened up the door to new forms of cooperation in the sphere of economy, politics and security. Ukraine's support for the `partnership for peace' initiative gives a chance to it to start more concrete cooperation with the NATO countries in the military sphere and integrate more deeply in the European structures." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about various aspects of international security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, that were discussed at the meeting. According to Vyachselav Kostiov, press secretary of the Russian president, the sides expressed the opinion that nothing is possible in the world without Russia and the United States. It follows from that statement that "Russia has retained the status of a great power, and not only a nuclear power, and the west, in the person of Clinton, recognised it without hesitation." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes on the same subject that "the consolidation of Russia's greatness should be the main objective of the economic and socio-political reform, now under way in Russia". This objective is easier to attain by acting jointly with other countries, and close Russian-American cooperation, built on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual benefit, would play an important role in it. So far as European security is concerned, which was also discussed during the talks, previously the problem consisted in bringing down the level of military rivalry and preventing a nuclear catastrophe, while now the point at issue is joint, coordinated efforts, aimed at maintaining world stability, the newspaper writes. Commenting on the meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the words of Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State Committee for the Defence Industries of the Russian Federation, who said that "the trend of passing over from open technological rivalry to technological partnership has become clear." He said that 108 joint project on a wide range of scientific and technological problems are now being implemented. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov described the results of the talks as the opening up of a new stage in Russian-American partnership, while "humanitarian assistance will be replaced by a package of measures, aimed at the revival of the Russian economy," IZVESTIYA writes. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and PRAVDA writes briefly about the most important moments of the first and second rounds of the Russian-American summit talks. So far as the second important topic is concerned --meetings of the two chambers of the new Russian parliament -- the newspapers focus their attention on the election of Vladimir Shumeyko to the post of chairman of the Federation Council. According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the 98 votes that he got "reflect with mathematical accuracy the official position of the senators: 65 of them are heads of local administration of subjects of the Russian Federation, 11 are staff members of the president's administration, 15 are staff members of the administration of the government and another 15 are regional officials of a lower level." Only two people who voted for Shumeyko do not belong to this administrative team, the newspaper points out. According to the author of the article, if the new chairman really wants the Federation Council to be an efficient body, he should offer posts of deputy chairmen to representatives of the opposition. "Actually, he is facing the dilemma: either obedient deputy chairman along with the obedient Federation Council, or vice versa," the newspaper points out. According to IZVESTIYA, the election of Shumeyko to the new post means that the president and the prime minister got whom they wanted on the post of chairman of the Federation Council, and the senators, who depend on the executie authorities, got the chairman whom the president and the prime minister wanted. Commenting on that fact, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes that members of the Federation Council can hardly be suspected of "too warm feelings for Shumeyko." They voted for him, because, irrespective of all his defects, he is "the president's man" and can help maintain cooperation with the Moscow power structures. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA described the lower chamber of the new parliament, the State Duma, as a rather ornamental institution, deprived of any real power, while IZVESTIYA points to its "chaotic" character, judging by the first days of its work. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which deals with Russia's military doctrine, its foreign and domestic policy. "The course of the country's foreign policy and security is set by the president of the Russian Federation. This fact, recorded in the new democratic constitution, reliably protects it from the influence of national-extremism. Basically, the course remained unchanged: it is aimed at the development of partner-like, good neighbourly relations with the rest of the world and continues to be open and predictable," Kozyrev wrote. "The military doctrine of the Russian Federation, approved by the Russian president early in November, is also a guarantee of stability and consistent character of the country's domestic and foreign policy. Together with the conceptual framework for foreign policy, it will be included in the conceptual framework for security, which is being drafted now," he pointed out.
