The sources said a broader reshuffle would not likely take place until after the European Parliament elections in mid-June and Greece hands over the rotating, six-month European Union presidency to Germany. A reshuffle would be aimed at boosting some aspects of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement's [PASOK] policies which, while not considered failures, have not proceeded at the requisite pace for PASOK's broad reform programme. But other analysts say new amendments to the party's charter adopted at this month's PASOK congress which stipulate which nine Executive Committee members may and which nine may not simultaneously hold cabinet posts, could precipitate a reshuffle before the June elections. They add that while this could in some respects hamper the final month of the Greek EU presidency it could on the other hand accelerate implementation of the government's programmes.
