Rashid said that they discussed the developments in Yemen. He praised the efforts being made by Egypt and President Husni Mubarak to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and to reach a cease-fire. On the failure of the UN envoy's mission, Rashid said that the UN envoy had made good efforts and put forward certain proposals. Rashid noted that had they been adopted by the United Nations and the rest of the Arab countries, they would have helped to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and bring about a cease-fire. He said that he and the UN envoy discussed quick ways to form a military committee, which previously supervised the armed forces' movements. He said they also discussed expanding the committee by adding certain Arab parties to it. Rashid noted that the fighting in Yemen hinges on the continuation of the rebellion against the constitutional legitimacy, this group's submission to the legitimacy, and ending the rebellion. He said: Despite this, we are ready for a cease-fire and will contribute to forming a committee to monitor it. Responding to a question that unity cannot be imposed by force, Rashid said that the unity was not imposed by force, but was established peacefully and democratically, and two referendums were held on the unity. He pointed out that what is now taking place in Yemen is an attempt to impose secession by force and we are defending and safeguarding this unity. He said that he asked 'Amr Musa for Egypt to continue its important and good role in limiting the Yemeni people's suffering and pain.
