In accordance with the statistics, the total amount of purchased commodities in 1993 reached 10.2 billion yuan, a 20-percent increase over the previous year. The amount of commodities sold in 1993 was 11.6 billion yuan, a 16.5-percent increase over the previous year. The commercial system has comprehensively fulfilled its goal set for 1993. In light of the goal set by this term of the government to "achieve great economic development in three years and enter a higher stage of economic development in five years," the commercial system has conscientiously carried out its tasks. In the past year, it has overfulfilled its assigned goals in four areas: Direct retail sales increased by 16.8 percent; after subtracting for policy factors, actual profits reached 43.46 million yuan; more than 1,300 small state-owned enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of the total; and 10 large commercial networks, including the Shangzhidu and Wuhu commercial buildings which are to be completed before the end of this term of the government, began construction. Reform of the commercial system is deepening. First of all, more than 600 large and medium-sized commercial enterprises have consolidated and improved their deregulation reforms and have changed their management mechanisms, thus accounting for more than 70 percent of all enterprises. Second, the reform of the shareholding system has taken an initial step. Eight enterprises have been approved to implement the shareholding system (the Hefei and Wuhu Department Stores have been reorganized into a limited liability stock company). Another 18 companies are now being set up. Third, enterprises are accelerating their structural reform. The provincial commercial system has established seven enterprise groups, merged seven companies, and auctioned off 18 small enterprises. Fourth, according to the principle of restructuring, changing product lines, and leasing out, more than 1,300 state-owned small enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of all enterprises in the same category. Fifth, the reform of commercial administration has been further deepened, thus paving the way for the reform of government organizations. Marked achievements have been made in building commercial networks. In recent years, localities in the province have seized opportunities and have accelerated the construction of commercial networks. They have tried to pool funds through many channels and in various forms including loans, issuing bonds, the holding and buying of shares, and joint ventures. In 1993, the provincial commercial system has built, rebuilt, and enlarged more than 900 commercial networks, with a total floor space of more than 900,000 square meters. The total investment in the project has reached 500 million yuan. Among these commercial networks, 18 have more than 10,000 square meters of floor space. The provincial commercial system has focused on stabilizing the market and bringing into play its role as the main channel. In light of the relatively great changes in the market since last August and particularly during last November, the provincial commercial department has concentrate its efforts on commodity supplies for festival seasons. At the beginning of last December, the department began to arrange commodity supplies for festival seasons. In mid-December, the department held a meeting attended by directors of commercial bureaus at the prefecture and city level and set concrete requirements for arranging the market supplies for the Spring Festival. On the eve of the 1994 Spring Festival, the department sent 12 people to inspect the work in four areas. All localities actively organized commodity resources to ensure the supply by the market. They also adopted many price-control measures, including limiting the prices of important commodities and goods in great demand, supervising and controlling price fluctuations, and establishing a reserve system. The situation of market supplies was rapidly improved, thus bringing into play the state-owned commercial sector's role as a main channel.
