According to a report yesterday by Albanian Television, Berisha, who is visiting Bucharest, told reporters that the meeting in Zurich between foreign ministers Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi was successful because both sides showed they wanted to solve the crisis. He suggested another meeting be held in Tirana to continue the talks and resolve the problems. He said the meeting's aim will be to smooth bilateral relations. The Albanian president did not say when this meeting would be held. It is significant that many people in Tirana wonder what happened to cause Berisha's sudden turn.
