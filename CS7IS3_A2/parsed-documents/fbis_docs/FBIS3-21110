Depreciation and specific contingency provisions account for Fr250 million of those Fr300 million. Eurocopter's turnover comes to Fr 10.21 billion, down 10.5 percent over 1992. Executive board co-president Siegfried Sobotta attributes the sales slump to a decrease in receivables from production aircraft deliveries, which plummeted to 159 in 1993 from 211 in 1992. No one expects those deliveries to start creeping upward again before mid-1995. Sobotta also sees the collapse as the result of a "sharply deteriorated non-military customer base", matched by a decline in service sales. "To adapt to this tough economic situation, we have had to implement measures that include staff cutbacks (a total of 1,060) in France and Germany, reduced working hours, and lower stock levels to bring operating costs under control," Siegfried Sobotta goes on to explain. "1993 was a challenge way beyond anything we could have imagined," admits Jean-Francois Bigay. "Both the civil and military markets were disastrous--a level unlike anything we've seen since 1965-67." Despite all these woes, results are encouraging. "We took orders for Fr9.32 billion, including Fr4 billion for maintenance and Fr3.5 for new aircraft. New airplane orders totaled 166 against 159 in 1992, despite a tough market." Moreover, the new orders involved higher tonnages: 43 Cougar/Super Pumas against only 10 in 1992. Market penetration results are also encouraging. Indeed, Eurocopter has increased its civil market share to 54 percent of the value of registered aircraft (compared to 51.5 percent in 1992), and 60 percent of the value of registered craft in the parapublic sector. The group has also regained its pre-Gulf War military market share, or 24 percent of the value of aircraft, compared to 7.5 percent in 1992 (figures apply to the open military market, outside the CIS and USA). Nearly all these market shares have been won through exports: 95 percent of the new helicopters are registered outside France and Germany. This worries Jean-Francois Bigay, who notes that "Too high a rate of exports makes a company fragile; [...] we need national orders." In any event, "1994 will be another rough year for the group," Jean-Francois Bigay continues. "Although orders are up, the effect will not be felt until 1995, and we expect another 10-percent decline in turnover." "1994 will be quite a challenge for us," continues Bigay. "Eurocopter will be consolidating to insure a calmer and more active future for itself... We will need support from every quarter to shore up our export position in 1994, while winning more national orders." Eurocopter's objective is to cover 100 percent of the civil market's needs, and 80 percent of the military market's needs by century's end. No layoffs are planned for 1994. This is another challenge the helicopter manufacturer has set for itself, one that depends on its hopes to capture national orders within the next six months. Boxed Material: NH-90 Opts for the RTM322 Technical progress on the Tiger has been smooth, and the NH-90 transport helicopter program has taken a significant step forward with the final selection of several technical options. --Engineers have chosen the RTM322 turbine of Rolls-Royce, Turbomeca, MTU, and Piaggio. It will be developed and rated for use in the naval and land versions of the NH90, while General Electric's and Fiat Avio's T700 will be partially rated ("brought to technical maturity") as a second engine, ostensibly to equip Italy's 260 craft. --Program planners no longer consider the rear ramp for the French Army's tactical transport version an optional feature. Instead they are taking it into account as they develop the helicopter. --The naval version's carrying capacity will be expanded to include 700-kg missiles. The other programs--the civil EC-120 and EC-135 and the military Tiger, which is beginning tests of its navigational and weapons systems--are moving ahead as planned. But the situation in Russia is at a virtual standstill. The proposed joint venture to develop the Mi-38 with Mil "has made little progress organizationally", according to Sigfried Sobotta.
