Speaking to journalists upon his return from Warsaw, Andrejcak said that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili left the meeting convinced that "it was important and advantageous" for them to support cooperation with the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland). The Slovak Republic supports cooperation aimed at ensuring better security and prosperity, Andrejcak said. He said so-called "contact groups" would be established after Clinton's Prague visit to study possibilities and ways for further cooperation. The next meeting of Visegrad defence ministers will be held in Bratislava, he added. He said Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys's absence from the meeting would not hamper cooperation within the Visegrad Group, adding that the deputy Czech defence minister, on behalf of the Czech Republic, voiced apprehensions over the possibility of the institutionalisation of the Visegrad Group that, Andrejcak said, was not being considered by anyone. The participants in the Warsaw meeting discussed the American Partnership for Peace initiative, which offers them closer military links with NATO.
