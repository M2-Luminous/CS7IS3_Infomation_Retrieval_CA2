The following is the full text of the circular: The world's current high and new technology development keeps on changing and international competition in science and technology is intensifying. If we do not take firm measures to equip our party members and cadres with modern scientific and technological knowledge as well as upgrade the level of the entire Chinese people in scientific education, it is impossible to gain the initiative in international competition. Therefore, the party Central Committee has decided that while earnestly studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the socialist market economic theory and fundamental knowledge, all party comrades must earnestly study modern scientific and technological knowledge. In studying modern scientific and technological knowledge, it is necessary to study the Marxist fundamental viewpoint on science and technology. In particular, it is necessary to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important expositions, firmly establish the concept of "science and technology is the primary productive force," and more conscientiously implement the principle of "economic construction cannot do without science and technology, and scientific and technological work must be geared to economic construction." It is necessary to realistically shift economic construction and social development onto the path of relying on scientific and technological progress and upgrading workers' quality. It is necessary to become more familiar with the fundamental knowledge of modern science and technology, understand current the revolutionary trend in the world's new technology, comprehend the general pattern of scientific and technological progress, and upgrade cadres' quality in scientific education as a whole. We must conscientiously apply scientific and technological theory, knowledge, and methods to observe and handle problems, as well as continue to scientifically upgrade our policy-making capability and work level. "Fundamental Knowledge in Modern Science and Technology," a book proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and compiled under the leadership of the State Science Commission, discusses in a simple and profound manner new knowledge and progress in the world's scientific and technological development, as well as our countermeasures. It can be used as a rudimentary textbook for cadres to study modern scientific and technological knowledge. Party committees at all levels must outline specific plans for cadres to study modern scientific and technological knowledge, and conduct regular supervision and inspection. Leading cadres must take an exemplary lead by studying the subject well. Party schools at all levels and cadre training institutions of various categories must incorporate the teaching of modern scientific and technological knowledge into cadres' training plans. They should closely cooperate with science commissions and science associations at all levels as well as local scientific research institutes and institutes of higher learning to effectively plan for teaching courses and to select the teaching force. While concentrating on self-study, working cadres should avail themselves of flexible, varied, and effective study and guidance. Press and propaganda departments should coordinate closely with cadres' study by increasing their publicity of science and technology as well as vigorously popularizing modern scientific and technological knowledge.
