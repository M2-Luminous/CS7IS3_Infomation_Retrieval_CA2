Official authorities hastened to contain the popular reaction and called for self-restraint and responsible behavior. Popular reaction was far ahead of the authorities. The masses have maintained sincere feelings and a sound awareness for 42 years. Whenever the Jews have dealt their barbaric blows to Muslims, the main preoccupation of the governments has not been to react to these attacks but to contain the mass anger and control public unrest. This continued until the regimes' policies overcame the reaction of the man in the street. The majority of the people thus began to pay scant attention to the violation of the nation's dignity and the desecration of its sacred places. Many of the older generation who are suffering from repression and pain yearn for the 1950's, when popular awareness was boiling from the Gulf to the ocean and the streets were erupting with demonstrations. These were the people's recourse for their political impotence and a necessary venting of their emotions over the wounds to their dignity and their defeat. But regrettably, yesterday's vigor no longer exists. Many of the patriotic and national forces have retreated and lost their zeal. Only the Islamic forces have remained in the arena, and they are being pursued and attacked by the authorities and cursed by the international forces, which accuse them of terrorism and of being opposed to peace. The extent of the anger that cannot be kept pent up is evinced by the extent of the official organs' efforts to consolidate the defeat and present a fait accompli. This was clearly shown in everyone's desire to continue the peace process and their calls to protect it from collapse. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is the bloody fruit of a peace resulting from a defeatist and capitulationist mentality. What peace is this they are talking about and what is its philosophy if its price is more killings, destruction, massacres, and violations of Palestinian human rights? How can there be coexistence when the Jews are acting according to the Talmud, which advocates the annihilation of the Muslims and legitimizes the shedding of their blood? The Zionist concept of peace is the peace of the Jews and their security, not peace for the Palestinians and their recovery of their lands. What the international and regional capitals are saying about peace is only a trick to defuse popular anger and to calm the hearts that have been shaken by this barbaric crime. The hurried U.S. call for the resumption of the peace talks in Washington and everyone's eagerness to blame the incident on sick madmen suffering from psychological complexes are only designed to justify the logic of the false peace, while asserting that this peace will solve our problems, make everyone happy, and restore normality. But this crime indicates something completely different. Its planners chose to carry it out in a sacred place and at a holy time in a clear indication of the essence and core of the conflict. It is a conflict between two systems and civilizations, one divine and the other earthly, one that embodies harmony with what God wants and the other hostile to God and propagating discrimination and the inequality of peoples. The Zionist Jews' concept of security demands nothing less than the exclusion and annihilation of the Muslim Palestinians and depriving them of the right to life and to their land. Hence, the logic of confrontation must take account of the real Zionist objectives. No understanding can be reached with a criminal enemy through the logic of the defeated peace. Real, practical action that deprives the Zionists of their security and safety is the only possible reply that can restore a balance to the conflict formula. Indifference, laxity, and dependence on negotiations will not restore wasted dignity or lost rights. The blood of innocent Palestinians shed in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is merely the price for the ostrich policy that is pursued in the region in regard to the criminal enemy. If Muslims were in the habit of returning blow for blow, the Zionists would not have been so confident that they could commit their crimes so easily. There is only one logic that the nation should follow undeviatingly in its struggle with the enemies: namely, the logic of steadfastness, resistance, and escalation of the confrontation, not withdrawal and retreat. Retreat has always paved the way for the enemies to commit more crimes. The Muslims have had enough retreats and humiliation and everyone should now shout for revenge. Let the secularists and pragmatists stop offering their advice and logic, which have only compounded the nation's humiliation and degradation.
