Accompanied by officials from the Bangladesh Rural Development Bureau (BRDB) and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Xujiang, the CPC delegation visited the cooperative known as the Digirchala Women's Cooperative Society. The cooperative, which used to be a village with 200 households, is one of the 4,000 such bodies organized by the BRDB throughout the country. During the trip, the Chinese visitors were warmly received by a group of women from the cooperative. According to the women villagers, after setting up the cooperative in 1984, they have no longer merely depended on their husbands to support the families. Since then, they have been engaged in raising poultry, cattle and goats as well as fishery, tailoring and handicraft-making, they said. Talking with the women villagers, Wen said that he was very happy to visit the cooperative and was very impressed about their hard efforts and achievements. Wen, who is also a member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, expressed his hopes that the rural economy in Bangladesh will be further developed through the efforts of the women's cooperatives. The CPC group arrived here on Wednesday at the invitation of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
