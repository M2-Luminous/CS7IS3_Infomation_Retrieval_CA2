[Peres] ...and what would have become of the secret negotiations if I had told people like you about them under seal of strictest secrecy? [Menne] Will you tell us instead what you currently have in the diplomatic pipeline? [Peres] We are currently negotiating on another peace agreement with the Palestinians. Then we will test what can be achieved with the Syrians, but we have a dual problem there: Not only are the positions of the two parties opposed, but above all, we are not in direct negotiation. Everything goes via the United States. [Menne] Do you still attach importance to an agreement with Syria? [Peres] Yes, because there is no real solution for any country in the Middle East before we have achieved an economic and political agreement for the whole region. [Menne] The United States continues to play an essential role in Middle East diplomacy. Can Russia, for its part, take on a role? [Peres] Well, Russia's role is more a symbolic one today: The Russians have to ensure that the Middle East is on their agenda, but this will not mean for a long time yet that Russia is on the agenda of the Middle East. They simply want to maintain the image of the great Russia. [Menne] Some questions about the personal side of the political development. What was the happiest day of your political life? [Peres] The day on which the state of Israel was born. [Menne] What did you feel when you heard about the massacre in Hebron? [Peres] I was shaken to the marrow of my bones, I was ashamed and shocked. [Menne] And do you fear for the peace process? [Peres] No. [Menne] What was your reaction when Yasir 'Arafat first refused to initial the maps of the Jericho territory during the signing of the autonomy agreement in Cairo? [Peres] I fancied I was a doctor whose patient had just fallen and who had to find the right treatment very quickly. [Menne] How did you feel when you saw the pictures of the Palestinian policemen marching into Jericho? [Peres] These were very satisfying pictures for me. I did not feel any regret, on the contrary: I hope that the Palestinians will quickly develop a successful administration. [Menne] You have worked for Israel all your life. Does it hurt that some of your compatriots are now calling you a traitor? [Peres] No, I can live with it. I have only pity for these people. [Menne] As defense minister, you dealt primarily with military tasks. You are regarded as the "father" of the Israeli nuclear reactor in Dimona. Now you are working on a peace solution. Has reality changed or have you changed? [Peres] The basic conditions have changed. During the first 45 years, Israel's security was the main problem. Now it holds true that we only find security if we have peace. The "lever of deterrence" of Dimona directly influenced the peace agreement with Israel. I am still working for the same objectives, only the means have changed. In former times, the country needed above all weapons, today it needs wisdom. If one wants to achieve peace, wars have to be made impossible. [Menne] What can still endanger the peace process now? [Peres] Actually, only something idiotic or unpredictable. I believe that the current of history is leading the people away from war. Seen from the historical point of view, we have come to the end of the hunting season -- what is important cannot be hunted any longer and what can still be hunted is no longer important. [Menne] That is to say, you think that the peace process is irreversible? [Peres] Certainly. The process was not initiated under pressure from other countries or by threats of war, but by a national process of will, like almost all great achievements of the past decade. A communist caused the end of communism, a white South African the end of apartheid, a Peronist the end of Peronism. And Israel initiated the termination of the Middle East conflict. [Menne] What will happen next? [Peres] The next step is the development of the New Middle East. In concrete terms, this means for the Israelis and Palestinians that the two national footbridges grow together into a bridge in the next five years. After the election in the autumn, we will negotiate on the extension of the autonomy settlement. [Menne] What will become of the Jewish settlers in the occupied territories? [Peres] Everything will depend on the relations between Palestinians and Israelis. If 500 Jewish settlers live among 190,000 Arabs in Hebron, this will be no problem if the relations are good. However, if they are bad, the situation will be unbearable. [Menne] That is to say, the psychological barriers between Israelis and Palestinians first have to be reduced? [Peres] Exactly. As it was also possible between Germans and French, Germans and Poles. We must not forget that on both sides the third or fourth generation has already grown up now with completely consolidated hostile images; everyone imputes the most devilish intentions to the other from the start. It will take some time until both sides understand that they are a community of fate. [Menne] Is it not the prerequisite for such a peace process that the Palestinians get their own state? [Peres] There is, of course, a completely legitimate national consciousness, which also needs a political form of expression. And the autonomy settlement grants them everything that makes up a state, except for defense and foreign politics. However, there will be all symbols of independence, from passports to stamps. Over the long term, I prefer the model of a confederation -- politically between Jordanians and Palestinians, economically between Israelis, Jordanians, and Palestinians, which can be approximately compared to the Benelux structure. In the near future, however, we still have to be very careful with Israel's security interests. [Menne] How is the New Middle East supposed to look in concrete terms? [Peres] Like the European Community. Borders would only be defined in demographic and cultural terms, but they would not be permitted to impede the movements of people, ideas, and goods. What television can do must also be possible for streets, railroads, and aircraft. The most important objective must be the general raising of the standard of living because if someone has a low income and a television set, he will compare his situation with that of a European and feel envy, bitterness, and rage; in this way, fundamentalist movements are created. [Menne] Will the economy play a greater role than politics in the creation of the New Middle East? [Peres] We should introduce economics in politics, instead of politicizing economies. Many Arabs still see their economy in an old-fashioned way as a national economy, which, however, no longer exists because markets are more important than nations and because one cannot place flags on one's children's breakfast table. "Cannons instead of socks, tanks instead of shoes," it was said in Israel in the fifties, today I hear more and more frequently: "Better a bank than a tank." We have to create a regional community with a common market. [Menne] And who is supposed to pay for it? [Peres] For one thing, this does not cost a penny, we would only have to restrict some crazy expenses. In the last decade, the Middle East spent billions of dollars on arms, the Syrian armament budget devours almost half of the GDP, in Israel it is only 26 percent. These are enormous sums, of which a reasonable part might flow into economic development. Only very rich countries can afford expensive armies and costly dictatorships. [Menne] What can Israel offer to its neighbors? [Peres] Above all technology and science. Only think of the rapid spreading of the desert in the Middle East -- we have very precise experiences with techniques that can check and force back this desertification of the region. Our neighbors can immediately benefit from it. [Menne] And what can the Arab countries offer to Israel? [Peres] We can economically survive without our neighbors; our exports are well developed. But politically it is very problematic for Israel to exist as an island of affluence in a sea of poverty. Therefore, the Arabs can give the most important thing to us: peace.
