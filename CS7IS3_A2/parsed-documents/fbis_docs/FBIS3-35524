He says that this morning's incidents reinforce the PLO's demand for international supervision to guarantee the safety and well-being of the Palestinian residents of the territories. Abu-Sharif was asked to comment on the Israeli argument that the massacre was committed by a mentally ill person. The following is his reaction. [Begin Abu-Sharif recording, in English] Well, we have seen such statements before. When the intifadah began, an Israeli soldier stopped a bus with 60 Palestinian workers on it and machine-gunned them. That is an old story. Actually, the Israeli Government is responsible, whether this man is unbalanced or balanced. I think he is balanced. He is an extremist, and the more the Israelis maneuver around and linger in implementing the agreement that was signed in Washington, the more ground they give to their extremists. [end recording]
