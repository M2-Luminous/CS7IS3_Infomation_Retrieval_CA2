Tsui Sze-men said: According to the Sino-British "Joint Declaration," the British Government must terminate all its governing activities in Hong Kong (including Kowloon and the New Territories) on 30 June 1997 and smoothly hand over sovereignty and governing power over Hong Kong to the Chinese Central Government, and it may not recant or evade its obligations under any pretext. Now, only a little more than 1,200 days before the return, Chris Patten, the last British governor and politician who was defeated in election in his own country, on numerous occasions openly broke the country's promise under various pretexts, culminating in the termination of Sino-British talks. Without the Chinese Government's approval, he unilaterally submitted the so-called "Chris Patten political reform program" -- a program that infringes on China's sovereignty -- to the "Legislative Council" [Legco], which functions entirely under British colonial rule, for implementation after its "approval." Tsui Sze-men said: Every time they withdraw from a country or region, the British colonialists use tricks to create contradictions and divide the country or region. Their habitual tricks have been personally experienced by Hong Kong compatriots today, and the British Government's two sinister attempts pursued by Chris Patten on its behalf have been completely exposed to the light of day. Its first attempt is to create a pro-British legislative body on the basis of Patten's political reform program, a body that listens to London and imposes itself on Hong Kong after 30 June 1997. Another is to plunder every penny of the Hong Kong Government's fiscal surplus of 130 billion Hong Kong dollars, ignoring the past friendship between Britain and China and British long-term interests. Making Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong ineffective and plundering Hong Kong's fiscal surplus are Chris Patten's two most despicable attempts. These short- sighted sinister attempts are not only opposed by the great majority of the Hong Kong compatriots, they are also opposed by more and more people in business and diplomatic circles in Britain itself. Tsui Sze-men pointed out: At this crucial moment, the Chinese Government issued a resolute statement which solemnly points out that with the termination of "Letters Patent" and "Royal Instructions" in Hong Kong by 30 June 1997, all the legislative bodies created unilaterally by British politicians at various levels in Hong Kong will be disbanded. According to the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of the National People's Congress [NPC], legislative bodies at various levels which embody China's sovereignty will be organized, beginning on 1 July 1997. The NPC Standing Committee was far-sighted in adopting the decision on organizing the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]. Since then, the members from Hong Kong and those from the mainland in the PWC have cooperated faithfully with each other and stepped up the study of the organization of the HKSAR Government, the selection of its chief executive, and the election of its legislative bodies at various levels. First, the second group of nearly 100 Hong Kong affairs advisers are seriously putting forward opinions and suggestions and playing the role of a collective body of wisdom. The third group of advisers will be hired soon. The PWC itself will be properly strengthened. Nearly 300 Hong Kong district affairs advisers, many of whom are from the grass-roots level, were hired on 5 March. These talented people are working with one heart and one mind in making a preliminary exploration of ways for Hong Kong people to administer Hong Kong. Tsui Sze-men was convinced that the Chinese Government has both the determination and the ability to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and continued stability and prosperity. Hong Kong will certainly be prosperous so long as the motherland's mainland enjoys stability and economic development. Tsui Sze-men said: One country with two systems, administering Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people, and a high degree of autonomy can be realized according to the Hong Kong "Basic Law" only after China's central government completely recovers Hong Kong's sovereignty and administration. Reliance on foreign forces and use of the pretext of accelerating democracy and making Hong Kong people administer Hong Kong sooner are in violation of both China's sovereignty and the Chinese people's aspirations. None of the attempts can succeed. Tsui Sze-men said: As a representative of overseas Chinese, I took part in the flag-raising ceremony for Burma's independence in Burma on January 4, 1948. I also attended the last Burmese governor's flag-lowering ceremony. I witnessed Britain's Major General (Lance), holding a British flag, walk out of the governor's office in tears. It will be my pleasure to witness the last Hong Kong governor walk out of the governor's office. It will be different from what I did in Burma. At that time, I was invited to attend the ceremony as a guest. Next time, I will attend the ceremony as the host and will be particularly happy and honored. Tsui Sze-men said: Premier Li Peng said in his "government work report": "I hope the PWC will unite the Hong Kong compatriots in a comprehensive way, make good preparations for establishing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its first government and legislative body, and live up to the expectation and great trust placed in it by the people across the country." Since I heard this passage, I have felt that the responsibility resting on my shoulders is very heavy and important because I am a PWC member. I will unite with all the forces in Hong Kong that I can and will make the greatest efforts for Hong Kong's smooth transition in the second half of the transitional period and for its successful reversion.
