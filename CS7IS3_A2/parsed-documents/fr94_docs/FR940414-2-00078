FR940414-2-00078 FR940414-2-00059 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Abnormal Occurrence Report Section, 208 Report Submitted to the Congress Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on abnormal occurrences (NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 16, No. 3). Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.'' NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences. The report to Congress is for the third calendar quarter of 1993. The report identifies the occurrences or events that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described. This report discusses two abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved a medical sodium iodide misadministration and one involved a 1981 fatal radiation exposure of a radiographer. One industrial radiographer overexposure event and four medical misadministrations that were reported by the Agreement States are also discussed, based on information provided by the Agreement States as of November 1, 1993. The report also contains information updating four previously reported abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities and three reported by the Agreement States, and includes information on two other events of interest. Appendix D has been added to this report which includes events submitted by Agreement States that are likely to be categorized as abnormal occurrences. For these events, insufficient information was available as of November 1, 1993, to positively identify them as abnormal occurrences. A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout the country. Copies of NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 16, No. 3 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. A year's subscription to the NUREG&hyph;0090 series publication, which consists of four issues, is also available. Copies of the report may also be purchased from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. Dated at Rockville, MD this 8th day of April, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John C. Hoyle, Assistant Secretary of the Commission.
