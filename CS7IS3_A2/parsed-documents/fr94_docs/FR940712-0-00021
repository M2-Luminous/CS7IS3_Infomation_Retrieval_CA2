FR940712-0-00021 FR940712-0-00007 Subsistence Harvest Estimates for 1994 Through 1996 NMFS published a document proposing a range of subsistence need estimates for 1994&hyph;96 based on the results of the 1992&hyph;93 harvests (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS proposed that the lower bound of the harvest estimate for northern fur seals on St. Paul Island for each year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at 1,645 (the same as that in 1992 and 1993). If the Aleut residents of St. Paul Island reach the lower limit of the estimated range of animals during the harvest, and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request an additional number of seals, up to a harvest total of 2,000 fur seals. For St. George Island, NMFS also proposed that the lower bound of the estimate of subsistence need for each year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at the 1992 and 1993 level of 281 fur seals. If the Aleut residents of St. George Island reach the lower level of estimated need during the 1994 harvest, and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request an additional number of seals up to a harvest total of 500 (the upper bound estimated for the 1991&hyph;93 harvests). The Aleut residents of St. Paul and St. George Islands may harvest up to the lower bound of the applicable estimate between June 23 and August 8 of each year, 1994&hyph;96. If, at any time during the harvest, the lower estimate of subsistence need for an island is reached, the harvest must be suspended for no longer than 48 hours, pursuant to 50 CFR 215.32(e)(1)(iii), pending a review of the harvest data to determine if the subsistence needs of the island residents have been met. At such time, the Pribilof Aleuts may submit information indicating that subsistence needs (for either island) have not been met. This information should be submitted as quickly as possible, optimally just prior to the time that notification is given that the lower end of the harvest estimate has been reached in order to assure that the required harvest suspension lasts no longer than 48 hours. If the Pribilof Aleuts substantiate an additional need for seals, and there has been no indication of waste, the AA must provide a revised estimate of the number of seals required for subsistence purposes. If additional information is not submitted by the Pribilof Aleuts, the AA will consider only the information in the record at the time of the suspension. It is likely, under such circumstances, that the revised subsistence estimate would remain the same as the original estimate. If that is the case, no additional takings would be authorized. Classification NMFS has determined that the approval and implementation of this document and amendment to the current regulation will not significantly affect the human environment, and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on this is not required by section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act or its implementing regulations. This rule makes only minor changes to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes; this action does not entail significant substantive revision. Because this rule does not alter the conclusions of previous environmental impact analyses and environmental assessments (EA), it is categorically excluded by NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6 from the requirement to prepare an EA. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
