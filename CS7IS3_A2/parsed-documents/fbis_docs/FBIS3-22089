Treatment program director, Jorgen Green, has few doubts on the subject after 30 years of experience with drug users. Quicker and tougher measures need to be taken against drug abusers. The first time the police nab a drug addict, he must get an offer he cannot refuse. Either he submits to controlled treatment or else the judge gets his file, and the addict risks being locked up. Having worked with drug addicts since the onset in the carefree 1960s, the director of the youth center in Vordingborg has little doubt. "But we will not use force--we do not want to battle our clients. We have abolished illegal use of force and corporal punishment. There is no reason to resurrect them," said Green. If the drug abuser breaks off treatment, he must go back to the judge on his own and explain his breach of contract. Green recommended that the judge enter into treatment contracts with drug abusers in the same manner as is done with youth contracts. But most importantly, drug abusers must find work or schooling. Even if others have to be moved back in line. "There are lots of other groups we give advantages to. Well-educated youth already have excellent opportunities to move ahead. The worst thing that you can do is to hand drug addicts a maintenance allowance. Then they can sit on the sidewalk and sell their various wares to other addicts and beginners. A government employee on the state, county, or district payroll and an addict on the government payroll cost about the same," said Green. He has also taken a close look at the right of general practitioners to prescribe methadone to addicts. "Right now we maintain people on permanent methadone use. If we dispense methadone, it must be tied to an offer of treatment. It does not cost any more than doing nothing--it is just a question of where the funds are put. Either they have to be spent on rehabilitating drug addicts or else in combatting crime, prisons, and hospital care," he said. Methadone treatment, on the other hand, only makes it more difficult to cure addicts of their addiction, according to Green. Methadone treatment thwarts every other form of treatment. The addict sets up obstacles and forces the doctor to write out a description instead of quitting the needle and embarking upon a difficult cure--without drugs. "You are letting the drug abuser leap from the fat into the fire, because if he does not have a grip on his life, he will supplement his methadone with alcohol, pills, and heroin," Green's experience has shown him. He rejects the idea that it is police raids on drug users and pushers that have caused some users to make their next injection their last. He is strongly opposed in this view by the Danish Association of General Practitioners, which has vehemently protested the police raids on pushers. "If one looks at police figures for 1992, it is evident that there was a significant drop in the number of drug-related deaths in Copenhagen during the Vesterbro raids, while there was a rise in the provinces," he said. The deaths are due to a number of diverse factors: --The average age among drug addicts has risen. Recruitment of youths is declining. --The channels of distribution have changed. This means that neither addict nor pusher knows how much morphine is contained in a dose, with the consequent risk of overdose. --There is an increase in the flow of methadone coming out of general practitioners' offices. Addicts supplement methadone with drugs on the illegal market. --Drug abusers are psychologically and physically worn down. --AIDS claims the life of many more drug addicts than was the case earlier. --Revision of police statistical methods. The one thing Green does not believe is responsible for the rise in the number of drug deaths is police intervention. "It happens because certain idiots take trips to Bangkok, buy heroin, and rush back to Copenhagen to sell it," he said. Meanwhile, he points to studies in Zurich where the number of drug-related deaths rose significantly when police withdrew and permitted a "needle park" to be created where addicts could hang out unmolested. "Unless we create a kind of ghetto, virtually any idiot can burst on the scene with drugs and slip out of the country with money in his pocket. This guy could care less about how much morphine there is in the drug," Green warned. Daily incidences of lethal injections forced the authorities to close the park in 1992. Green paints a scary picture of Copenhagen as the Amsterdam of the North. He warns against setting up "coffee shops" where hashish may be freely bought and sold. "When I hear people mentioning it, I often wonder whether they have really seen what goes on in Amsterdam. If they did, people would return home shocked and say this is not what we want," said Green. He does not believe there is anything to indicate that legalizing one drug or another and selling it in "coffee shops" would reduce the amount of addiction. In Amsterdam, pushers selling the hardest drugs stand right outside the cafe doors. Shops selling syringes, hash pipes, and equipment for snorting are located right next door. Nor does he feel that a rise in illegal activity involving euphoric drugs can be used as an argument for setting up locales where hash is freely sold. "This merely reflects the level of activity of the police in the area. The police activity in Christiania alone causes that number to rise," said Green. [passage omitted]
