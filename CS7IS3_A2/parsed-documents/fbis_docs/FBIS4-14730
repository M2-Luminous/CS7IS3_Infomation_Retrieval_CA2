The "New Wave" Association was the most successful. From now on, its five members -- I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzennyk, I. Koliushko, and M. Kosiv -- will represent Lvov Oblast in the Supreme Council. The Ukrainian Republican Party, however, sustained a defeat in the first round of parliamentary elections -- none of its candidates won a legislative seat. Also defeated was its leader, M. Horyn, who lost to his former colleague S. Khmara. Mr. Horyn believes that the fact that only three "Republicans" qualified for the second-round election is a humiliating defeat for the party. In his words, other parties fared better "thanks to the destructive idea of fighting with Mafia, employed by Russia's Zhirinovskiy some time ago." The slogan "Strength, Order, and Wealth," trotted out by the Ukrainian Popular Army-Ukrainian National Self-Defense during its campaign, failed to win much support among the electorate. Out of nine candidates proposed by the above organizations, only two will continue to fight in the second round. In spite of an aggressive campaign, candidates from the so-called Ukrainian National Socialist Party (not registered officially, by the way), who ran in almost every electoral district, found themselves "off the board." Obviously, the electorate was a bit confused by their slightly extravagant uniform, including black shirts with swastikas. People could have also associated them with the "brown shirts..." Among those who failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on the first try were L. Skoryk (23.4 percent) and I. Kalynets (18.7 percent). A. Holub, member of the Communist Party of Ukraine and "Pravda" correspondent, was the only journalist who made it to the second round. So far, the most successful Rukh members were L. Tanyuk and Ya. Kendzyor. Five more will have to brace up for the next round. Their rivals are primarily independent candidates and members of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. The highest turnout on 27 March was primarily reported from rural areas. However, both city and rural residents are anxious to know one thing: Will the new legislators justify the hefty funds that the state paid -- from taxpayers' pockets, naturally -- to stage the elections?
