Today, as Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Kono said a moment ago, he and I intermittently held meetings which lasted over six hours with some intervals wherein we had time to study each other's proposal. As far as the details of our agreement are concerned, these are specified in the documents which are being handed out to you. As President Kono mentioned, we were summoned by House of Representatives Speaker Doi before 1900 this evening -- yesterday. Speaker Doi presented her proposal to us. With her proposal as the basis, President Kono and I started the meetings. I believe that Speaker Doi's proposal served as a catalyst or a remarkable start for producing such fruitful results. Although the speaker's proposal was not reflected satisfactorily in the agreement, we, with the speaker's proposal in mind, have agreed on each point specified in the documents handed out to you. In conducting the meetings, President Kono and I discussed the political situation facing Japan. We have shared the common understanding that unless the political reform issue -- which has been discussed for over six years and which the people expected to be solved -- is brought to an end, it would be impossible to solve economic issues and regain the people's trust of politics, thus further undermining the international community's confidence in Japan. Given such a situation, we have shared a mutual understanding that it is necessary to take a broad view of the political reform issue to settle it. Based on such an understanding, we have had frank talks. As a result, overcoming our own difficulties, I, as the representative of the ruling parties, and President Kono, as the representative of his party -- as I have just said, we have reached the agreement from a standpoint of securing the national interest. Since tomorrow is the final day of the current Diet session, I cannot make any comments now on specifically how plenary sessions will be conducted or the joint committee of both houses will be held, as that will be up to the Diet itself. However, I cannot find the words to describe how happy I feel that the political reform bills have come to be settled in this way. Regarding issues which are pending at a time like this, such as economic problems and the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, I would like to have Mr. Kono spend some time with me as soon as early next week to hold frank discussions. This is how I feel right now. I will respond to other issues in the question-and-answer session.
