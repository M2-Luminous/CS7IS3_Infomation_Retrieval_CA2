During this round of talks, held in our country's Foreign Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies since last Saturday under the auspices of the UN secretary general's envoy, the two sides signed a joint communique today, stressing the need to abandon hostility and accept national reconciliation. Although the communique has not specified a timetable for implementing the agreements reached, the two sides have stressed the importance of implementing the cease-fire, halting illegal detention, and stopping any offensive operations and troop movements in Tajikistan and along its borders. Also in this communique, the representatives of the Tajikistan government and the opposition groups have reached some agreements on the next round of talks in Islamabad and discussion on the issues related to the mechanism of controlling the cease-fire. The agenda of the second round of Tajikistan peace talks includes four main axes of establishing a cease-fire, a general amnesty, return of the refugees, and holding elections. The two sides, however, agreed to concentrate the main talks on the cease-fire control mechanism. [passage omitted]
