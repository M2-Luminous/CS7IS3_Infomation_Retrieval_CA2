FR940511-2-00065 FR940511-2-00046 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;4883&hyph;3] Campo Band of Mission Indians; Tentative Adequacy Determination of Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on application of the Campo Band of Mission Indians for full program adequacy determination, public hearing and public comment period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination for purposes of sections 4005 and 4010. Under separate authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA is reviewing an application for a non-attainment area permit to construct a proposed MSWLF on the Campo Reservation. There will be a separate public comment period and decision on that application. The Campo Band of Mission Indians (``Campo Band'') applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed the Campo Band's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions of the Campo Band's MSWLF permit program that are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. These portions are described later in this notice. The Campo Band has drafted revisions to the remainder of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full approval. EPA has determined that the Campo Band's revised requirements and emergency regulations, if fully adopted and affirmed before EPA makes a final determination, would be adequate to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on any determination to approve a Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the DATES section. The Campo Band's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. DATES: All comments on the Campo Band's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on July 14, 1994. A public hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. June 30, 1994 in Alpine, California. An open house is scheduled for 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 30, 1994 in Alpine to give the public an opportunity to discuss the tentative approval before the hearing. At the hearing, EPA may limit oral testimony to five minutes per speaker, depending on the number of commenters. Commenters presenting oral testimony must also submit their comments in writing at the hearing on June 30, 1994. The hearing may adjourn earlier than 9 p.m. if all of the speakers deliver their comments before that hour. Representatives of the Campo Band of Mission Indians will be present at the open house and the public hearing held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Ms. Christiane Camp, Mail Code H&hyph;3&hyph;1, US EPA Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105. The public hearing will be held at the Alpine Elementary School Auditorium, 1850 Alpine Blvd., Alpine, California 91901. The open house will be held at the Alpine Elementary School Auditorium.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background 1. Solid Waste Permit Program Criteria On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), 42 U.S.C. 6941&hyph;6949(a), requires States (and, as discussed below, allows Indian Tribes) to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.
