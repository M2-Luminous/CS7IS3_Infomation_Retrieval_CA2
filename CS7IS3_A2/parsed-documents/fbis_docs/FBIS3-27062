Due to the grim economic situation, some plans for financial reform, such as changing state-run specialized banks into commercial banks, have had to be postponed. According to informed sources in Beijing, the reform to unify the yuan exchange rate announced by the central government this year has caused the yuan to depreciate by 50 percent in a hidden form, and the negative effect of this measure is that it has greatly stimulated inflation, which was already very serious in China. As a result, persons in economic circles in China have drastically changed their views on China's economic situation this year; among these, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's think tank also generally holds that inflation in China is the most important problem at this time. Zhu Rongji pointed out at an internal meeting last month that, in light of this situation, this year, China must strictly control the volume of currency issued; he also demanded that various localities strictly control the scale of credit within their plans and should refrain from exceeding them by a single cent. Due to the grim economic situation, some reform measures have had to be postponed. Zhu Rongji pointed out that financial reform must be slowed down, and while the People's Bank of China can still change to the status and function of a central bank according to schedule, changing state-run specialized banks into commercial banks must be slowed down, and he pointed out that this was a long-term task. According to information, this decision by Zhu Rongji is mainly based on two reasons: first, due to the high inflation rate, China must control the volume of currency issued; however, other regulatory and control measures are very limited at this time, so China can only tighten the money supply through controlling bank credit. Therefore, for a long period to come, controls over the scale of credit issuance by China's banks cannot change, while the commercialization of specialized banks can hardly be promoted. In addition, state-owned enterprises have been slow in changing their operational mechanisms, nor can they really take sole responsibility for profits and losses. Therefore, specialized banks, which are there to provide funds to state-owned enterprises, cannot handle their deposits and loans for purely commercial reasons; as a result, if reform of state-owned enterprises cannot provide specialized banks with an appropriate environment, specialized banks cannot really change into commercial banks. According to information, one of the most important measures to support the unification of the yuan exchange rate -- work to build an exchange rate transaction system among the banks -- has not been smoothly prepared. An informed source pointed out that because various departments are still arguing on the concrete plan for an interbank transaction system, it is not optimistic that the original plan can be implemented on 1 April this year. In addition, a relevant person disclosed that, at present, "debt chains" among state-run enterprises throughout the country have already swollen rapidly to nearly 100 billion yuan, and some persons hold that these debt chains are largely the result of the tightening of the money supply which began last July when the central government carried out macroregulation and control.
