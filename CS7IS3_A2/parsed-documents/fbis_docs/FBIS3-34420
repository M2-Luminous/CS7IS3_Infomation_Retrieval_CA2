The report states that checkposts have been set up on intersections and vehicles are regularly checked. Repressive patrols are conducted on the streets. In order to tighten control, at times, the regime's agents block the streets or announce that they are one-way streets. The ruling clerics, who are still gripped with the fear of last year's heroic uprising by the Mashhad residents, are implementing these repressive actions in an attempt to control the mounting protests of the people of Mashhad.
