According to the authors of the "Appeal to Nations of the Former USSR," which RID has recently received, this day should mark the beginning of activities aimed at a voluntary restoration of the USSR. Over the last three years since the 17 March 1991 referendum, reads the document, people have realized "that they have been sold for the benefit of international capital and interests of the United States; deprived of the united motherland, friendship, peace, and accord; and thrown into the abyss of war, lawlessness, and spiritual and material impoverishment, and that the country has been reduced to a zone of cheap labor, raw materials, and `dirty' production, as well as a dumping ground for industrial waste." The KKNDB believes that at rallies, meetings, and pickets on 17 March, people should categorically voice demands to fulfill their will, which was expressed three years ago and ignored by "the democrats and national-extremists" who came to power.
