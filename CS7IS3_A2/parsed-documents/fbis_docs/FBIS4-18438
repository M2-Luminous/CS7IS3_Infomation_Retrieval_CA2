This is the question being asked by the large number of Turks who did not cast their ballots for the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) that more or less doubled its support in Sunday's local elections gaining 18 percent of the overall vote. The fear is that the important gains by the Islamites will in a short time translate into interference in the secular way of life that the majority of people in this country are used to. As they consolidate their foothold the Islamites will then turn to dismantling the principles of Kemalizm one by one, starting with laicism, this fear has it. As for their final goal, it is believed this will be the institution of the Shari'ah, the all-encapsulating Islamic judicial code governing everything from a husband and wives behaviour in bed to the conduct of international relations. There can be no doubt that there are elements within the RP who would be more than delighted to see all of this come about. Even statements by the RP leader Necmettin Erbakan can be interpreted as pointing to the fact that he too would wish such an outcome eventually. It is however equally evident that the RP will not want to endanger its victory on Sunday from day one. This is a cool and calculating party that has worked hard both at the top and at the bottom to get the outcome it has gotten. It mobilized tens of thousands of young men and women in a door to door campaign which highlighted concrete rather than "spiritual" issues. In its campaign the RP capitalized to the full the anger among the public resulting from the incompetence and corruption of current local administrators. It promised to bring concrete solution to concrete problems ranging from air pollution to the environment, from the price of bread to city transportation. The first statements by victorious RP candidates show that these are the issues they will concentrate on initially. In order to allay a major fear among the public they have even indicated that they will not revoke alcohol licences--considered the litmus test for RP--that have already been issued, although they admit they will not issue new ones. All this indicates that this Party has no intention of scaring away timid people whose support it has gained for social reasons and whose votes have been effective in the RP victory. Especially when it will want to consolidate its position prior to the general elections in the fall of 1996. This is why we are hearing a lot of: "don't be afraid we are not as bad as the opposition says we are" type of statements emanating from new RP mayors. It must also be remembered of course, that the RP also tapped the anger of a predominantly conservative society in the face of images of unchecked hedonism by a rich minority. An anti-aesthetic minority whose ugly Bacchanalian and corrupt antics were persistently presented in the mass media as if it was representative and the sign of social advancement. [sentence as published] In this respect it is wrong to say that spiritual and moral considerations did not play any role in these elections and in the RP victory. On the other hand, the images, highlighting the behavior of this ill-educated newly rich segment of society, churned out day in day out by the press and private televisions were a main instrument contributing to the conservative backlash. The fact is that the press and television in Turkey have contributed hardly anything to cultural and educational awareness choosing instead to go down the path of least resistance by exploiting basic instincts. This press and television however is now in a state of near panic because "the Islamites are coming." The media in Turkey refuses to see that it has come to represent the cultural, moral and ethical decay that conservative elements have objected to so strongly. It has also come to represent for intellectuals the "anti-culture" of a decaying new rich bourgeoisie which abused its social privileges to the hilt. Regardless of where they stand politically the establishment parties, including those on the left, also pandered to the whims of this new rich element and its press and media, thinking somehow that this would enhance their power. On top of all this where they could they also took their "pick of the readies" [money] that an increasing corrupt system was laying on their path. This is what makes it conceivable today that people who generally voted for social democrats have now turned to the RP because of its social messages even though it is a religious based party. Especially when the RP intentionally kept its social message in the foreground and its spiritual message in the background -- except, of course, where it needed this message to fortify its social message. The main thing now is to try and interpret what is going on in a cool and calm manner. There is no need to panic. Neither is there a need to be complacent about anything. There is however a need to try and see things for what they really are. The first thing to realize is that Turkey is a complex country that does not lend itself to easy answers. Even if no one else is aware of this one can be sure that the RP is.... [ellipsis as published] Mark the taxi driver who drove me to work this morning. He said he was a staunch supporter of the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). "I would never vote for the RP" he said "But I voted for Melih Gokcek (the RP's candidate for Ankara)." He said he did not see this as a vote for the RP in the sense that he had opted for the candidate that had convinced him the most during the campaign about addressing Ankara's growing problems. This is just one permutation. There must be thousands more, especially among those who switched from a social democratic vote to the RP. The RP is more than aware of this. It is important now to note the warning the public has given the mainstream parties who have much time to mend their ways, to overcome their petty bickering and to serve the people for a change rather than serving themselves. This is the only way to allay the "Islamic threat." But more than issuing a warning the RP victory has also signalled the unmistakable advent on the political scene of a new force in Turkish society which will have to be considered from now on. The RP victory will inevitably catalyze a new social contract in this country whose ethnic, religious, and sectarian divisions are becoming more apparent as time goes on. The social contract will have to of necessity be based on democratic ideals in order for all to have their breathing space. It will have to prove to all the parties to it that maintaining the whole is to the advantage of all of them individually. This is the challenge facing the country and its legislators. Shallow commentators in the Turkish media who have contributed nothing to enhancing the awareness of the public, and who are now panic stricken because their "cushy life styles" appear to be threatened are not aware of this. Their complacency did not permit them to see what was on the horizon and now they are screaming for help. But there is no succor for them. Perhaps they will now see that the basis of a new social balance of power is being laid in Turkey and act accordingly. Hopefully this will also lead them to exercising some intelligence to ensure that the overall democratic system is strengthened in a manner that prevents it from becoming the tool of one segment of society or another.
