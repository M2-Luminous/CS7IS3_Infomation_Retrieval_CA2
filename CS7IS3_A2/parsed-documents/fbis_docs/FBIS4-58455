They chanted loud slogans expressing the eternal ties between the masses and the leader of their revolution, the symbol of their pride and dignity, the builder of their civilization and the fulfiller of their dreams to live freely on earth. Amid the masses rubbing shoulders with him, the brother leader of the revolution made the following address: [Al-Qadhdhafi] Brothers, we let them hear our voice once again from Masallatah, the beacon of knowledge and land of jihad. We let them hear our voice from this place which was the bridge through which the Italian occupation forces in 1911 tried to cross to Tarhunah and to the east, as they used to call the region. But the invading forces, brothers, could cross only over the bodies of your fathers and grandfathers in well-known battles. [passage omitted] Brothers, we are proud of and cherish these eternal battles from our history. They give us inspiration to confront the new enemies, neo-fascism, the new crusade, the new Western colonial campaign. We confront them today at a time when we are stronger than before, more numerous, with more equipment, and with more preparedness to face up to our enemies. [passage omitted] Brothers, we are stronger than before, and therefore our resistance will be more fierce, more violent than that of our fathers and grandfathers. Their banners will never again be raised on this land. The banners of freedom will always float over this land. We are prepared to offer more sacrifices to impose our will on the greedy and the covetous. [passage omitted] The free Libyan people are now defying those who are even stronger than Italy; it is challenging U.S. imperialism and its unjust allies. We here challenge the three isolated states which are swimming against the tide: the United States, Britain, and France. We challenge them here with, on our side, the peoples, the regional organizations, the international organizations, the strugglers for freedom in all the continents of the world. The United States, Britain, and France are internationally condemned states, internationally isolated states. They have no means other that the stick and carrot method, and using the Security Council by force, with falsehood and lies. Thanks to your stand, O courageous Libyans, the three states America, Britain, and France are isolated and condemned. They are acting against the international community, against the United Nations, and they have nothing left before them except tearing up the UN Charter, trampling on international law, and making the Security Council vote by force in favor of their unjust resolutions. The steadfast stand of the Libyan people has made the entire world support the wronged Libyan people, the Libyan people that have right on their side, the Libyan people that ask only for freedom on the land of their fathers and grandfathers. We are facing big states, however they are isolated states; they are condemned by the international community; all the world's peoples are today cursing the United States, Britain, and France. We are supported by the peoples of the Arab nation, even if their leaders have submitted, even if their leaders betray us, even if the leaders become weak. We are supported by masses that stretch from the Atlantic to the Gulf; you are supported by the peoples of the Arab nations; these people who own the veto right which has more power than the veto of the UN Security Council; the veto that the Somali people had used represents full evidence of what I am saying, brothers. Let us raise our voices even higher; we are the people of the land, and right is on our side [words indistinct], we have a right to liberty, we have the right to live free on our land. We fight, brothers, we will do so with honor; we will fight with force because we will never relinquish the land of our ancestors. As for the others, they will fight with dishonor, they will base their fight on experience; they will weigh up their losses and gains because they will be fighting on a land that is not theirs; they are the aggressors. Whereas we, when the time of confrontation comes, will be stronger than they; because we own this land; this land on which we walk is the land of our fathers and ancestors. What is important, brothers, is that their feet will tremble on this land because they are aggressors and greedy people; we are not greedy, we only defend our right to live; whereas they defend the right to reap profits from uncalculated adventures. Let them try the confrontation with the Libyan people who are ready for this. Brothers, I urge you to be ready to embark on the battle of confrontation and the confrontation of defiance using any type of weapons. Victory will be ours regardless.
