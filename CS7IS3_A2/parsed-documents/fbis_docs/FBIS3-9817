However, this has nothing to do with the already expressed legitimate will of the Serbian people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a commentary by Jovan Lakicevic: [Lakicevic] The Sarajevo political circus, stage-managed by some kind of a Serbian Citizens' or Serbian Consultative Council under the auspices of Alija Izetbegovic and the vigilant eye of U.S. Envoy Charles Redman, is one of those events that inevitably causes feelings of shame and resignation among decent people. This is so primarily because of the awareness of the kind of humiliation some of our compatriots in Sarajevo are prepared to accept in order to accomplish their extremely banal, petty, and personal ambitions. Their decision to live in the Muslim part of Sarajevo is their own choice, and it was therefore not at all necessary to raise it to the level of an improvised political meeting and some kind of political proclamation that support Alija's idea of a unitarian Bosnia under Islamic domination. However, the meeting of a group of Sarajevo Serbs, who, as they themselves said, hold prominent posts in cultural, economic, political, humanitarian, (?business) and other organizations, with the unconcealed illusion that they will retain these with this action, has gone one step further. These Serbs did not hesitate to ask Izetbegovic and the United States to scrap the Srpska republic for the sake of unitarian Bosnia, and demand trials for their compatriots for having committed war crimes. Regarding the first demand, they have obviously overlooked the fact that 90 percent of Serbs in Bosnia hold a different view and that they have expressed their view on two occasions. First, they voted in favor of the program of the Serbian Democratic Party, and then, with the same percentage, to stay in the former and future Yugoslavia. Regarding war criminals, it appears that these concealed and newly discovered fans of Alija's sovereign Bosnia, who are susceptible to amnesia, completely overlooked the fact that the most serious crimes in Sarajevo have actually been committed by Alija's former proteges: Juka Prazina, Caca, and others, and that they have been liquidated by Izetbegovic's camarilla so that the International Court for War Crimes in The Hague could not one day lay its hands on the greatest monsters of the Sarajevo horror, who incidentally were not Serbs, but Muslims. The aforementioned Sarajevo Serbs, who hastily gathered themselves in the Citizens Council and expressed loyalty to Izetbegovic's leadership, appear not to have learned anything from the experience of the Zagreb Serbian People's Party, a similar party in form and function. This so-called Serbian party of Milan Djukic's at one time played the role of folklore detachment to the vociferous young Croatian democracy, but when it had finished its sad, subservient role, Tudjman dismissed it completely. This appears to be the inevitable fate of all volunteer servants who are prepared to betray the interests of their people for personal gain. Those who were in a position to see it on television saw that the so-called Serb convention in Sarajevo was also attended by a former top-ranking member of the League of Communists of Serbia, Zarko Papic. Also attending was Dr. Ivan Djuric, who was brought for this occasion from Paris and is otherwise known as someone suitable for all anti-Serbian actions anywhere from Belgrade to the capital city of France. Those who were not present but were dying to be there were the representatives of the Citizens Association of Serbia, the Independent Trade Unions, the Belgrade Club of Independent Intellectuals, the Center for Anti-War Action, the Fund for Human Rights, the Helsinki Parliament of Citizens, Women in Black, the European Movement, and other similar quasi peace-loving organizations from Belgrade, whose number is almost identical to the number of their members. They were not there because UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] did not secure a plane for them to fly from Belgrade to Sarajevo. The president of the Serbian Renewal Movement did not go there either, even though he wanted to. He sent a letter to the organizers of the Serbian self-humiliation in Sarajevo, criticizing UNPROFOR for not meeting their wishes, unlike the wishes of those of who commanded the destruction of Sarajevo, which it had met on so many occasions in the past. Things appear to be somewhat more complicated than it appeared to those nervous, impatient, and not-to-be passengers to Sarajevo. UNPROFOR people, that is, the political circles of the Western alliance, obviously correctly assessed that their trip to Sarajevo to serve Izetbegovic and Silajdzic would be a causal motive for their new political disgrace at home in Belgrade. They therefore needed to be protected from this, because all these pacifist organizations that used all available means, including those coming from abroad, to fight for peace and brotherhood and unity at a time when Serbs in Bosnia and Krajina were literally forced to take arms and protect their basic human and civil rights and the right to life, have not finished playing the role given to them by their inspirers and founders on the Serbian political scene. One should therefore not be angry with UNPROFOR, because people in UNPROFOR, or rather, the people behind UNPROFOR, actually thought about their political future when the organizations were not. Regarding the organizers of the aforementioned convention of Serbs in Sarajevo, they should simply be left to their own fate, or rather, the choice they themselves have made. This really has nothing to do with the Serbian people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and their already expressed will and determination.
