I am not going to emphasize the demise of what used to be UNO [National Opposition Union], which had been expected for months. It is the future of the national political understanding that I must discuss. First of all, it is healthy for Nicaragua that the hub of consensus-based political decision-making will from now on be the National Assembly. The blocs that seek to give the country a stable framework will do a great deal there to further such stability. We can be sure of that. Moreover, I do not foresee any new crisis in the Assembly, like those of recent years, that might hamper or disrupt national life. The Assembly will operate normally, with equally normal annual elections of authorities, from now until 1996. We can also be sure of that. The Assembly is going to pass the constitutional reforms before May 1994; they will be substantial and profound and will be designed to strengthen the system of democratic participation, the balance between the branches of government, the judicial system and the electoral system, and the transparency and integrity of public service. These reforms will also give the Assembly new functions in decision-making on fiscal policy and in the ratification of international financial agreements, as well as in the appointment of judges, the comptroller, the attorney general, and a new and much needed post, the attorney general for human rights. The idea is not to turn the Assembly into a substitute for the Executive Branch. That would be preposterous and tactless. The Executive Branch must preserve intact its powers to run the government. The idea is, however, that the issues affecting citizens ought to be aired in the Assembly, the national public forum par excellence, and that the citizenry ought to know in advance what is involved when, for example, a tax is going to be imposed or a commitment signed with a financial body such as the IMF. These reforms of the constitution will not have to include, as some would like, express bans on certain individuals holding public office or running for elected office just because they have family ties with the president of the republic. As they have been proposed so far, such bans smack of revenge. And constitutions cannot be reformed on the basis of first and last names. This has been one of our past vices and ought to remain buried in the past. The National Assembly, with the political consensus of its deputies, must also make headway in passing laws of great national significance that have to be enacted in 1994, such as the Labor Code, the Law of Military Organization, a Tax Code, a Fisheries Law, and a Law Against Drugs, among others. The country can be sure that its Assembly will be a political hub, a hub of consensus, and will pass laws that benefit the nation. The time has now come to forge national political accords that have weight and substance. Parties cannot keep on playing the "thumbs down on him" game or go around threatening to expel others, as the parties that remain in what used to be UNO are now doing. That indeed is preposterous. Those who want no agreement have expelled those who do. The Christian Democrats showed exemplary courage in deciding to join the National Assembly when they did. Other parties, the APC, the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement], and most of the deputies of the PSD [Democratic Social Party], are now walking into the Assembly with their heads held high, aware of what they are doing. Theirs too is a courageous decision. Why? Because they are walking in to help the country get moving, not to continue thwarting and delaying national solutions. Let those who remain on the outside, screaming and threatening, stay there. Less and less attention will be paid to them. The point now is to work and build. We are starting the year off on this positive note. And I am sure that it will last and that it will bear fruit.
