At a time when the idea of compelling [Socialist Party leader] Michel Rocard to drop out of the presidential race if his scores are bad in the European Parliament elections is attractive to all those who do not believe in him, many would like to push former Culture Minister Jack Lang onto the arena. He is receiving letters and telephone calls, and he is being pressured. For his part, Lang is reflecting. Seriously. He is traveling (he was recently in the United States), and is multiplying contacts to "acquire renewed energy," as he puts it. The reasoning is simple: if [European Commission President] Jacques Delors persists in not returning to the French political game--the two men recently had a long conversation about the presidential election--Lang's popularity may be a trump card. In the latest PARIS MATCH/BVA [Brulle Ville Associates] poll, 41 percent of the French said they trusted him (compared with 43 percent for Delors, 28 percent for Rocard). Some of Lang's friends also note that Bernard Tapie reportedly affirmed that in this case, he himself would not run in 1995. Others are already outlining scenarios for the second round: they would prefer that Lang face [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur rather than [Rally for the Republic leader] Jacques Chirac.
