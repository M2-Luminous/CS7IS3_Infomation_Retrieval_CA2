This is due to the recently reached agreement between the two countries' leaders. Turkmenistan has also agreed to a deferment in the payment of the Georgian $150 Mn debt. Meanwhile, the production of electricity by the Georgian hydro-power plants has almost doubled due to a rise in the river levels. Georgia generates 16 Mn kilowatt hours of electricity daily. Another 2 Mn kilowatt hours arrive daily from Azerbaijan. The Georgian hydro-power plants are expected to start working at full load in the second half of March, which will put most of the local enterprises back into operation.
