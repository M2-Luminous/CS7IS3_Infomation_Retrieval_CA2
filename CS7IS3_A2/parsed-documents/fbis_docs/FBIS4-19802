This was a rather bumpy ride. Is the decision final, this time? [Suard] It is, as far as we are concerned! We consider the decision firm and final. The actual services to be rendered have been defined, while the legal aspects remain to be finalized. This will be done in the coming weeks. This is an extraordinary achievement for French industry! It demonstrates that France has a number of technologies -- in this case the TGV [high-speed train], but also telecommunications, nuclear technologies, satellites -- which place it at the forefront of ever fiercer international competition. As for the TGV, I must say that this is a success not only for Alcatel-Alsthom, but also for the French state and the SNCF [French National Railway Company] which initiated this technology 30 years ago. [Monnot] This contract is a real stimulus for the railway operation of GEC-Alsthom, one of your subsidiaries. [Suard] Indeed. For GEC-Alsthom and its subcontractors, this contract represents four years of work for 800 people. The first segment of the Seoul-Taejon line must be ready in late 1999. The whole line (with its extension to Pusan) must be ready by 2001. [Monnot] Last November, Siemens lowered its bid to $2.1 billion. At the time, GEC-Alsthom, whose 1993 bid was $270 million higher, had stated that such a price was unreasonable. Yet this is the price level at which you closed with Korea. [Suard] Well, we held a number of negotiations. The services to be rendered were changed. A larger share of the equipment will be manufactured in Korea, which means lower costs. The agreement stipulates that out of the 46 trains to be supplied to Korea, 12 will be entirely manufactured in France, while the balance will be assembled in Korea. Roughly speaking, half of this contract's revenues will flow to Korea, and the other half to France. In any event, as compared to our bid of last year, the expected margin remains the same. [Monnot] You will not lose money at this price level? [Suard] Of course we will not! Had we expected to, we would not have gone ahead. [Monnot] The contract also provides for an integral technology transfer to Korea. [Suard] The idea is that, by the time the contract has been completed, Koreans will be able to manufacture the type of train we are selling them today. This only relates to current trains, with today's technology. It does not include the next generations. [Monnot] Will you get financial backing from the French Government? [Suard] No. There will be no funding from the French Government. And, I might add, no compensation whatsoever. The technology to be transferred is already worth a lot. The Korean component of the contract is to be funded locally. As to the exported element, it will be funded by banks, including Suez, which played an integral part in the negotiation.
