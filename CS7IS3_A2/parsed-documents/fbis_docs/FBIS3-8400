Kazimierz Nalaskowski said Tuesday that a possible appeal by the defence minister to the constitutional tribunal against the part of the 1994 budget law which pertains to the armed forces may only relate to the final shape of the law and may be lodged after the end of the legislative procedure i.e. when the budget law is adopted by the Senate and signed by the president. Under the law on the constitutional tribunal, ministers are not entitled to lodge appeals against the budget law but they have the right to ask for support from such entities as the cabinet, the prime minister, the Sejm committees and a group of 50 deputies that are eligible to file appeals against the budget, Nalaskowski said. On Monday, Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk told a press conference in Bydgoszcz that he would appeal to the constitutional tribunal against the budget law adopted by the Sejm on Saturday. Kolodziejczyk declared that "what has happened to the Defence Ministry's budget this year is scandalous" and accused the legislative authorities of deeply interfering in the prerogatives of executive power.
