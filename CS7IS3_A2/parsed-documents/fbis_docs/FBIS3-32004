The labor union sectors see those arrangements as unilateral and the coup de grace to the workers' organizations, which will become organizations of unemployed people. According to members of the labor unions, the employers' associations want only to avoid their responsibilities in paying the workers. The various labor unions are ready to meet with the other sectors of national life to search for a solution to the Haitian crisis.
