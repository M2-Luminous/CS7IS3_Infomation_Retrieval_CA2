The Subject Will Be the Attempts To Destroy Ukraine Economically as an Independent State!'"] [Text] As is known, passions raged last Friday in parliament's session hall. After a political statement by Yu. Zvyahilskyy and a letter signed by 122 deputies, the session decided to discuss the question of the situation that had arisen in connection with the attempt on the life of people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik. We understand that an investigation is under way and that many circumstances and details regarding the tragic events of 30 May have still not been made known to us. Nevertheless.... are there not too many contradictions in the actions of the highest-ranking officials? Are there not too many "white spots" in this--let us say right out--"dark" affair? Aleksandr Parakhonya, our correspondent, asked Colonel Hryhoriy Omelchenko, member of the Supreme Council Presidium and chairman of the Commission on Matters To Combat Organized Crime and Corruption, to comment on the situation. [Omelchenko] I like and respect NEZAVISIMOST very much. That is why, although quite a few journalists have come to me with similar requests these days, I am granting this interview only to your newspaper. Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy's political statement nor the letter signed by 122 deputies (as is known, People's Deputies Yu. Spizhenko and Yu. Boldyrev were the organizers for collecting the signatures) were unexpected by myself personally and many other people's deputies. Sooner or later, something similar had to be heard. I would say this: An objective process connected with the investigation of the criminal case regarding the attempt on the life of people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik is under way. If you recall, I also spoke during that meeting and requested that normal conditions be established for the activity of the investigating operational group and that the safety of the members of this group and their families be assured. Incidentally, one Kiev newspaper wrote ironically. It wrote that Zvyahilskyy is urging a struggle against the mafia, but Chairman Omelchenko of the commission to combat organized crime and corruption is proposing to keep silent. How much this corresponds to the truth, evidently, does not disturb the newspaper. It is sufficient to read the verbatim report of my presentation -- here it is, read it!-- and it will be clear that Omelchenko did not at all suggest to the deputies that there be silence. However, I do not consider it necessary to engage in polemics with this provocation; I will treat such statements with humor. It is natural that this conclusion rang out. It is fully contained in the chronology of events that we forecast and which are following one after the other.... I will also not comment on Mr. Zvyahilskyy's political statement. My evaluation, just as that of any other individual, is subjective. I can agree with some of it and not with other parts of it. However, I would gladly put my signature under the statement's final thesis. In my copy of the session's verbatim report, that paragraph is marked "nota bene." I will quote it for the readers of NEZAVISIMOST: "As a people's deputy of Ukraine performing the duties of the Ukraine's prime minister, I demand very decisive measures from the Ukraine's Supreme Council to protect the national interest of the state and the honor and dignity of its citizens; the investigation of all (we stress the word 'all'--G.O.) circumstances concerning the attempt on the life of people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik; rigorous observance of law, order, and legality; and the establishment of an effective legal mechanism." I vote with both hands for this formulation of the question, and I will do everything that depends on me so that ALL circumstances in the Bortnik affair will be investigated with strict observance of legality and law and order. [Parakhonya] Are you confident that the one who fired at Bortnik will be found? Who do you think it is? [Omelchenko] In this case, who the specific individual is that made the attempt on the life of the people's deputy is not as important as who is behind him and who aimed his hand. One must determine the motives for the crime. As the ancients wisely said--who benefits? Some officials hope very much to keep the motives secret. I will not mention names now for the sake of the investigation. I will pose the question of establishing a Supreme Council investigating commission, which will be able to investigate this matter fully, thoroughly, and objectively, jointly with the general procurator's investigating operational group, to the session of the Ukraine's Supreme Council in accordance with Article 109 of the Constitution--to dig down to the sources and to the roots! Moreover, I will secure from the Supreme Council and its Presidium the pronouncement of a decree on conducting a thorough inspection of the financial and economic activity and hard currency accounts of the concern that people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik heads, and also of the other state institutions, commercial structures, and commercial banks--both domestic and foreign--with which Ukragrotekhservis has conducted financial and economic activity. Only by conducting this comprehensive inspection, and then an expert legal and bookkeeping examination, can we and you establish (I do not doubt this!) the true motives for the attempt on Vladimir Bortnik's life. Incidentally, Ukraine's Security Service has twice charged the monitoring and auditing department of Ukraine's Ministry of Finance to conduct a thorough inspection of the activity of Ukragrotekhservis and of the state and commercial structures connected with it. Up until now, this decision of the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] has not been carried out. I intend to raise the question about the responsibility of officials from the Ministry of Finance's KRU [monitoring and auditing department] for the failure to implement the Law on the Organization and Legal Bases for Combating Organized Crime. It clearly states: The duty of all state structures, including the KRU, is to carry out rigorously the decisions of the SBU, the general procurator, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and other subunits engaged in combating corruption and organized crime. I will refrain from evaluating--politically, morally, and ethically--the strange inactivity of the KRU in this matter. I will, however, see to it in every way possible that the decree on the appointment of this inspection body be carried out by the Supreme Council Presidium, as was done in 1990, when the Presidium appointed a similar inspection agency to investigate the circumstances connected with the misappropriation of assets allocated to eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. The programs of a majority of the people's deputies contain quite a few correct words and vows to the voters to struggle resolutely against the mafia and corruption. That is why I nevertheless believe that my proposal to establish a Supreme Council investigating commission and to ensure normal conditions for the work of the operational investigation group's members will be supported. If we succeed....Lord willing! I hope and am confident that we will manage to bring this affair to a complete end, and then.... it is difficult for me to say this phrase; but then we will no longer talk only about the mafia and corruption in the highest echelons of power. The subject concerns attempts to destroy Ukraine economically as an independent state! No matter what it costs, I will do everything to investigate this matter until the end. [Parakhonya] On Friday, extremely serious accusations addressed to V. Datsyuk, the general procurator, sounded from the parliament rostrum. It seems to me that some of our deputies are simply incapable of remembering that they represent the first, the legislative, and not the third, the judicial, branch. What is more, Yu. Spizhenko, the minister of health, quoting his medical colleagues, reported that the police workers who protected V. Bortnik were drunk.... [Omelchenko] Here on my table are documents: The examination of the policemen was conducted at the time, 31 May, by the on-duty medical personnel at that same emergency hospital. All were sober and acted in accurate compliance with instructions. I will say one thing: Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy nor Yu. Spizhenko, who arrived during the night at the hospital where the wounded deputy was located, have any justifying motives. Yes, a vital need to send V. Bortnik abroad could have arisen (we will not specify--did it arise?) in order to provide him with qualified medical help there. However, knowing that the wounded man was under protection and that an investigation was being conducted--however, they were not able to know about this--it was necessary, at a minimum, to secure the permission of Ukraine's procurator general to see the patient. [Parakhonya] Perhaps I am posing the question amateurishly; however, the supposition suggests itself that a concern for V. Bortnik's health was not the only reason for his urgent dispatch abroad. It looks as if something else worried the organizers of this trip. Was it impossible to allow the leaking of some information? [Omelchenko] The question is not at all amateurish. You are looking directly at the root. I can answer--in the aspect, let us say, of a version. It is one of the working versions of the investigation. In addition, I can justify this version using evidence existing today. I will not do this for one simple reason--so as not to agitate unnecessarily public opinion about this criminal case. However, I promise your readers that I will tell everything without fail as soon as it is possible to do so without harming the interests of the investigation. Knowing practically all aspects of this criminal case and everything that is occurring around it, I was again convinced that we vitally needed a note about Section 4 of Article 111 in the Constitution and Articles 27 and 28 in the law concerning the status of a people's deputy in Ukraine. The subject in them concerns a deputy's immunity. I intend to submit the question of the repeal of these articles to the Supreme Council session. The deputy's immunity, which our people's deputies possess at all levels, no longer exists anywhere in the world. This is some kind of feudalism! I think that the law's propositions concerning who can institute proceedings against a people's deputy should be formulated approximately as follows: "A criminal case concerning a people's deputy of Ukraine can be instituted by the general procurator, oblast procurator, procurator of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol, or persons acting as general procurator, procurators of the oblasts, and procurators given the same status as them. The criminal case should be heard by Ukraine's Supreme Court." Concerning deputies of local soviets, a criminal case against a deputy should be instituted by the appropriate procurator--rayon, city, or oblast--and heard by the oblast court. That is all! There should not be any other limitations in the criminal procedure or any special procedure for instituting criminal proceedings against deputies. [Parakhonya] However, you see, provocations, squaring of accounts, etc., are possible against deputies (and against you also--no, against you in particular). [Omelchenko] If a deputy does not break the law, does not commit crimes, and is not connected with the mafia and corrupted commercial structures, banks, etc., he has no reason to fear anything or to be apprehensive--the more so since a procurator, before instituting criminal proceedings against a people's deputy, will weigh and recheck everything a thousand times--the responsibility is too great. I consider the problem of a deputy's immunity to be the Rubicon which our Supreme Council simply must cross. [Parakhonya] I very much doubt that parliament will take this step. [Omelchenko] Let the deputies recall their campaign promises, programs, and vows to fight against the mafia and corruption. They are able to carry them out and show precisely how the question of a deputy's immunity will be solved. It will become a kind of litmus-paper that will immediately reveal who is who. [Parakhonya] You will insist on a role-call vote? [Omelchenko] Simply! [Parakhonya] It seems that the case of V. Bortnik has shown how vulnerable our deputy's immunity is. By no means do I have in mind only the fact that a people's deputy with his immunity can be wounded, just like any other ordinary mortal. Certain forces behind the scenes can also direct his actions. The fact of under what conditions and how the question was decided to send V. Bortnik urgently to Vienna testifies to the sweeping capabilities of the "opposite side." The work of the investigating operational group and the Commission on Matters To Combat Organized Crime and Corruption will encounter (is already encountering?) a certain opposition. Or is this a secret? If possible, a few words about the operational investigating group. [Omelchenko] Let us begin with the latter. The group contains high class professionals from the general procurator's office, SBU, and MVD--investigators and operational workers. Working indefatigably, the investigators work approximately 16-18 hours a day. The operational people work even more; the week that passed after the day of the crime was practically a week without sleep for them. Now about the opposition. However strange it may seem, one must render it its due. Anonymous "well-wishers" somehow know the home telephone numbers of the members of the group that is investigating this criminal case. Recommendations, so to say, "not to dig deeply" were first addressed to them. Next, blackmail was set in motion in the case--promises to publish some devastating material that would compromise the group's leadership. Threats of physical violence have also already been heard. [Parakhonya] You see, the lads in the investigating operational group have wives, children.... [Omelchenko] That is why the group's members were forced to take definite actions to protect the life and health of their relatives and relations and, naturally, take a number of necessary steps to establish conditions--even if only minimal--for the group's normal functioning. [Parakhonya] In your view, how will the situation develop? [Omelchenko] It will be possible to see a great deal after parliament adopts a decision to establish a Supreme Council investigating commission, and when a decision has been taken at the Presidium level, to conduct a thorough financial and economic review of Ukragrotekhservis and the structures connected with it. At that time, events will begin to develop swiftly. [Parakhonya] Are you confident that an affair of this scope will be a unique one in your work as chairman of the parliamentary commission? [Omelchenko] It is not the attempt itself on the deputy's life but that which is connected with this case that does not at all surprise me. This case is one of an extremely average level, since today corruption and the mafia clans have actually eaten away at the state. The people have probably lost faith already in the ability to conquer this terrible evil. One would like to believe that this Supreme Council is able to do something useful. Would that God would let us establish a special subunit in the SBU to fight corruption, which has still not been established, including through the fault of the former Supreme Council. It is no less urgent to adopt--even if only the first ones--laws regarding the struggle against corruption and organized crime and to give a legal definition of the concepts: "mafia," "corruption," and "organized crime." The Supreme Council planned to do this last year; however.... [Parakhonya] You said that people have probably already lost faith in the fact that it is possible to defeat the mafia and corruption. You and those who are engaged in investigations possess information that is not even dreamed about in a terrible dream; have you preserved this faith? [Omelchenko] That is a very difficult question.... Sometimes workers engaged in combating corruption and organized crime remind one of Don Quixote or fanatics who continue their struggle despite any logic. They beat their heads against the wall and the result is often nothing.... I will speak frankly. Previously, specialists in this field at times left the work because the pay did not suit them. I do not wish to judge them; each has his own problems and living circumstances. However, young people are now leaving us at times for quite different moral and ethical motives: The work is dangerous and risky and is running free. To beat one's head against a wall is a dishonorable occupation. I want to emphasize once again: The adoption of radical and very decisive legal measures to combat this terrible evil is necessary--of course, with the parallel adoption of economic laws. However, without legal ones, economic laws (you see, where is corruption rooted?--in the economy) will not work. If we do not repeal a deputy's immunity, one can give up the struggle against corruption and the mafia as a lost cause.
