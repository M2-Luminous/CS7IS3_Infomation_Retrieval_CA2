An explosive device planted in an unoccupied car parked by the side of the road detonated the moment the Mercedes-600 containing Berezovskiy emerged though the gates of the reception center. The driver of the Mercedes was killed on the spot by fragments of the device, while Berezovskiy and his bodyguard, as well as several passersby, were injured. Late in the evening Berezovskiy, who received severe burns to the face and hands, was sent home from the hospital but is under the constant observation of a doctor. The bodyguard is in a very serious condition: He has lost his sight, and the lower part of his face has been badly affected. It was only at midday on 8 June that it became clear that his condition had, as the doctors put it, "stabilized." An official statement put out by the "LogoVAZ" board describes the incident as a terrorist act aimed at killing Berezovskiy. The version of events which maintains that this was a chance occurrence, an attempt on the life of the owner of the car containing the bomb, is being refuted. The grounds for this are as follows. The explosive device was directional and the mechanism itself was filled with many metal balls and splinters which were spread over a distance of 150-200 meters. It is most likely that the owner of the car which was blown up, who was allegedly in the neighboring casino, does not exist. Several witnesses claim that the car, which was completely destroyed by the blast, had Lithuanian license plates. The interpretation that it was linked to the allocation of spheres of interest is denied in just as categorical a manner. Indeed, "LogoVAZ" does not have any competitors in Russia in terms of volumes of sales. However, last year a series of explosions shook "LogoVAZ" parking lots in Moscow which the company itself tried to investigate. As we were told in private conversations, they succeeded in ascertaining who the terrorist was. He turned out to be a half-crazy lone blackmailer unconnected to any criminal groupings. Following the recent incident, doubts about this verdict have only intensified. At the same time, people at "LogoVAZ" maintain that neither Berezovskiy nor "LogoVAZ" have recently been the victims of intimidation. Unofficial sources assert that, considering the realities of life in this country, the company could long ago have reached a peace agreement with the capital's major mafia structures. However, it is not really possible to monitor all groups making money out of automobiles. One interpretation of the attempt on Berezovskiy's life says that recently this entrepreneur has significantly broadened his range of activities and begun to pay greater attention to politics. Berezovskiy, 47, is a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the author of many scientific works on the theory of management. It was he who was the inspiration behind the first private industrial investment project in Russia, "AVVA," to build a new giant automobile plant in Tolyatti. That aside, Berezovskiy is the founder of Russia's largest charitable foundation -- "Triumf."
