"A decade ago women and children seemed on the periphery of the AIDS epidemic. Today they are at the centre of our concern," Dr. Michael Merson, executive director of the WHO global programme on AIDS, said. "AIDS has not spared women and their children. On the contrary, the epidemic wave has affected millions of them, and millions more are threatened." More than 13 million women will have been infected by 2000, and nearly a third of them will have died, Dr. Merson told an international conference on HIV in children and mothers held in Edinburgh. Even if all new infections were stopped in their tracks now, total AIDS cases would still quadruple by 2000. Almost one in two of newly-infected adults were women. "The number of women acquiring HIV a year cannot be counted in the thousands, or even the hundreds of thousands. "More than 1 million women will be infected in 1993. "By the year 2000, over 13 million women will have been affected, and about 4 million of them will have died." As infections increased in women, so did infections in their babies. So far, these totalled about 1 million, and more than half already had AIDS. [Passage omitted] Guardian Newspapers Limited, September 8, 1993
