FR941025-0-00040 FR941025-0-00011 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 16 CFR Parts 1615 and 1616 Continuation of Stay of Enforcement of Standards for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear, Sizes 0 Through 6X and 7 Through 14 AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission. ACTION: Continuation of stay of enforcement. SUMMARY: This notice announces the staff's decision to extend the stay of enforcement of sleepwear requirements against (1) garments currently being used as sleepwear that are labeled and marketed as underwear if these garments are skin-tight or nearly skin-tight and (2) garments that are essentially identical in design, material, and fit to such ``underwear'' garments. EFFECTIVE DATE: The stay published at 58 FR 4078, January 13, 1993, which became effective January 13, 1993 continues in effect until further notice. The Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the termination date of this stay. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia A. Fairall, Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207; telephone (301) 504&hyph;0400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , the Commission is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR'') concerning the possible amendment of the Commission's flammability standards for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X and 7 through 14. The current flammability standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X is codified at 16 CFR Part 1615 and the standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 is codified at 16 CFR Part 1616. On January 13, 1993, the Commission issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the possible amendment of its flammability standards for children's sleepwear. 58 FR 4111. On that same date, the staff also issued a stay of enforcement of the sleepwear requirements against certain garments. 58 FR 4078. That stay went into effect when it was published on January 13, 1993. The staff is extending the stay of enforcement as previously issued while the Commission considers the proposed amendment. As stated in the NPR which is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , the staff has noted that many garments currently in the marketplace and labeled as ``playwear'' or ``underwear'' are suitable for use as sleepwear and are being used as sleepwear in a substantial number of cases. Pending Commission consideration of amendments to the sleepwear standards, the Compliance staff is extending its stay of enforcement against the following garments. The staff will continue not to enforce the sleepwear requirements against garments currently being used as sleepwear that are labeled and marketed as underwear if those garments are relatively free of ornamentation and are skin-tight or nearly skin tight. Such garments may be either one or two piece garments and typically are manufactured of a fabric such as rib knit, interlock knit, or waffle knit. The stay also continues to cover garments that are essentially identical in design, material, and fit to such ``underwear'' garments. Examples of the types of garments covered by the stay are illustrated on pages 4 and 6 of the Supplemental CPSC Staff Guide to the Enforcement Policy Statements of the Flammability Standard for Children's Sleepwear (1989). Although the staff continues to stay enforcement against these garments under its sleepwear standards, these garments must comply with the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles, 16 CFR part 1610. Dated: October 17, 1994. Sadye E. Dunn, Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26099 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6355&hyph;01&hyph;P
