He did so to protest the systematic return by the United States to Haiti of those who want to leave the country. This agreement constitutes the legal basis of U.S. Coast Guard efforts to systematically return Haitian refugees who attempt to enter the United States. Mr. Michael Barnes added that President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide also gave notice of his refusal of the latest plan for a settlement to the crisis in Haiti. U.S. Vice President Al Gore presented the plan to the president last month. Father Aristide considers unacceptable the American proposal to lift the sanctions before his return to Haiti as head of state. The American policy is a perversion of democracy, says the letter to President Bill Clinton from the Haitian president, who has lived in exile since 1991. The letter points out that in any case the 1981 convention concerning the refugees expires in six months. It should be recalled that the American policy regarding the Haitian refugees is based on the presumption that the refugees are not fleeing persecution, which is unbelievable, writes President Aristide. He reproaches Mr. Bill Clinton for having taken on the responsibility for the policy of his Republican predecessor George Bush, who began to send back Haitian refugees in 1992.
