Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was scheduled to sign the "Partnership for Peace" document during a visit next Thursday to the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At a recent summit, President Clinton and other alliance leaders invited their Warsaw Pact foes to accept the plan, which would draw the nations closer but without granting them membership. NATO officials said the East Europeans can begin signing the partnership document on Monday. After they do, they will work out individual programs for taking part in military exercises, peacekeeping and other NATO activities. In turn, the nations will have to share information about defense budgets, promise civilian control over the military and standardize weapons systems. Lithuania earlier this month became the first former Soviet republic to ask for membership in the alliance and the security guarantees that would go with it. Poland, Hungary and others also want to join. But the allies have refused to admit the East Europeans, fearing to do so would create a new divide in Europe and isolate and upset Russia, a formidable military power.
