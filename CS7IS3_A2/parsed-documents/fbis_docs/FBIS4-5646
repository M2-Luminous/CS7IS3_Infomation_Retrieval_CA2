FBIS4-5646 "dreas071_a_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Group Suspects Yokosuka Nuclear Submarine Repair Group Suspects Yokosuka Nuclear Submarine Repair OW1104094494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0848 GMT 11 Apr 94 OW1104094494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Yokosuka, Kanagawa Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The reactors of two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines may have had repair work done in Japan in January in spite of a bilateral agreement ruling out such activities, an anti-U.S. base citizens group said Monday [11 April]. The Holland, a 10,500-ton U.S. tender for nuclear-powered submarines, called at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, for about a month from January 11, according to the citizens group, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) coalition of Japan. During the period, two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines -- the Tunny and the New York City -- also stopped at the base, group members said. The group said base employees witnessed in mid-January several repair engineers from the Holland enter into reactor and weapons zones within the submarines. The zones are off-limits to Japanese. The group members said the tender and the submarines stopped at the base at the same time apparently because the war ships' reactors needed repairs. The Holland was designed to provide repair and supply services for submarines. A memorandum between Japan and the U.S. stipulates that power equipment of U.S. submarines will not be repaired in Japan. A U.S. Navy commander in Japan said that the Holland conducted "a routine port visit in conjunction with her current deployment to the western Pacific." Yokosuka city officials said that based on the Japan-U.S. memorandum it does not believe nuclear-related repair work was done. Shoji Shimizu, leader of the NEPA coalition, said the port call by the Holland may indicate future plans to have U.S. submarines repaired in Yokosuka.
