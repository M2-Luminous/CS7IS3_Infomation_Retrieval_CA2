FR940712-1-00059 FR940712-1-00012 Phase In To reduce potential impact of large increases in rent, BLM proposes to phase in substantial increases in the base rent and percentage of gross rental receipts. Additional rent based upon a percentage of gross rent for space rental in the facility will not be phased in. Initial increases in the base rental payments in excess of $1,000 or 20 percent of the current rent, whichever is greater, will be phased in over a 5-year period. Subsequent increases in rent above the first year will be based on an equal annual installment, plus the inflation adjusted increase. As an example, if the current base rent is $700 and the new rent based on the schedule is $2,700, the first year's rent would be $1,700 plus the inflation-adjusted increase, and the rent for years 2 through 5 would be increased $250 per year. Assuming a 2 percent increase in the CPI&hyph;U during the 5 year phase-in period, the base rents would be calculated as follows: Year 1␣($700×1.02)+$1,000=␣$714+$1,000=$1,714 Year 2␣($1,714×1.02)+$250=␣$1,748+$250=$1,998 Year 3␣($1,998×1.02)+$250=␣$2,038+$250=$2,288 Year 4␣($2,288×1.02)+$250=␣$2,334+$250=$2,583 Year 5␣($2,583×1.02)+$250=␣$2,635+$250=$2,885 Year 6␣$2,885×1.02=$2,943 Additional rent based on a percentage of gross rent received from tenants covered by the right-of-way authorization would also be phased in. The percentage would be set at 15 percent during the first 5 years after the effective date of this rule, and 25 percent thereafter. Exceptions The proposed rental payments only apply to those communication users that are required to pay a fair market rental. Current regulations exempt Federal, State, or local government agencies or instrumentalities thereof, except municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue is customer charges. Also exempt are rights-of-way authorized under a statute that explicitly does not require payment of a rental, and facilities constructed under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended. The BLM proposes to close a loophole through which ``exempt'' agencies derive revenue from the rental of space within their facility or the area authorized. Section 2803.1&hyph;2(b)(1)(i) would be amended to require ``exempt'' agencies to pay fair market rent for those uses from which they derive revenue from the rental of space. It is BLM's intent to use the rental fee schedule for all existing communication uses covered by the proposed rule. However, when it is determined by the authorized officer that the rental payment schedule does not reasonably reflect fair market rent, other reasonable means will be used to estimate the rental payment. The BLM reserves the right to use individual appraisals or other valuation procedures to calculate rental payments for communication uses. Periodic Review of Rental Schedule
