The development of China's industry and agriculture requires energy and while the development of nuclear power is attracting more and more attention from the Party and the State, growth in this area is restricted by the industrial base and by the State's financial resources. As a result, the State hopes to develop a next-generation PWR that will be safer, simpler, and more economical. Since 1986, experts and S&T personnel from NPIC have learned from China's successful nuclear power research and design and have intensely followed the leading edge technologies of improved foreign reactors; they have now completed the research and design process for an improved 600MWe PWR, the AC-600. This reactor has a core with a higher safety margin, less complicated systems, and non-dynamic systems safety measures which have earned the approval of international atomic energy organizations. It is now known that the conceptual design was completed in 1987, and the independent feasibility study for the AC-600 was completed in 1990, pushing forward the 1991-1995 development plan; the China Nuclear Industry Corporation and the State Science and Technology Commission have both signed off on this plan. According to this plan, in 1995 the NPIC will have completed the testing and analysis of the overall design of the AC-600 reactor, the low flow velocity, critical heat flow density, and other crucial items. To date, the key item in the overall design, the critical heat flow density, has been completed and the three non-dynamic safety systems are being assembled with a projected date of completion of 1995; work on other items is on schedule. Based on preliminary analysis and the current developmental work, the AC-600 could be China's next-generation PWR power plant in the year 2000.
