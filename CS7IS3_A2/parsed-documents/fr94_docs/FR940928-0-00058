Newly redesignated ยง430.23 is amended by adding paragraph (r) to read as follows: ยง430.23 Test procedures for measures of energy consumption. * * * * * (r) General Service Fluorescent Lamps and General Service Incandescent Lamps. (1) The Estimated Annual Energy Consumption for lamps defined in ยง430.2, expressed in kilowatt-hours per year, shall be the product of: (i) The input power in kilowatts as determined in accordance with section 4 of Appendix R to this subpart and (ii) The representative average use cycle of 1,000 hours per year, the resulting product then being rounded off to the nearest kilowatt-hour per year. (2) The Lamp Efficacy for general service fluorescent lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps defined in section 430.2 shall be the quotient of the average lumen output and the average lamp wattage as determined in section 4 of Appendix R of this subpart with the resulting quotient rounded off to the nearest lumen per watt. (3) The Lamp Efficacy for general service incandescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps shall be the quotient of the average lumen output and the average lamp wattage as determined in section 4 of Appendix R of this subpart with the resulting quotient rounded off to the nearest tenth of a lumen per watt. (4) The Estimated Annual Operating Cost for lamps defined in ยง430.2, expressed in dollars per year, shall be the product of: (i) The representative average unit energy cost of electricity in dollars per kilowatt-hour as provided by the Secretary, (ii) The representative average use cycle of 1,000 hours per year, and (iii) The input power in kilowatts as determined in accordance with section 4 of Appendix R to this subpart, the resulting product then being rounded off to the nearest dollar per year.
