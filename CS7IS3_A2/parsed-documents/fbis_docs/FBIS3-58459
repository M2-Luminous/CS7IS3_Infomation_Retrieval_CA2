Coeme, who is facing moves to lift his parliamentary immunity, also told a press conference that he knew nothing about the unsolved 1991 murder of former Belgian minister and Socialist Party boss Andre Cools. Persistent press reports said that Cools might have been slain because he knew too much about kickbacks allegedly offered to Coeme's Socialist Party by the Italian firm Agusta, which won a contract for 46 helicopters in 1988. A judicial report on the affair, leaked last week, said Agusta had won the 225 million dollar contract by offering a 413,000 dollar bribe to Coeme's Francophone Socialist Party, part of Belgium's fragile ruling coalition. A special parliamentary commission was due to rule later Thursday on the request from an investigating magistrate that Coeme's parliamentary immunity be lifted so that he can be questioned about the scandal. Coeme, a socialist who is also transport minister but was defence minister when the helicopter contract was signed, said: "I committed no forgery. There were no written forgeries. There were no unfair acts." He rejected demands from political foes that he resign, saying that this would amount to admitting guilt. Coeme added that "I have a feeling of profound injustice" and that he would welcome any chance to clear his name. He said he had submitted to a parliamentary probe a detailed account of how the helicopter contract had been was awarded to Agusta which showed there had been no irregularities or manipulation. Coeme maintained that there had been "insane competition" at the time by lobbyists "circling the case like vultures." The judicial report alleges that Coeme had suppressed recommendations in favour of the German firm Messerschmidt Boelkow Bloehm (MBB) and the French aircraft manufacturer Aerospatiale. The deputy prime minister denied any knowledge of a draft recommendation from Belgium's military purchasing office that a tender from MBB be excluded from consideration. The Belgian parliament was to vote Friday on whether to lift the parliamentary immunity of another two Francophone socialists implicated in the scandal. They are Guy Spitaels, currently head of the regional Francophone Walloon regional government who was Francophone Socialist Party boss in 1988, and Guy Mathot, a member of the Walloon regional government.
