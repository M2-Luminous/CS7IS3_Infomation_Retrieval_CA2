Just like at the closed session on Monday, a large group was formed of those deputies who oppose the documents. For example, Nodar Natadze, leader of the Georgian People's Front, accused the parliamentary majority backing Eduard Shevardnadze of betraying the national interests. The opposition suggested debating the issue on the powers of the Georgian delegation currently staying in Moscow. The Abkhaz deputies in the Georgian parliament opposed the documents. Leader of the parliamentary faction called The National Democrats, Irina Sarishvili, told Interfax that the signed documents are "humiliating for Georgia." She believes they mean for Georgia the loss of Abkhazia. Sarishvili said it appears that the Georgians who fought for their land in Abkhazia were posed as aggressors, while the Abkhaz as fighters for the freedom of their Motherland.
