Russian officials attending the four-day talks explained that to ensure the safety of flights over Siberia it is necessary to limit the number to six per hour, even though new facilities have been built to enhance the reliability of communications equipment. The Russian officials suggested that a parallel route could be established over Siberia that would allow nine filghts an hour, but Japan said the proposal would require building new radar facilities. However, Japan said it would consider the proposal. The two countries will meet again in mid-March. A Japanese Transport Ministry official said Friday that officials were unaware that translators were being used. They stressed that the need for improved traffic control in the Siberian route will increase with the opening of the Kansai International Airport in September. Russia, citing the diminished reliability of its communication facilities, has been restricting the number of commercial flights over Siberia since December to six per hour, only a third of the previous volume of traffic. The restriction initially caused delays of as much as two and a half hours for flights in and out of Narita Airport, and even though the situation has improved since then, flight delays of 30 to 40 minutes are still common, officials said. The Siberian route is the main air route linking Japan and Europe, used daily by some 40 to 50 airliners both into and out of Tokyo.
