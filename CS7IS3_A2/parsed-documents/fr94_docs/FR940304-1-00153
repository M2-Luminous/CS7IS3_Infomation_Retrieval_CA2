FR940304-1-00153 FR940304-1-00014 Table 4&hyph;12._ Payback Periods of Design Options for Microwave Ovens [In years] 1Standard level 1Payback period 1 2.1 2 2.3 3 2.9 4 7.4 5 13.0 3. Significance of Energy Savings for Conventional Ovens To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new conventional ovens under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of product: Level 1_0.69 Quad Level 2_1.41 Quads Level 3_2.40 Quads Level 4_2.69 Quads Level 5_3.88 Quads The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. Significance of energy savings for conventional cooking tops. To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new conventional cooking tops under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of product: Level 1_0.02 Quad Level 2_2.54 Quads Level 3_2.68 Quads Level 4_2.85 Quads Level 5_3.04 Quads The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy.
