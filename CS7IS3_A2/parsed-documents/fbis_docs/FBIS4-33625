This is the position expressed on 7 June by Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral. In his opinion, the complete closing of the border between the two countries is speeding up an imposed, strategic genocide within Haitian society. Cabral also complains that he has not yet received the list promised about one week ago by Dante Caputo. The deputy foreign minister also pointed out that he does not know the date on which to expect the mission of 60 UN observers who have agreed to help with surveillance of the border area.
