The revelation came shortly before the government assembles a panel of experts commissioned with redrawing the border lines of the 300 constituencies for the 500-seat lower chamber. The redistricting plan in question was sketched out by a panel of academics appointed by the 1989 LDP administration of then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. The plan also eyed the creation of 300 single-seat constituencies for the lower chamber. Most of the 38 cities, towns and villages are demanding a change in the redistricting plan on the strength of the resolutions adopted by their local legislative assemblies, ministry officials said. These governments are from Aomori, Saitama, Yamanashi, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Mie and Wakayama Prefectures. These local governments are urging the new redrawing panel -- to be inaugurated soon by the administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- to comply with their specific requests in sketching out new redistricting proposals for the single-seat electorates of the lower chamber. The local governments say the Kaifu administration's redistricting plan, if implemented without necessary adjustments, would break up their locally-unified blocs of policy administration with adjacent municipal governments or communities of local residents. The city of Kuwana in Mie Prefecture told the ministry that the LDP-proposed connection of Kuwana and the other geographically separated municipal government in an unified constituency "would provide a serious stumbling block to the future development of our city." The new redistricting law -- legislated on January 29 -- mandates the redistricting panel to "consider local conditions such as the shape of administrative blocs, geography and the availability of transportation means."
