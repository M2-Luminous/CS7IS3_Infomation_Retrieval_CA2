"It is an important milestone in our march to liberation to have an indigenous African as president after centuries of racist, colonial rule," Mr Makwetu said. The events of the past few weeks had been breathtaking. The huge voter turnout at elections had demonstrated "a deep hunger for democracy among our people". The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's wide-ranging and balanced state of the nation address. It also supported Mr Mandela's intention to subscribe to the United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights, and asked that detention without trial not be used again. People who had committed offences in the struggle against apartheid should be released unconditionally. Other offenders should be released at the discretion of the government of the day. The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's emphasis on development and empowerment. Housing and job creation were important in a society where 8-million people lived in shacks. However, the government had to resist the temptation to borrow money and had to keep inflation in check.
