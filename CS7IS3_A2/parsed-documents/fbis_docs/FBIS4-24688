Tian Fengshan, acting governor of the provincial government; and Cong Fukui, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Wang Zongzhang, vice governors of the provincial government, were present at the meeting. Yue Qifeng said that we should further deeply study the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and use the theory on building the socialism with Chinese characteristics to liberate and army our ideas and to guide our work. Yue Qifeng said: How to strengthen and improve the leadership of the party is also an important issue. We should bring into full play the functions of the government and its functional departments. The provincial party committee will go all out to support the work of the government. In regard to the economic work, Yue Qifeng said: I agree to the ideology of extension in five aspects and acceleration in two aspects. The key is [words indistinct]. To really target and see results, we should emancipate the mind and change our ideas, the party as a whole should be mobilized, and all people should go into action. It is necessary to achieve the transformation and reform of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and to develop agriculture. We should also cultivate new economic growing points and pioneer the second battle field for the economy. That is, we should vigorously develop town and township enterprises, the industries run by districts and neighborhood committees, private and individual enterprises, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, the tertiary industry, and new high-tech enterprises. The governments at various levels should emancipate the mind, create conditions, offer policies to support the development of the enterprises and industries of these kinds. All departments should deeply conduct investigations and study and work out methods. Only by so doing will the ideology of five extensions and two accelerations not become an empty talk. Yue Qifeng said: Local officers should do deeds for localities. We should pay attention to the development of the local economy. Only when the local economy is developed will the overall situation be better inspired. Yue Qifeng said: How to build our party in the new historical period is an important task. The issues of what we should grasp to promote party building, who should grasp party building, and how to grasp party building should be explored. Viewing the general situation, we know that party building and the spiritual civilization are still two weak links at present. We should not only see that our party has prestige, combat effectiveness, and prospects but also not ignore the existing problems. So, we should persist in the principle of being sure that both hands are tough. Acting Governor Tian Fengshan set forth requirements for the work of the provincial government. He said: The major task of the provincial government is to implement to the letter the principles and policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council and the policy decisions of the provincial party committee. What is the most important task at present is that the leaders at various levels should concentrate their energy, be inspired with enthusiasm, be diligent in performing their official duties, quietly immerse themselves in hard work, and achieve their work in a down-to-earth manner. The leaders at various levels should go deep to the rural areas and enterprises, get in touch with the grass roots, and bravely overcome difficulties and solve problems. The government should embody the policy of taking a two-hand approach in dealing with its work, ensure the smooth implementation of government decrees, strengthen the improvement of administrative honesty and diligence, resolutely correct the unhealthy trends within trades, firmly foster the thinking of service, and build itself into a government with high efficiency and administrative honesty and enjoying prestige among the masses of the people.
