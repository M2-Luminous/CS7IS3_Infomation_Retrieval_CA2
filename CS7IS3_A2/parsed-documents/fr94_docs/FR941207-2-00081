At any time up until the cross, users can review, edit or cancel their orders. B. Market Maker Guarantees In addition to orders entered by users, Chicago Match will include guarantees by Chicago Match market makers. Theses market makers will be Exchange members who register with the Exchange to be Chicago Match market makers. As such, they will be obligated to guarantee a minimum execution size to all users of the system. The minimum size of the guarantee will be ten thousand shares for the two hundred securities listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange with the highest consolidated trading volume, five thousand shares for the one hundred securities with the next highest trading volume and two thousand shares for all other securities. 22 Market maker guarantees automatically will be entered into the Chicago Match at the start of the time for order entry. 22 See proposed CHX Article XXXVII, Rule 2(g). C. Priority and Liquidity Fees and Credits Chicago Match permits the use of liquidity fees and liquidity credits to determine the level of priority for order matching. In the Chicago Match, the size of the liquidity fee or liquidity credit determines the level of priority for order matching. Those users that are willing to pay the highest liquidity fee will have the highest execution priority (except for orders that are a part of the CHX quote, which have the highest priority of all orders). Those users desiring to be paid for providing liquidity will have the lowest priority. Liquidity fees and credits will only be paid when an order with a liquidity fee is matched with an order with a liquidity credit. When a match occurs, a liquidity fee that is equal to the size of the liquidity credit will be paid. In all other cases, no liquidity fees will be paid. Users enter liquidity fees and credits when they enter orders. The Chicago Match will include a default liquidity fee or credit to be associated with a specific Chicago Match guarantee by a CHX market maker. 23 Chicago Match market makers can improve this liquidity fee or credit and increase the size of their guarantee before the cross takes place. 23 The term ``default liquidity fee or credit'' refers to the liquidity fee or liquidity credit associated with buy and sell orders in each security in which a Chicago Match market maker is registered, which are automatically entered into the Chicago Match. The size of each such Chicago Match Market Maker Order shall be equal to the Default Size, which is the minimum guarantee the market maker must provide. ( See proposed Article XXXVII, Rules 2(g) and 6(C).) The Chicago Match will limit the size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits entered by users. If a liquidity fee is greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer for the particular security at cross time it will be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time. For example, if 1/2 of the spread is 61/4 cents, and an order with a liquidity fee of 10 cents is entered, the maximum liquidity fee that order can pay will be 61/4 cents. Liquidity credits, however, will be treated differently than liquidity fees. The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be entered in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. For example, if the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time was 1/2 (50 cents), the maximum liquidity credit allowed would be 25 cents. If an order was entered with a liquidity credit greater than 25 cents, the user would have the option of either having the liquidity credit reduced to half of the spread or having the order excluded from the match. D. Order Execution The CHX's publicly disseminated bid or offer will be entered into Chicago Match as an order. 24 Once entered, these orders will have the highest priority for execution. 25 24 Quotations will be updated until the time of the order matching. 25 These orders will be entered with a liquidity credit equal to 1/2 of the spread of the consolidated best bid and offer. These orders will be entitled to full execution ahead of the other orders within the group that have the same liquidity credit. All matched orders will be executed at a random time within a predetermined ten minute window period at the market price at such time. The Chicago Match will calculate the market price as the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer regardless of the size of the spread. For example, if the Consolidated Best Bid and Best Offer of stock X was 20&hyph;201/8, the cross price would be 201/16. Limited price orders, orders with a liquidity fee or credit entered in cents, and orders that are entered with a liquidity fee or credit relative to the Consolidated Best Bid or Offer or as a computed quantity (in addition to liquidity fees or credits entered in cents) will be eligible to be displayed over the system. The Exchange will assign numeric values to these orders based on the then current Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The Exchange anticipates that initially it will update displayed information at least every fifteen minutes. 26 26 In particular, the numerical values of orders entered relative to the Consolidated Bid and Offer will need to be updated as the market price changes prior to the match. Chicago Match users also may enter linked orders, which are defined as orders whose execution are conditioned on the execution (or non-execution) of one or more orders. For example, a user may only want to sell stock X if he can buy stock Z. A user would than link his sell order of stock X to his buy order of stock Z. When the match occurs, the user's order to sell stock X will only be executed if the user's order to buy stock Z is also executed. Otherwise, both orders will remain unmatched. The Exchange believes that permitting the linking of orders, and permitting orders that specify a limit price, will give money managers greater cash management capabilities. The CHX states that this flexibility will increase the effective match rate of the system relative to that of other crossing systems.
