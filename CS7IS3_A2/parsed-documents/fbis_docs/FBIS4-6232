However, we must always highly rate the duty of strengthening party unity because although, generally, out party is united, some party organs and party committees are facing a lack of unity -- serious in some places; some party cadres and party members do not strictly observe the principle of democratic centralism; and hostile forces are finding ways of interfering with our internal affairs, degrading our cadres' political and moral quality, and dividing us in line with the implementation of their "peaceful evolution" conspiracy. In order to strengthen internal unity, we must perform many tasks. Party committees must outline appropriate measures suitable for their practical conditions. But there is a common point that all party organs, cadres, and members must take heed of: this is the implementation of the party principles on organization and activity, beginning with the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership and individual responsibility. These very principles, on one hand, help to develop the party's intellectual ability so that it can reduce mistakes and shortcomings in its decision and ensure the party's stable and dynamic management. On the other hand, they make sure that our party is a united bloc and a strong organization. It is necessary to stress that these principles do not destroy democracy. The party statures clearly state: In organizing and in discussing all issues, every party member is allowed to fully express his view. However, when an issue has been decided upon by the majority, a person with a view which is in the minority can retain his view, but he must conform with the decision of the majority. Together with the implementation of these principles, the political report clearly points out that party cadres and party members must inculcate in themselves a revolutionary morality and a healthy lifestyle and fight against waste, corruption, illegal business practices, individualism, indiscipline, authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness, because these evils will lead to disunity. c. The national block must be broadened, and the close relationship between the party and public must be consolidated. Uncle Ho's thought must be promulgated to broadly unite the Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause for national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward the goal of a prosperous population, a strong nation, and a just and civilized society. We must consider the national interest as our common goal. At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as they do not run counter to the national interest. We should eliminate obsessions and hatred and look forward to the future. The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all state guidance, policies, and laws. Is national unity a strategic policy? National unity is a fundamental policy of our party and state. The ideology of great unity must be manifested in all state guidance, policies, and laws and in all areas of politics, economy, society, security, national defense, and foreign affairs to meet the legitimate interest and aspiration of people from all walks of life; link benefit with responsibility and individual interest with citizenship obligation; respect national interest; and create favorable conditions and an environment to completely liberate the power of production and encourage all people and economic sectors to increase production, improve business, enrich themselves legally, practice thrift for national construction and protection, and continuously improve the people's material and cultural life. At the same time, it encourages all people to satisfactorily implement social welfare policies by repaying debts to people who have rendered meritorious service to the nation, to participate in public work and charity and humanitarian activities, and to help each another eliminate starvation, reduce poverty, and develop the tradition of kindness and gratitude of our ancestors. We must broaden the national unity in diversified forms. We must organize and develop more new activity forms from low to higher levels and create different forms suitable to different walks of life. We must develop the active role of exemplary persons in all social classes, levels of society, ethnic communities, and religions. We must direct our activity to villages, subwards, and households. And we must consolidate the alliance between the worker and the peasant and intellectuals, making it a foundation for national unity. d. We have to reform the cadre-related work. First, we must renew the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying cadres, especially key cadres. Gifted people must be trained, encouraged, and employed. We have to create favorable conditions for sound people -- both inside and outside the party and inside and outside the country -- to contribute their best efforts for the nation. We have to rejuvenate the contingent of cadres and promote elderly cadres with sound knowledge, experience, political stance, and health. Woman and ethnic cadres must be given special attention. And we must fight narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination.
