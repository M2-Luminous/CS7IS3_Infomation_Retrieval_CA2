Turkey said it took the decision after NATO's Southern European Allied Forces Commander Micheal Boord's call that an air operation will be launched against Serbia if it fails to withdraw its forces from Sarajevo in ten days. The 16-membered NATO earlier agreed to order air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo unless they withdraw artillery and other heavy weapons at least 20 km (12 miles) or put them under U.N. control within 10 days. General Staff spokesman Dogun Silahcioglu told an AA reporter that with the reinforcement Turkish Air Forces will have 18 F-16 type warplanes in Ghedi base that will be ready for the air operation. Meanwhile, AA learned that Greece did not give permission for the eight F-16 warplanes to pass through Greek airspace. Officials said Turkish warplanes will pass to Ghedi base over the Mediterranean Sea on Feb 14.
