Vivekanand] [Text] Jordan, American, U.N. and Lloyds Register representatives are holding talks in New York on the modalities of a proposed land-based regime at al-'Aqabah to verify adherence to the international sanctions against Iraq, official and other sources said Saturday [7 May]. Although Washington has accepted the Jordanian proposal that Lloyds Register take charge of the verifications, several key issues remain to be agreed upon before the arrangement could go into place at al-'Aqabah, according to the sources. "For some reason or the other, the Americans are taking their own time even on issues that need very little clarification," said one source. "At this rate, it could be several weeks if not months before a final agreement is reached." U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the American acceptance of the proposal, subject to "finetuning," after a meeting with His Majesty King Husayn in London on April 25. Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali said last week that the U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea had not intercepted and delayed any al-'Aqabah-bound vessel after the King's meeting with Mr. Christopher. But, Dr. al-Majali said, this did not mean that the interceptions had stopped. He added that no progress had been made in having the onshore verifications regime in place at al-'Aqabah. France announced last week that it was withdrawing from the so-called multinational interception force (MIF) in line with the Jordanian effort to end the damaging sea-based inspections of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. According to the source, the issues on the table in the ongoing discussions in New York involve the mechanism for Lloyds Register's presence at al-'Aqabah, modalities of ensuring adherence to the U.N. resolutions that imposed the international sanctions against Iraq and who will pay the cost for Lloyds Register presence at al-'Aqabah. (The sources could not confirm reports that Jordan might be seeking a Security Council announcement that the offshore inspections are being replaced with an onshore verification regime). On the first point, Jordan has proposed that a Lloyds Register representative be included in a team along with port officials, clearning agents and shipping agents which will observe Jordanian customs inspection of all incoming and outgoing cargo related to Jordan, the source said. Such teams are a permanent fixture of all import and export procedures at the port in line with Jordanian customs regulations. "The customs and the port authority are the two sides that never change," noted a shipping source, noting that other participants will be a representative of the clearing agent nominated by the importer and another nominated by the concerned shipping agents. Under the proposal, Lloyds Register will join the customs and ports officials as standing members of the team until such time the situation in the international sanctions against Iraq is changed. "This agreement will concern cargo coming into and going out of the Jordnian market," said the source. "Actually this is a concession that Jordan is making. There is no rule that says Jordan-bound cargo should be inspected or observed by anyone." All Iraq-bound cargo in transit through Jordan will be stored at a separate warehouse, and will be cleared according to the guidelines set by the U.N. Sanctions Committee. "All items other than food and medicine should have the approval of the Sanctions Committee," said the soruce. "Those that might arrive at the port will have to await such approval wherever that is necessary." Sufian Muhaisan, manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents Association (JSAA), confirmed that this was the broad outline of the Jordanian proposal. "Jordan is abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and there is no reason why Jordanian imports or exports should be inspected or even observed," Mr. Muhaisan told the JORDAN TIMES. "Lloyds Register can observe what is going on at the port and what kind of goods come into and go out of Jordan and file its reports," he said. "Nothing more, nothing less," he added without elaboration. Another point in the New York discussions is payment for Lloyds Register for its observatory presence at al-'Aqabah. The Sanctions Committee has refused to accept a Jordanian request that the United Nations pay the cost, the sources said. The request was made by Prime Minister al-Majali when he addressed the committee in New York in December. Subsequently Jordan proposed that the Amman government pay the costs and reduce the amount from the Kingdom's annual contribution to the U.N., the sources said. it was not clear by Saturday whether the world body had accepted the proposal. Reports from London said the amount being discussed was between $2 million and $3 million per year. There was no confirmation of these reports.
