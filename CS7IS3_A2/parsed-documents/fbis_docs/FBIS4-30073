In interbank trading, the unsecured overnight call rate was traded at 2 2/32 to 2 3/32 percent. On the open market, the rate on newly issued three-month certificates of deposit was offered around 2.11-2.13 percent. Considering the yen's recent gain against the dollar, the central bank's supply of funds was rather smaller than expected, said a dealer at a Japanese commercial bank. Some expect the central bank to continue its monetary stance to stabilize longer-term interest rates for some time. A dealer at a long-term credit bank said, "It will be a long time before the Bank of Japan tries to lead interest rates lower to check the yen's appreciation." The bank of Japan injected 300 billion yen into the market by purchasing one-week discount bills worth 200 billion yen and by lending 100 billion yen to commercial banks, against the projected shortage of 320 billion yen for the day. As of Wednesday, reserves by commercial banks in the central bank coffers were 300 billion yen over the required amount.
