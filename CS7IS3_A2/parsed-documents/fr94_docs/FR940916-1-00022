SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this notice are Randall N. Crenwelge, Project Manager, and Mary-Jo Cooney, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff, (G&hyph;MS&hyph;A). Background and Discussion Executive Order 12770 (E.O. 12770), signed on July 25, 1991, and the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;418) both designate the metric system as the preferred system of measurement for U.S. trade and commerce. E.O. 12770 requires Federal departments and agencies to use the metric system in their activities, including procurements, grants, regulations, and agency programs and functions related to trade, industry, and commerce. Metric usage must be in accordance with section 3 of the Metric Conversion Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;168, 89 Stat. 1007), as amended by section 5164(b) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988. Federal departments and agencies may claim an exemption from the requirement to convert, if use of the metric system would be impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms. Proposed exceptions to metric usage must follow an effective process of review by heads of departments and agencies. The U.S. Coast Guard's Metric Transition Plan, as required by E.O. 12770, is specified in COMDTINST 5711.2. The Chief of the Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection has established the strategy and procedures for metrication in the ``Procedures for Metrication in the Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection,'' dated February 26, 1993. A future rulemaking will implement a portion of that strategy. English to Metric Conversion Methods The Coast Guard is considering several methods for converting the English system measurements in its regulations to the metric system.
