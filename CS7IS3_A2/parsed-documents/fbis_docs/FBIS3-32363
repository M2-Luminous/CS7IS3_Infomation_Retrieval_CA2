The voting, which will continue until 1800 (0000 GMT), began with absolute normalcy, a large turnout, and great enthusiasm at the 8,363 polling tables throughout the country. Initial results will begin to be known by 2000 (0200 GMT) and shortly thereafter the winner, who will govern the country for a four-year period beginning 8 May, replacing Rafael Angel Calderon, will be announced. On the eve of the elections, the two main presidential candidates, Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez and Social Democrat Jose Maria Figueres maintained a close tie, according to several surveys. As part of the elections, besides electing a president and two vice presidents, Costa Ricans will reelect members to the Legislative Assembly, composed of 57 deputies, and authorities of 81 municipalities throughout the country. Approximately 3,000 policemen will guarantee order during the process. All through the day and until tomorrow, a "dry law" banning the sale of liquor will be enforced. The restriction began Friday night, when electoral propaganda also stopped to give voters a 48-hour reflection period.
