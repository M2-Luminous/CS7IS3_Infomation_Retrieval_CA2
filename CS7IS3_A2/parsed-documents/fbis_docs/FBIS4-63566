In a statement issued on Monday, Kostikov said that extremists have lately stepped up their activity in the war zone in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Violence against civilians, hostage taking and killings continue in the region. There have been attempts to involve Russian soldiers and officers carrying out a peace-keeping mission in the region to involve in the war. "Especially inadmissible are the facts when representatives of the local administrations become organisers of and participants in acts of violence. Russian authorities will not tolerate glaring violations of human rights and law in the zone of the state of emergency," Kostikov said. Calling on the people of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to resist provocations of extremists seeking to derail the peace process in the region, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stresses that law enforcement bodies in the war zone have all necessary rights and means to stamp out extremism and protect the civilians, Kostikov said.
