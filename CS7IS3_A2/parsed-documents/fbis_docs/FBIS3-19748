Karayalcin said, "What is graver, however, is for the Turkish economy to enter the process of becoming based on the dollar, for the Turkish lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium of exchange." Noting that the preservation of national sovereignty is closely linked to reliability of the Turkish lira, Karayalcin proposed that urgent measures be started for Central Bank autonomy. The SHP leader said that the excessive dependence on domestic and foreign loans makes it impossible to produce an alternative policy in the short term. Murat Karayalcin, speaking in his party's TBMM [Turkish Grand National Assembly] group meeting yesterday, evaluated recent economic developments. Karayalcin, whose criticism drew attention, said that he was "worried" that the economy's dependence on domestic and foreign loans would eventually create important problems from the standpoint of exercising sovereignty rights. Karayalcin, stressing that we are "gradually becoming a nonproductive, but consumer society, said the following: ``The savings rate in 1993 was a marginal 15.3 percent. This is an incredibly low level. A country that has a marginal savings rate of 15 percent cannot finance its own development. For domestic and foreign loan dependency to be this extensive makes it impossible to produce alternative policies in the short term. Some measures have been taken. But we will not feel the effect of the Taxation Law until after 1995. We hope the public sector's loan requirements can be reduced by 1995. Certainly we have to increase domestic savings to reduce the economy's dollar dependency.'' Noting that Turkey largely lost in the 1950s the savings structure of society of the 1930-40's, Karayalcin said, "We must concentrate in the 1990's on measures to base growth largely on domestic resources." Status of Turkish Lira `Grave' Karayalcin stressed that for domestic and foreign loan requirements to be this high was "grave" and continued: "However, what is graver is for the Turkish economy to enter the process of becoming based on the dollar. For the Turkish lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium of exchange is a more serious problem that high domestic and foreign loans. There is a question of an approach of indexing rental contracts and commodity prices to the dollar. And even more serious is that our citizens have begun to use foreign currency as a savings medium. The SHP considers our national currency's loss of value and respect an extremely negative development. The preservation of national sovereignty, as well as other elements, is closely linked to reliability of the Turkish lira. It is impossible as a whole to speak of the Turkish lira's gaining respect, or of fully exercising national sovereignty rights. The problem is not just to preserve the economic balances, but that our national currency gain respect at the same time." Karayalcin said that efforts toward Central Bank autonomy must begin urgently. Stressing that there is an inverse relationship between an autonomous Central Bank and inflation, Karayalcin said, "The Central Bank must, within a reasonable period of time, cease to be a body that serves the Treasury alone and become autonomous. Autonomy, on which agreement must be reached in the next few years and which would be implemented at a time that would not put a squeeze on the economy, is important from the standpoint of the European Union also."
