It gave one a strange feeling to walk into Sabbatsberg, Stockholm's main emergency clinic, on a Tuesday afternoon and find the personnel gathered in the coffee room. A box of chocolates--a gift from a grateful patient--was being passed around. "Things used to be hopping around here, but now we jump if the telephone rings," head nurse Soren Carlsson joked. Humor was mixed with bitterness and anger. Because lying around everywhere were yellow slips of paper confirming that the end was near: The emergency clinic will shut down on Friday. When that happens, the telephones will stop ringing for good, and the empty ambulance garage, where the personnel have set up a temporary "therapy corner" with good and bad papier-mache figures (one of the bad figures has been christened Ralph Ledel), will be demolished. People commonly referred to as the victims of society's dark side--knifing victims, traffic victims, and heroin abusers--will be taken to other emergency rooms: at St. Goran, Caroline, and Huddinge Hospitals. It is not just Sabbatsberg's emergency room that will disappear: The entire hospital will be closed on 15 December and reopened after the first of the year as a local hospital operated by M&M Medical, Inc., with from 40 to 50 employees. Sabbatsberg's 1,600 employees are being scattered around among various places. The building contractor is already busy making alterations to the former alcohol detox unit. "We were not supposed to close before the end of November, but everything is being speeded up. Even though it is not possible to close down a hospital in two months," said an indignant Carlsson. Politicians in the Toilet He was not alone in his feelings--or his humiliation over the politicians' decision, which seems to be anything but well founded economically. Among other things, the brand-new operating rooms are being put "in mothballs." "We have a palace that we have to leave. Everything works perfectly--it is easy to operate," said a nurse in the operating unit. She laughed when SVENSKA DAGBLADET's photographer Jurek Holzer caught sight of a little monument on the wall: a chamber pot the bottom of which was decorated with two pictures of politicians responsible for the change. "That was put up when feelings were at their peak," said the nurse, who was unwilling to have her name printed in the newspaper. To some extent, anger has given way to resignation. Several gaps can be seen in the list of scheduled operations. The number of patients has fallen off, and so has the number of personnel. Most of the employees know where they will go after the end of the year, but there is still anger over the way the assignments were made. "We received notices to indicate our interests last spring, but then the answers were a long time coming. And when they did, we had only one week in which to answer or become unemployed. For mothers of small children, that was tremendously difficult." Sabbatsberg has a specialist clinic for jaw operations. Surgeon Hans Bystedt will perform his final operation on 8 December. The decision as to where the clinic will move to will be made the following day. That decision has already been postponed once, and Bystedt does not seem fully convinced that it will be made on 9 December either. Want To Go to Soder Hospital "We will probably be relegated to some shack," he said with a laugh. Then he became serious and talked about finances and cooperation with the plastic surgeons and ear, nose, and throat specialists at Soder Hospital. "We want to go there, but the administration wants to move us to Caroline Hospital. The most important thing is to keep the waiting list from growing longer. Most of our patients are young, and for them, a six-month wait is an eternity." There was an atmosphere of leave-taking in the air, even though work was proceeding as usual. In the newly renovated X-ray department--the city's best, said department head Anders Tyden proudly--one could hear a statement that is common at Sabbatsberg these days: "So long! I'm off to take a look at my new job." And in the emergency unit's coffee room, Asa, Maj-Britt, and Soren were already talking about memories of the years at Sabbatsberg. "I'll never forget the guy who escaped and smashed up the cars in the parking lot." "Do you remember the meadow just outside? And the cafe across the street where we used to buy pastry?"
