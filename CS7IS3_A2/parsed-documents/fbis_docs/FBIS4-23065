Shevchenko and N. Espinosa-Ortis; UDC 621.372.8] [Abstract] a third variant of the method of shift formulas for design of asymmetric planar optical waveguides is proposed, two variants of this method having already been described (V.V. Shevchenko; RADIOTEKHNIKA I ELEKTRONIKA, Vol. 31 No. 5, May 86). Unlike the _a_-method of transverse waves and the k-method of wave numbers, this k_a_-method yields a complete expansion of a mode field into modes of a reference waveguide. This method is demonstrated on the TE-mode in a waveguide with a nonhomogeneous guiding layer between two different homogeneous outer layers. As the equivalent reference waveguide for comparative evaluation is used one with a homogeneous guiding layer, as is being done in the other two methods. The field function is obtained from the appropriate wave equations by the usual procedure. The resulting equation for the amplitude of the transverse electric field component is then used for both approximate analytical and exact numerical calculation of the key waveguide parameters such as the critical frequencies and the propagation constants, also the spectral parameter. For illustration is considered a waveguide for surface waves with a guiding layer which has a truncated exponential profile of dielectric permittivity. All those key parameters of its modes have been calculated for various values of the exponent q, to confirm the expediency of this method. Approximate (analytical) calculations may as well be made by the _a_-method, inasmuch as the k_a_ method does not refine the results within the entire 0 � q > � range of the exponent. Exact (numerical) calculations for surface waveguides as well as for embedded ones should, however, made by the k_a_ method. Figures 4; references 4. @t
