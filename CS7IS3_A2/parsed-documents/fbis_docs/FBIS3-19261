Pries: "Rebuff"] [Text] "Disrespect of laws," "impertinence," "deeply disappointed," "most concerned" -- it is a long time since words like these were last heard in U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations. Christopher went to Beijing to request respect for "The Universal Declaration on Human Rights," a respect to which Bill Clinton wants to link the most-favored-nation status for Chinese exports to the United States. However, the guest was coolly told that China had "a concept of its own" regarding human rights and -- if Washington could afford it at all -- Beijing could, if necessary, even do without that particular favor. True, by the standards of the complacent West, one will hardly be able to approve of the way in which China treats political opponents. Whether such standards are applicable for the huge Middle Kingdom, however, remains dubious. In a nutshell, "China's concept" of human rights consists in guaranteeing an improvement of the living conditions for the more than 1 billion Chinese. A great deal remains to be done in this connection and Beijing will be measured by the Chinese themselves if and when it fulfills the promise. Experience has shown that no one can force a different concept on the Chinese leadership from the outside. Even less so if the advocates of "universal human rights" prove to be hypocritical. Did the United States care for human rights at all when the "Chinese card" could still be played as a trump against Moscow? And how would it want to guarantee the most primitive human rights if China were to experience catastrophes like the current ones in the crumbling Soviet State and in the Balkans?
