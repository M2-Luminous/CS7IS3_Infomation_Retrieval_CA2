The project was initiated by residents of Lugansk. A joint resolution "On Additional Measures To Increase Mutual Supplies of Consumer Goods to Donetsk, Dniepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, and Lugansk Oblasts" was signed. Given the payment crisis and lack of credits and funds for trade, the only viable option remaining, officials believe, is to conclude direct agreements among enterprises, which would quickly and efficiently fill store shelves with goods. The agreement specified terms of trade and economic cooperation and established groups coordinating mutual efforts, ATN reported.
