[Shoniya] Recently, these relations have undergone not just substantial, but we might say fundamental changes. Mutual alienation, which at times prompted us to look at each other as virtual enemies, has disappeared. As early as October 1992, Azerbaijan and Russia signed a treaty that laid the legal foundation for relations of friendship and cooperation between the two sovereign states. However, it soon turned out that, putting it bluntly, they took this step for the sake of appearances. At present, the new Government of Azerbaijan is having to scrupulously restore everything that was so quickly and "expertly" destroyed at the previous stage. [Akhundova] Do you blame only the Azeri side for severing relations? [Shoniya] Perhaps some of the blame also devolves on Russia. However, there is a reason why they say: "Love cannot be compelled." The Russian leadership heard nothing but rebukes from the lips of the former leaders of Azerbaijan--this was still the same Soviet empire, it wanted yet again to "swallow up" Azerbaijan, strip it of its independence, and so on, and so forth. As I observed how anti-Russian sentiment was fueled in the society, I became convinced at the same time that this sentiment did not reflect public opinion. In this regard, a trip to Agdam shortly before its occupation became a particular revelation for me. As I socialized with common Azeris, I understood that these people have a very good attitude toward Russia and Russians. At the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, I understood that some kind of change was coming. [Akhundova] Leaders of the People's Front have a different point of view on this. They believe that in June 1993, a quite commonplace coup d'etat occurred in which the hand of Moscow clearly shines through. [Shoniya] This is absolutely absurd. Russia strictly adhered to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of Azerbaijan. I speak in all sincerity: personally, I did not receive any instructions to support someone, to place my bets on someone, etc. [Akhundova] Recently, representatives of the opposition have written that the admission of Azerbaijan to the CIS has failed to produce the desired results. The war in Karabakh goes on and, allegedly, will go on until Azerbaijan accepts all conditions set by Russia, the main condition being for Russian troops to return to the original lines in Azerbaijan. [Shoniya] Nobody ever set such conditions for Azerbaijan when it joined the CIS. Besides, what kind of raising of the issue is this: we joined the CIS, but this accomplished nothing for us. Allow me to ask: What did the policy of the previous authorities accomplish for Azerbaijan--a policy of alienation from Russia, from other republics of the Commonwealth? Strained relations developed even between Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Did this policy accomplish anything for the people of Azerbaijan? [Akhundova] Do you believe that the introduction of Russian troops to the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict under the aegis of peacekeeping forces could play a positive role? [Shoniya] Russia will assume the burden of responsibility if the two sides ask it to. That is, if you want assistance we will provide it; if you do not want it, we are not going to impose ourselves; you sort it out yourselves. At times, we hear absolutely absurd assertions: Since the issue is not being resolved, it means that Russia is getting in the way in order to allegedly force Azerbaijan to make concessions. I beg your pardon, but it was Azeri troops that were defeated in Karabakh, and not Russia. The myth about military assistance allegedly being provided by Russia to Armenia is by now obvious to all. As far as the so-called "wild" assistance from mercenary adventurers is concerned, we are aware of the facts: Russians have also taken part in combat operations on the Azeri side. [Akhundova] A few words about the most acute problems of the Russian-speaking population.... [Shoniya] The seizure of apartments is one of the "painful" problems of the Russian-speaking population of the republic on which I indeed work thoroughly. A person leaves home for an hour or two, but when he returns he finds his apartment taken. In all of this, it is extremely difficult to evict those who have seized someone else's living space. Local authorities do nothing, make excuses, and some hide behind the refugee problem, which is altogether not noble. Refugees are the most pressing problem in Azerbaijan. However, it will not be solved by replacing one set of refugees with another. Numerous apartment seizures inflame and destabilize the situation in the republic. I understand that the rights of not just the Russian-speaking but also the indigenous population are being infringed upon. Can you imagine that Azeris sometimes approach me with complaints about the arbitrariness of the authorities? However, when interests of the Russian-speaking population are affected this assumes a different coloring, and a problem of daily life is frequently elevated to the level of an interethnic problem. [Akhundova] You maintain continuous contacts with the Russian-speaking citizens of Azerbaijan. What is their mood at present? [Shoniya] At a certain point, some kind of hopelessness appeared in the community of Russian-speaking residents, hence the mood of having their bags packed. Many left the republic literally with tears in their eyes. Azerbaijan is their motherland, the motherland of their fathers and grandfathers. The people became very hopeful following the change in the political situation in Azerbaijan. However, I am apprehensive about the feeling of hopelessness reemerging if the authorities fail to make timely and specific decisions concerning specific issues. On occasion, the powers that be openly tell the people whose apartments have been seized: We will help to have your living space vacated, but for this or that amount of money. The people throw up their hands, lose hope, and head for the embassy to either file for citizenship or ask for assistance in leaving the confines of the republic. Therefore, the main point at present is to overcome the indifference and criminal negligence of local authorities because at the level of the government we find full support and mutual understanding. [Akhundova] My last question: What are the prospects for state-to-state relations between Azerbaijan and Russia in the new year? [Shoniya] They give us hope, but we will have to work very much and very hard. I would not be telling the truth if I said that I view state-to-state relations as divorced from the Karabakh problem--this festering wound on the body of your republic. The position of the Russian leadership is unambiguous: it advocates most resolutely the unconditional and unqualified return of all the seized territory. As far as Nagorno-Karabakh is concerned, the parties should find a mutually acceptable way to settle the conflict.
