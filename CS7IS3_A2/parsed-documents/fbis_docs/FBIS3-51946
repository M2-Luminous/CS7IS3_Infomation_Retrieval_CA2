Taking a look backward is always a good exercise. If we do so with an open and constructive attitude, we may find out where the problems were and where we can refocus our actions to help improve future prospects. Many international, political, economic, and social factors were present in 1993. They all had an impact on the year now ending, one of the worst of the last 14 years for Nicaragua. The living conditions of large parts of society deteriorated; a considerable number of agricultural, industrial, commercial, and service enterprises had to close their doors or are now on the verge of bankruptcy. The unemployed population has continued to grow; frustration levels have soared; there has been a surge in crime; and the insecurity felt by citizens all over the nation has increased. Delays in the arrival of foreign aid and the strings attached to it have served as an economic disincentive and have had psychological repercussions on important sectors of our national life. In addition, the continuing infighting of Nicaragua's political class has fostered a climate of constant anxiety. Moreover, the rigid application of erratic and contradictory economic policies has deteriorated still further the social conditions of the majority of the population. Economics Despite all this, particularly the erroneous economic policies of the year that is ending, and thanks to the good luck of abundant rainfalls all over Nicaragua, some encouraging signals for agricultural prospects in 1994 have appeared. Agriculture is the backbone of Nicaragua's economic and social life. There is no doubt that the transition process Nicaragua is going through is complex and difficult. Inconsistency in the application of economic instruments and a highly compartmentalized view of economic, political, and social processes, combined with the difficulties imposed by the international context, meant that the economic recovery and social stability goals for 1993 were not achieved. The economy is still seen by government policymakers as part of an accounting system, in which all the effort is concentrated on making sure that the various accounts close out, without thinking that the economy is more than simple addition and subtraction. Economics involves social and productive relations that must be taken into account, but 1993 was marked by a deep recession that will produce a new decline in the GDP [gross domestic product] of 0.7 percent and a further erosion of per capita income. Policies and Undesired Effects Unemployment and underemployment rose to over 50 percent of the economically active population; a third of the nation's households are living in extreme poverty. Deregulation and privatization of the economy, intended to reduce state intervention and shift more responsibility to the private sector, have not helped to stimulate the economic and productive process. On the contrary, the state has been reduced, but its regulatory capacity has not grown stronger; instead, this process has created greater disruption in the production and circulation of goods and services, with negative effects on the population. The existence of a certain overvaluation of the cordoba in relation to the dollar, the high degree of indexing of the economy, and the rapid tariff-lowering process were factors which, rather than helping to develop markets, have distorted markets. These policies have deepened the economic recession and produced a greater concentration of income. As production has continued to fall, the economy has grown more vulnerable to the vagaries of foreign aid. Therefore, uncertainty and difficulties related to the availability of foreign resources may influence changes in economic policy; these factors fed the inflationary spiral and people's expectations. The major policies of 1993 that shored up the stabilization program produced undesired effects. Among those are: - a) Credit policy. Keeping interest rates high was a stimulus to attract resources for the financial system, although they do not support a real credit expansion that will promote production. High interest rates combined with the loan guarantees demanded by commercial banks have barred access to credit for a large number of small producers. - b) Exchange policy. The strong indexing of the economy has kept the exchange rate from serving as a stimulus for export production. Maintaining an overvalued exchange rate in the absence of other complementary policies has slashed gross international reserves, making economic stability even more vulnerable. The Rainy Season, a Positive Factor - c) Fiscal policy. The monetary policy of 1993, which continued to impact on domestic demand, brought about a reduction in real income, leading to a highly restrictive spending policy. This had the effect of worsening the economy in general, causing a deterioration in basic services and higher unemployment. - d) Fixed investment, estimated at 13 percent of the GDP, remained depressed. Public investment, which represents about 60 percent of the total, was less strong than originally projected because of problems with formulation, execution, and follow-up, among others. Private investment experienced a very slight and insufficient growth as if to compensate for cuts in the originally programmed investment. This was due to a lack of clear policies and signals to economic agents, combined with political instability. - e) Despite the factors mentioned above and the recessive character of the economy during 1993, the good rainy season will permit an increase in agricultural production in the 1993-94 season, which could generate moderate economic growth next year. A rapid economic recovery supported by new stimulus policies that should be introduced in 1994 could allow us to turn the 1993 experience around and move to a position of hope and greater optimism. Then we may be able to say that 1993 was the year when we hit the bottom of the barrel, and now the only way we can go is up, as we try not to sink still further in a search for new "false bottoms."
