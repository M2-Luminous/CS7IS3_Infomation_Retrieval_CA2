A working committee would consist of two cabinet ministers, Sok An from the Cambodian Peoples Party and Veng Sereivut from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], and Khmer Rouge officials Tep Khunnal and Chhuon Prasit, the prince said. Sok An said he believed the meeting would take place soon, as the prince said the radical faction was eager to talk. But he admitted that despite the progress toward negotiations, fighting continued, although both sides were blaming the other as the aggressor. "In some places the Khmer Rouge take the iniative to attack government positions and we have to defend ourselves," Sok An said. Thai military officials however told a different story, saying government forces had attacked Khmer Rouge bases south of the border town of Poipet in the third consecutive day of clashes. The information ministry acknowledged that government troops were still "keeping pressure" on the guerrillas in the area around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Siem Reap province. "Our main aim is to defend government positions but that does not mean that we have to keep quiet. Sometimes we need to move first," Sok An said. To be discussed by both sides is King Norodom Sihanouk's peace proposal, in which he suggests that "acceptable" Khmer Rouge members will be given senior cabinet posts if the guerrillas cease military activity, open their zones and merge their fighters with the national army. During a recent clandestine meeting between Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan and Prince Ranariddh, both sides agreed to set up the working committee to discuss the implementation of the king's proposal. But the prince later questioned the rebel leader's sincerity, after Khieu Samphan would not first agree to a ceasefire. "We are willing to end all problems by political means -- that's the government policy," said Sok An, adding that a ceasefire was a priority. "But first we have to stop the killing of the people." But in a letter to Prince Ranariddh dated December 28, Khieu Samphan complained that the peace plan was being jeopardised by "a lot of political propaganda and military activities aimed at destroying Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge)". Another government minister admitted earlier a "political" dimension to the upsurge in fighting. "It's normal," he said. "When you start to negotiate, you have to put your weight in the military side also." Thai military officials reported some 300 troops backed by two T-54 tanks attacked Khmer Rouge positions at Phum Kaedon, forcing about 1,000 people to flee towards nearby Thailand. The Thai army was on alert following the government's heavy mortar and artillery attacks on the Khmer Rouge on Saturday.
