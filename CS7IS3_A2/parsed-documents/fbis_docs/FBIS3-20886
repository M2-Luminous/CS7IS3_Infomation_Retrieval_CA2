In the report, a company is considered to be European if it manufactures, undertakes research and development in Europe, and makes decisions concerning the above two activities in Europe. Through its 18 January resolution, the European Parliament gives its unconditional support to Europe's electronics industry. The draft resolution is submitted by the European Parliament to the Commission. It is a statement of intent, which the Commission may use. However, the Parliament is only consulted over electronics -- it is not party to decisionmaking. It thus calls upon the Commission to use all the means at its disposal to assist European electronics exports to Japan and the United States. In particular, in view of the difficulties in penetrating the U.S. and Japanese public markets, the European Parliament suggests "systematically including a reciprocity rule in Community legislation" so as to offset the lack of European protectionism in public markets. In the same spirit, it asks the Commission to negotiate fair competition with the European Union's trading partners, including stabilization of currencies and exchange rates, in addition to respect for the rules of the International Labor Office, and for international regulations over the environment. The Parliament also invites the Commission to work with the Council of the European Union to draft two notices before 1 January 1995. The first notice will apparently concern the conclusion of "agreements similar to the U.S.-Japanese agreement on semiconductors," or of "an `electronic' agreement similar to the `automobile' agreement with Japan." The second notice seems likely to concern the establishment of Community protection measures. Regarding components, so as to avoid dependence on a single non-European manufacturer, the Parliament's "statement of cause" (the "statement of cause" explains the reasons for the draft resolution; the resolution is what has been adopted by the European Parliament) suggests the establishment of a European participation fund to finance a part of the research dedicated to commercial purposes. This would enable "the strengthening of the technological and financial base of the European electronics industry." In practical terms, through its draft resolution the European Parliament also demands aid for "cooperation over research and development for precompetitive and competitive innovations." It also asks the Commission to "strengthen and accelerate technological research efforts undertaken under the European research framework programs, and under the EUREKA initiative", and to give legal and financial assistance for "reconstruction and rationalization initiatives emanating from the private sector and aiming to improve adaptation to the global market." It gives its support to the possibility of creating European trusts capable of competing with the American, Japanese, and South Korean giants by insisting that the Commission should authorize mergers and cooperation whenever necessary for the survival of the European industry. In the same spirit, it calls for harmonization of technical standards, taking the GSM standard as an example. Furthermore, it insists that the European Union should maintain "expertise in the development and implementation of pan-European networks for the exchange of data, so as to ensure its interoperability."
