If the ACSA is signed, Japan can provide fuel and services to the U.S. forces. It is expected that if economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, Japan will be asked to supply fuel to the U.S. warships participating in naval blockade. The United States has long been asking Japan to sign the ACSA. Meanwhile, as tension has mounted on the Korean peninsula, opinion has prevailed within government offices, such as the Foreign Ministry, that a rear-echelon support system should be established immediately. The government will seriously consider the conclusion of the ACSA if the United States renews its request. However, the same Foreign Ministry official said: "Discussions within the government will not be smooth."
