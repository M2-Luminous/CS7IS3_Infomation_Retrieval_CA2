Gakal, Elektrogorsk Scientific Testing Station; UDC 532.529.5] [Abstract] The flow of a boiling coolant through parallel heat exchanger channels in a reactor core is analyzed for stability on the basis of the 1P2T1W (P-pressure, T-temperatures of liquid and vapor respectively, W-velocity). The equations of this mathematical model are one-dimensional first-order partial differential equations describing the flow of kinetics of a two-phase stream including its one-phase segment and the laws of mass-energy-momentum conservation in such a channel with appropriate boundary conditions. These equations are integrated numerically by the method of finite differences, the four sought variables being: pressure, temperature of the liquid, velocity of the stream, and the volume fraction of vapor. Friction at the channel walls is described by simple correlations for a homogeneous liquid, as a function of the Reynolds number. The interphase heat transfer is assumed to be sufficiently intense for disregarding the small thermal unbalance between the phases. The boundary conditions are: constant pressure at the outlet; given temperature and flow rate of entering coolant. Both bubble boiling and film boiling during the flow are considered, the boundary between both modes in the stream being defined in terms of the critical heat flux as a function of the mass fraction of vapor within its subcritical range. Calculations made without applying the Courant condition reveal an onset of instability and its subsequent evolution by a mechanism associated with heat load changes under a constant pressure head and the consequences thereof. As stabilizing factors are identified friction at the wall and heat transfer from it to the entering one-phase stream segment. The combination of these factors with thermal inertia of channel wall, hydrodynamic losses due to flow rate and attendant density perturbations as well as due to friction and internal drag within the two-phase stream segment will determine the flow dynamics. The adiabatic one-phase stream segment is replaced with an equivalent hydrodynamic drag element. Both heated and two-phase stream segments are subdivided into equally thick discrete slices. The calculations have been made for an actual system with a circulation pump and six parallel identical parallel heat exchanger channels between a common collector followed by six throttles and a common separator for preceded by six throttles, the coolant flowing as follows: 1. liquid entering the collector, 2. liquid-vapor mixture entering the separator, 3. liquid alone returns to the pump after passage through the heat exchanger. The stabilizing effect of a digital Bernoulli flow rate meter on the inlet side has also been evaluated, on the basis of calculation of the flow rate as a function time with and without such a device in the circulation loop.
