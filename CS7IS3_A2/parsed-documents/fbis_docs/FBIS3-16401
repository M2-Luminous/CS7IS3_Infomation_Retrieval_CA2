This is always the case whenever the conflicting sides come close to an agreement on a cease-fire and the commencement of talks. Before reporting on the meeting between Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of Armenian Supreme Council, and Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet, at the Idzhevanskiy-Kazakhskiy border on 12 March, the announcer stated that the Armenian side was forced to halt military operations because of losses it recently suffered in Karabakh. This is an absolute lie because the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and Armenia have always proposed a cease-fire and talks. The claim about Armenian defeats is also a lie. The only success by the Azerbaijani side since the start of the offensive on 18 December 1993 was that they penetrated Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. However, they suffered considerable losses and were forced out. The Azerbaijanis have always suffered defeats and have lost tens of thousands of men on the other war fronts too. During his interview, Rasul Guliyev said that the Armenian forces must be withdrawn from all Azerbaijani lands. This has always been Azerbaijan's aspiration. However, the opposing side has never agreed to it, and no such agreement was concluded during the aforementioned meeting. This was confirmed by Babken Ararktsyan in his statement to Mayak Radio following the report on Ostankino. In refuting that report and in an attempt to avoid similar intrigues by the Azerbaijani side, the chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council declared that henceforth Armenia will not go to such meetings unless the Karabakh side also takes part in them. Babken Ararktsyan spoke in detail about this meeting in his news conference today. [passage omitted]
