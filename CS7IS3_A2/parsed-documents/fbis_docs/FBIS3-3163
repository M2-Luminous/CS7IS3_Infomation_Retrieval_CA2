The programme demands that by the year 2000 the mortality rate of pregnant women in these counties be cut by 50 percent while deaths of children under 5 years old be reduced by one-third. The World Bank will loan China $100 million over the next six years for the project. And governments at all levels will match the WB loan in their budgets to jump start the joint health project, said Liu Peilong, Director of the Foreign Loan Office of the Public Health Ministry. The project is scheduled to begin this summer. It targets reducing death rates of mothers and children by expanding and improving primary health care services in the remote and poor districts. The $100 million loan and local matching fund will be used to build and improve the village and county health care centres as well as anti-epidemic institutes. Grass-roots medical workers will be trained in the latest methods of treating diseases and preventive health care. The World Bank and the ministry last week concluded the first- phase pre-evaluation on the project counties. Liu said around 300 counties with a population of nearly 1OO million were selected for the project. The counties were chosen from Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Guangxi and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Chinese and foreign specialists studied project plans by examining current health situations in the counties. The ministry, with help of some international health organizations and foreign specialists, is compiling teaching materials to train the local medical workers. Ministry statistics show that in the poor and remote counties, the death rate for children is more than 60 per 1,000. And the maternal mortality rate is more than 200 per 100,000, yet in some places it can be as high as 1,000 in every 100,000. The main cause of maternity fatalities is post-delivery bleeding, accounting for about half of the deaths . Malnutrition is one of the major causes of the high mortality rate of children in the poor counties.
