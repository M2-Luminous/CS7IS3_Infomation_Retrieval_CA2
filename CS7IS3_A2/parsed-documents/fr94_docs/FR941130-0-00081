FR941130-0-00081 FR941130-0-00015 Federal Work-Study Programs In accordance with statutory amendments and consistent with the Secretary's desire to promote community service activities, the Secretary proposed to amend the purpose of the FWS program to include an encouragement to students receiving program assistance to participate in community service activities (page 32269). The Secretary proposed to add a new definition of ``low-income individual'' for purposes of community services (page 32269). The Secretary proposed to amend the program participation agreement to include assurances that (1) employment under the program may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities, and (2) institutions will inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community service and will consult with local nonprofit, governmental, and community-based organizations to identify community service opportunities. In identifying community service opportunities, the Secretary expects institutions to consult with their students (page 32269). In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to amend several provisions governing use of FWS funds. First, institutions participating in the Work-Colleges program would be allowed to use FWS funds for meeting costs of the Work-Colleges program. Second, the institutional administrative expense allowance for work-study for community service learning would be eliminated. Third, the amount of an institution's allocation under the FWS programs that may be transferred to the FSEOG program would be increased from 10 percent to 25 percent. Fourth, an institution would have additional carry-back authority to pay students who work during the summer. Fifth, an institution would be required to use 5 percent of the total FWS Federal funds granted to the institution to compensate students employed in community service activities for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years (page 32269). In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to provide that a student employed by a proprietary institution and performing community services is no longer also required to be furnishing student services (pages 32269&hyph;32270). In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to increase the Federal share of FWS compensation paid to a student employed other than by a for-profit organization to 75 percent (page 32270). As a result of statutory changes the Secretary proposed to remove the ``Community Service-Learning Program'' from the regulations (page 32270). Job Location and Development (JLD) Program The Secretary proposed to combine the regular JLD program to expand off-campus job opportunities and the ``Community Services'' JLD program to locate and develop community services jobs for students into one program. The Secretary further proposed to expand the statement of purpose for the JLD program to include the encouragement of participation in community service activities. The Secretary also proposed to allow an institution to use the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of its FWS allocation to establish or expand a JLD program (page 32270). The Secretary, in accordance with amended section 446(a) of the HEA, proposed to eliminate the authority for institutions to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations and limit institutions to working with other institutions for the purpose of developing jobs (page 32270). Work-Colleges Program In accordance with the Amendments, the Secretary proposed to add the new ``Work-Colleges program'' to the regulations (page 32270). Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program The Secretary proposed to amend the allocation and reallocation provisions for unexpended FSEOG funds (page 32270&hyph;32271). The Secretary proposed to eliminate an institution's authority to transfer FSEOG funds to the FWS program as necessary to implement statutory provisions (page 32271). The Secretary proposed to increase the maximum FSEOG award that an institution may award a student per academic year from $4,000 to $4,400 for a student studying abroad (page 32271). The Secretary proposed that the Federal share of FSEOG awards will not exceed 75 percent effective for award years beginning on or after July 1, 1993 as necessary to implement statutory changes (page 32271).
