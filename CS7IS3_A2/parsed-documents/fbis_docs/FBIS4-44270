This is the first time in 25 years that the average rate has fallen below 4 percent. Food prices bucked the trend, rising higher than the average in June while clothing prices remained stable and electricity and heating costs varied greatly, falling in Bologna, Milan, Florence and Trieste but rising in Venice, Genoa and Naples. [passage omitted] Premier Silvio Berlusconi and Labour Minister Clemente Mastella were amongst those who welcomed the low inflation figures after they were announced on Tuesday. "I hope this news does the markets good," said Berlusconi, "but often money markets have a logic all of their own, which is frequently far from reality." For Mastella, the inflation figures could have positive repercussions for the labour market: "I hope these figures help. Falling consumer prices make it possible to proceed rapidly in the contract negotiation field." Unionists, who met with government ministers for cost of labour talks this morning, saw the latest provisional inflation figures as a sign that a mini-budget promised by Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini yesterday would not be necessary. "The fall in inflation shows that no corrective measures are necessary," said Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] union. "These conditions are right for reducing interest rates and thus keep the borrowing requirement under control."
