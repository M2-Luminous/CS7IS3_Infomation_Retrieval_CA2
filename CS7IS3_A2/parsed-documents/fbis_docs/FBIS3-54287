"This meeting was a success. It opens a new page in relations between the two sides," said an aide to 'Arafat. King Fahd and the PLO chairman spent an hour on Monday "reviewing bilateral relations and developments in the Middle East peace process, especially the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy negotiations," he said, declining to be named. Saudi television showed footage of the meeting but there was no comment from officials in Riyadh, which has spurned the PLO for the past three years for siding with Iraq during the Gulf crisis. "King Fahd expressed his support and that of the Saudi Government to the Palestinian cause and people," senior PLO official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told reporters. A Palestinian diplomat added: "The meeting was very friendly and it helped to blow away the summer storm in bilateral relations. The future is promising." On Tuesday, 'Arafat met Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, who is the emir of Riyadh and an influential member of the royal family who heads a Saudi committee in charge of collecting funds for the Palestinians. 'Arafat later visited the mausoleum of the Prophet Muhammad in the western town of Medina and was to leave for Egypt to meet President Husni Mubarak for further talks on the launch of Palestinian self-rule. On Sunday, he made a pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca. Since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 'Arafat was not welcome in Saudi Arabia because of the Palestinians' support for Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. Saudi Arabia, which had been the PLO's principal financial backer, cut off its annual 85.5-million-dollar subsidy in retaliation. 'Arafat last met King Fahd on August 8, 1990, six days after the invasion, and failed to persuade him to agree to an "Arab" solution to end the crisis instead of a Western military intervention. The king spurned 'Arafat's initiative, and a US-led multinational coalition used Saudi Arabia as its launching pad for "Operation Desert Storm" which drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait in February 1991. Fellow Gulf monarchies also cut off aid to the PLO, triggering a financial crisis within the organisation. But the Saudi authorities allowed Prince Salman's committee to continue its work after the war, collecting 10 million dollars a year in voluntary contributions and deductions from the salaries of Palestinian workers. By 1993 the kingdom had begun to soften its stance, pledging 100 million dollars to help implement Palestinian autonomy starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank region of Jericho. "Relations with Saudi Arabia are a top priority for us," a Palestinian diplomat said. Attempts for a reconciliation a year ago fell apart when 'Arafat received the "Mother of All Battles" medal from Saddam in Baghdad. The Palestine Liberation Organisation is anxious to restore close ties with the kingdom, which is seen as the leader of the Gulf Arab states and would be a powerful ally as the PLO tries to launch its self-rule deal with Israel. In September, 'Arafat visited Oman, the first Gulf monarchy to ease strains with the PLO. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar have also improved ties, but Kuwait insists on an official apology before it "forgives" 'Arafat.
