FR940407-0-00077 FR940407-0-00014 E. Use of Program Revenues Today's rules incorporate statutory restrictions on the use of revenues generated by statutory EIP's. These restrictions are mandated by section 182(g)(4)(B) of the Act on the use of revenues generated by statutory EIP's submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act. Revenues may be generated by an EIP from a wide variety of fees or charges, including emission or permit fees, fees associated with approving and recording trades, application fees associated with labelling or sources opting into an EIP, and fees or charges associated with TCM's. Specifically, any such revenues may be used by a State for providing incentives for achieving emissions reductions, providing assistance (up to 75 percent of costs) for the development of innovative technologies for the control of O 3 air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings, and funding (with up to 50 percent of the revenues) administrative costs of State programs under the Act. These restrictions on the use of revenues do not apply to discretionary EIP's. Because the use of revenues from discretionary programs is not constrained, some or all of the revenues generated by discretionary EIP's may be rebated in order to create a revenue-neutral program, or one with less revenue retained by the State. Rebate provisions of revenue-generating EIP's can be designed to reduce the total cost to the affected sources without diminishing the incentive to reduce emissions created by the EIP. For example, an emission fee program could place a fee on total emissions from affected sources, and rebate an amount based on average emissions or percentage emissions reductions of the affected sources. In a program with a large number of sources, each source would only have a minor influence on the average emissions. Thus, the rebate is not dependent on a source's own actions, and would not distort the incentive of the fee on every unit of emissions created by the source. IV. Discussion of Comments and Regulatory Changes This portion of the preamble is organized according to the ``Discussion of Issues'' section in the proposal, with additional discussion of general issues raised in public comments. The following discussion highlights the changes and clarifications made in the final rules in response to the public comments on these issues. A. Program Goals 1. Statutory Programs Statutory EIP's are those programs submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act, generally because of failures in achieving required emissions reductions. The Act does not specify the extent to which the EIP must, in and of itself, make up for the specific failure in achieving the emissions reductions necessary to meet the next milestone requirement. Rather, the provisions specify only that the EIP ``shall be sufficient, in combination with other elements'' of the plan, or together with a ``transportation control plan,'' to achieve the necessary reductions. In the proposal, the EPA solicited comments on whether to require that some specified minimum percentage of the required reductions be met by a statutory EIP. Most commenters, including State and local agencies, industry, and an environmental group, felt that EIP's should not be required to meet a specified minimum percentage of emission reductions. These comments were generally based on the premise that opportunities for such reductions will vary because of potential differences between nonattainment areas that may implement EIP's. A specified minimum percentage would not provide recognition of these differences nor the flexibility that needs to be an inherent part of EIP's. On the other hand, an environmental group commented that a specified minimum percentage of required reductions should be met by a statutory EIP, equivalent to the percentage difference between what the SIP is achieving and what the next milestone requires. The final rules retain the requirement that a statutory EIP make a significant contribution to the required emissions reductions, without mandating any percentage reduction requirement or that the EIP assume the entire burden of making up for the shortfall. This position is most consistent with statutory intent that the States have flexibility in determining how best to combine an EIP with other emission reduction programs to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Further, this position is consistent with meeting the benefits sharing goal established for all EIP's. 2. Discretionary Programs In explicitly allowing for discretionary (i.e., nonstatutory) EIP's to be included as SIP provisions, the Act does not impose any specific emissions reductions requirements on such programs (sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6)). Thus, the proposed rules imposed no specific emissions reductions requirements on discretionary EIP's. The proposal relied upon the new State planning, quantitative progress, and attainment requirements in the Act to ensure expeditious attainment of the NAAQS, regardless of the type of emissions reductions programs that States may choose to include in their SIP's.
