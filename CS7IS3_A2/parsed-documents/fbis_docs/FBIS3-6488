The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "The unity and cohesion of the party will be powerful when love for revolutionary comrades underlies it." The paper further says: Revolutionary comradeship is noble ideological and mental feelings between revolutionary comrades who are fighting in the same ranks to achieve common purpose and ideal under the guidance of the leader. Our revolutionary comradeship is, above all, a major source of the close unity of the entire people around the illustrious leader in ideology and purpose and in-morality and obligation. For the revolutionaries, the leader is a great comrade and a lifesaver who takes care of their destiny and future with full responsibility. Loyalty to the leader is the supreme manifestation of revolutionary comradeship. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great comrade and a great father of our revolutionary soldiers and people. The Korean people follow the dear leader with unshakable conviction and a sense of obligation, holding him in high esteem as the centre of unity, the centre of leadership. Our singlehearted unity has an invincible might as we fully display revolutionary comradeship, resolved to share the same idea and destiny with the dear leader. Unprecedented in history is such singlehearted unity based on revolutionary comradeship between the leader and the soldiers in which the leader loves and believes in his soldiers and the soldiers trust and remain loyal and devoted to him. Our revolutionary comradeship also unites all members of society in a big harmonious family by turning the relations between them into true comradely bonds. Being comradely love based on loyalty to the dear leader, our revolutionary comradeship closely rallies all the members of society like kinsmen. An increasing number of people unhesitatingly donate their blood and flesh and cover handgrenades with their bodies on the point of explosion to save their comrades. These noble traits are a proud reality of our country today. If they viewed the relations among people from the viewpoint of equivalent compensations, they would not have saved their downing comrades at the sacrifice of their lives. And young men and women would not have volunteered to marry disabled soldiers and adopted orphaned children and brought old men with no one to support them to look after them as their family members. As they value comradeship most, all our people are true revolutionary comrades who share the same destiny on the road of the revolution. In the course of fighting under the guidance of the dear leader, comradely love is regarded as most precious and our singlehearted unity is unbreakable. With this powerful weapon, we are firmly defending Korean-style socialism and triumphantly advancing the revolution and construction, decisively frustrating any challenge of the imperialists.
