FR940504-0-00059 FR940504-0-00015 50 CFR Part 661 [Docket No. 940120&hyph;4123, I.D. 011094A] RIN 0648&hyph;AE05 Ocean Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce issues this final rule to implement Amendment 11 (Amendment) to the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (FMP). The Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho salmon and the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR. The Amendment is intended to: (1) Address persistent low OCN coho stock abundance and annual escapement goals below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), (2) prevent imbalances in recreational coho harvest allocation at low allowable harvest levels, and (3) prevent the frequent use of emergency rulemaking to implement annual management measures. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Amendment, including the environmental assessment and the regulatory impact review/initial regulatory flexibility analysis, are available from Lawrence D. Six, Executive Director, Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), Metro Center, Suite 420, 2000 SW. First Avenue, Portland, OR 97201&hyph;5344. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson (Northwest Region, NMFS) at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140, Rodney R. McInnis (Southwest Region, NMFS) at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040, or Lawrence D. Six (PFMC) at 503&hyph;326&hyph;6352. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ocean salmon fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States (3 to 200 miles offshore) in the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under the FMP. The FMP was developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. (Magnuson Act), and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in 1978. Since then, the FMP has been amended 10 times, with implementing regulations codified at 50 CFR part 661. From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually. In 1984, a framework amendment was implemented that provided the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulations without annual amendments. Amendments to the framework FMP were implemented in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1991. The Council prepared the Amendment to the FMP and submitted it to the Secretary for approval under the provisions of the Magnuson Act. On January 10, 1994, the Secretary began formal review of the Amendment. A notice of availability and a proposed rule were published in the Federal Register on January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3327), and February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4895), respectively. The preamble for the proposed rule discussed the rationale for the proposed amendment. The comment period on the Amendment ended March 10, and on the proposed rule March 21, 1994; two written comments were received. The Amendment was approved on April 6, 1994. As implemented by this final rule, the Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho salmon. The OCN coho stock is composed of naturally produced coho salmon from Oregon coastal streams. OCN coho are important contributors to the ocean harvest, as the stock aggregate constitutes the largest component of naturally produced coho caught in ocean salmon fisheries off Oregon and California. The modified escapement goal is intended to achieve an aggregate OCN adult spawning density of 42 naturally spawning adults per mile in standard index survey areas each year. The standard index survey areas are 48 different stream sections that have been surveyed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) each year since 1950. Under the current methods used by ODFW, the spawners in the standard index area are extrapolated for 4,764 miles of coastal spawning habitat. This translates to a numerical spawning escapement goal of 200,000. The original FMP spawning escapement goal of 200,000 was based on this extrapolation. This number of adult spawners per mile was documented as the estimated MSY spawning escapement level in an ODFW study of coastal stream spawning escapements and subsequent production from 1950 to 1980. The Amendment also provides that when OCN coho abundance is forecast to be less than 125 percent of the annual numerical escapement goal, or below 250,000 fish at the present spawner escapement goal of 200,000 adults, an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent will be allowed for ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting on non-OCN coho salmon stocks. When the predicted OCN coho spawning escapement is 28 or less adults per mile in standard index areas, the Council may allow only an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent. The Council will evaluate the actual level of incidental harvest of OCN coho that might be expected to occur in fisheries for chinook salmon and non-OCN coho salmon and will recommend only the minimum incidental harvest rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries, provided that that rate will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock.
