FR940323-2-00131 FR940323-2-00103 [Docket No. 50&hyph;336] Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;65, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed change to the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specifications (TS) would provide a one-time extension of the surveillance frequency from the required 18-month to the next refueling outage but no later than September 30, 1994, of the power operated valves in the service water system (TS 4.7.4.4.1.b) and in the boran injection flow path (TS 4.1.2.2.c). This would extend the surveillance for these valves approximately 5 months. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c The subject valve in the boron injection flowpath was exercised through a complete cycle on March 7, 1994, during the performance of SP 2601A. This surveillance verified the valve's operability. However, the performance of this surveillance did not satisfy literal compliance with Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c, because it was not performed while the unit was shutdown. A one-time extension to the surveillance frequency for the subject valve in the boron injection system does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. Technical Specification 4.7.4.1.b Service water valves 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B are normally open and are designed to fail in the ``as is'' position. The valves do not perform any active safety function (are not considered in any operational procedure to mitigate the effects of an abnormal event), nor do they provide isolation between the two service water headers. Their primary function is to isolate the downstream portion of the header for maintenance activities. Increasing the time interval between performance of surveillance testing 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B does not involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of a previously analyzed accident. In addition, a review of the maintenance and operational history of the service water system valves did not identify any previous problems with the ability of the valves to open or close, or to meet any other design requirements. Therefore, the one-time extension of the surveillance interval does not involve a significant increase in the probability of consequences of an accident. 2. Create the possibility of new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
