In fact, there was considerable expectation over the weekend over the outcome of Carpizo's announcement on 24 June. It was announced that same day that Carpizo and President Salinas would discuss the matter on 25 and 26 June. Saturday was a long day of waiting and the following letter addressed to the president and the general public was released on 26 June at noon. The text of the letter follows: 1. Due to the decisive support I have received from ample sectors of society, the president of the republic, political parties, and nongovernment, professional, and academic organizations, and in order to dispel the belief I am acting irresponsibly and unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of interior secretary to fulfill the inherent duties of that post during the federal electoral process. 2. I hereby confirm the commitments established in the agreement signed by eight political parties and myself on 27 January 1994 regarding democracy, justice, and peace. Likewise, I guarantee my impartiality, which I intend to firmly maintain. To do this, I will require the support of the general public and political parties so that there will be no further speculation concerning the party to which I referred in my letter of resignation. Any disclosure on my part at this time would seriously affect my impartiality and the duties I must carry out in the forthcoming electoral process. 3. I will continue to strictly adhere to the de jure state by holding clean, reliable, objective, and honest elections. 4. I hereby affirm my current post is the last political post I will hold during my lifetime. I will not, under any circumstance, hold a political post in the future. 5. I urge all Mexicans to strengthen our de jure state, to always speak the truth, and to make political civility and mutual respect govern our actions. In my opinion, these principles constitute an irreversible commitment. Dr. Jorge Carpizo concluded his letter by thanking the general public, the president of the republic, and the political parties for their support in urging him to continue as the head of the Interior Secretariat.
