Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), told a seminar that MAC will hold a meeting in June to discuss the resumption of cultural exchanges with the mainland. Earlier this month, the cabinet-level MAC put a hold on cash it had planned to use to finance cultural and educational exchanges with the mainland to protest Beijing's callous handling of the Qiandao Lake crime. Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, along with two mainland guides and six crewmembers, were robbed and killed on the lower deck of a pleasure boat ferrying them across the scenic lake in Zhejiang Province, eastern China, on March 31. Beijing denied that the killings took place and did not make any arrests until Taiwan threatened to comprehensively review the existing ties between the two sides. The mainland security authorities have charged three and arrested a fourth suspect in the mass murder. The move, however failed to thaw the frozen ties as many questions surrounding the deaths remain. "The distrust and psychological trauma that have been brought to the general public is most worrying for long term relations," Su warned. "To narrow the widening cultural and social differences, special efforts from both sides are needed ... and cultural exchanges, among others, are believed to be the most effective remedy," Su said. The Government of the Republic of China [ROC] in 1987 lifted its decades-old ban on visits to the mainland by Taiwan residents for family reunions. Since then millions of local people have visited the mainland.
