FR940105-0-00008 FR940105-0-00002 4. Comment. The reduction in the random testing rate should be applied to all workers. Four of the 30 commenters on this issue_three unions and one licensee_supported the Commission's proposal that licensees maintain the 100-percent random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. Their reasons included a concern for lack of commitment by contractor employees to maintaining the industry's high drug-free standard and the need for the higher testing rate to provide continued deterrence for contractor employees. One of the three unions recommended that long-term contractors should have the same lower random testing rate as that of licensee employees because test results of long-term contractors and licensee employees have been almost identical. There were several issues consistently mentioned by those 26 commenters who opposed maintaining the 100-percent random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. There was a general concern for unnecessary inconsistencies in random testing rates between Federal agencies. Commenters recommended that the NRC program be kept as consistent as possible with programs in other Federally regulated safety-related industries. These include the DOT programs that currently require contractors and vendors to be randomly tested at a 50-percent rate. Various licensees cited the testing results from 1990 and 1991 which, in their opinion, create no statistically sound rationale for testing contractor and vendor employees at a rate different from that of licensee employees. They argued that, while the contractor/vendor positive testing rate has been twice that of licensee employees, it is still low enough to make unnecessary the expenditure of the resources necessary to maintain two separate random testing pools. Various commenters noted that contractors and vendors are subject to the identical access authorization and other FFD program requirements as are licensee employees, including behavioral observation. These stringent requirements, in their view, obviate the need to keep the contractor/vendor random rate at 100 percent. Some also noted that the deterrent value of random testing is in the act of testing itself and not in what many consider to be a high rate of testing. Some commenters warned that keeping contractors and vendors at 100 percent could be construed as discriminatory against those employees and may be perceived as punitive rather than as a corrective measure. Two licensees also cited a study of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of the First Year of Program Performance and an Update of the Technical Issues,'' which indicates that a 100-percent testing rate is only a little more effective than a 50-percent rate for detecting occasional drug users. NRC Response Although there is a difference between the positive results of random testing of licensee employees and those of contractor and vendor employees, the positive random testing rate of both groups has been less in each year since 1990, as stated in the response to Comment 1 above. While the contractor/vendor random testing positive rates continue to be about twice the rate for licensee employees and statistical analysis of the data shows that the difference in proportion between the contractors' and licensees' employees is not explained within statistical fluctuations (therefore, differences in the rates are statistically significant), the Commission agrees that the absolute numbers of positive test results of all categories of nuclear power workers are low. Therefore, the Commission will permit its licensees to lower the random testing rate to 50 percent for all persons covered by 10 CFR part 26. However, the Commission will continue to monitor licensee program performance and effectiveness and will make program adjustments as necessary.
