In a letter to Akashi, a copy of which has been sent to TANJUG, Karadzic points out that since the first day of the cease-fire Muslim forces have been moving their trench lines towards Serb positions. "These engineering works have been going on constantly, right up to today," Karadzic alleges, assessing that this is "an attempt to improve their military position under cover of the cease-fire." The RS president points out that these Muslim cease-fire violations are being carried out in many places -- in Mojmilo (three or four places), in the Jewish cemetery, in the Dobrinja-Vojkovici area (two places), Rajlovac (three places), on Zuc (two places), in Brijesce and in the Butmir-Ilidza area. "We strongly protest against these Muslim military activities, which are a clear and flagrant violation of the Serb-Muslim agreement reached on 9 February," Karadzic writes, assessing that "this cease-fire which was realized with such difficulty is now under serious threat." "Furthermore, the whole peace process is now in danger. Unless the newly dug Muslim trenches are abandoned and destroyed, the already begun measures to build confidence will suffer huge damage," Karadzic assesses, adding that "if something is not done quickly," the Serb side will not be able to continue its cooperation in the efforts to achieve peace in the Sarajevo region.
