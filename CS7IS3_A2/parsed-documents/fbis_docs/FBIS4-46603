According to a previously approved plan that was coordinated with internal-affairs bodies, details of Guardsmen without weapons are going out into the streets of Simferopol at night to protect the citizenry against criminal infringements. Classes in combat training are also continuing according to the usual plan. Topics are being practiced in particular that are envisaged by the training program for cleaning up the consequences of a natural disaster. Some of the mass media, however, have tried to inflame the situation surrounding the units of the National Guard of Ukraine, which have been located in Crimea since 1992. All kinds of gossip surrounding BTRs [armored personnel carriers] that have arrived on the peninsula is spreading. The press service of the NHU command has been authorized to announce that the military hardware has returned to its units after the planned seasonal repairs at a plant. The means of transport on hand in the subunits are only 14 percent of the necessary standard quantity. Insinuations aimed at creating tensions around a military unit that is being formed in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "The National Guard of Ukraine" thus seem curious.
