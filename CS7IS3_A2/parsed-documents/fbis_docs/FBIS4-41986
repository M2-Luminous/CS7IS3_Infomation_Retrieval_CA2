The results, I have no hesitation in saying, are being awaited impatiently in Russia and the United States, Western Europe, and Moldova. But even 48 hours later the sluggish post-independence state machine has managed to process the voting forms from only 16 of the 27 electoral districts. Of the votes counted in this partial context 35 percent of voters preferred L. Kravchuk and 31 percent, L. Kuchma. Even before the elections the geographical preference pattern had been accurately predicted by sociological services: Western oblasts prefer the current president, while eastern oblasts prefer the main contender for the post. In practice 90 percent of Ivanofrankivsk Oblast voters, 80 percent of Lviv Oblast voters, 76 percent of Rovno Oblast voters, and 71 percent of Volyn Oblast voters who participated in the election preferred L. Kravchuk, whereas 82 percent of Crimeans preferred L. Kuchma. The former premier has twice as many votes as the president in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. [passage omitted] One of the main conclusions to be drawn is obviously that, whoever wins on 10 July, he will not be able to ignore the results of these elections. And the main result is that Ukraine is split approximately in half. The cold shower which voters in eastern oblasts have given L. Kravchuk has shown that his reliance on the national radicals in the west of the country is leading society into a blind alley. While L. Kuchma, who advocates Ukraine's integrity, can no longer realize his slogan in practice unless he finds a common languages with the population of the western oblasts. All the indications are that unless these two leaders draw the appropriate conclusions, the winner at the next elections in the Ukraine will be not A. Moroz or B. Lanovoy, but a Belorussian [as published] version of Zhirinovskiy. Another conclusion also suggests itself. No matter how the 10 July second round of elections ends, it can already be said that the policy which Leonid Kravchuk has been pursuing since the fall of 1991 has not brought success, to put it mildly. Reliance on the superficially highly attractive slogans of the national radicals in the western oblasts has brought him to political disaster, since how else can you assess the activity of a political leader who has split his country? The initiator, by his own admission, of the destruction of the Soviet Union in December 1991 in Belovezhskaya Forest, L. Kravchuk -- following the same logic in his policy -- has split Ukraine in 1994. His mistake is that his slogan of absolute independence for Ukraine misled the masses of so-called ordinary people. This slogan, based on the fact that Ukraine as part of the USSR produced 34 percent of the steel, 46 percent of the iron ore, 36 percent of the television sets, 56 percent of the sugar, and so forth, should have confirmed that Ukraine is a rich state. Yet this republic was only rich as part of the USSR. Having destroyed its links with the other republics, this state with a population of 52 million has experienced a vicious two-year economic crisis, and all the attributes of state independence have been reduced to proud words, state flags, a national army uniform, and suchlike. To a certain extent it for this reason (disillusionment) that the turnout of voters in the Ukrainian capital was so low (barely above 50 percent). One way or another all these factors cannot fail to impact on the second round of the election. What these results will be, we will learn 10 July.
