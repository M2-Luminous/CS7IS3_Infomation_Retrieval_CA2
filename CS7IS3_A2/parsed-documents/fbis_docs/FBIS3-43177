Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-04JAN94-NORTH KOREA Kim Il-song Stresses Talks With U.S. On Nuclear Issue President Kim Il-song used his annual New Year's address to reiterate Pyongyang's interest in dealing mainly with Washington on the nuclear issue while minimizing Seoul's involvement in the issue. On the domestic front, Kim reaffirmed the somber economic reports that surfaced at last month's party plenum. Apparently attempting to bolster Pyongyang's preference for solving the nuclear issue through talks with the United States, Kim projected an upbeat assessment of the status of the ongoing nuclear talks (Pyongyang radio, 1 January). Invoking the DPRK- U.S. joint statement of last June, he contended that if the two sides "abide by and implement the principles" contained in the agreement, the nuclear issue can be resolved in a way that is "fair" to both sides. Prefacing his assessment of the nuclear issue with a reiteration of Pyongyang's warning against "pressure and threat," Kim said that resorting to pressure would result in the "collapse" of negotiations. Further underscoring Pyongyang's interest in better relations with the United States, Kim's address followed the precedents of the past two years by eschewing harsh denunciations of Washington. Instead, Kim's most direct criticism of the United States came when he blamed the delay in resolving the nuclear issue on what he termed Washington's "persistent" antisocialist and anti-DPRK "maneuvering"--relatively mild rebukes by Pyongyang's standards. Kim's stance on the nuclear issue reinforces earlier signs of North Korean interest in projecting an image of progress in ongoing DPRK-U.S. negotiations on the issue. In the most optimistic assessment of prospects for resolving the nuclear issue so far, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was cited by the North Korean news agency KCNA on 30 December 1993 as claiming a "breakthrough" on the nuclear issue at a working-level bilateral contact held in New York recently--a contact that the spokesman touted as the 18th time working-level officials of both sides met since high-level bilateral talks were held in Geneva last July. According to the spokesman, the U.S. side removed an unspecified "series of stumbling blocks" at the 29 December meeting, thus bringing the deadlocked DPRK-U.S. nuclear talks "back on track." South Korea In contrast to its conciliatory stance toward the United States, Kim in his New Year's address was stridently critical of South Korea. Underscoring Pyongyang's unwillingness to engage Seoul in a substantive manner, at least for now, Kim claimed that beneath the "veneer" of civilian rule the South Korean government is no different from "the preceding military dictatorial regimes," claiming that "evil laws of anticommunism and fascism" enacted under previous governments remain in effect. Kim's harsh portrayal of the South's new civilian government appears to reflect Pyongyang's pique at Seoul's rejection of a series of initiatives Kim had personally advanced. For example, Kim criticized the South for having ignored his "magnanimous proposal" for exchanging special presidential envoys, along with his 10-point program for national unification, even though Kim's New Year's address itself ignored Seoul's current calls for exchanging special envoys. Suggesting, however, that Pyongyang has not written off inter-Korean dialogue entirely, Kim fell short of refusing further dealings with the ROK government, claiming only that South Korean "people and figures of all strata" are proclaiming their loss of faith with the current South Korean regime. In keeping with Pyongyang's increasingly harsh rhetoric against Seoul, North Korean People's Army (KPA) chief of staff Choe Kwang also recently sounded a more belligerent note. In a speech commemorating the second anniversary of the appointment of Kim Il-song's son, Kim Chong-il, as armed forces supreme commander, Choe cited as the KPA's task the reunification of Korea "with the gun" (Pyongyang radio, 23 December 1993)--a formulation not observed in Pyongyang's public pronouncements in recent years. However, in the same speech, Choe seemed to equate "the gun" with revolutionary spirit when he used the phrase again to call on the KPA to crush enemy challenges with "the gun of revolution." A week later, the party paper Nodong Sinmun seemed to make a special effort to suggest that Choe's language was intended to be figurative, carrying an article stating that "under no circumstances" could Pyongyang "invite self-destruction" through "a fratricidal war" (KCNA, 31 December 1993). Gloomy Economic News Continuing to project a somber economic picture, Kim's address toned down his once standard boasts about North Korea's economic prowess. Last year, for instance, he had claimed that North Koreans were "free from worry and anxiety about food, clothing, and shelter," and that North Korea had no unemployed or beggars (Pyongyang radio, 1 January 1993), but this year he merely maintained that the people live "happy lives free from social and political unrest or worries about livelihood." Underscoring earlier signs of a shift in economic priorities, Kim appeared to go out of his way to emphasize the importance of foreign trade to the North Korean economy. He called on the nation to develop "foreign markets" and expand production bases for export goods. In another twist of economic priorities, he seemed to reverse the traditional emphasis on basic and heavy industry by calling for investment of "efforts" into the coal, power, and metal sectors "in a bid to develop" agriculture and light industry. Implications Kim's contrasting treatment of Washington and Seoul suggests that Pyongyang will continue to press for bilateral talks with the United States, while attempting to keep inter-Korean dialogue at the minimum level required for the resumption of the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. Nevertheless, Kim's emphasis on foreign trade--something that cannot be fully developed without the resolution of the nuclear issue- -underscores Pyongyang's apparent desire to get this issue out of the way.
