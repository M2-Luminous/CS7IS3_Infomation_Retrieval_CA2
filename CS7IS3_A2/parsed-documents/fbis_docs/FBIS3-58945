Kohl, who is running for Ludwigshafen the sixth time, received 69 of the 72 valid votes in the meeting of the constituency delegates. Three delegates voted against the CDU federal chairman. Kohl's Social Democratic Party [SPD] opponent in the constituency is Doris Barnett (40), head of the social administrative office in Ludwigshafen, who was nominated in late November 1993. In his nomination address to an audience of 300, Kohl strongly warned against slackening determination to struggle for European unification. Germans would have "to pay bitterly" if they wanted to opt out of the unification process. Kohl called for a rethinking process, and said people should not expect the level of benefits and rights to continue to rise forever. To maintain international competitive strength, enterprises in Germany must be made more flexible. The current round of wage talks offers an opportunity for this, as can be seen by the agreement achieved in the chemical industry.
