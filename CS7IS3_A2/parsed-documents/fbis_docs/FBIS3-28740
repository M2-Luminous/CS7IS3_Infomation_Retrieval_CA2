Of these, the three largest radio stations were the Voice of America, VOA, which, headquartered in Washington, was under USIS, the U.S. Information Service; Radio "Free Europe" which, headquartered in Munich in the Federal Republic of Germany, was targeted at the East European countries; and Radio "Freedom," which was targeted at the former Soviet Union. When the Cold War was over, a number of people suggested dissolving Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom" because the main goal of these two stations had been achieved: communist rule over European countries no longer existed. But U.S. President Clinton holds a different view. He wants to maintain Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom." He is also calling for the setting up of Radio "Democratic Asia" [Chaau As Daan Chur], arguing that, just like Europe, Asia is a continent with an important role and a strategic position. In the current situation, the role and strategic position of Asia are all the more important. With a large population, Asia now has some 170 million English-speaking people. The United States must have a sense of responsibility toward Asia, especially at a time when there is a "new-type Cold War," that is, a peaceful evolution strategy, the purpose of which is Asian domination. More importantly, this strategy is also aimed at eradicating communist nations, including Vietnam. That is the reason for the coming into life of Radio "Democratic Asia." This radio, headquartered in a borrowed place in Asia, has constantly beamed distorting broadcasts against socioeconomic reforms and social progress in various Asian countries. It has also carried news about various activities on the U.S. mainland and about the exemplary role played by the United States overseas. Looking back over the years, we will see that Washington has been very keen on using radio to spread propaganda in Asia. Since August 1986, Washington has used the airwaves of a radio, which is also called Radio "Freedom" (located in Thailand and operating with U.S. technological and financial assistance) to regularly beam broadcasts in English, French, Vietnamese, and Thai. From late 1992 to early 1993, Mrs. Helen D.Bentley, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, put forth a proposal calling for the establishment of Radio "Free Asia." Then on 15 June 1993, President Clinton came up with a proposal to set up Radio Democratic Asia and to organize an ad-hoc committee with its members appointed by the president himself to manage the operations of various radio stations such as the Voice of America, VOA; Radio "Free Europe"; and Radio "Freedom." More specifically, this new committee will replace the old Board of International Broadcasting and will be responsible for establishing Radio "Democratic Asia," whose broadcasts are to be directed at those countries which, according to Clinton, lack democracy, such as Vietnam, China, Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, and so forth. The U.S. Government has set aside $30 million from its budget for the running of Radio "Democratic Asia." When talking about his proposal at the White House, Clinton stated: "The purposes for the maintenance of Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom" and for the establishment of Radio "Democratic Asia" are to help consolidate democratic institutions in various areas, both in Europe and Asia, where there is an absence of democracy. People in undemocratic countries still need genuine information which should be free from being doctored or distorted by the local administration." (!) President Clinton's new proposal has won strong support from many congressmen, including Senators Russell Feingold and Joseph R. Biden -- two very powerful figures at the U.S. Senate in this matter. On learning of the decision on the setting up of Radio "Democratic Asia," a number of reactionary political organizations among the exiled Vietnamese in foreign countries appear to have been delighted. They regarded this as a long-awaited victorious step in the "democratic construction strategy" for Asia in general and for Vietnam in particular. But "anything rational will remain, while anything irrational will go bust." They might have forget this age-old axiom. That is why they have displayed their ecstacy too soon.
