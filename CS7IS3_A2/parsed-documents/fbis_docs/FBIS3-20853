This time our questions were directed at the deeper pivotal connections of the reform, at the logic for selecting the individual systemic measures. [EKONOM] Why is the Czech Republic being acknowledged as the most successful of the former socialist countries after three years of the economic transformation? Do you see the main reason more in the relatively favorable starting position of our economy, or do you think the chosen transformation strategy was decisive? [Klaus] That question has two parts: first, distinguishing between what was a kind of gift from the past and what was our own doing, and second, determining the factors that played the key role in the transformation process. I tend to play down the view that we are doing well simply because during the First Republic there was a democratic tradition here and a good level of industrial production. Naturally, it is a question of degree and quantitative calculation, but my assessment of the ratio between the past and the present is 2:8. I think the absolutely key factor was that we succeeded in choosing precisely at this time the only correct and the only possible way. Given the same kind of past, if the concept of one of the "third" ways had prevailed, then today we would be exactly where the other postcommunist countries are now. The general answer I can give to the other part of the question is that the uniqueness of our transformation process is the interplay of our political and economic factors. The notion that to achieve success only the political factors and the velvetness of the revolution would suffice, or that being a little bit better economists than the others would be enough, is not right. I believe that the magic and the charm lies precisely in the mutual interplay that makes possible an upward-leading process. If this interplay is poor it creates a vicious circle of hopelessness, which is precisely where many postcommunist countries find themselves. [EKONOM] Why, in spite of a number of problems of which every citizen is to some extent aware, there still exists a large measure of consensus on the reform among the majority of the population? Do you think it is due to the fact that the reform was measured out in the right doses or to the fact that people were able to recognize that the chosen way is correct...? [Klaus] I think that the consensus is the result of a very open, clear, and forceful reform policy, and of the fact that we simply managed to sell our basic concept which we promulgated and are promulgating. Using the terminology of your journal, we could say that we were good salesmen of our concept of the reform and that we marketed it very well. We are talking about a kind of perpetual election campaign, incessant explanations, arguments, and influencing of the public. That has not happened and is not happening now in the other postcommunist countries. [EKONOM] Why is there in the Czech Republic, in spite of the decline in production, a significantly lower unemployment rate than to the west and the east of us? Is it because of the growth of the private, especially the service, sector, or because, in the thus-far unprivatized enterprises, overemployment still persists? [Klaus] From Milton Friedman I learned to always distinguish permanent quantities which have their fixed, long-term value, from transitory quantities which deviate in the short term from some level that holds over the long run. Our temporary unemployment rate is now evidently below this long-term value, at which it will stabilize itself in time. In that respect, the short-term movement in the unemployment rate will certainly be upward, but it will be a continuous and moderate movement within the range of a few percent, not a big jump. As far as the causes of the favorable short-term unemployment rate are concerned, in my view there are three. One stands apart from the economic mechanism and belongs more in the category of the societal and social climate in the country. I evaluate it with the help of the participation rate (share of the employed or those looking for employment among the able-to-work population) which, thanks to historical, ideological, as well as peculiarly specific traditions, has been extremely high here. Its decline to the level usual in other countries is the natural consequence of the democratization process. The remaining two factors, of which one is positive and the other negative, are economic. The positive one is the tremendous dynamics of the nascent private sector which succeeded in absorbing a considerable part of the released labor force. From the structural point of view, there has been an evident outflow of the work force from the primary and secondary sectors to the service sector, which is very labor intensive. That, after all, also made possible the tourist boom here, while at the same time being financed by the tourist boom. The third, this time negative, element is the survival of the phenomenon called in the economic literature "labor hoarding." It is known from the standard course of an economic cycle in the West, when during a recession and a fall in demand production declines much more than employment, because companies hope that it will be better for them to keep their skilled workforce and not have to look when demand goes up again for new people whom they would have to train. Labor hoarding here has many causes. Today, from my position as prime minister I would not presume to determine whether this is a standard, in its own way a rational, phenomenon or a specific behavior by the present and former state enterprises, and I have a feeling that not even your magazine's independent experts have enough arguments to do that. [EKONOM] Why, even after the law on bankruptcy and settlement went into full effect, are there no bankruptcies? Do you suppose it is because of the nonexistence of real, private creditors, the interlinkage of the banking sphere and the enterprises, or the overload in the courts? [Klaus] Bankruptcy is not some desired economic phenomenon. The economic phenomenon we want is restructuring. It has many forms: enterprises divide, combine, some grow, some fail spectacularly, and the notion that the only correct form of restructuring is a bankruptcy is simply fundamentally wrong. I believe that a critic of the restructuring process of the Czech economy should assess the rate of this process while keeping in mind that the absolute number of bankruptcies is only a very imprecise indicator of it. Those who connect these two phenomena are making a terrible analytical mistake. Which indicator of the restructuring do I consider better than the number of bankruptcies? I would offer any number of them. For example, the number of available jobs on the labor market, which, however, are poorly recorded in the statistics, or the rate of labor turnover. The correlation between them and the number of restructured enterprises says more than a mere number of bankruptcies, which is only the tip of the iceberg. [EKONOM] Why was it possible to maintain during the entire period since December 1990 a stable exchange rate of the Czech koruna and not find ourselves in the vicious circle: imported inflation--general inflation--imbalance in the balance of payments--further devaluation? What arguments can be used to counter the demand for the revaluation of the exchange rate, in favor of which speaks the undervaluation of the exchange rate in relation to the parity of the buying power, and how to resist the pressure from the lobby of exporters calling for further devaluation? [Klaus] Fundamental for the success of the reform was to create what I would call a cushion--that is a sufficient difference between the real exchange rate and what is usually hypothetically called parity of the buying power. In other words, the economic exchange rate had to be placed on its marginal, not the average, level. Its stability during the 36 months proved that our choice of the starting rate of exchange was absolutely correct. Since that time it has been continually strengthening, in other words, the real exchange rate is increasing even though the nominal rate remains constant. We succeeded, therefore, in fulfilling the announced prerequisite of having the nominal exchange rate become the anchor of the entire economic system, the single fixed point around which other quantities revolve, not the other way around. As far as the devaluation or revaluation pressures are concerned, they reflect the fact that various economic entities stand on various sides of the market and each pushes its own interests. The magic of the market lies in the fact that a partisan interest must not and cannot prevail, as long as there is not in power an obtuse and bumbling government which would allow itself be influenced by those lobbyists. I believe that with our government no such danger exists. But it would be an absolute mistake to assume that our exchange rate is rigid. Although the nominal exchange rate is firm the real exchange rate is growing stronger, so that actual revaluation goes on continually. But I do not think that there should be a nominal revaluation. [EKONOM] Why was it necessary to resort to wage controls? Don't you have the feeling that the thus far unprivatized enterprises, to which it should mainly apply, do not take wage regulation very seriously, while private entrepreneurs use it as a shield against the demands of their employees? [Klaus] In the ideal market, after the entire transformation in its macro and micro dimensions is completed, wage regulation, of course, makes no sense and has no justification. We are not yet in a situation where stable market relations exist; when the government analyzed the developments in the wage situation, the movement of the wages caused it justified concern. Although after the price liberalization a so-called second transformation cushion was created, when the average real wage fell below the average labor productivity, since the initial months of 1991 a process of real wage increases began. A faster increase of wages over prices is in this situation of emptying the cushion logical and quite all right, the only disturbing thing is its rate--and that was, in our opinion, considerably exceeded in 1993 and did nothing else but increase inflation and worsen our economic position abroad. Therefore the government resorted, even though it was not very happy about it, to this unpopular step, and the minute it is under the impression that it can retreat from it, it will do so without delay. A country which quickly increases its real wages pushes itself out of the market. We know many cases where this happened--we can name, for example, the former GDR after the unification of Germany or the latest developments in Slovenia--which should serve as a warning. And as far as the fact that some "escape" from the wage regulation, well, every regulation has its drawbacks. Economic policy has, always and everywhere, its two dimensions: one sends a psychological signal and the other has the effect of blocking or making something impossible. These exist parallel to each other even in the case of wage regulation. Which one of them has a stronger effect I cannot say exactly, but I believe that there is a certain effect. [EKONOM] Why is it necessary to maintain a balanced budget and not allow a deficit budget, when all West European countries work with one. In this connection the case often cited is that of the United States, which has one of the greatest indebtedness in the world and which at the same time was one of the first to get out of the current recession? [Klaus] All parents know the standard question of their children: Why do I have to be home by nine when all other children are allowed to stay out until eleven? Remember the answer you give them, and my answer to your question is not that different. Just because somebody else does something differently does not necessarily mean that it is good and that we have to do the same no matter what. It is absolutely clear that to run a deficit in the state budget, when we borrow at the cost of somebody else in the future, is bad policy. Let nobody confuse it with an individual's decision to take out a loan, which is made by one and the same person who knows that he himself will have to repay that loan. The decision of the state as a whole is something entirely different than such a decision which carries individual responsibility, and the state today and 20 years later, when the loan may have to be repaid, is not an identical entity. And that a deficit leads to inflation, which is another form of taxation on a number of economic entities, is also absolutely clear. [EKONOM] Why was it possible to make the assumption that this year the inflation will be only in the single digits? Is such expectation realistic? [Klaus] To inflation applies the theory that less inflation is better then more inflation, and no inflation is the best. Why? The entire economic system is held together by a general equivalent--money. In fulfilling its function as a measure of value it should be stable. If we have inflation, the measure is no longer made of steel but of rubber, which sometimes stretches, sometimes contracts. But we need to work with economic quantities about which we know what value they have today and what value they will have tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, in a week, in a year. That stability of values, made possible by minimizing inflation, is an enormous economic good. Not mentioning the fact that many of us have fixed incomes which are devalued by inflation. These are standard textbook arguments and are no exaggeration, as they may appear to some. When I declare that inflation will be in the single digits this year I am not arguing about percentages, I am stating above all the following: inflation will be visibly lower than in 1993 when it approached 20 percent. [EKONOM] Why are many prices still regulated by the government? To what extent is it a question of the social tolerability of the reform and to what extent a question of subsidizing monopolies? [Klaus] Undoubtedly, some prices are still regulated by the government, but there are not many of them. In comparison with many West European countries we are a country that is regulated less rather than more. I am not aware that the basic objective of regulation is to struggle with the monopolies. It is rather a question of a general tolerability of the reform. Prices must be adjusted during the entire transformation process toward their final point, which we can define as the world prices, only slowly (that is, after all, another rule of transformation). We are all angry at Skoda-Volkswagen when it wants to sell vehicles for world prices calculated by the exchange rate. That is simply nonsense, which, unfortunately, many of those gentlemen do not understand. I would not confine the reasons for changing prices gradually only to the social aspect, because far more important is the economic aspect: increasing the price of a railroad ticket to the level of world prices would not mean just that some will stop riding the trains because it is socially intolerable for them, but the next day the railroad would perish because it would cease to be used by those for whom it is economically intolerable. And it is precisely in cases of some of the more or less badly structured branches that is is useful to have the state help keep the adjustment process gradual by regulating prices. [EKONOM] Why, in spite of the fact that the private sector is growing very rapidly and shared in the creation of GDP in the third quarter of 1993 by more than 60 percent, is the decline in industrial production continuing? Data for the first three quarters of 1993 showed a decline of 5.2 percent, and in construction 4.1 percent, in comparison with the same period last year. What is the reason? [Klaus] Statistical data that describe this phenomenon may be correct, maybe not. If they are correct, then all I can say is that the process of eliminating the economically unhealthy production for which there is no demand has simply not yet ended in our economy. Nothing more, nothing less. It is a different matter, however, if the numbers do not give us the correct information. And I can make serious arguments for thinking that this is the case. First, we have here an enormous problem with the master database. Every statistician knows that the most important thing is to have a permanent master database with which to work. Thanks to the restructuring and privatization there have been some unreal changes in our database of enterprises, and I do not believe that with all these transformations every enterprise is submitting statistical reports compatible with those they had submitted in the previous year. If we grant that the error could be on the order of 1-2 percent, which, for every statistician, is a perfect result, just such an error means that the GDP in the third quarter of 1993 registered not a decline of 5 percent but an increase of 1 percent, for example. The second factor is the more precise evidential capability of the natural quantities than of the value quantities. Therefore, no matter how paradoxical it sounds, I also pay careful attention to quantities in the current prices, and I put big question marks over the quantities in the constant prices. The complexity of constructing price indexes is so enormous that an error in the category of 1-2 percent is completely negligible and rather tends to be much greater. The third argument in favor of my assertion is that in all cases individual statistical indicators measure only the gross rate, not the net quantities. The question of what is getting rid of the "wheel spinning" in any number of economic activities and what really is a decline in the net product, that for me is an unknown and statistically not recordable phenomenon. It leads me to the conclusion that the information, for example, about the decline in GDP during the first three quarters of 1993 by 0.9 percent says absolutely nothing to me, it only evokes the problem of political vindication and explanation of that number.
