If political structural reform still remains at the level of administrative structure in a general sense, then it will entail two evil consequences--few results will be scored in reform (the problem of overstaffing in organs, for example), and economic structural reform will be held back again. When interviewed by this reporter, Lu Jianhua pointed out: Although many factors that affect the trend of the social situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties, yet the five major factors comprising reform, economic construction, the political situation, public will and opinion, and the authority of the central government are the most crucial ones, which can be forecast and well grasped. Lu Jianhua, author of the book entitled "The 'Leftist Scourge' in China" under the pen name of Wen Yu (2429 5124), is the person who did the actual writing of the blue book "Analysis and Forecast of China's Social Situation" (1994), and his article "The Five Major Factors That Affect China's Social Situation in 1994" has caused strong repercussions among the personalities in Beijing who are concerned about the current political situation. People said that this was the "first article" written by a Chinese academic in recent years which "made a most pertinent and unique assessment on the situation." Lu Jianhua further elaborated on the five major factors that affected China's society this year as follows: Regarding the political situation, he said: "In 1994, the transference of central power (i.e., from the second generation of the leading collective to the third generation of the leading collective) will enter a crucial period. History proves that in the variable of the political pattern in contemporary China, the issue of unity during the period of transference of power is the most difficult to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it will elicit massive personnel changes or even policy reversals, thus leading to turbulence in the social situation. During this year, a number of vital social interest relations are urgently awaiting solution. Without a united and rational central government, it is impossible to fulfill the above mission, and inappropriateness of the course of transference of power will lead to disastrous consequences. Stability Will Be Affected by Commodity Prices In this connection, Dr. Lu Jianhua said that at the present stage, the establishment of checks and balances as well as compromise mechanisms of power within the central government is the only choice to maintain unity and rationality and, if the first step is made in the area of transference of power during the crucial period, many costs can be avoided. Lu Jianhua asserted that so far as 1994 is concerned, it is an historic opportunity to make decisions. Regarding public will and opinion, they will be another major factor affecting the social situation in 1994. Lu Jianhua said: If reform and economic construction exert excessively heavy pressure-- on commodity prices in particular--on people's daily lives in 1994, then the awareness of interest losses caused to some strata will be sharpened. Last year, peasant income grew slowly, the income of staff and workers was insecured, and the declining living standard of retired people was not improved. All this has added weight to the pressures of living of considerable numbers of people, which has increased the possibility of their unexpected response to certain particular economic policies. He pointed out: In rural areas, the relationship between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense, and in urban enterprises there have been contradictions centering around such issues as income, democratic management, and others things between managers and staff and workers. A host of facts indicate that the work style of grass-roots officials is at the core of the tension between cadres and masses, and that its adverse impact on the people's will and opinion is certainly no less than that of the corruption issue. Regarding the authority of the central government, he maintained that there will be little possibility this year of social unrest directly affected by factors of corruption. However, various kinds of frictions and conflicts triggered by the declining authority of the central government will be a hidden peril that will affect social stability. Besides, the revenue-sharing system will be practiced this year even though technical conditions have not yet entirely matured. Hence, the central government should make adequate forecasts of various possible consequences (including the intensification of local interests). Regarding economic construction, although the rapid growth that has continued for two years has brought vigor and vitality to the entire society, yet it has been followed by a certain degree of confusion, disorder, and shortage of supplies, and various social, economic, and political mechanisms that led to the overheated economy have not been removed. This means that the social causes of economic fluctuations will not be completely eliminated this year, either. Regarding reform, the institution of a modern enterprise system and structural reforms in prices, finance, taxation, investment, and so on, will be the focal points this year and, at the beginning of carrying out these reforms, a series of social and economic consequences will emerge, with some of them on the negative side, toward which a calm attitude is necessary.
