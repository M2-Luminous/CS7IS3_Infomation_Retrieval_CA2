Al-Shar' told AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM that Syria will not concede one inch of Golan territory and will accept no security arrangements at the expense of Syria's national security or pan-Arab security. He said Syria will determine its position on resuming the peace negotiations in Washington in light of the results of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the region. The Syrian foreign minister called on the United States to shoulder its responsibility as a sponsor of the peace process. He urged the United States to make the right decision to safeguard the peace process and preserve U.S. credibility in the region. Al-Shar' warned that if Israel fails to reconsider its position toward the peace process as a whole and to make the right decision to put this process back on track in accordance with the Madrid formula, then things will keep getting worse.
