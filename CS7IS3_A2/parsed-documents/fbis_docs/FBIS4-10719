In the final analysis, however, how much will Brazil pay in interest to foreign creditors over the next few years? It is difficult to know the exact figure. Almost 55 percent of the debt certificates that are being exchanged are fixed earning papers with an annual ceiling of 8 percent interest. Yet in the case of fluctuating rates, payments will be subject to the variation of interest abroad. Michael Gartenkraut, economic affairs secretary during the Jose Sarney government, estimates that the debt agreement will permit the government to economize around $2 billion per year. He says that the savings will stem from the reduction in principal and interest. Gartenkraut says: "These are preliminary figures, as they depend on the creditor banks' decision to choose fixed or fluctuating interest rates. In addition, they will also depend on the level of interest abroad." According to Carlos Langoni, former Central Bank president and current director of the FGV [Getulio Vargas Foundation] World Economy Center, the debt agreement could increase remittances abroad in the long term, but will make payments regular. Langoni says: "This agreement is much more advantageous than the previous ones, as it will effectively reduce the principal, setting more reasonable repayment periods." Langoni agrees with Joel Korn, executive vice president of the Bank of America, who believes that the Brazilian foreign debt problem has been resolved. According to him, considering that Brazil has a good reserves level and increasing exports, the debt will no longer be an obstacle for economic growth. "With the reduction of the so-called Brazil risk, the country will be able to obtain money abroad at a much lower cost. In addition, risk investment in the private sector will grow, especially by countries like Japan," Langoni says. Not everyone agrees. Economist Gerald Medley, of Pactual Bank, believes that as far as obtaining money is concerned, the external market is in very poor condition. According to him, the reason is the lack of definition of interest rates in the United States, and the uncertainties in the stabilization of the Brazilian economy. "Banks do not want those papers in their portfolios. Even countries that have already concluded a debt agreement, like Mexico and Argentina, are finding it difficult to obtain money. The time is not right," he says.
