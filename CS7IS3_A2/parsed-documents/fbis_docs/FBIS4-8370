We spoke with the chairmen of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], the Coexistence Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] about the new government and the present state and future of Slovak-Hungarian relations. [Dostal] Could you compare the previous and present Slovak Governments? [Bugar] For a year and a half, we were searching for consensus and possible dialogue with Meciar's government. No dialogue took place and a tone of confrontation prevailed. Now we can participate in coalition talks, and one takes an interest in our views. In May 1993, we had a meeting with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. One of the results was the agreement that laws concerning minorities would be deliberated with us before they get into the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR]. Unfortunately, this did not happen. We have now received the promise that not only laws concerning minorities but also all laws will be discussed at meetings of the Coalition Council, and it seems that this promise is being kept. I believe that it is necessary to show the Slovak public that it is possible to govern by other than confrontational means, as was typical of Meciar's government. The endeavor on the part of the new government is a sincere one. [Duray] The present government differs in a very fundamental way from its predecessor. First and foremost, it is not confrontational and overpoliticized and is more accommodating toward various components of society and more acceptable to foreign partners. [Nagy] In one respect, the new government differs from its predecessor in a fundamental way: It sends out very clear and unambiguous signals about its political orientation. So far, it has not left the domestic and foreign public in any doubt that it is oriented toward the Western type of democracy, the market mechanism, and the NATO security system, and that it wants to have normal relations with its neighbors, be it the Czech Republic, Hungary, or the other neighbors. [Dostal] How will the activity of the new government make itself felt in Slovak-Hungarian relations, in your opinion? [Bugar] My first experience as regards statements by members of the new government is very good. The government is looking for possibilities of coming to an agreement with the Hungarian side in some way. I think that the change of the confrontational tone can have a positive effect. A braking factor is that soon there will be elections in Hungary, and it is highly unlikely that some specific steps concerning, for example, bilateral agreements will be taken by then. It is possible to at least agree on certain principles concerning mutual cooperation. On both sides, one can feel the realization that the confrontational tone that existed between Hungarian and Slovak political representatives at the government level needs to be changed. [Duray] The first statements by the prime minister and individual government members are incomparably friendlier toward Hungary and the Hungarians living in Slovakia than statements by the previous government. There have already been positive echoes to this from the Hungarian side. It is questionable whether this government will have the time to bring about some specific changes in relations between Hungary and Slovakia but, judging from the first statements, there exists the possibility of an atmosphere being created between the Governments of Hungary and Slovakia that will reinforce trust. [Nagy] Positively. The first speech by the prime minister in parliament testifies to his accommodating steps. The government evidently realizes the importance and significance of Slovak-Hungarian relations and wants to take steps to meet the other side halfway. The response from the Hungarian side has been positive, according to my information. It would be good to seal the bilaterally accommodating attitude by a meeting at the highest level still in this period [prior to elections in Hungary and Slovakia]. This good atmosphere and the warming up in mutual relations have been contributed to also by the will of the new Slovak Government to tackle some problems of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. [Dostal] Will the new situation have any impact on the assertion of demands that were adopted at the assembly [of representatives of the Hungarian minority] in Komarno [on 8 January]? [Bugar] These demands are of a long-term nature. Everyone who knows what they contain realizes that this cannot be accomplished within six months and not even in one year. There exist various areas in which certain steps could be taken. But I would not insist that the Komarno documents be incorporated into the government's program, as it were. They do not even figure among the demands of the Hungarian parties because we, too, realize that this cannot be accomplished in six months. [Duray] The shortness of this government's term of office does not make it possible to take any major steps, in my opinion. It will not be possible, for example, to pass a constitutional law on the status of minorities in Slovakia, but some partial steps can be taken. And these are already being taken. We assume, for example, that a law on birth registers and a law on the bilingual names of communities will be passed before the summer, that structural changes will be made at the Ministry of Education, and that the concept and the composition of the Government Council for Ethnic Minorities will be changed. It is clear already that the reorganization of the territorial and administrative division of Slovakia planned by Meciar's government is being halted. This was a general demand, however, which is to the satisfaction of all self-administrative bodies in Slovakia. [Nagy] I believe that the government will fulfill the agreements that have been reached between the political parties represented in government and the Hungarian parliamentary parties. An agreement has been reached on Council of Europe recommendations as well as on some personnel issues. I do not think that the Komarno documents were used as a basis for the agreements between the government and the Hungarian parties. [Dostal] Do you not expect an aggravation of Slovak-Hungarian relations in the course of the election campaign? [Bugar] At the moment, I can only rely on the specific steps of this government. I assume that also other steps will help eliminate existing mistrust on both sides. It is very important for us that this government and the political parties that make it up be given a chance also after the elections. Both the government parties and the Hungarian parties are interested in searching for possible rapprochement, and the election campaign could be different from that of 1992, in that respect. In view of our experience with the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS], it is to be expected that they will exploit the issue of ethnic minorities in their election campaign. They will be taking advantage of every step of this government, but also of our steps, in order to demonstrate who is "the savior of this nation" and who "protects the Slovak nation against Hungarians." [Duray] They could come to a head. The question, first and foremost, is how long the new government will need parliamentary support. We expect the political tranquility we have in Slovakia right now to end with the start of the election campaign, at the latest. The aggravation of political atmosphere in the national sense will depend also on the other Slovak parties, particularly those that were represented in the previous government because it was mainly these parties that had introduced the tone of confrontation into Slovak politics. [Nagy] I expect the HZDS and the SNS to intensify Slovak-Hungarian tension and to play the so-called Hungarian card, as they have done heretofore. They have no other option if they want to win a certain part of voters to their side. They will create a picture of the enemy with regard to Hungarians and the Czechs. I would be surprised if they did not. But I hope the population of the Slovak Republic will not swallow for the second time the bait of the empty promises of this movement, as it did in 1992.
