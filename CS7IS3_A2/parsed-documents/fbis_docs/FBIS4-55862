FBIS4-55862 "dreeu099_k_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 CROATIA Opposition Leader Satisfied With Outcome Opposition Leader Satisfied With Outcome AU2005202594 Rijeka NOVI LIST in Serbo-Croatian 20 May 94 p 3 AU2005202594 Rijeka NOVI LIST Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Sonja Modric: "Parliament Is No Longer Mouthpiece of HDZ and President Tudjman"] [Excerpt] Zagreb -- After yesterday' first round of talks between the opposition leaders on the distribution of assembly posts that the opposition is entitled to have according to the agreement with the ruling party, the Liberals held a news conference in the assembly building yesterday. All members of the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] tacitly supported in front of journalists the view of their president Drazen Budisa that all the participants in the negotiations on the distribution of power in the assembly and the settlement of the parliamentary crisis "had demonstrated a high degree of political maturity and responsibility." Budisa expressed the hope that the agreement would indeed be respected by all sides. He guaranteed on behalf of the opposition that this would be all the opposition would do. Budisa declined to reveal the details of the talks on the opposition's candidates and the tactics of future moves in the assembly. Stressing that he was not authorized to talk about that yet, Budisa only conveyed the HSLS' view: Damir Zoric should remain the vice chairman of the Chamber of Counties. The Liberals are also demanding the post of the deputy chairman in the Chamber of Representatives for their candidate Goran Granic, who was nominated in a secret ballot. As Budisa said himself, he is not a candidate for any of the available posts in the assembly as he is involved only in the work in the party. Asked by the NOVI LIST journalist to comment on the view held by a section of the opposition that the opposition did not profit as much as it could have from the agreement, Budisa used the allegory: A rope can be stretched to the maximum, but then there is a danger of it snapping. It is better to have some kind of assembly than not to have one at all. A chaos and the collapse of the system do not suit the opposition. Only the undemocratic forces could wish a chaotic situation. So, Budusa takes the view that the opposition has gotten as much as it could, and that the consequences will be significant. The situation in the assembly, as he said, has already changed. The Croatian Assembly can no longer function as the mouthpiece [transmisija] of the ruling party and the president of the republic. The rift in the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] will continue. Croatian Democratic Community Has Lost Power The Croatian Democratic Community has lost the power it had and one should hope that it will behave accordingly in the future. Budisa mentioned the upcoming election of the assembly leadership, which will include chairman and deputy chairmen of the chambers and the heads of committees and commissions. Since the opposition is getting a significant number of places in this way, it is clear that its influence will be much greater. [passage omitted]
