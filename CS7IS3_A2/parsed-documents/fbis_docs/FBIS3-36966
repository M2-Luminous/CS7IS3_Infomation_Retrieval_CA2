"In essence, Croatia and Ukraine were one state 80 years ago, noted Onesin Cvitan, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Croatia to Ukraine. "Friendly links connected our countries during the time of Soviet power. I hope that Ukrainian-Croatian cooperation will grow stronger and reach a qualitatively new level by the end of the 20th Century." Valentyn Lipatov, deputy minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine, who took part in the signing of the document from the Ukrainian side, supported this opinion too. He emphasized: "The agreement between our countries on a visa-free entry procedure extends the possibilities of Ukrainian-Croatian cooperation in the area of trade links, exchanges of tourist delegations, and so on." The ceremonial opening of Croatia's embassy and trade mission in Ukraine will take place in Kiev today.
