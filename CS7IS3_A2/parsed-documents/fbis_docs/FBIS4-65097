Now that the Partnership for Peace initiative has shown the way, the individual problems must be tackled. This was stated at a news conference today in Budapest by Bundestag Defense Committee Chairman Fritz Wittmann. The main issues are compatibility, communication, education, and leadership. Wittmann stressed that of all the eastern bloc states, Hungary is the closest to Germany. He did not rule out joint German-Hungarian military exercises. However, language problems would certainly arise, as shown by the example of the Franco-German brigade. The military preparedness of the Hungarian Armed Forces is at a very high level, the politician continued. This shows that they have survived the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the process of adaptation very well. This is important insofar as Hungary plays a special role in the region, geographically and politically. Hungary's Defense Minister Lajos Fur expressed gratitude for the gratis supply of materiel from stocks of the former GDR National People's Army. This help has strengthened the excellent relations between the two states.
