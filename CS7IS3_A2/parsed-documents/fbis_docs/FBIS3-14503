The source, seeking to clarify conflicting reports in the Swiss and Austrian press, said rumours arose because "we want to have our own headquarters" after 29 years in rented premises in Vienna. As a result of the rumours, Geneva authorities contacted OPEC with an offer to provide a site for 90 years and help finance construction of a headquarters near the United Nations institutions here, the source explained. OPEC's secretariat was initially based in Geneva, but was moved to Vienna in 1965 because the Canton of Geneva refused to grant it diplomatic privileges in line with those of UN facilities here. Qatar meanwhile also said it would offer "everything you want" if the headquarters was moved to the tiny Gulf state, the source said. The source said Austria, which draws economic benefits of an estimated 50 million dollars a year from OPEC's presence in Vienna, in turn reacted by offering OPEC new terms. "The situation is still fluid," the source added, saying a written proposal from the Austrians was expected to be discussed by OPEC ministers at their summer conference in Vienna around mid-June.
