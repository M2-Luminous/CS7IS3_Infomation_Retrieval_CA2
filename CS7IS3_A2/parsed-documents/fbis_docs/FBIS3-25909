After recounting Xinjiang's achievements in economic construction in other fields of work, Abulaidi Amudurexiti said: The development and prosperity of Xinjiang is the product of unity between soldiers and civilians, and unity among various nationalities. The military units stationed in Xinjiang have regarded assisting localities in invigorating their economy as an important task in guaranteeing social stability and promoting unity among nationalities. In recent years, officers and men of the military units in Xinjiang have taken part in more than 210 key construction projects in various localities, assisted localities in building more than 310 public facilities, taken part in over 1,200 disaster rescue operations, planted more than 1 million trees on a voluntary basis, built more than 150 school structures, and assisted more than 80,000 poor households in areas where they are stationed in freeing themselves from poverty. The officers and men have helped people of various nationalities to dig more than 1,400 km of irrigation ditches, thus expanding the irrigated areas by 1.4 million mu. Water diversion canals, such as the "Canal of Army-People Unity" and the "Canal of Love for the People," have been built in many areas north and south of the Tianshan. The military units have also voluntarily helped the masses sink more than 110 wells and install over 40,000 meters of water pipes, thus solving the problem of water supply for more than 120,000 herdsmen's households and ending their long history of drinking unclean water obtained from snow. The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget the contributions of the soldiers, who are their sons and brothers, in developing Xinjiang. Pan Zhaomin said: The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang regard the "Army as a great wall, and soldiers as their relatives." Whenever a military unit has some important arduous task to perform, the masses in the surrounding areas dispatch young and able-bodied men to assist in transporting goods and provisions. Despite a shortage of capital, the governments at various levels have done their best to raise funds to help military units solve problems of drinking water and electric power, and other problems involving employment for the dependents of officers and schooling for their children. Commercial enterprises, supply and marketing departments, and bookstores have frequently organized mobile service vehicles to deliver goods to the military barracks. Counties, cities, and agriculture-animal husbandry farms run by regiments have established a system of army-people joint defense to help military units conduct patrols and maintain stability along the border areas. Throughout the autonomous region more than 3,100 household service centers have been set up to warmly help the officers and men guarding the frontier, and to solve the problems of dependents of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs. Every road, every military barrack, every electric power station, and every water diversion project along the border defense area is imbued with the painstaking labor of the people of all nationalities.
