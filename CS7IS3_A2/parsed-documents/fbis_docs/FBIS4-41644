UNA leader Anatoliy Lupynis, in an interview with the UNIAN news agency, said the democrats and liberals were the locomotives of political fascistisation in Ukraine. It is noteworthy that it is precisely the selfsame democrats and liberals who refer to the UNA-UNSO organisation as a modern neonazi one, because its militants participated in the recent military conflicts in the Dniester region, Georgia, interconfessional strife inside the state, and now leave for the Crimea for summer "holidays."
