The number of Chinese and foreign tourists visiting Hangzhou has gradually increased during this sightseeing season. In light of the increasing number of hoodlums in the city, Hangzhou's public security organ launched a drive to crack down on them in March. Over the past 40 days and more, the city has tracked down 132 cliques and arrested 692 gangsters. After cracking down on these evil doers, public order in scenic spots, amusement parks, and fairs has markedly improved. It was learned that based on investigations, the public security organ has uncovered 796 criminal cases including 301 major cases. Public security personnel also confiscated 14 guns, 227 knives, and other weapons used for criminal purposes, eliminating the hidden dangers that threaten public security and order to a great extent.
