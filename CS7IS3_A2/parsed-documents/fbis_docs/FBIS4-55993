As REUTER reports, a decision about Slovenia's participation at this conference was made at the last moment, as our country was not on the list of nine invited central and Eastern European countries last week. The French decision about this was also supported by Germany. It is known that our country, as opposed to Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Lituania, Latvia, and Estonia, has not signed the associate EU membership agreement yet.
