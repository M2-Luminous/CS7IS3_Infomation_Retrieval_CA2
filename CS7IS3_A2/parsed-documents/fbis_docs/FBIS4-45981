We have news by reporter Nam Son-hyon from New York. [begin recording] Nam: The North Korean mission to the United Nations said that it sent a telex to IAEA Director General Hans Blix on 13 May in the name of Pak Yong-man, director of North Korean Atomic Energy General Department, officially notifying him that North Korea had started to replace fuel rods at the nuclear power plant [wonjaryok palchonsoe yonryobong kyochechakopi sichaktoeumul]. According to the telex message sent by Pak Yong-nam, specially obtained by KBS, North Korea noted that from late April to early this month, it had notified the IAEA on four occasions that it could no longer delay the replacement of fuel rods. North Korea said that it regrets that it could no longer delay the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear reactor because of technical and safety problems [kisuljogurona anjonsangmunjerona to isang kyochechakopul mirulsuopssu]. Director Pak Yong-nam said in the telex message: In spite of the special status [tuksuhan chiwiaraesodo] with the IAEA, North Korea has provided sufficient conditions to guarantee the continuity of safeguards regarding the replacement of fuel rods, but the IAEA Secretariat did not respond to North Korea's good will [sonuijogin yogu], and instead put forward unreasonable conditions [pudanghan chogonul]. North Korea said, however, that there are many opportunities for future negotiations regarding the issue because it just began the work, and stressed that if the IAEA shows its fair position, North Korea could allow the IAEA to choose and keep [sontaekkwa pogwan] fuel rods while they are being replaced. It also said that the future negotiations would be more productive when they are held at the place near the area where the work of replacing fuel rods is being started. North Korea added in the telex message that it believes that it is fortunate that the IAEA has decided, though belatedly, to send the inspection team to Pyongyang and that it is ready to accept the inspection activities of an experimental nuclear power plant and a radiochemical laboratory, as mentioned earlier.
