This idea that the party is above the state has begun to be challenged by legal studies circles. Mainland scholar Guo Daohui [6753 6670 2547] published an article in the latest issue of FAXUE YANJIU [Legal Research], entitled "Authority, Power, or Right -- Pondering Relations Between the Party and People's Congress From a Legal Perspective," in which he criticized the idea of the party exercising leadership over the government. He stressed that in a socialist country, the ruling power of the communist party is not granted by heaven, and that the communist party is not a leading organ above the people's congress. Guo Daohui pointed out that the communist party's power to lead is a kind of political rallying force, a persuasive and influencing force, and that this kind of power to lead in terms of political ideology is different from state power and is not a kind of compulsory political force, nor a general restraining force on society. He also stressed that the party's leadership over society does not equal one-party dictatorship, and that the party's power to lead cannot be higher than people's sovereignty. The communist party is not the main body of state sovereignty, and cannot directly enjoy the right to rule the country. Talking about the relations between the communist party and the system of people's congresses, Guo Daohui thought that the people's congress system has been established and has been operating under party leadership, but this kind of leadership cannot be understood as the party directly enjoying the state power of the people's congress, or that the party is the supreme organ of state power. He also cited the amendments to the mainland's Constitution in 1978 and 1982 as examples. In both constitutional amendments, the words "under CPC leadership" in the sentence "the National People's Congress is the supreme power organ under CPC leadership" were omitted, and this indicated that the party could not surpass the people's congress.
