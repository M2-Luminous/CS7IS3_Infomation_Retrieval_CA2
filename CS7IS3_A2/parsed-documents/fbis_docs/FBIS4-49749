He said his father would be very much interested in the World Cup Soccer Tournament this summer. Speaking at a news conference for Chinese and foreign reporters held at the State Council Information Office today, Deng Pufang and Zhang Baifa [vice mayor of Beijing], who are in charge of the Preparatory Committee for the Sixth Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games, answered reporters' questions in connection with the games' preparations and other matters. An ABC reporter asked: How is Deng Xiaoping's physical condition? Deng Pufang said: He is in very good health [ta shen ti hen hao 0100 6500 7555 1771 1170]. He is leading a normal retirement life at home. The weather is now getting warmer and outdoor strolling is good for his health. Answering an ANSA reporter's question about humanitarianism and human rights, Deng Pufang said: Humanitarianism is closely related to human rights, involving human values and issues in many other fields. Deng Pufang: The things we do concern disabled people. We often underscore humanitarianism and human rights. Over the years, we have often advocated the need to protect disabled persons' rights and interests. He added: Since reform and opening up, disabled persons' livelihoods as a whole have improved a lot, but there are still some disabled people who have food and clothing problems. The work on disabled people should focus on those disabled people who have the biggest problems, such as whether they have jobs, have the opportunity to receive an education, or have enough to eat and to wear. It is unrealistic if we ignore these basic issues and talk about humanitarianism and human rights in abstract terms. Deng Pufang indicated that a sincere humanitarian must be genuinely sincere to do humanitarian work. He said: We in China are doing our work little by little, and little successes, accumulating over time, will result in great achievements and inspire great hope.
