FR940804-0-00024 FR940804-0-00011 Background On January 12, 1994 in 59 FR 1699, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations. Rule 454 was adopted by SMAQMD on February 23, 1993. This rule was submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for the above rule and nonattainment area is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 1698 and in a technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSD dated June 10, 1993 for Rule 454). Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 1698. No comments were received by EPA on the notice. EPA Action EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and also stop the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock. The sanctions and FIP clocks were started on October 22, 1991 when EPA determined that the State failed to make a complete submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that the State made a complete submittal. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
