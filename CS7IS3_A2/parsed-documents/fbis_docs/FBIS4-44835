Jessi offices in Munich report that a spray processor for use in semiconductor production has been developed within the framework of a Jessi project. This completely automatic unit, called the ACC4, has been designed for treating silicon wafers 150 mm in diameter. Instead of treating the wafers in chemical baths, as has been done to date, a process that has become increasingly difficult because of the continual reduction in structural widths, the spray processor removes the chemicals from large containers, and then filters, mixes, and heats them before spraying the rotating wafers. In this way, the liquid is evenly distributed on the wafer surface, a higher operating temperature with a shorter treatment time is achieved, and the reproducibility of the production process is improved. Currently, 150 to 300 wafers per hour can be treated in this way. Drying is performed by means of heated nitrogen, thereby making a closed "dry-in/dry-out" processing cycle possible. The four partners in the Jessi project--Blomme, Sapi Equipments, Leti, and Philips RTL--are now developing a similar system for wafers 200 mm in diameter. It is expected to be ready in the second half of 1995. The present system uses less energy and is about 30 percent cheaper than other competitive systems. Planned improvements in the process are aimed at reducing the amounts of chemicals and deionized water even further.
