Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said in Ankara on Monday that "normal military cooperation" will also continue after last Thursday's halting of arms deliveries. The auxiliary supplies within the framework of NATO defense aid are affected. Cetin affirmed that Turkey continues to adhere to the conditions and is using the BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers supplied by Germany from the stocks of the GDR People's Army in the internal controversy with Kurdish extremists from the ranks of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). He thinks it is completely normal that the FRG Government is taking the time to follow up on the accusations because of the tremendous domestic policy pressure and to examine whether the arms delivered from Germany were used in violation of the agreements, which, however, is not the case.
