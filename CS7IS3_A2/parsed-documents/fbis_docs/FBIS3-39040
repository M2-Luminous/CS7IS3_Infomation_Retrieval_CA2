"A new U.S. position on the recognition of Skopje is imminent," government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters in the press room. He was referring to an earlier meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou and US Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles. [passage omitted] Mr Venizelos was reluctant to express Greek annoyance over the US move, but refused to offer easy excuses: "The American side has been preoccupied with this issue and has laboured over its own position on it for some time now, precisely because it takes into account the Greek stance. Up to a point, Washington understands -- or that's how we would like to interpret its stance so far -- that pressure has to be exercised on Skopje, because that's where the knotty problem lies, namely, how to bend the intransigence, the provocative attitude and the pseudo-irredentism of Skopje." Nevertheless, he finally admitted there would shortly be "an announcement of Skopje's recognition by the U.S." Asked whether the government considered revising its "deterrent" diplomatic strategy after seemingly having lost its last trump card (which was the erstwhile U.S. reluctance to recognise Skopje) Mr Venizelos stopped short of admitting there was no other alternative. "Deterrence is not a wish, but the outcome of a determinate balance of international forces, which is beyond the power of any single country to influence on its own. However, a deterrent policy implies above all that we as a country have accurately defined our objectives. And this is what the government has done, reflecting a popular majority which transcends the electoral appeal of the (ruling) PASOK party."
