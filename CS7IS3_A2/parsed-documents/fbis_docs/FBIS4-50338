Peres was speaking to reporters this afternoon jointly with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the Foreign Ministry after their half-an-hour talk. "We never denied the difficulties, but on the other side there are still hopes of opportunities," Peres said. He thanked Christopher for his continuous effort for peace in the region. He said Christopher's visits had brought new promises from both sides for the negotiations. Christopher, who arrived in Israel Monday [16 May] from Damascus, said that "we certainly are making some progress" on bringing the Israeli-Syrian negotiations back on track. "But it's a very long road, and we are at the beginning of the long road," he said. He did not specify on the progress. "There are detailed discussions on both sides on each of the consistent points," he said. "Every meeting I have with them is certainly a progress that makes a sense." This morning, Christopher toured the new Palestinian autonomous region of Jericho to get first-hand information of the developments there. "It is really a thrilling event to see the translation of realities on the ground and to see the Palestinians taking control of the civil administration," said the U.S. secretary. Christopher is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin later today. It is still not clear whether he will return to Damascus or just return home Wednesday.
