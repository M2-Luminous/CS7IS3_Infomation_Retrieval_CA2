Yusef Azadmanesh added: This increased production resulted in a savings of $50 million in foreign exchange for tea imports. Yusef Azadmanesh gave an interview to IRNA on Sunday. He added: Last year 56,000 tons of dried tea was produced, while another 30,000 tons was purchased from India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Concerning tea imports, the executive director of the National Tea Organization said: Excessive imports of tea in recent years by peddlers and people living near the borders and the failure to control it have brought disruption and disorder to the market, and this damages production. He also said: Pricing limitations imposed by the Consumer and Producer Protection Organization and also the packaging of tea has enabled domestic tea to compete in terms of quality and packaging with foreign products. It is hoped that with comprehensive government support for farmers, this product will find its rightful place. Azadmanesh said the main reasons for the low quality of domestic tea in previous years were the failure to make proper use of modern machinery and harvesting substandard leaves from the tea bushes, and he said this trend has recently been improved. The executive director of the National Tea Organization discussed the payment of government subsidies. He said: Currently the finished price of a kilogram of dry tea is about 3,000 rials[R], while each kilogram of tea is marketed at R1,500 to R2,700. According to this official, in the Second Five-Year Economic Plan, the harvesting of more crops per surface unit will continue, with the creation of rainfall irrigation networks, and the area under cultivation will be expanded.
