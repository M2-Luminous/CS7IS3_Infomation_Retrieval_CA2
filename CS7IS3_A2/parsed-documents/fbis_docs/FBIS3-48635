Yuichi Ichikawa, a chief negotiator for the coalition parties who chaired the council, declared an end to a series of talks which had continued intermittently since Wednesday to iron out a concessionary plan to salvage the government's reform package by the Saturday deadline but failed to reach agreement on how to amend the bills. After the end of the talks at the council, leaders of the seven coalition parties and the government were meeting to work out a new strategy to help realize Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's commitment to political reform. Hosokawa told reporters he will propose a meeting with Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in a last-ditch effort to enact the reform measures. The LDP, rejecting the compromise plan offered by the ruling parties at the joint committee, presented its own reform plan before the end of the day. But the coalition parties also turned it down, saying it lacks strict anti-corruption measures necessary to alter Japan's politics, notorious for repeated bribery scandals involving key figures. The coalition could now call a second vote on the bills in the House of Representatives on Friday, coalition sources said. The bills, which were passed by the lower house last November but rejected by the House of Councillors last Friday, would become law if two-thirds of the powerful lower house members approve them. The bills would become law if two-thirds of the members of the joint council approve a compromise plan and the amended bills pass the lower and upper houses by Saturday. The joint council is made up of 20 members -- 10 lower house members who voted in favor of the reform package and 10 upper house members who voted against it, including seven LDP members. Hosokawa, who staked his premiership on enacting the bills, said earlier in the day that he would not hesitate to step down if his political reform campaign fails. He told a meeting on political reform that, "I will not stick for a minute to the post of prime minister if political reform is not realized." Since taking office as premier last August after dislodging the LDP from its 38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has vowed to get the bills passed by the end of the current Diet session. If he fails to do so, he could be forced to resign or dissolve the lower house to win a new mandate, political analysts said. The LDP's offer would increase the number of single-seat constituencies in the lower house to 300 from 274 in the original electoral reform bill, as well as cut the number of proportional representation seats to 171 from 226. This compares with the coalition's compromise plan which calls for 280 for single-seat and 220 for proportional representation seats. At present the lower house has 511 seats, all elected from multiseat constituencies and with no proportional representation. In addition, the LDP plan would split the seats under proportional representation into 47 prefectural units while the coalition proposed breaking them into seven electoral units, instead of a single nationwide electoral unit in the original bill. On political fund-raising, the LDP said political donations by an enterprise or a group to a maximum of 240,000 yen a year to individual politician's two fund-raising bodies should be allowed. But the coalition said it could only backpedal from a blanket ban on corporate donations to individual politicians in the original bill by allowing members of local assemblies to accept such donations for five years after the reform bills are enacted.
