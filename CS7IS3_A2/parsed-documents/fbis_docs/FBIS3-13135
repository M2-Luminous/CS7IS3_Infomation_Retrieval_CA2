The investigation of the Islamic commission focuses on three aspects. The first regards the guard procedures at the Cave of the Patriarchs by the Islamic Waqf and the Israel Defense Forces [IDF] prior to and on the day of the massacre. The commission found that the four IDF soldiers who were present at the site during the massacre fled from the cave as soon as the shooting was heard. The other issue this committee is investigating is the events during the massacre, mainly those pertaining to the evacuation and treatment of the wounded. The committee found that IDF soldiers fired at the Palestinians who wanted to evacuate the wounded and at ambulances. This caused a delay of more than one hour in the evacuation, which caused the death of some of the casualties. The third issue under the commission's investigation deals with events during the two days following the massacre, the manner in which hospitals treated the wounded from the cave, and casualties from IDF soldiers' fire during clashes in the city. Palestinian sources from Hebron associated with the Islamic commission have said that the commission obtained a document which contains a plan by the Jewish settlers to push the Muslims out of the Cave of the Patriarchs. According to the sources, Supreme Court President Me'ir Shamgar, head of the Israeli commission of inquiry, has, through intermediaries, requested a copy of the document. The members of the Islamic committee have not yet decided whether to accept the request, the sources said. The committee appointed by the PLO is about to present an official request to Israel's top echelons -- including Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin; Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF units in the West Bank; and Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Civil Administration -- asking for permission to collect testimonies from IDF soldiers who were at the Cave of the Patriarchs and its vicinity. The PLO committee, the headquarters of which are located at the Hebron Academics Association building, has so far collected 40 testimonies of Palestinians who were present during the massacre, 12 testimonies of people who were wounded during the massacre, and the testimonies of four Islamic Waqf guards who were at the site during the massacre. The committee has also drafted charts of the site and the circumstances of the massacre. The committee's findings will be handed over to the PLO Executive Committee in Tunis. The PLO committee is made up of 11 Hebron residents: five lawyers (including two former judges), three physicians, an engineer, a surveyor, and Shaykh Muhammad Nazim Tahbub, the Hebron area mufti, who is also a member of the Islamic commission board. The committee is headed by Attorney Hashim al-Qawasmi, a former district court judge and West Bank district attorney. It also includes engineer Mustafa al-Natshah, former Hebron mayor and a leading Fatah public figure in the region. The PLO committee is divided into four subcommittees, each having a separate area of investigation. A subcommittee investigating the legal aspects, assigned with conducting a debriefing of the chain of events during the massacre and after it, has so far collected 40 testimonies of Palestinians who were at the Cave of the Patriarchs during the massacre. A medical subcommittee is examining the issue of the massacre fatalities and is questioning the wounded. A technical subcommittee is examining the site layout, and preparing drafts and diagrams. A shari'a (Muslim-religious) subcommittee is dealing with the Cave of the Patriarchs status as a holy site and the ritual procedures in it. Attorney Hashim al-Qawasmi, committee head, said yesterday he believes the committee will end its work in two weeks. The Islamic committee is made up of four members, all residents of Hebron: an attorney, a university professor, and two clergymen. Two members of the committee, including Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, who was deported to south Lebanon, are supporters of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The head of the committee is Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Muhtasib, the Hebron shari'a qadi (ruling on Islamic laws). The committee was set up the day after the massacre by the Higher Islamic Council and the Muslim Waqf Council in Jerusalem. The members of the committee collected 30 testimonies of eyewitnesses and Cave of the Patriarchs Waqf officials. It intends to question Palestinian casualties who are hospitalized in al-Muqasid in Jerusalem and government hospitals in Bayt Jala and Ramallah. The committee has asked the Civil Administration for permits to leave the Hebron area, which is under curfew, and travel to the government hospitals to collect testimonies there. This committee has stated, giving a preliminary figure, that 36 Palestinians were killed on the day of the massacre by Barukh Goldstein and IDF soldiers' fire throughout Hebron. The committee will soon publish its findings.
