This was confirmed through a news release dated 15 April and released by Emmanuel Reyme, first secretary of the Chamber of Deputies. The great bodies of the state, the employers' associations, the protesters, and the various political groups will be consulted on a solution to the political problem. At around 1100 this morning, the office of the lower chamber will meet with the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry before beginning consultations with the employers' associations this afternoon at 1500, according to the timetable sent to the media by Reyme. The public was previously informed of this during the address to the nation on 13 April. In his message, Monde noted the institutional vacuum created by the refusal of the president in exile to appoint a new prime minister. [passage omitted] Let us recall that the political parties gathered under the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization called Monde's initiative maneuvers and a return to the starting point. According to [Hubert] de Ronceray, Monde is desperately trying to exhume the null and void Governors island Agreement. For his part, National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis keenly deplored the fact that Vice President Monde had unilaterally decided to address a message to the nation and to initiate consultations without bothering to send him the outlines.
