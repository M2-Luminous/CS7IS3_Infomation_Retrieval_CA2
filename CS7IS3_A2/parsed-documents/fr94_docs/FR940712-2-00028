FR940712-2-00028 FR940712-2-00023 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;305&hyph;000] Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff July 6, 1994. Take notice that on June 30, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, Seventh Revised Sheet No. 14 and Sixth Revised Sheet No. 25, to be effective August 1, 1994. Natural states that the filing is being submitted to commence recovery, effective August 1, 1994, of $2,066,473 net premium paid for coal gasification supplies which is part of its gas supply realignment program. Natural requested whatever waivers may be necessary to permit the tariff sheets as submitted herein to become effective August 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of the filing are being mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory agencies. Natural states that it has reached a tentative settlement with members of the Natural Customer Group (NCG) regarding recovery from them of GSR costs. Natural suggests that members of the NCG may preserve their rights by filing an abbreviated protest which may be supplemented if the settlement is not approved. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16773 Filed 7&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
