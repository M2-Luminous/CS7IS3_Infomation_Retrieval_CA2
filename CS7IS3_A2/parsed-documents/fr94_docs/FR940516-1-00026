FR940516-1-00026 FR940516-1-00001 C. Section 4.26_Use, Amendment and Filing of Disclosure Documents Except as follows, the requirements for updating pool disclosure documents would remain substantially unchanged and are proposed to be set forth in Rule 4.26. The Commission is proposing to extend from six to nine months the maximum period between the date on a disclosure document and the date of its use. This would conform the updating requirements of pool disclosure documents to those of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act for public securities offerings. 73 As under current Rule 4.21(b), two copies of each amendment to the disclosure document must be filed within twenty-one calendar days of the date upon which the pool operator first knows or has reason to know of the defect requiring the amendment. There has been some uncertainty as to whether amendments are subject to the twenty-one day prefiling requirements of current Rule 4.21(g)(1) (renumbered as Rule 4.26(d)(1)). The Commission is confirming that such amendments may be used simultaneously with their filing with the Commission, i.e. , not more than twenty-one days after the date on which the pool operator first knows or has reason to know that the disclosure document is materially inaccurate or incomplete. 73 Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act requires that when a securities prospectus is used more than nine months after the effective date of the registration statement, information contained therein may not be as of a date more than sixteen months prior to such use if the information is known and can be furnished without unreasonable effort or expense. IV. Related Matters A. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules, consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The rule amendments discussed herein would affect registered CPOs and CTAs. The Commission has previously established certain definitions of ``small entities'' to be used by the Commission in evaluating the impact of its rules on such entities in accordance with the RFA. 74 The Commission previously determined that registered CPOs are not small entities for the purpose of the RFA. 75 With respect to CTAs, the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within the context of a particular rule proposal whether all or some affected CTAs would be considered to be small entities and, if so, the economic impact on them of any rule. 76 74 47 FR 18618&hyph;18621 (April 30, 1982). 75 47 FR 18619&hyph;18620. 76 47 FR 18618, 18620. The amendments proposed herein would reduce rather than increase the requirements of Rule 4.21 for CPOs and the requirements of Rule 4.31 for CTAs. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 3(a) of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Acting Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies that these proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission nonetheless invites comment from any registered CPO or CTA who believes that these rules would have a significant impact on its operations. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, (``PRA'') 44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq ., imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance with the PRA the Commission has submitted these proposed rule amendments and the associated information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget. The burden associated with this entire collection, including this proposed rule, is as follows: Average Burden Hours per Response: 124.65. Number of Respondents: 3,924. Frequency of Response: On Occasion. The burden associated with these specific proposed rules, is as follows: Average Burden Hours per Response: 8.05. Number of Respondents: 1,162. Frequency of Response: On Occasion. Persons wishing to comment on the estimated paperwork burden associated with this proposed rule should contact Gary Waxman, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;7340. Copies of the information collection submission to OMB are available from Joe F. Mink, CFTC Clearance officer, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, (202) 254&hyph;9735.
