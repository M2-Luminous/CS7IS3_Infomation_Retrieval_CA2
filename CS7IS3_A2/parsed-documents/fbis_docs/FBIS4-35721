He informed the Libyan foreign minister, who also came to Cairo to attend the nonaligned meeting, that the whole problem can be attributed to a misunderstanding among several concerned parties including the Thai mass media. Citing the vote Thailand cast for Libya at the World Health Organization, he told his Libyan counterpart that Thailand always supports Libya, adding that Thailand has never thought of making any false charges against that country. He said only two out of 60 Thai job placement firms were involved in sending Thai workers to Libya without government permission. He asked that the Libyan foreign minister clarify his country's policy toward Thai workers. The Libyan foreign minister replied that as a matter of fact, Libya has no bias against Thai workers. Preventive measures against law violations have been applied to workers from all countries, not specifically Thailand. The Libyan people admire and praise Thai workers for their honesty, diligence, and workmanship, and learned about Thailand from them. The Libyan foreign minister also proposed that the Thai Government open an embassy in Libya so that it can look after the 25,000 Thai workers there more closely and further strengthen bilateral ties. Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri foreign minister replied that the proposal was accepted for serious consideration and hope that Thai workers in Libya will continue to contribute to the strengthening of the Thai-Libyan relations.
