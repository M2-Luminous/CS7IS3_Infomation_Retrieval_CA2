Speaking on Europe 1, Juppe said France had discussed with the Chinese authorities "our conception of human rights" and "how we considered that from this point of view the situation in China was unsatisfactory." Questioned about the arrests of a number of dissidents during the Balladur visit, Juppe said that there had been "disinformation" surrounding the affair, noting that a Chinese minister had denied the arrests while "the New China News Agency had confirmed them in a dispatch." The French minister said the aim of the trip, "to renew political dialogue with China," had been achieved. Paris was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, said Juppe, but added that China needed telephone lines, nuclear power stations, high- speed trains and wheat. "It is with this in mind that we also renewed dialogue," said Juppe. Normal relations between Paris and Beijing were restored on January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan, healing a year-long rift. Relations had become strained after a contract for the sale of 60 advanced Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by the sale of gunboats.
