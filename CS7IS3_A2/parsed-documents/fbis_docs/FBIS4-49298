Chen Xitong, member of the political bureau of the CPC Central Committee, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, and chairman of the planning and construction committee of the capital, stressed that we must strictly safeguard and implement the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the phenomena of violating and damaging the plan. Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipality and first vice chairman of the planning and construction committee of the capital, said in his speech: In 1983, the party Central Committee and the State Council decided to set up the planning and construction committee of the capital to examine, work out, and implement short-term plans and annual plans for the overall urban construction of Beijing; to organize and formulate urban construction and management rules; and to coordinate the relations of all fronts. This is extremely necessary. [passage omitted] Hou Jie, minister at the Ministry of Construction and vice chairman of the planning and construction committee of the capital, said in his speech: Big headway and great changes have been made in the urban construction of the capital. Both Chinese and foreign personages are satisfied at this. [passage omitted] In his speech, Chen Xitong expressed his welcome to the members of the newly readjusted capital planning and construction committee. He said: Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with the support of all departments and commissions, the capital has made big headway in construction. However, it still far lags behind the requirements of the central authorities and the target of having the style and features of an ancient capital as well as a modern, international, large city. We should make efforts in the next decades in order to attain the target. This task is still arduous. The main tasks of the readjusted capital planning and construction committee are to implement the "overall urban construction plan of Beijing" and to fulfill the heavy trust of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the people. Chen Xitong stressed: We must strictly safeguard and enforce the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the phenomena of violating and damaging the plan. The current plan has richer contents than the previous ones. It is a blueprint for economic and social development as well as a program to guide construction and development. Without the plan, urban construction will become disorganized or disorderly. Beijing was the ancient capital of five dynasties. The predecessors' plans were good, so does the "overall plan" revised this time. Such a good plan in the world should fully be cherished. There are only reasons for safeguarding, perfecting, and developing it but no grounds for damaging or going against it. Beijing is the capital of our great socialist motherland as well as a shopwindow of China and reflects the image of China. So, cherishing and safeguarding the plan is cherishing the capital. This is the awareness of the capital. Chen Xitong pointed out: The phenomena of going against and damaging the plan were very serious in the past. Great improvement has been made through the elimination of the disorderly, scattered, and weak situation over the past years. However, some phenomena of going against and damaging the plan still exist. If we do not resolutely wage a struggle against these phenomena, the fulfillment of the plan will become an empty talk. To ensure the smooth implementation of the plan, first of all, leaders should take the lead in strictly carrying out the plan. All the major issues, the issues going against the plan, or the issues concerning the necessity to appropriately readjust the plan according to the demands of the objective reality should be decided, according to different conditions, jointly by the chairman and vice chairmen of the planning and construction committee of the capital or by the plenary sessions of the committee. No individuals have the rights to making decisions. Second, construction units should consciously submit themselves to and implement the plan. They must not pay attention to only economic results to the neglect of the plan. Third, the planning departments should strictly make management, supervise the implementation of the plan, have the daring to make criticisms, not be afraid of giving offense, upgrade their quality, set strict demands on themselves, and realistically assume responsibility for the implementation of the plan.
