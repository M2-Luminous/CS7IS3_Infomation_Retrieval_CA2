The opinion poll was conducted by the Urban Socioeconomic Investigation Team of the State Statistical Bureau under the auspices of BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO [Beijing Youth News] between 23 and 28 February. The pollers issued 1,001 questionnaires to Beijing residents and collected 997 replies. BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO reported the results on 10 March. Commodity and service prices were also a major issue which concerned the residents of Beijing, and 46 percent of the respondents placed the issue of prices in the top position. Other reform issues which concerned Beijing residents -- in addition to the housing, medical-care, and retirement pension reforms -- were the construction of the legal system (25 percent), reform of the political structure (23 percent), educational reform (21 percent), reform of the labor, employment, and personnel system (19 percent), and reform of government institutions (15 percent). Most people maintained that the most important criterion for assessing the success of the reform is that most people are better- off. People who hold this opinion accounted for 66.5 percent of the respondents. On the other hand, 76.7 percent of the respondents maintained that the main threat to reform comes from corruption, and 72 percent of the respondents said that only if the government makes great efforts can the anticorruption struggle achieve solid results. Among the Beijing residents who were polled, 79 percent believed that reform would improve their standard of living, but 23 percent of older people, especially those above 65, feared that reform might lead to a decline in their living standards.
