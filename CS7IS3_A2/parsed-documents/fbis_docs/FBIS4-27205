Hata has donated to Shinseito through his fund-raising organization "Shinwakai," starting with a 20 million yen contribution to Hata's newly created faction in the Liberal Democratic Party in January 1993, immediately after he launched his own group, according to Hata's Secretary Akira Makabe. Hata's 50 million yen loan from banks, revealed in his financial report, was lent to Shinwakai, and part of the money was further donated to Shinseito, said Makabe, who also works for Shinwakai. It was the first, albeit partial, disclosure of Shinseito's fund resources. Shinseito, a key party in the ruling coalition headed by Hata, is scheduled to disclose the balance sheet on its political financing in September. Moriyoshi Sato, director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies, who handled the party financing, said he also borrowed 100 million yen from banks last October and lent 50 million yen to the party. "Mr. Hata and Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa are lending to the party with borrowed money," he said. Ozawa is Shinseito's secretary general and the main strategist in the coalition.
