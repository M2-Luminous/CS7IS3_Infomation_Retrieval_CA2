The strengthening of bilateral relations and several international topics were evaluated by Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali and his Argentine colleague, Guido Di Tella, who -- after representing his country at the recent Uruguay Round Conference in Marrakech -- remained in the country on an official visit. According to a joint communique, the two parties determined "the agreement of their viewpoints on the main topics that were discussed and the similarity of the evaluations that have been made by the two governments regarding the rapid evolution of international relations." After lamenting that their economic exchange has not yet come up to the level of their good political relations, the two countries expressed their desire to "consolidate their cooperation in every sphere." At the end of a meeting in which several other Moroccan ministers participated, Di Tella announced that President Carlos Menem will make an official visit to Morocco "before the end of the year." The exact date has not yet been made known. The economic exchange between Argentina and Morocco, which was very scarce in the 1980's, has been increasing constantly for the past three years.
