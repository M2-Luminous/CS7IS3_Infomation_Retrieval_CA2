ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received from Mycogen Corporation of San Diego, California a notification (53219&hyph;NMP&hyph;R) of intent to conduct a small-scale field testing of a non-indigenous microbial pesticide. The Agency has determined that the application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. Dates: Written comments must be received on or before September 30, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Phil Hutton, Product Manager (PM) 18, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 213, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA (703&hyph;305&hyph;7690). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to EPA's Statement of Policy entitled, ``Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,'' published in the Federal Register of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received from Mycogen Corporation of San Diego, California (53219&hyph;NMP&hyph;R). The proposed small-scale field trial involves the release of a non-indigenous microbial pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis serovar japonensis strain Buibui (B.t. buibui) into the field in order to evaluate the efficacy of this microbial pesticide against certain Coleopteran pests for the control of white grubs in turfgrass relative to the commercially available pesticides. Field trials will be classified as small or micro-plot studies and will be conducted within areas of approximately 50 ft. by 100 ft. Treatments will include three to five replicates per treatment. Testing will consist of one or two applications which coincide with specific stages of larval development, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd larval instars. Field trials will be conducted using prototype liquid flowable formulations and some limited testing with dry granular formulations. Liquid treatments will be applied to plots in the test area using a handheld compressed air sprayer with nozzles. Granular formulations will be applied using a pre-calibrated drop spreader. The proposed field trials will be conducted during July - September 1994 and monitored 21 days following initial application. Following the review of American Cyanamid Company's application and any comments received in response to this notice, EPA will decide whether or not an experimental use permit is required. Dated: August 19, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21104 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
