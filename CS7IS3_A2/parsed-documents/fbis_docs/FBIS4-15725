FBIS4-15725 "drsov070_a_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Grachev, Lavrov Comment Grachev, Lavrov Comment LD1104204494 LD1104204494 BFN [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian 1609 GMT on 11 April carries a 10-minute "Details" program, presented by Vera Kuznetsova, examining the chain of events leading to the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb military positions, featuring interviews with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. "Details" program regular announcer Sergey Dorenko is shown among other journalists at a news conference given by Andrey Kozyrev in Spain today following NATO's second air strike. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov points out that "according to the UN Security Council's resolution, the UN secretary general should be making such a decision in consultations with members of the Security Council. No such consultations were held with Russia." Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev says: "Although it seems that all is correct from the legal point of view -- there was a UN sanction, there were UN consultations in accordance with the UN resolution -- everything is correct here. But from the moral, human point of view we believe that there was no need for these strikes. There are no peacekeeping forces there and no one to defend. There is one Ukrainian company, 93-strong, deployed 12 kilometers away in the southwest and only 12 UN representatives in Gorazde itself, who are no danger there. Moreover -- knocking out two tanks -- frankly, we can say that this was just a demonstration of power." Answering Kuznetsova's question on whether Russia is being bypassed in the Yugoslav peace process, Lavrov says that this is an exaggeration. "When the Russian president has said for the first time that the Yugoslav problem cannot be solved without Russia's participation, you may recall that it was followed by Russia's success in easing the situation around Sarajevo. So, at that time no loss of Russia's prestige was suffered -- rather the opposite." He goes on to say: "When the Russian president stated this today, for the second time, I think it was for the same reason -- that our partners simply have not yet mastered the kind of partnership which we are trying to negotiate with them." Pavel Grachev, in an "exclusive interview" to "Details" says that in his opinion the air strikes were not necessary from the political or from the military point of view. "U.S. Defense Secretary Perry has asked me to consult with him in the future for the sake of the Partnership for Peace program." Dorenko then presents a fragment of Kozyrev's news conference in Madrid where he is shown among other journalists standing next to Kozyrev. Kozyrev says: "I had a conversation with U.S. Secretary General Christopher right here about one or two hours ago in which I expressed concern about the world being dragged into an extremely dangerous chain of exchanges of blows, and I asked the secretary of state to show maximum restraint. We believe that all sides should now immediately stop all military actions. This also means the Muslim side which, regrettably, is provoking the Serb side in a number of locations. Of course, we consider air strikes against the cities as being unacceptable, just as we do any threats against the UN forces. At the same time, it is most likely that the air strikes will bring results quite different from those that are probably expected from them. The responsibility for the possible grave consequences of these strikes -- which, most regrettably, we are still awaiting -- lies with those who made this decision."
