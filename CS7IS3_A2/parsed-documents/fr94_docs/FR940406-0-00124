In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability vehicle (or engine) selected under §86.096&hyph;24 (b) or (c), and submitting data therefor, a manufacturer may, with the prior written approval of the Administrator, submit exhaust emission data, evaporative emission data and/or refueling emission data, as applicable, on a similar vehicle (or engine) for which certification has been obtained or for which all applicable data required under §86.098&hyph;23 has previously been submitted. (g) through (h) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;24.
