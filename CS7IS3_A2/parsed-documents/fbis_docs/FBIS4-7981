Views have been expressed that this question is unconstitutional and cannot be the subject of the referendum. Many are asking what the position of the president of the Slovak Republic [SR] is in this respect: Can he refuse to hold a referendum on this issue? In searching for an answer to this question, we come up against the fact that the pertinent provisions of the SR Constitution are ambiguous and even contradictory. According to Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, "basic rights and freedoms, taxes, levies, and the state budget cannot be the subject of a referendum." It would follow from the quoted phrase that a referendum cannot be held on these questions. On the other hand, the text of Article 95 of the Constitution is formulated in such a way that it makes it incumbent on the SR president to call a referendum if a petition containing the signatures of at least 350,000 citizens requests it. Therefore, if the SR president were not to call a referendum, he could be accused of violating the Constitution, specifically its Article 95. What remains unanswered is who will judge whether the question proposed for the referendum cannot be the subject of the referendum according to Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution. The conception of the Constitution implies that the instrument should be the SR Constitutional Court as the independent judicial institution for the protection of constitutionality. The problem lies in the fact that the Constitution does not specifically entrust the determination of these questions to the jurisdiction of the SR Constitutional Court. The authority of the SR Constitutional Court to give an opinion on the problem under discussion can be indirectly implied from Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution: "The Constitutional Court interprets constitutional laws when there is a controversy. The conditions will be determined by law." The conditions referred to in the quoted provision of the Constitution are set down in Law No. 38/1993 of the SR National Council on the organization of the SR Constitutional Court, proceedings before it, and the standing of its judges in Sections 45 to 47. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court interprets the constitutional laws only when a controversy arises about their interpretation between the proposer (it could even be the president) and some state agency. From what is mentioned above, it appears that, under the existing laws, the president cannot, in the case of the planned referendum, turn to the Constitutional Court for an interpretation before the referendum is announced because there is no controversy with a state agency. The possibility of using such an approach could be provided to him only by an amendment of the mentioned law. The president could have some possibility of turning to the Constitutional Court under the existing law only after the referendum has taken place. If the Constitutional Court arrives at the opinion that one of the questions asked in the referendum could not have been the subject of the referendum as determined in Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, it could, in my opinion, declare such a referendum invalid. But the Constitutional Court would obviously make such a ruling in an extremely tense political situation and in a state of constitutional turmoil, which the results of the referendum could create in view of the conflicting nature of the several provisions of the Constitution in respect to the question concerning the fate of the deputies' electoral mandates. Under such circumstances, before announcing the referendum, it would be more appropriate to create a way, through legislative means, for the Constitutional Court to determine the constitutionality of the planned referendum, an additional reason being the initial very negative responses from abroad.
