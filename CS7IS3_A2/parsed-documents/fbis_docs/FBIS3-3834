Because the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] considers that the North Korean side has failed to give full cooperation and assistance to its delegation in completing the nuclear inspection work in North Korea, countries such as the United States and Japan have adopted measures and resorted to threats, one after another, trying to use blackmail and pressure to force North Korea to change its position. The latest threat by the United States is to send 850 U.S. troops and to ship 200 Patriot missiles to South Korea "as a deterrent force against a missile attach by North Korea." According to reports, Japan also is "drafting punitive measures against North Korea in the economic area," including ending remittances from Japan to North Korea by Koreans, stopping bilateral trade, cutting off communications links, and halting sea and air transportation between the two countries. The South Korean Defense Ministry announced that since Wednesday, its Navy, Army, and Air Force have begun to enter a "nine-day special full alert." It is not difficult to see that all these are to deliberately create a tense situation. On the previous day, Chinese Premier Li Peng has explained clearly China's position on the Korean peninsula issue which is that China is in favor of solving the problem of nuclear inspections on the Korean peninsula through negotiations, and is not in favor of exerting pressure, as this will not help solve the problem. The Chinese representative to the United Nations has thoroughly expounded China's viewpoint at the Security Council, hoping that other Security Council members can accept China's idea. Using negotiations to settle international disputes is China's consistent position. At this moment, when swords are drawn and bows bent on both sides, greater efforts must be made to urge both sides to sit down at the negotiating table. In fact, regarding this international incident, which has been caused by the problem of IAEA nuclear inspections, the two sides have completely different viewpoints. The IAEA, which sent personnel to North Korea to carry out nuclear inspections, claimed that North Korea "refused inspection of a radioactive chemical laboratory at Yongbyon," therefore "up to now it still is not certain whether North Korea has used nuclear materials for military purposes." The North Korean side, however, held that it had "enthusiastically assisted the inspection delegation in its work," and that "the inspection delegation accomplished successfully all the activities stipulated by the 15 February Vienna Agreement." Under these circumstances, the sensible method is first to clarify the truth, and not to hastily carry out blackmail and threats. If the IAEA wants to send someone to North Korea to carry out inspections once again, then it is completely possible to sit down to discuss and study the issue. On the last occasion, it was negotiation that worked in talking North Korea, which had not agreed to an inspection, into accepting an inspection. Why can the issue not be settled through negotiations this time? Some people in the international community hope that China, which maintains friendly relations with North Korea, will exert pressure on North Korea. In fact, China's position is very clear. China is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and China's consistent position is that it neither encourages nor supports nuclear proliferation. Regarding the current dispute, it should be settled through negotiations. China and North Korea are two completely independent countries, so the problem of exerting pressure does not exist. The United States is now drumming up support; it says it will impose so-called "sanctions" on North Korea, adding that among the permanent members of the UN Security Council, only China is against "sanctions," but this is not correct. The news yesterday reported that Russia, another permanent member of the UN Security Council, also said that it "hoped to solve the international dispute over inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea through talks," and they thought that "it is too early to talk about sanctions." Naturally, inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea is an issue meriting people's attention, but it is an issue that has existed for months, or even years. Why must the Americans so hastily resort to blackmail and threats at this moment in time, and send troops and missiles? People know that President Clinton has met with many difficulties abroad, and also has been battered by the "Whitewater" incident at home. Are the Americans trying to divert people's attention with this issue so as to cast off their dilemma? Regarding this, we must watch very carefully.
