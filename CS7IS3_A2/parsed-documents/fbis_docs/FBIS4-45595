FBIS4-45595 "jptdd028__l94095" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 10 June 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Newspaper Details Spread of Narcotics in Central Asian Newspaper Details Spread of Narcotics in Central Asian Countries Drug-Related Crimes Up in Kazakhstan 94WD0420B Moscow TRUD in Russian 10 Jun 94 p 4 94WD0420B Moscow TRUD Russian CSO [Report from Kazakhstan by Oleg Kvyatkovskiy] [Text] It is obvious that the south and the southwest of the republic have also been closely enrolled in the well-known "golden triangle" of intense activity of the international narcotics mafia. This is also indicated by concrete figures. In only four months of this year, 2,178 crimes connected with narcotics were registered in Kazakhstan--not so long ago, that many did not accumulate even during a five-year plan! Two hundred eleven cases of the sale of the killing "grass" have been exposed. Thirty-four hideouts, where people of all ages and nationalities "got kicks" were destroyed. Almost two metric tons (!) of narcotics were removed. Criminal proceedings were instituted against 1,276 people. Called to account were another 929 consumers of the poison; in all, 14,000 of them have now been registered in Kazakhstan. Multiply by 10--and you will obtain more or less the real number of potential killers, thieves and users of violence, capable of doing away with their own mother for a "a small amount of vodka." Prior to 1986, in Kazakhstan, as throughout the entire USSR, they obstinately pretended that "we do not have and will never have any drug addicts in our country." Now for already eight years running people in the republic "demonstrate constant concern" and "they are considering a state program of struggle". But while all the new documents on "counteraction" are being discussed, the narcotics business is not losing time. It has in abundance what the state does not have now--money. And thus, the possibility of ordering their "music."
