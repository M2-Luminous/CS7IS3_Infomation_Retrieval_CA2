Politics--particularly the matter of nationality--has moved to the head of those items which are urgently important in this matter. The southeastern part of Ukraine--the Russian-speaking and Russified portion of our country--has put forth many, many politicians and politicoes who with wearisome intrusiveness, and almost daily, have been using the mass media to advise that Ukraine should quickly join the CIS economic union. The more ethnically homogeneous western part of Ukraine crosses itself and draws back from such a prospect, regarding such a union as a significant step toward the utter loss of independence. And this is what is interesting: It is not only the obvious pseudo-pragmatists of the Kuchma-Hrynyov type and not only the directors of state enterprises who have declared themselves to be supporters of unconditional integration (read: capitulation), but also all the leaders of the communists and socialist, whose positions--as demonstrated by the very recent elections to the Supreme Council--are quite strong in the Donets Basin, as well as in the Kharkov, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, and other regions.... Under pressure from these "formers," local "referendums" were held in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts--posing the question of Ukraine's full-blooded participation in the CIS. And a predominant majority of the population answered "Yes" to this question. Also obtaining support was the idea of according the Russian language the status of a second state language in Ukraine. Here it seems that everything is understandable: The "Russian-speaking population" fears total Ukrainianization and--thereby--an infringement upon its own rights. Moreover, the transparency of the borders ensures--as everybody knows--more freedom in the movement of persons and goods, a factor which is particularly urgent for the inhabitants of those territories adjacent to Russia. The paradox lies in something else: The communists and socialist, who regard Ukraine as some kind of temporary, unreliable creation, yearn with all their hearts to shelter themselves under the wing of Russia--a country which is now headed by that fighter for a bright, capitalistic future, that anti-communist No. 1--Boris Yeltsin. This paradox requires a further, detailed, and profound study because it has certainly become clear nowadays that the underestimation of the national or ethnic factor in politics could lead to fatal errors, to a transformation of social tension to national-social tension with all the consequences which would stem from that.... Something else is likewise clear: An active, openly shameless formation of a "fifth column" is now taking place in Ukraine; Yu. Meshkov and his team have emerged as the colossal stimulators of this process. By taking absolutely provocatory steps with regard to Kiev, this pocket-sized Crimean president is testing the strength of the Ukrainian state every day, and he is disseminating an anti-Ukrainian attitude. Moreover, by setting this attitude in motion he is ready to undermine the Crimean Peninsula itself. Sensing the utter impunity of his own actions, as well as the utter incapacity of official Kiev to "put its foot down," he will--perhaps--go as far as he desires. Furthermore, Yu. Meshkov feels the moral support of the communist, Russian-speaking leaders of the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, for whom the "Meshkov experiment" in the Crimea is a model for further actions. They will not even have to find their own model, but simply follow--step by step--this little Crimean Napoleon until Ukraine is smashed to smithereens and "subsequently rejoins the great, mighty...," and so on and so forth. The left-wingers marched into the elections under the slogan: "Restore the disrupted economic ties with Russia!" One candidate for the office of deputy from Odessa waged his campaign under the slogan: "For reunification with Russia, for independence from anyone who attempts to block this." In order to make this slogan more substantial, the left-wingers organized meetings in work collectives and cobbled together some appropriate resolutions. Amid the pressure of political passions their slogans sounded like incantations, like a road map for leading the country out of its economic crisis. They endeavored to create the illusion among people that Yeltsin and Kravchuk were about to sign an important document to renew the above-mentioned ties, and that a new, happy life would begin on the morrow. A short time ago I asked one such advocate of the "renewal" idea to cite for me at least one document--a decree of the Supreme Council, an edict of the president, or a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers--which would prohibit the ministries or enterprises from instituting and developing mutually advantageous ties with any state whatsoever. That person merely shrugged his shoulders. And what can be said in this regard? Certainly such documents simply do not exist, but neither Yeltsin nor Kravchuk are to blame for what happened. Ties were broken by themselves where it made no economic sense to do so. And they will be renewed where such a sense manifests itself again--without decrees or edicts. There are innumerable speculations about Ukraine's "anti-integrationist" position. All kinds of reproaches are being poured down on the heads of the national-democrats, as if they somehow do not want to come to an agreement on resuming normal relations with the Russians. In point of fact, however, everything seems both simpler and more complicated. Whereas Belarus is being called Russia's warehouse, Ukraine is being called its semi-finished goods annex. Only 15 percent of Ukrainian industry is operating nowadays to produce finished goods, i.e., end products. The decline in production within the Russian Federation, along with the conversion process, has temporarily jolted Ukraine's entire building and repair complex; it cannot exist without Russian components. But Russia has lost interest not only in Ukrainian repair facilities, but also in its machinery, motor vehicles, coal, and metal. The energy capacity of Ukraine's manufacturing facilities has been hit hard by the sharp rise in prices for energy sources, which--in turn--has led to a precipitous increase in production costs. And nowadays even those products in which the Russian market is interested cannot be sold there because they are from 30 to 50 percent more expensive than their foreign counterparts. Add to this the galloping inflation, the crisis in non-payments, the decline in trust in the karbovanets--and the picture becomes relatively complete. In the economies of both Ukraine and Russia the ball is controlled--first and foremost--by all the crisis-type processes, and then by the ambitions of the politicians. Thus, with regard to the pace of reforms, Ukraine differs significantly from Russia. Becoming more and more widespread is an administrative game in accordance with which the ministries in Kiev pretend that they are directing the enterprises, whereas the enterprises pretend that they are turning out products. Hidden unemployment is increasing. Wages are either not being paid out at all, ot they are being paid in purely token amounts. The growth of social tension has already produced its first "eruptions." Meetings and demonstrations, as well as the picketing of state institutions, have occurred in Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and other Ukrainian cities. The state has demonstrated its inability not only to adminster state industry, but also to shore up an effective financial policy. Therefore, many economists consider that help should come from the collapsed privatization program. But this would be extraordinarily difficult to do within the disrupted Ukrainian political system--the uncertainty concerning the stances to be taken by the newly elected parliament, the presence of what is essentially a temporary government, and the decline in the president's popularity.... The prospects for Ukraine to sign the documents on joining the CIS economic union are likewise uncertain. Only one thing can be said without ambiguity: The Belarusian variant will not work in Ukraine, regardless of who is in power--the right-wingers or the left-wingers. The key questions of the union--inclusion within the ruble zone, the abandonment of our own currency, the conversion of the National Bank of Ukraine into a branch of the Moscow Bank, the elimination of customs duties, and other such things--have now evoked an allergic reaction not only among the national-democrats, but also in most of our state's population. No less protest has been evoked by the attempts to issue shares--along with Russia--for several Ukrainian enterprises, first and foremost, on facilities in the oil-and-gas complex. In the opinion of serious politicians (unlike such persons as Kuchma), all these things threaten Ukraine with a complete loss of sovereignty and its transformation into one of the non-state provinces of the federation. And steps in this direction could lead to unforeseen consequences; they could place this country on the brink of a civil war. And one will hardly find in Ukraine any political force which would assume the responsibility for such a precipitous historical step. Thus, "Meshkovism" has released deep roots, dreams about some miraculous, communist-sausage past, and gladdened the hearts of thousands of people in our marginal country. It is one thing to be gladdened by dreams, but quite a different matter to take up Kalashnikov automatic firarms in order to put such dreams into real life. Leonid Kuchma is the only person who thinks that he can thus "subdue" Ukraine peacefully without sweeping it away. He is mistaken in this because certainly the two years of independence were for us not merely years of mistakes and disillusionments. A new type of person--a Ukrainian citizen--has come to replace the faceless owl. Aside from national-political aspects, the problem of sharing a single economic space with Russia also has essentially practical aspects. Some people are proposing that we integrate ourselves into the economy of a state which--to put it mildly--has not demonstrated itself to be a model of prosperity. It has the same decline in production, the same non-payment crisis, strikes by miners, along with gradual disintegration of the oil-and-gas complex, electric-power engineering, transportation.... What will happen to such an economic space? What kind of economic union would that be? Perhaps, a union of the barefoot and the naked.
