Police said earlier the three were shot by the occupants of a bakkie [pick-up truck] the officers stopped near Alberton on Wednesday morning. Police spokesman Lt Deon Peens said in a statement Mr H R J Killian, 35, was wounded and the main artery in one of his legs was severed, while Mr H van der Westhuizen, 44, was shot in the head. They were admitted to hospital. A woman, whose name has not been released, was wounded in the buttocks while she was sitting in a taxi near the scene of the shooting. Commander "Zimbiri" used a pre-arranged code in his call but there was no other way SAPA could independently verify the authenticity of the call. He said the Alberton attack killed three officers -- "whites, naturally." There was no immediate explanation for the discrepency between his account of the attack and the police version. The caller added the attack formed part of a "farewell programme" for APLA Commander Sabelo Phama who died in a motor accident in Tanzania last week. "Zimbiri" claimed the death had been no accident and that Phama had been assassinated in a plot jointly planned by South Africa's National Intelligence Services and the USA's CIA. APLA is the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania.
