This incident is part of a long line of oppressive measures that the present government has undertaken against the political opposition and the independent and opposition press. For the AD in particular, this criminal act comes after the murder of Gjovalin Cekini, after the shameful organization of a defense for his murderers, after the assault on deputy editor in chief Gjergj Zefi, after dozens of incidents prepared in the offices of the ruling Democratic Party against the AD's work, and after attacks, insults, and slanders against the party's leaders. This latest activity of the Albanian Ton-Ton macoutes neither surprises us nor weakens us. As we have declared, the AD's members are ready to give their lives to establish democracy in Albania. They will die as Cekini did, if this is the price required, but they will never fall silent and they will continue to loudly denounce the police state that has been created in Albania. The AD does not protest against the state and asks for nothing from it, but issues a strong warning that the last stop on the road of crime is prison.
