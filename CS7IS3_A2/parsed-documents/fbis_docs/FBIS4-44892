Manufacturers who have mastered these systems have been getting good results using them in ordinary operations. There are numerous examples of photomolding systems being used in the development process to create prototypes for verification and testing purposes, and in the production process for vacuum casting and to make casting models. All past methods for accomplishing these same tasks required large amounts of time and money. The point of mastering photomolding systems is to produce plastic models with minimum precision and strength. Decreasing numbers of experienced, skilled technicians means that it now takes several weeks to produce wooden patterns for casting purposes, thus making it impossible for makers to respond to sudden orders. And pressured by budgetary constraints and development deadlines, manufacturers are unable to prototype and test their products adequately. Photomolding systems have the potential for solving all of these problems. Photomolding systems harden or cure photocured resins in layers by carrying out laser scanning operations based on three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) data, and then create three-dimensional shapes by stacking sectional forms. As long as 3D CAD data is available, plastic models can be produced rapidly, and even shapes that are not possible with machine processing, like hollow structures, can be integrally molded using photomolding systems. Although they share a common production method called "sectional stacking," various equipment have been developed recently according to the types of materials and processing methods employed. The generic term "Rapid Prototyping & Manufacturing" (RP&M) is often used to refer to this equipment and the processes they are used in. There are a wide variety of uses for plastic models produced via photomolding systems, including prototypes for checking the shape and functions of products and as casting models.[.sup](1)[/] On the flip side of the coin, however, the equipment alone runs several tens of millions of yen, and the resin used in the photomolding process costs upwards of ¥15,000 per kilogram, making photomolding systems extremely expensive. And there are also those who harbor doubts about the effectiveness of these systems, citing the need for 3D CAD data, and insufficient precision and molding speeds as their reasons. However, progress is being made in the development and improvement of photomolding system equipment and resins from the standpoints of lowering their costs and increasing their accuracy and operating speeds. A Photomolding Production Association has also been founded, and the government has begun supporting photomolding systems via tax breaks and technological development subsidies. Under these circumstances, manufacturers have already begun to incorporate photomolding systems into their daily operations and are getting results. This article relies on case studies to try to determine just how these systems can be utilized to achieve the best results, and exactly how effective they are from the standpoint of reducing production time and costs. Plastic Models Machine Processed Using NC Tools -- Average Daily Operating Time Is 20 Hours The Nakashima Propeller Company (headquartered in Okayama City) introduced a photomolding system into their operations in March 1991, and ever since, according to Vice President Hiroshi Nakashima, they have been using that equipment "...as part of our production line." Nakashima Propeller is engaged primarily in the manufacture of propellers for boats and ships, and uses the plastic models produced via its photomolding system in place of wooden patterns as casting models.[.sup](2)[/] The shape of a propeller will differ slightly according to the shape of the ship, the type of engine, the location where it will be used and the type of performance being sought. Therefore, there aren't many cases where the same shape propeller is mass-produced; the tendency recently being toward small-lot, multi-product production. Up until recently, three types of casting models were used at Nakashima Propeller -- metal molds, wooden patterns and rotating molds (a kind of sand mold that employs a rotating squeegee-type device). Casting is performed using these models, and machine-processing is relied upon to complete the product. Metal molds are produced in dimensions that will enable them to be used in common on products for which continuous demand is anticipated, whereas wooden patterns are used to produce propellers for which there is a concentrated, short-term demand. The rotating mold is used to turn out small lots of small-sized propellers, as well as large-sized propellers. The company has recently been turning out increasing numbers of propellers with completely new shapes, and for these, has been relying more and more on wooden patterns and rotating molds. Because the rotating mold process is done completely by hand, it requires skilled technicians and longer production schedules. The same can be said for wooden patterns. The longer schedules, combined with a shortage of skilled technicians, have been making it very difficult to meet orders with short delivery times. It was this situation that prompted Nakashima Propeller to take a close look at photomolding systems. Its photomolding system cannot be applied to the manufacture of truly large-sized propellers, but is more than capable of handling three-blade propellers, the maximum diameter of one blade of which is one meter. Depending on the shape of the propeller, the photomolding system can often produce plastic models that are closer to the finished product than those using wooden patterns or rotating molds, a factor which helps cut down on machine-processing time as well. The costs involved in producing a single mold using the photomolding system are about the same as those for rotating molds, but because the photomolding system does not require the intervention of skilled technicians, according to Koichi Kuramoto, head of the Medical Business Office, "It is cheap when you think in terms of the investment required to train skilled technicians." Compared to the roughly one week required to manufacture a wooden pattern for a propeller with a diameter of 80 cm, the photomolding system can produce the same size plastic model overnight. The photomolding system makes effective use of nighttime hours to complete the molding process, leaving daytime hours for removing the plastic models from the molds and/or replacing the resins. The average operating time per day works out to 20 hours. Thus, it only takes about one day to complete a plastic model, and several small models can be produced at a time, further increasing efficiency. And the photomolding system enables the user to enlarge the pitch of the lamination layer to the limits to create hollow shapes, thereby reducing molding time and material costs. Since the plastic models are ultimately machine-processed, their surfaces need not be all that precise upon coming out of the mold. Also, it isn't like propeller designers simply determine the sectional forms and major dimensions to create a completely three-dimensional shape. That is why Nakashima Propeller constructed a system that makes use of CAD macro functions to automatically create 3D CAD data. This data is shared by the photomolding system and the numerically-controlled (NC) machine tools. But because the photomolding system produces plastic models that are slightly larger than the end product, some revisions must be made to this data. Government Intervening to Improve Utilization Environment Via Tax Breaks and Development Support Aimed at Lowering Prices In October 1993, the Japanese Government added photomolding systems and their peripheral equipment to the list of systems/equipment that fall under the purview of the Basic Technology Research and Development Promotion System (high-tech tax system). These systems/equipment will remain on this list for one year, until September 1994. During that time, 7 percent of the price of purchasing such systems/equipment can be deducted from the purchasing firm's corporate taxes. There is also a possibility that this time period and the items targeted for inclusion on the list will be expanded. As a measure aimed at lowering the price of photomolding system equipment, the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Corporation plans to commence development of related technologies on a consignment basis. The budget for this undertaking is expected to total ¥800 million covering a four-year period beginning in FY94. On the industry side, a Photomolding Industry Association was officially launched on January 26, 1994, with a total membership of 57. This group will not only promote photomolding systems, but will encourage RP&M activities in general. Membership is comprised of representatives from photomolding equipment and resin manufacturers and users, CAD vendors, peripheral equipment makers and researchers, who plan to engage in technology exchange and research and development work, as well as activities designed to certify what equipment falls under the purview of the above-mentioned high-tech tax system. Copes With Future Shortages of Skilled Workers and Cuts Processing Time Roughly in Half Ideally, a manufacturer can construct a system such as the one put together by Nakashima Propeller which automatically creates 3D CAD data, but in actuality, often the product in question makes this impossible. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Mihara Works is also utilizing plastic models in place of wooden patterns, but they must input 3D CAD data into the photomolding system by hand from the drawings.[.sup]3)[/] Even so, they claim the results have been significant. The Mihara Works installed a photomolding system into its operations in May, 1992, to produce plastic models in place of the wooden patterns the plant had had to rely on up until that time. Of course, a certain amount of knowledge concerning how to read drawings is required, but even employees who have only been with the company a year can input 3D CAD data into the company's photomolding system. The 3D CAD data required by the photomolding system can be obtained from verifications of casting system plans, mass calculations and shape studies. There are also occasions where scale models are produced for use in design work. The plant also studied assembly processes based on 3D CAD. Up until the plant installed the photomolding system, the preparation of most wooden patterns was assigned to specialists. However, with the growing shortage of skilled technicians, the plant found itself in a situation where it couldn't meet delivery dates even when its employees worked on weekends and holidays. And when they tried consigning their wooden pattern production work to outside firms, even "urgent" orders took around 10 days to get back. Their photomolding system cuts this time in half, to five days turnaround time. Hiroaki Sano, chief of the Casting & Forging Section of the Machine Department, stated that when they were considering installing equipment for the production of models, "We couldn't decide whether to go with NC machine tools or a photomolding system." Their reasons for choosing the photomolding system were: (1) No need for skilled technicians; (2) Even hollow shapes can be integrally formed; (3) Unmanned operation capabilities make it possible to effectively use nighttime hours and days off (for short delivery times); and (4) The same shaped models can be produced over and over again. The final analysis was that NC machine tools were more troublesome to operate than a photomolding system from the standpoint of having to change tools and work. Dimension Accuracy Above Specs and Increased Strength With Fluororesin-Coated Sheets The photomolding system being used at the Mihara Works can produce plastic models up to 850 x 600 x 500mm in size. Models larger than this are produced in several parts, which are then joined together when they are attached to the plates. As for the dimensional accuracy of these plastic models, according to Chief Sano, "The plastic models exhibit around half the errors allowed by the precision specifications for the castings, and are more than satisfactory as replacements for precision casting wooden patterns." Metal shrinkage and sand mold deformation greatly affect precision. But plastic models turned out via the photomolding system exhibit little change over time, and can be taken out and used after six months in storage with no problems. There have been cases recorded where the same plastic models were used between 100-200 times. To cut back on the expense of the raw materials used in plastic models, honeycomb structures are employed. The surface layer of these models is about 1mm in thickness. If this surface layer is made any thinner, molding time and material costs might be reduced even further, but model strength could not be maintained. When it comes to repairing broken plastic models or revising their shapes, excess parts can be cut off and fast curing resins used to fill in cracks and depressions, and the repaired/revised area can then be coated with a photocuring resin. This photocuring resin will harden up with exposure to sunlight. A few techniques being used to enhance the strength of plastic models include thermal spraying aluminum (Al) and pasting a fluororesin-coated sheet on the surface of the model. Chief Sano says that applying these measures "Extends the service life of the plastic models longer than that for wooden patterns." Since the costs involved in thermal spraying are quite high, this technique is not used that often, but fluororesin-coated sheets are employed all the time. These sheets not only improve strength, but also add to the surface precision of the plastic models. Thus far, fluororesin-coated sheets have been used on wooden patterns in place of mold-releasing agents. This is because the long service life of these sheets helps hold costs down. For example, the same model is used to produce 200 sand molds. Ordinarily, a mold-releasing agent would have to be re-applied to the pattern or model about once every five times, or roughly 40 times during the course of turning out the 200 molds. But a fluororesin-coated sheet is applied once and can be used for all 200 operations. This cuts costs by roughly one-half. And since the sheets offer better releasability vis-a-vis casting sand than mold-releasing agents, you can get by without allowing for a large draft. This reduces pads, and helps lighten weight and reduce the amount of raw materials used. Techniques are also being used whereby these sheets are only pasted to those areas where mold-releasing agents peel off easily. Molding Simple Shapes to Increase Rate of Operation At the Mihara Works, roughly 18,000 man-hours are put in per month on casting models. The photomolding system is operated approximately 300 hours a month, but since it possesses twice the productivity, these 300 hours are equivalent to roughly 600 man-hours put into producing wooden patterns. The photomolding system therefore accounts for one-thirtieth of the overall monthly man-hours spent on casting models at Mihara Works. Because the photomolding system is being used primarily to turn out small-size models, in terms of numbers of models produced per month, photomolding accounts for between 20-30 percent of the total. Producing small, intricately-shaped models by photomolding costs less than with wooden patterns. Therefore, there are times when the simply-shaped portions of large-sized models are constructed of wood, while the smaller, more complicated parts of these models are photomolded. Let's compare the cost of producing molds using wooden patterns and plastic models on differently shaped objects, using as examples brake covers and cylinders. The volume of the brake cover is roughly five times that of the cylinder, but the shape of the cylinder is significantly more complex. Manufacturing these brake parts using conventional wooden patterns cost 260,000 for the covers and 260,000 for the cylinders. Producing the same parts using photomolded plastic models cost 200,000 for the covers, but only 135,000 for the cylinders. The cost of the resins used to make the plastic models increases proportionally to the volume of the model, thus working out to 75,000 for the covers and just 16,000 for the cylinders. In addition to raw materials costs, producing a plastic model prototype also involves depreciation costs, energy, laser wear and tear and personnel expenses. From the standpoint of production time, it took 90 hours to construct the wooden pattern for the brake covers and 135 hours to put together the brake cylinder wooden pattern. The cylinder pattern took considerably longer to produce. If we do not count CAD data preparation time and look only at the molding time required by the photomolding system, we see that it took 49 hours to produce the cover model and just 45.7 hours to turn out the cylinder model. Photomolding required less time to do the cylinder model than the cover model. These findings indicate that complex shapes have a big impact on the time required to produce the wooden patterns for them. Naturally, this increases the costs involved in the process as well. We also learned that the greater the volume of the product, the longer it takes to produce a photomolded plastic model for it, but that complex shapes have little or no affect on model production time using the photomolding system. Thus, the more complex the shape involved, the greater the merits of using the photomolding system. However, if this were the only criteria used to choose between wooden patterns or photomolded plastic models, the operation ratio of the photomolding system would probably drop and the per-model costs of producing plastic models would most likely increase in accordance with the types of orders received. This in turn could lead to a vicious cycle wherein the criteria used to determine the shapes for which plastic models are most effective become increasingly strict. To avoid this situation, the Mihara Works raises the operation ratio of its photomolding system equipment by producing whenever possible plastic molds even for simple shapes that could just as quickly be done by hand (wooden patterns). This approach has other advantages as well, one being the shortening of delivery times. And contrary to wooden patterns, the in-house quality control procedures required for photomolded plastic models are easy to carry out. Rapid Response to Frequent Shape Changes and Fewer Misunderstandings Concerning Perceived Shapes Nihon Morex, a manufacturer of connectors (headquarters in Machida-shi, Tokyo), is employing a photomolding system to turn out prototypes for submission to its customers. In developing connectors for consumer electrical appliances and equipment in particular, the shapes of these connectors undergo numerous changes from order-receipt to commencement of mass production, and the photomolding system is very effective at dealing with these frequent shape changes. Connectors for use on consumer products come in an infinite number of different shapes, and are generally produced on the basis of specifications dictated by customers at order placement. Below is a brief explanation of what the work flow from order placement through mass production looked like in the past. Based on specifications provided by the customer at order placement, Nihon Morex designers would put together product drawings tailored to satisfy these specifications. Once the customer had checked and approved these drawings, then prototyping began. Prototypes can be divided into two major types. These are prototypes for studying shapes and for confirming functions. Prototypes for studying the shape of a product are almost always produced singly, while prototypes for checking out the functions of a product need to be turned out in larger numbers and require metal molds. There are times when both types of prototypes are manufactured simultaneously. In the past, since solid, three-dimensional shapes were created based on two-dimensional data in the form of orthographic projections, shapes were often changed following the manufacture of the prototype. The reasons for these shape changes included engineering changes made by the customer and different perceptions of the final shape held by the customer and Nihon Morex, as well as design and manufacturing errors. Despite the fact that connectors come in relatively straight shapes, it is very difficult to describe all the data involved in drawings. This results in differences between the shape the customer has in mind, and the shape envisioned by the designers based on the specifications. The shape envisioned by the designers based on the specs often also differs from the shape imagined by the customers after looking at the drawings. Because these kinds of misunderstandings existed, claims were often made whenever Nihon Morex showed the customer the prototype, and Nihon Morex would have to redo the prototype a number of times until the customer was satisfied. There were occasions in the past when the company had to redo prototypes as many as eight or nine times. It normally takes about a week to produce a single prototype, but it can be done in two to three days with five to six engineers working overtime on it. And when a large number of prototypes are needed for functional testing, the patterns or molds for these prototypes must be prepared. This can take between three to four weeks, with two to three weeks required just for the pattern parts. This time-consuming process must be undertaken every time there is a shape or other change to the original specs. With the photomolding system, however, it only takes one night to prepare the required shape. And when a prototype of the same plastic material as the product is needed for functional inspections, the plastic model produced using the photomolding system is transferred to a silicon mold and vacuum-casting is carried out. The process is completed in two to three days. Nihon Morex has developed a system for rapidly producing plastic models reflecting shape changes. The company's sales representatives now carry notebook-style personal computers around with them with drawings of client products stored in memory. When a customer dictates a shape change to a visiting sales representative, the sales representative inputs this data directly into the digitalized drawings of the original design stored in the PC's memory and immediately transmits that revised drawing over public telephone lines to the company. And whereas customers used to have to confirm their specifications based on drawings alone, the photomolding system now enables the company to provide its customers with plastic models at the initial stage of the process, a development which has drastically reduced the number of shape changes made by customers. What used to require eight to nine shape changes, now can be accomplished with as few as two to three changes. The shortening of prototype production time and the reduction of changes has had a considerable impact on Nihon Morex operations. For instance, customers are not about to delay the start of their mass production operations because their connector supplier can't meet its delivery deadline. Prior to installing the photomolding system, Nihon Morex engineers had to put in considerable overtime producing prototypes as delivery times drew near. Nihon Morex has taken a number of measures aimed at taking full advantage of its photomolding systems capabilities. For instance, in order to produce a high precision model, the company has deliberately lowered the output of the laser by inserting a glassplate in the laser path. This has improved the level of precision from what used to be 0.1mm to 0.05mm. As a result of enhanced precision and improved resins, pins, terminals and other metal parts can now be inserted into the plastic models. Prior to these improvements, plastic models often broke when metal parts were inserted into them, prohibiting the functional testing of these plastic models under the same conditions as the finished product operates in. Nihon Morex also purchased a special American-made software package for US$500 that automatically produces the shapes of the supports. (Parts required to support those parts suddenly thrust out when producing solid models by stacking sections. The location and shape of these supports depends on the stacking direction.) When the user inputs the three-dimensional shape and stacking directions of the model and the material value of the resin, this software produces the minimum support in the optimum location. This support is made to bend at the touch of a finger, making follow-up processing extremely easy. Reduced Annual Prototype Expenses by 100 Million; System Expanded for Common Use of All Departments. After installing and using a photomolding system to produce prototypes for one year, Toyota Motor Corporation "reduced its prototyping expenses by 100 million," according to Akihide Kobayashi, a foreman in the Coordination Department, Engine Development and Engineering Division No. 1, Vehicle Development Center IV. TMC produced 66 different types of molds for a total of 212 molds in all during that one-year period.[.sup]4)[/] This figure was arrived at by totalling up the difference between the costs of producing prototypes using the photomolding system and the postulated costs of producing prototypes of the same shapes using conventional methods. This figure did not take into account such secondary effects as shortened development time and reduced numbers of engineering changes. TMC installed the photomolding system in its engine design division in 1990. TMC worked together with the manufacturer of the system to develop an enhanced version capable of turning out models larger than those possible with off-the-shelf photomolding systems so that TMC could use this system to produce all the prototypes required by the engine design division. The prototypes produced using the photomolding system are reportedly used to confirm shapes that cannot be satisfactorily checked using 3D CAD alone, to confirm mountability and to study the intake parts required for comparative testing. Foreman Kobayashi claims that the photomolding-produced prototypes are "especially effective for visualizing air intake flows." In the past, the prototypes produced for visual testing purposes were constructed of acrylics and polycarbonates. It cost several million yen to produce just one of these prototypes. Depending on the shape of the prototype, there were instances where they could only be made with channels or passages inside rectangular parallelepiped, which meant that intake flows were not visible from all angles. When TMC uses its photomolding system, it reportedly estimates molding expenses at 10,000/hour, which includes the time required for everything from data preparation to molding and follow-up processing, and after making comparisons with other prototyping methods, advises its engineers. When TMC produces a prototype for visual testing, it acquires a clear understanding of just what degree of precision is needed for which parts, and what is required in terms of surface processing, such as support removal and polishing. This enables the company to manufacture a product without engaging in extra and unnecessary work. For this reason, even though they have an order (specifications) in hand, the designers always meet with the engineers in charge of molding. The photomolding system can fall victim to abuse. Because the photomolding system makes it possible to produce prototypes faster and cheaper than conventional methods, there is a tendency to turn out more plastic models than are really necessary. Although one approach calls for making the most of the special features of these plastic models to carry out more studies than was possible in the past, desktop studies are often just as beneficial. TMC has therefore implemented a follow-up survey to determine whether or not the plastic models produced using the photomolding system are actually being put to use. This survey program is designed to put a halt to the unnecessary production of plastic models. And to lower unit costs, the company is also striving to utilize a single plastic model in numerous studies. TMC purchased a second photomolding system at the beginning of 1993, and has created a system whereby the chassis, body and other divisions can simultaneously use this system together with the designers in the engine division. This had evolved from the fact that the engine division had been asked in the past by other divisions to produce molds for them, and because the advantages of the photomolding system have been recognized by all of the company's other divisions. The knowhow needed to operate the system is passed on to each new section that is set up, and TMC says that its photomolding systems are now operating 5,000 hours a year. Consigning Model Production to Outside Firms Because photomolding system equipment is so expensive, if a company cannot assure a certain rate of operation, then its investment will not prove effective and the cost of model production will be high. And to operate a photomolding system effectively also requires 3D CAD data and molding knowhow. For these reasons, numerous manufacturers opt to contract with outside firms to have their models produced for them. What does it cost to have models produced outside? There are basically two ways of calculating these costs. The first involves calculating unit costs on an hourly basis (hourly rates) for each process, such as CAD input, molding, etc., and the second calculates costs based on the volume of the model being produced. One manufacturer who uses a photomolding system to produce plastic models on a consignment basis determines his costs in the following manner. First, this maker charges a basic fee of 30,000 per job. In addition, it then establishes the hourly costs for each of four processes -- 3D CAD data input, slice data preparation and other data processing work, molding and follow-up processing, such as removing supports, etc. Molding expenses include equipment depreciation costs, laser wear and tear expenses, the cost of raw materials, utilities charges, personnel expenses and site rental fees. The hourly rate for CAD input is 10,000, data processing costs 5,000 an hour, molding is 20,000 and follow-up processing runs 5,000 per hour. For example, if CAD input and molding each takes 10 hours, and data processing and follow-up processing each require two hours, then the final bill, including basic fee, will work out to 350,000. Costs cannot be arrived at this simply for complex shapes and/or when detailed processing is required. But costs can be held down somewhat if the company contracting for the production of the model produces the slice data in-house. 3D CAD Is a Necessity; Goal Is Improved Overall Efficiency When using a photomolding system, the time required to input data can be shortened if 3D CAD data is prepared right from the initial stages of the design process. The Sony Corporation is pushing forward simultaneously with the promotion of 3D CAD and the use of a photomolding system. The company applies 3D CAD to the development of specific products, then makes use of that data in its computer-aided engineering (CAE) and photomolding system operations. Sony says this enables it to evaluate any problems and the measures to deal with them, and the effectiveness of each of these tools. Sony's System Development Section, which falls under the Research and Development Department, Production Engineering Development Division, is in charge of operating the photomolding system, and produces plastic models requested by Sony's other divisions. Since actual costs would be too high if calculated in detail, the System Development Section calculates the cost of operating the system at roughly 10,000 an hour. But Hiroshi Harimaya, manager of that section, says that "There are also times when the cost is set at the figure given by the requesting division." The company expects operating costs to drop once utilization of the system increases, the rate of operation goes up and operating knowhow is accumulated. Until then, Sony feels it is has to turn a blind eye, at least to a certain degree, towards test period operating costs. If a company is capable of using a photomolding system to its full potential in-house, then installing such a system on these terms is one possible approach. However, for small- and medium-sized companies, it is quite likely that even if they introduced a photomolding system into their operations, it would lie idle much of the time. For these companies, better approaches to making use of photomolding systems might be to get together with other like-minded firms to purchase and use a photomolding system on a group basis, and or to take advantage of firms that undertake the production of plastic models on a consignment basis. These latter approaches would not afford the opportunity to accumulate operation knowhow, but firms would still be able to acquire knowledge on the capabilities of photomolding systems in the area of applications. Conclusion Photomolding systems have a variety of applications, but more often than not, if a company tries to use a system in too many different ways, it will not acquire the skills and knowhow necessary to utilize it well in any one of them. This is because the degree of precision, strength and production time differ for each application. And those users who are benefiting the most from their photomolding systems have come up with numerous schemes to enable them to master the operation of these systems. In the future, as users increase in numbers, equipment prices drop and 3D CAD comes into more widespread use, it should become a lot easier for companies to install photomolding systems. When this happens, the key to the successful use of these systems will lie in steadily building up experience and coming up with ways of utilizing these systems that are tailored to the company's operations. Appearance of New, Low-Cost Equipment; Expanding Selections Based on Applications Numerous RP&M equipment centered around photomolding systems can now be purchased in Japan (See Table 1). Roughly 100 of these devices/systems are already being operated domestically. Table 1.

As a result, a variety of RP&M equipment, other than photomolding systems, is now being proposed and developed in the U.S. And a number of these equipment can also be purchased here in Japan. There are also numerous manufacturers marketing photomolding systems in Japan. These include 3D Systems, Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) of Germany and a number of Japanese manufacturers. Most of these systems make use of helium-cadmium (He-Cd) or argon (Ar) laser devices. There is only one system that utilizes a semiconductor laser, and that is the SLP produced by Denken Engineering headquartered in Oita-shi.[.sup](b)[/] The development of a resin that cures (hardens) in the semiconductor laser wavelength region was the impetus behind this system. The SLP is both compact and inexpensive. Another system scheduled for marketing by Ushio Electric this year is also compact and relatively inexpensive. This system uses a He-Cd laser, but achieves compact size by reducing output. Scanning speed is slow, however, and molding takes a long time. Let us briefly explain some of the other molding methods. The Solider by Cubital of Israel employs a photocured resin, but uses a different layer-curing method. Without performing a laser-scanning operation, this equipment produces a sectional form mask using electrostatic force and exposes this mask to ultraviolet lamps. Wax is then filled into the gaps created after unhardened resin has been removed, and the surface is scraped flat. Then a new coat of resin is applied on top of this, and the next layer is exposed. The Sinterstation manufactured by DTM of the U.S. operates like a photomolding system, producing each layer by scanning it with a laser. A thermoplastic powdered resin is employed as the raw material, and new supplies are needed for each layer. The total amount of resin to be used is heated to near melting prior to processing, and then the sectional forms are fused and sintered by scanning them with a CO[.sub]2[/] laser. The Stratasys Co. of the U.S. uses thermoplastic resin in its 3D MODELER and FDM, too, but supplies this resin in the shape of a wire. The resin is fused by means of a nozzle that moves three-dimensionally, and pressure is used to discharge the model. The LOM produced by the Helisys Co. of the U.S. bonds together paper and resin sheets coated with thermoplastic adhesives by subjecting them to heat and pressure. The contour lines of the sectional forms are cut using a CO[.sub]2[/] laser. And finally, to facilitate the removal of margins, the LOM also produces grid-like cut lines. Kira Tekkojo (headquartered in Kira-machi, Aichi Prefecture) is the only Japanese manufacturer to develop an RP&M device other than a photomolding system. The Kira system also employs paper layers. Thermoplastic powdered resin is only used on the sectional forms of the model, being attached via electrostatic force and bonded using a hot press. A cutter is used to put notches in the model for the contour lines and margins.[.sup](c)[/] The company plans to commence marketing this system in March 1994. Generally speaking, molding time can be calculated from the time required to produce a single layer and the thickness of the layers. In the case of photomolding systems, the time needed to produce a single layer depends on laser scanning speed and spot diameter. It also takes time to move the plastic model up and down to get ready for the next layer. However, mechanically-speaking, no matter how much laser-scanning time is shortened, there will still be limits placed on this process by the sensitivity of the resin, laser output and layer thickness. And the precision of the model will depend on what portions of the layer are hardened in what order, and at what scanning speed and spot diameter. This aspect of the process is dependent on control software. RP&M equipment come in a variety of different systems, and even photomolding systems are characterized by stacking direction and laser method. Right now, photomolding systems are head and shoulders above the other RP&M systems when it comes to actual usage, but we could see these other systems come into more widespread use in future.
