Officials in the Interior Ministry's organized crime department told INTERFAX that one Russian and two Moldovan citizens had been apprehended as they tried to smuggle a radioactive substance into Moldova and sell it for $20,000. The officials said that gamma-cobalt-60 had been obtained and put into a container in Russia and that the weight of the cargo and its destination were being determined. This is the first time the Moldovan police have found material of this high quality and packed so thoroughly. A small radioactive leak was detected that could be hazardous. Experts from the Moldovan Academy of Sciences are trying to determine to what use the cobalt was to be put. The officials also said that a Romanian citizen is suspected of being the customer who had ordered the cargo but there was insufficient evidence for his arrest.
