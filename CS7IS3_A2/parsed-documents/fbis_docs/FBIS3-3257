All of the 30,000 tonnes of ammonium bicarbonate in stock has been sold out, and the average amount of ammonium bicarbonate bought by each peasant household in the county has reached about 1 tonne. However, the line of vehicles waiting to buy fertilizers at the gate of the plant is still growing. At the Qianchang Town Seed Center, there is also a long line of people waiting to buy seeds. The director of the center said happily: "At this time last year, not even one catty of grain seeds had been sold. This year, 90,000 kg of 135,000 kg of hybrid grain seeds scheduled for sale during the whole year have been sold." The whole county's situation is even better. The accumulated total of grain seeds bought by peasants has exceeded 500,000 kg, equivalent to over 80 percent of the amount used last year. Last winter, although the government adopted measures to stabilize and lower grain prices, grain prices still went up to a certain extent. This has caused a craze to grow grain, has injected vitality into the development of the rural economy, and also put forward a new task of readjusting the agriculture structure. Pei Lianggeng, a major grain grower in Jingshan, has already bought all the grain seeds he needs this year. County and town leaders concerned suggested that he should put aside some farmland to grow lotus and other cash crops. Pei Lianggeng said very reluctantly: "At present, grain prices are so good and you are asking me to grow this and to try my luck blindly. I have no experience in growing cash crops and even if I have, I am not willing to do this. Who does not know that one should grow something with a rising price? In Jingshan County, peasants with this way of thinking are not in the minority. Jingshan County is famous for growing grains and the per capita grain sold and its percentage of commodity grains have ranked first in the province for 10 consecutive years. Last year, the output value of grain, cotton, and edible oil was more than that of diversified management for the first time. Will this percentage be reversed this year? Duan Xianbin, deputy secretary of the Jingshan County CPC Committee and who is in charge of agriculture, said with a heavy heart: "The rise of grain prices has given a guide to the peasants. Viewed from the situation of the spring farming this year, some peasants have staked this year's bumper harvest on growing grains. Some peasants who are growing other crops or have engaged in the breeding trade also feel regretful and are ready to grow grains again." How should we look at this?
