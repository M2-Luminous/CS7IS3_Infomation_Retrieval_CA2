On Christmas Eve He Was Appointed the Russian President's First National Security Adviser"] [Excerpts] [Poleshchuk] People in this country have grown accustomed to frequent cadre reshuffles and structural changes in the upper echelons of power. Still, the introduction of the post of the Russian president's national security adviser has come as a great surprise. If only because, if I am not mistaken, there has not been the slightest leak of information about the upcoming event, although such leaks have become almost commonplace recently. Was it a surprise to you also? [Baturin] Yes, it was a total surprise to me. [Poleshchuk] You did not undertake any efforts along these lines? [Baturin] It had never even occurred to me to work in this direction. And, as you have stated quite correctly, there have been no leaks. I did not know anything about it. This obviously suggests that the decision has been made either by the president himself or that he has discussed this matter with an extremely narrow circle of people. [passage omitted] [Poleshchuk] Was it a coincidence that a decision to introduce the post of national security adviser was made on the eve of President Clinton's visit to Moscow? Is there not some hidden implication, some "second trunk bottom" here? [Baturin] I cannot respond to this question for reasons I have already explained. But I think that indirectly this could have produced an impact. In recent days Boris Nikolayevich has been making very thorough preparations for the meeting with President Clinton. And apparently he has been constantly mindful of such an efficient U.S. state structure. In other words, this factor could be seen as a general background. But again, this is merely supposition. It is not worth trying to guess at what the president thinks. It is better simply to ask him. [Poleshchuk] Have you been actively involved in preparing the meeting with the U.S. President? [Baturin] No, I would say that the president has an aide on international affairs, Dmitriy Ryurikov, who has been long and thoroughly preparing this meeting. At this point perhaps I could join in. But then too little time has passed since my appointment to get engaged in this work. [passage omitted] [Poleshchuk] How would you respond to this statement: The post of the national security adviser is extremely necessary for the country's leadership today amid the dramatic reforms in the power departments, in particular the Security Ministry? The president needs an absolutely trustworthy man who will oversee the power ministries.... [Baturin] This reasoning is quite rational. And such ideas have long been expressed to the president, for instance in the course of his meetings with Presidential Council members. As far as I could see, the president listened to all of that but showed no reaction -- either positive or negative. At least, in my presence. [passage omitted] [Poleshchuk] And with respect to your personal contacts with the "power ministers," are you familiar with them? Have you had any contacts? Have you been in conflict? [Baturin] I had not met Nikolay Mikhaylovich Golushko (head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- A. P.) until last August. I first saw him at close quarters during a session of the Security Council's interdepartmental commission where I was present as a presidential aide. Then there were a few casual meetings in the corridors without any conversations. The same goes for Stepashin (Golushko's first deputy -- A. P.). I first had a detailed talk with him at the end of December, when the president tasked me to take part in preparing a statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service. I have known Yevgeniy Maksimovich Primakov (director of the Foreign Intelligence Service -- A. P.) since the end of the 80's. After all, he also comes from the academic world but he belonged to another weight category and we had no close contacts. I had an exhaustive conversation with Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev (commander in chief of the Russian border troops -- A. P.) after my appointment. Incidentally, many were wondering whether he would be able to command the border guards. I would say that as chief of the border service he has produced a very favorable impression on me. Just like Golushko, I have met Viktor Fedorovich Yerin (internal affairs minister -- A. P.) only at various sessions. We were not closely familiar. [Poleshchuk] A new post apparently presupposes the existence of a national security concept.... [Baturin] The concept has been there and it continues to be developed. Now there is a law on security: It was elaborated on the basis of a certain security concept. The law was adopted but work on the concept has not stopped: It must change all the time to keep in tune with the changing conditions. And conditions today are changing very fast. [Poleshchuk] But will a readable text be finally produced? [Baturin] I think so. At any rate, this was done in the Security Council. Of course, now I shall be taking part in this. And apparently I will somehow influence the content of this concept. [Poleshchuk] Does the introduction of the post of national security adviser mean that he automatically becomes head of the Security Council? [Baturin] No. [Poleshchuk] Up to now the question about adopting a concept on the Federal Counterintelligence Service remains open, although according to some reports, the text of the document was ready by the day of President Yeltsin's 21 December 1993 edict abolishing the Russian Federation Security Ministry. When, in your opinion, should the concept's approval be expected? [Baturin] I am afraid that you are in a little hurry here. The adoption of the Statue on the Federal Counterintelligence Service is a kind of foundation. But still there is a lot that remains to be done there. It is also necessary to carry through the reforms. The options are as follows. Either this concept existed before and is now being implemented, but I do not think that this is the best hypothesis. Or the building of the Federal Counterintelligence Service began not according to a detailed plan but according to a general outline proposed by someone. In this case this work must be finalized as soon as possible. Because a gap in reforms at the center and at the local level can be very dangerous. And once the entire framework of the Federal Counterintelligence Service has become clear and obvious, then we can see how good and effective is the concept which existed either in full or as a general outline. And then improve on it. I think that this version more corresponds to the truth. [passage omitted] [Poleshchuk] You are known as one of the main architects of a large number of documents defining Russia's present development. How do you envision the country's immediate future? What would you say to those who say that Russia is consistently moving toward tough authoritarian rule? [Baturin] Indeed, this is so. The adopted constitution provides for a model of tough authority. But the strength and toughness of authority lies not only and not so much in the model that exists in the constitution, in the minds or in public consciousness. It is also in how far the plans and decisions of this authority can be implemented. And many decisions -- I mean not only those by the president but also the government and the former Supreme Soviet -- were not obeyed. And this fact strongly undermines the version about dictatorship and a tough authoritarian hand. But the historical movement, the trend.... Quite naturally, after the pendulum has swung toward democratization to such an extent when it began to verge on anarchy, it has swung to the other side. But the pendulum will not freeze at this point and will soon start moving back. There is much of what is dangerous and unpleasant but there is nothing fatally terrible. [passage omitted]
