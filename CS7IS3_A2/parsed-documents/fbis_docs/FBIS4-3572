Wilkie] [Text] As Gou Qinghui was returning home from work on April 12, she looked up at the window of her flat. When she saw there was no light on, she knew immediately that something was wrong. She had already tried unsuccessfully to telephone her husband at his office and knew he had not been to work. Gou's husband, who had still been asleep when she left for work at 6.30 am, had vanished. At 9.20 pm, four men -- police and state security agents -- arrived at the flat. They ordered Gou to sign and put her thumbprint to a piece of paper which informed her that her husband, 32-year-old Xiao Biguang, had been detained for "shelter and investigation". The document Gou was shown said Xiao had been involved in "illegal activities" related to State Council Document number 56, issued in 1980. The police searched the flat and confiscated several manuscripts written by Xiao and books in Chinese and English, mostly about Christianity. They listed the titles on an official form which Gou was also required to sign. One of the English titles, copied down awkwardly in an uncomprehending police hand, read Cherish No Illusions, Nor Despair. The flat Gou lives in is in a block owned by the party's Central Discipline Inspection Commission, where her father works. On her front door, Gou displays an Easter message which reads, in English, "Christ is Risen". Inside the one-room apartment, a cassette tape of choral music by Handel played as Gou, her curly hair tied back and wearing a simple blue sweater and checked skirt, told the story of her husband's disappearance. She is a strong and feisty woman who is not afraid to challenge the police. But by the end of her tale, she had broken into wrenching sobs, her voice rising in outrage that the man she described as a good Christian had been taken away from her. China's dissidents and their families are, in the main, a stoic lot. They have to be. Many dissidents have spent much of their lives in prison. Their relatives may have no contact or information about their loved ones for years at a time, though the policy on visits has become somewhat more relaxed. In recent months, some high-profile dissidents have been in and out of police detention like yo-yos. Others are on the run, facing what may be years of exile from families and friends. But it is rare that the emotion shows through. Most dissidents claim they are not afraid of anything the authorities can do to them. Wei Jingsheng, before his re-arrest, would describe how the prison guards force-fed him, twisting a tube down into his stomach. He said he was prepared to live through it again. Just once in a while, however, the fear shows through. A young student who had escaped from jail and was on the run admitted in despair "I don't want to go to prison again" just days before being re-arrested. Gou and her husband met at the Yanjing seminary, where she teaches. They married in 1991, though they had little in the way of prospects or worldly goods. Her tears were a reminder, if any was needed, of the real pain and frustration suffered by those involved in dissent in China and those who love them. The men who visited Gou the night of her husband's arrest refused to give her any more information about her husband's alleged crime. She was told to inquire at the police and state security bureau on Zhengyi Road, about an hour's bus ride away. Her conversation at the Zhengyi Road office the next day went like this: "Can I see regulation number 56?" "We don't have it." "Please tell me what law he's broken." "We have no comment." "Please tell me where he is being held." "We have no comment." "That," Gou said, "was when I decided to walk out, and to make public what had happened to my husband." Xiao is believed to have been detained because of his friendship with Yuan Hongbing, a labour activist and legal expert who was detained on March 3 in Guizhou. Xiao has, however, been known to the police ever since 1985 for his involvement in the underground Protestant church. He frequently attended Gangwashi church in Beijing, where the aged pastor, Yang Yudong, has incurred the wrath of the authorities for his failure to co-operate with the state- controlled "Three Self Patriotic Church". Xiao had been an associate professor in comparative literature at Beijing University, but he had had to surrender his university ID card after 1989. Recently he has been working in a trading company. He had always wanted to study at a seminary, but was refused official permission to do so. Gou does not despair. "I believe God will keep my husband safe," she said through her tears. But like millions of her fellow countrymen and women, she does not cherish any illusions.
