FR941107-2-00025 FR941107-2-00007 Foreign Market Value A. Market Reforms in the Russian Federation In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, the Department normally uses a factor valuation methodology to calculate foreign market value when the country involved is an NME country and the Department determines that it cannot determine foreign market value based on the respondent's prices or costs. An NME-country respondent may argue that market-driven prices characterize its particular industry and, therefore, despite NME status, that foreign market value should be calculated by using actual home market prices or costs. In these investigations, the Russian manufacturers, Avisma and SMW, make such a market-oriented-industry (``MOI'') claim. Alternatively, the two companies claim that economic conditions now prevalent throughout Russia warrant revocation of Russia's NME-country status, effective January 1, 1994. The Department's analysis with respect to such claims centers around a government's role in economic activity. Consistent with the factors described in section 771(18), the Department considers the extent to which resources are allocated by the market or government, taking into account government involvement in currency and labor markets, pricing, and production and investment decisions. Where resources are not allocated by the market, it would be difficult to conclude that home market prices or costs should be used to calculate fair value. Evidence provided in these proceedings indicates that Russia is in the process of implementing extensive reforms to achieve its goal of becoming a market economy. The freeing of most prices in December 1991 and the privatization of most enterprises formerly within the state-planning system are important steps in moving Russia towards a market economy. We cannot conclude, however, based on the information in this record that Russia should be treated as a market economy for purposes of the antidumping duty law. The Russian economy, having emerged from a centrally-planned system, is in a state of transition. Many of the state controls have been abandoned, but that does not mean that functioning markets have replaced controls. Because the evidence does not demonstrate that prices and costs in Russia adequately reflect market considerations, we cannot at this time alter Russia's designation as a nonmarket economy. Information on the record also suggests that the government continues to be involved in the Russian magnesium sector. For example, the Russian Federal Committee on Metallurgy, a successor to the Ministry of Industry (Metallurgy Department), indicated in an official statement that it controls activity in the magnesium industry in Russia, noting particularly that it coordinates production, exports, and prices. Also, although the two producers under investigation have been privatized, this same statement indicates that the Committee may be using the remaining government interest in these companies to carry out its intentions with respect to pricing and production. For these reasons, we have determined that the prices or costs of producing magnesium in Russia should not be used to calculate fair value. B. Surrogate Country Selection In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. Thus, we have considered as possible surrogates those countries that are economically comparable to Russia and that produce identical or comparable merchandise. Of those countries that we have determined to be economically comparable, Brazil is the only country that is a significant producer of the identical merchandise, magnesium. (See October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the file.) Accordingly, we have based FMV on the values of the appropriate factors of production as valued in Brazil. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible. C. Factors of Production We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise for the above-mentioned exporters. The factors used to produce pure and alloy magnesium include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values, see our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for general expenses and profit, the cost of containers and coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for shipment to the United States. To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information for Brazil from the United Nations Trade Commodity Statistics ( UN Trade Statistics ) for January&hyph;December 1992. We did not attempt to adjust raw material factor values to account for inflation between 1992 and the POI because the figures were reported in dollars, and we had no indication as to how exchange rates, currency reforms, and hyperinflation could properly be taken into account. For those raw materials for which we were unable to obtain publicly available information from Brazil, we used data provided in the petition. To value heavy oil, we used 1993 data for Brazil from the Energy Information Administration's International Energy Annual. Although this value for heavy oil is tax-inclusive, it is the only data found for heavy oil in Brazil. Natural gas was valued using information from the petition on prices in Brazil because we could find no other source for prices of this product. To value electricity for industrial use, labor, and freight rates for both truck and rail, we used information reported by the U.S. Consulate in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
