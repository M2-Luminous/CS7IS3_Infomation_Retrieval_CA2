European companies must go and get involved in the region, according to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC foreign trade commissioner. Last year the EC had more trade with the countries in East Asia (previously the Far East) than with North America. By the turn of the century China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan will be economically more powerful than the United States alone or Germany and Japan together. They will also export more than Japan and Germany do at present. "Estimates such as these will mean that every analysis of a threefold division of world trade between the EU, the United States and Japan will quickly disappear into second-hand bookshops," Sir Leon said on Thursday [17 February] evening in London, in what he himself had announced in advance as a "major policy speech." Brittan also warned that the same dynamic could destabilize East Asia with "potentially catastrophic and far-reaching consequences." North Korea is still subject to a regime which plays "nuclear poker" and China is facing rapidly increasing economic diversity and "decreasing centralized power," according to Brittan, who is to visit the People's Republic next week. According to the British EC commissioner, Europe has much to offer East Asia. But he warned that Asia's supposed dependence on Europe for capital and know-how, or in order to counterbalance Japan and the United States, would soon "be entirely a question of historical interest." East Asia has its own capital and developed technological resources. One European advantage is that it has no political ambitions in the region, Brittan said. In Asia, Europe has a lead in sectors like transport infrastructure, telecommunications, aviation, oil, gas and environmental technology and service sectors such as banking and insurance. Brittan said "the multilateral framework" for doing business with the region was important. He hoped that China, with its unprecedented economic perspectives, could joint GATT this year. "If the whole of East Asia is represented in the multilateral trade system, then economic relations would be easier because we would all speak the same language and apply the same rules," Brittan said. But he does not want to subordinate that goal to the content of the entry negotiations. The EU is setting the following conditions for Peking's membership of GATT: further opening of Chinese markets, an import tariff ceiling of between 15 and 25 percent, further liberalization of exchange rates, and the right to carry out foreign trade and invest. Brittan also warned the East Asian community in advance that the West was determined to "discuss" trade in relation to environmental demands, fair competition and social conditions. These should be "an integral part of the Community's policies for the region," Brittan said. He wants to give industry prime responsibility for the relations between the EC and East Asia. The Commission will negotiate in the GATT framework but beyond that its role will be limited to "helping companies help themselves." That means export support and the provision of information on a European scale. The BBC has been asked to make recommendations on cleaning up Europe's "poor image" in Asia.
