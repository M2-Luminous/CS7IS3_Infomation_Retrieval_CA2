FR940607-2-00005 FR940607-2-00004 Foreign-Trade Zones Board Docket A(32b1)&hyph;2&hyph;94 Foreign-Trade Zone 50_Long Beach, CA, Request for Export Manufacturing Authority, J.M. William & Company, Inc., (Poly/Cotton Bed Linens) An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Port of Long Beach, California, grantee of FTZ 50, requesting authority on behalf of the J.M. William & Company, Inc., to manufacture textile bed linens under zone procedures for export within FTZ 50. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 20, 1994. The company plans to manufacture bed sheet sets, comforters and pillows. The primary input is woven polyester/cotton fabric (HTSUS 5513(14).41, duty rate: 17%), which is sourced from abroad (primarily from China). Additional foreign materials that may be used in the future include woven fabric of artificial/synthetic fibers, sewing thread, and nonwoven fill. The application indicates that zone procedures would be used only for export manufacturing activity. The company would export all products made with foreign fabric and other foreign textile mill products admitted to the zone. Zone procedures would exempt it from U.S. quota requirements and Customs duty payments on the foreign items. In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is [30 days from date of publication]. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 10-day period (to [40 days from date of publication]). A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at the following location: Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230.
