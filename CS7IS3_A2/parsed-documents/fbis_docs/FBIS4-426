"Our forces are now within eyeshot of the place where our 600-strong unit is," said Christine Umutoni, spokeswoman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) office in Uganda. She told AFP that RPF forces were not in a hurry to take Kigali and would move slowly to avoid massive destruction of the city. Many government troops were deserting and joining rebel forces, she claimed. Umutoni said RPF was "suspicious" of the French soldiers who had gone to Kigali to help evacuate foreigners. "They are showing signs of wanting to stay around and help this murderous regime," Umutoni said. Some 500 French soldiers flew into Kigali over the weekend to ensure the safe evacuation of the 600-odd French citizens in Rwanda. Umutoni complained the French troops were not leaving although the rescue mission had been completed. Reports from Kigali said the interim government left the Kigali hotel where it had taken up residence for an unknown destination as shooting intensified in several areas around the city.
