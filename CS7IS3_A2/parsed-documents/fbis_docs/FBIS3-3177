The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" is a key part of the "Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization" project sponsored by the Chinese Communist Youth League. The project has enriched and developed the drive to learn from Lei Feng in a new format to match the new era and is a new way to foster the "four have's" new generation and promote ideological and educational youth work. The project counts on the participation of young volunteers, orients toward society, and provides sustained and detailed voluntary services such as public labor, environmental protection, rescue and relief operation, community service, law and order, and the defense of youth rights. Since reform and opening up, there has been a boom in modern developments and projects. A large number of ambitious, hardworking, enterprising, pragmatic, dedicated, advanced, and Lei Feng-style people have emerged in various trades and professions. However, money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism have also grown in some localities, and indifference to suffering and refusals to help in emergencies are often reported. The party and government have stressed repeatedly that in developing a socialist market economic system, it is necessary to vigorously educate people in arduous struggle, thrift, nation-building, and vocational and social ethics with the aim of voluntarily resisting and overcoming various negative and corrupt phenomena and creating a better opinion and social climate for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" was initiated against such a background. It can actively promote good social morality; encourage solidarity, friendliness, helpfulness, courageous acts, and selfless dedication; boost patriotism and collectivism; strengthen socialist spiritual civilization; and raise ideological, moral, and scientific quality of youth. The activities are characterized by attention to self-education and stress on voluntary participation, which turns "being made to participate" into "me participating," allowing the majority of youths to join activities and services to help others and society, while having their souls purified and forming a correct outlook on life. They will have a chance to continually improve themselves morally, cultivate themselves, raise their quality, and finally turn into talented, disciplined, cultured, and morally sound youths with ideals and who work for the socialist cause. Therefore, from the very beginning, these activities spread very quickly across the large cities, illustrating their vitality. The Chinese Young Volunteers' Action has had a good beginning. Tens of thousands of young people across the countries have participated actively in this great project with enthusiasm and love. In launching this activity, localities should take note of their local conditions and ensure voluntary participation, that they go only as far as their abilities permit, work for results, and sustain their efforts. Only a pragmatic approach can deepen and sustain these activities, which will foster a generation of new people in the "Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization." The times call for more volunteers! Friends, join the ranks of the volunteers. Let more people contribute voluntary services toward a fundamental change for the better in the social climate and the progress and civilization of human society.
