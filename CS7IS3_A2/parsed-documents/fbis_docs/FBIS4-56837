What is your opinion on this and what future do you see for the Arnulfist Party? [Endara] Ernesto Perez Balladares' victory is unquestionable. Dona Mireya has recognized this because she is an honest politician who believes in and defends the truth. She does not believe in maintaining an air of uncertainty. Furthermore, this democracy we saw in full bloom yesterday, and of which all Panamanians are proud, needs candidates such as her, who can tell the truth for the good of the nation. I congratulate her for this. I also recognize Perez Balladares' victory. To prove this, I have invited Mr. Perez to come and talk with me. In the first place I will congratulate him and then I wish to offer him a transition mechanism to ensure that the transfer of power can be accomplished most efficiently. When he assumes power on 1 September he will be aware of everything and anything about public administration he so desires. [Villamonte] How do you view the fact that the government parties were unable to unite to face the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD]? [Endara] I believe it was because of the stubbornness of one man, who believed himself to be superior to all other Panamanians. I am especially fond of this man, but I believe he was responsible for the Civilists not retaining power. [Villamonte] The Arnulfist Party has said it will become an opposition party and Mr. Ruben Carles has said he will lead that opposition party. [Endara] We Arnulfists, and I speak as one because I can now that the election is over, cannot accept any leadership other than an Arnulfist leadership. I can tell you that, although Mireya is the one who should, because she is the leader of the party and the president. I, as an Arnulfist, submit myself to her authority. [Villamonte] Mr. Perez Balladares.... [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] [Question indistinct] [Endara] I wanted to address that issue, and I would like to do that now. I think that there was a lot of emphasis placed on the fact that the elections were very good, and they were. This is reason enough to be proud. We are proud of the elections, but there is something that happened in the election campaign and on the same day of the elections that is worthy of being criticized, that is worthy of being criticized. [repeats himself] In this regard I believe the election polls turned out to be what we were claiming. They were totally manipulated and were fraudulent. They were manipulated to make people believe that the one who actually came in fourth place was in second place. The one who was in first place actually came in first place and in that regard the polls were not manipulated, but the polls made people believe that his lead was very large. Those polls were manipulated against Mireya Moscoso de Gruber to favor the person who actually came in fourth place. It was obvious, obvious that the polls were manipulated and fraudulent. After meditating on it for a while, I do not think we could prohibit polls because we would restrict freedom of expression and that is inadvisable under any concept. Freedom of expression cannot be repressed. I believe, however, that the Panamanian people must learn the lesson of 1994 and when the 1999 elections come they should pay no attention to the polls whatsoever because those polls are conducted by persons without any scruples to fool the people. [Villamonte] [Question indistinct] [Endara] I am going to propose the topic of the transition. That is the fundamental topic I am going to propose. I believe Dr. Perez Balladares may want to talk about some topics that may interest him. I will gladly answer his questions. It is a meeting without an agenda, we can say. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you believe that with a PRD government back in power, freedoms will be restricted? [Endara] I must confess that for a long time I feared this would occur. Today I am cautiously optimistic, optimistic with reservations, that Dr. Perez Balladares has good intentions. I hope he will fulfill his promise to maintain this democracy and the country's freedoms. I hope we do not return to the military times. I sincerely believe, it but I must admit that the optimism is under inventory benefit, as lawyers say. I and other Panamanians are going to be vigilant and I hope the media will also be vigilant, taking care of our freedoms and our democracy, which we cannot lose. While Perez Balladares remains on the path of democracy, respect for freedom, respect for civilist or nonmilitary ideas, we are not going to be an obstacle. On the contrary, we will do everything within our power to contribute, but if he strays from that path you can rest assured there will be a group of Panamanians to oppose him and the Arnulfist Party will be in that group. We will firmly oppose any deviation from the proper path.
