Sidenko, deputy minster of railways and member of the Russian Federation governmental commission on the conduct of the 1994 spring sowing and crop harvest, by V. Chibisov, GUDOK correspondent: "Transport to the Village"] [Text] [Chibisov] The present belated spring has brought additional troubles to the farmers. Already in the sowing campaign a volume of work a third greater than last year has to be accomplished, since about four million hectares of arable land were not sown in the autumn due to a shortage of fuel and equipment. Moreover, many areas occupied by winter crops have suffered from intensely cold weather and required re-seeding. And then there are still high waters in many regions. The providing of the farms with seeds, equipment, and fertilizers also caused concern for a time. What is the situation now, Anatoliy Yakovlevich? [Sidenko] The village always was one of the priority directions of their work for railroad workers. Now by tradition the Ministry of Railways at the beginning of the year carefully analyzes the results of the transfers of agricultural products during the past year and, in accordance with the tasks which the government sets for the agro-industrial complex, determines the specific measures regarding the organization of the delivery of agricultural freight. And today the railroad workers are coping with the tasks set for them. Some 260,000 tonnes of seed grain, as was provided for by the plan, has been delivered to the regions of the sowing campaign. Not a single failure has been permitted. Our employees on the railroads and divisions and at the stations are approaching with full responsibility the fact that the timely performance of spring field work is to be secured by their participation. The last freight cars with imported seed corn destined for the Volga and North Caucasus regions left Kaliningrad a few days ago. Shipments of seed potatoes are proceeding actively. Almost 100,000 tonnes need to be delivered from Moscow, Ryazan, Orel, Ivanovo, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts to the northern regions--Vologda Oblast, Komi, and Karelia. Also to the Orenburg area and even to Chita. A special dispatcher group has been created in the Ministry of Railways which monitors applications for the shipment of this product and their fulfillment and tracks the movement of freight cars, etc. [Chibisov] And what about fertilizers, equipment, fuel? [Sidenko] A very important question for today. The villagers have only 21 percent of their fertilizer needs. They are being shipped in an uneven fashion although there is finished product at the plants. However, its shipment is being held back because of the recipient's inability to pay. The government of the Russian Federation has allotted credits for the purchase of fertilizers. State support (in the form of subsidies) of consumers is provided for. The fact is that now the cost of a single tonne of fertilizers exceeds the cost of a tonne of grain. One must give the railroad workers their due in this situation. Despite all the complexities and the large debts of the shippers, fertilizers are being delivered to the village. Its delivery is also connected with the same inability of the villagers to pay the producers of agricultural equipment. Shipment volumes come to only 30 percent of last year. The picture is somewhat different with petroleum products. A rather alarming situation with supplying villagers with fuels and lubricants had developed by the beginning of spring. A decision has been adopted to transport them without waiting for the credits which the government will allot for the agro-industrial complex. And now there are quite enough petroleum products at the oblast bases of all regions to carry out the sowing. And what is more villagers have obtained loans for settling up with the producers. Stocks of diesel fuel at the petroleum bases now exceed last year's level by 1.5 times. All this permits the conducting of spring field work in as short a time as possible. Practice confirms this: today more than 12 million hectares of spring crops have already been sown--higher than the level of last year. [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich, tell us briefly about the work of the governmental commission. [Sidenko] Its task is to monitor everything that is being sent to the agro-industrial complex for the conducting of the spring field work and the harvest. To comprehensively resolve the questions of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. So to avoid difficulties which arise, in particular, in the financial interrelations which confront agriculture. I think that this task is being fulfilled. In any case the sowing is proceeding normally. And one needs to make preparations for the harvest now. The shipment of early vegetables is beginning for the railroad workers. Taking into account that the Council for railroad transport of the CIS has instructed the Ministry of Railways to manage the fleet of refrigerator rolling stock, we have redeployed the necessary number of cars to the early cabbage growing regions. Now refrigerator sections are to be found in Moldova, Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Moreover, instructions have been given to the railroads regarding the preparation of 3,000 more such cars in order to include them in the work as products are presented. There is every reason to think that the railroad workers will cope with the shipments of the volumes of early vegetables envisaged by the treaties and contracts that have been concluded. [Chibisov] We have talked about the customers' inability to pay. But how are the producers of products for the village settling up with the railroad people for shipments? [Sidenko] This problem is the same for all shippers of freight. As a whole the debts to the railroads for shipments carried out come to about 2.3 trillion rubles. The suppliers of products for the agro-industrial complex have a large debt. Thus, if one takes petroleum products, it is almost R300 billion. With respect to mineral fertilizers... the Apatity Production Association alone has owed R11 billion and Kuybyshevazot and Tolyattiazot R5 billion and R2.5 billion respectively. The fertilizer producers of the regions of the Sverdlovsk and other railroads have a sizable debt. However, I repeat: we have a good understanding of the problem. And if we don't deliver the rolling stock for loading, we thereby exacerbate the situation in the country. That is why we are looking for the most varied forms of reciprocal settlements so as not to stop the shipment process short and to deliver all that is needed to the villagers. [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich! A purely sectorial question. A new railway traffic schedule is to be introduced on 29 May. What is its fundamental difference from the one now in operation? [Sidenko] There are special features and significant ones at that. If previously we tried to create a freight traffic schedule intended for maximum carrying capacities and the greatest throughput of car flows, now it has been formulated on the basis of realistic shipment volumes. This has been done so as to not hold on to a surplus fleet of locomotives and cars and surplus locomotive brigades. And through this to reduce operating costs. As for the passenger traffic schedule, its rates have been somewhat increased. Taking the wishes of the passengers into account, we have revised a number of the timetables for the running of trains. The new schedule makes it possible to carry out the capital repair of a track while not disturbing the rhythm of the running of passenger trains.
