Supplementary Information: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. Each of the Trusts is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Some of the Trusts consist of multiple series each of which has separate investment objectives and policies and segregated assets. Each Trust, and each Trust on behalf of its series, if any, has either: (i) Entered into an investment advisory agreement with Citibank, or (ii) invested all of the investable assets of the Trust or series in another open-end management investment company that has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Citibank (such management investment company referred to herein as a ``Hub SM Portfolio''). Each of the Trusts has adopted an Administrative Services Plan that provides that the Trust may obtain the services of an administrator, a transfer agent, a custodian, a fund accounting agent (in the case of those Trusts for which the custodian does not act as fund accounting agent) and one or more shareholder servicing agents. Pursuant to the Administrative Services Plan, each Trust has entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with LFBDS, pursuant to which LFBDS provides non-investment management, administrative services. Citibank performs sub-administrative duties for each Trust pursuant to a Sub-Administrative Services Agreement with LFBDS. LFBDS, a registered broker-dealer, is the principal underwriter of the Trusts, and shares of each Trust are currently offered through LFBDS to customers of entities (``shareholder servicing agents'') that have entered into shareholder servicing agreements (``Shareholder Servicing Agreements'') with such Trust pursuant to the Trust's Administrative Services Plan. 1 Under the Shareholder Servicing Agreements, financial institutions including Citibank Companies and securities brokers provide various account and customer services in connection with the shares. For such services, each shareholder servicing agent receives a service fee 2 and a shareholder servicing fee 3 from the Trust. 1 Each Administrative Services Plan under which a Trust has entered into a Shareholder Servicing Agreement has been adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, including the voting rights of shareholders specified therein. Applicants may, however, in the future, seek an amendment to a Fund's Administrative Services Plan to modify or eliminate the voting rights granted therein. 2 Some of the fees paid pursuant to the Shareholder Servicing Agreements may be deemed to be ``service fees'' as that term is defined in Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the ``NASD rule''). For the purposes of the application, the term ``service fees'' refers to such fees paid by the Funds to their shareholder servicing agents for certain services rendered under the Shareholder Servicing Agreements, and has the meaning given that term in the NASD rule. The terms ``distribution fee'' and ``rule 12b&hyph;1 fee'' mean an ``asset-based sales charge'' as defined in the NASD rule. 3 As used in the application, ``shareholder servicing fees'' means fees paid by the Funds to their shareholder servicing agents for providing subaccounting services for Funds shares held beneficially, providing beneficial owners with statements showing their positions in the Funds, forwarding shareholder communications, receiving, tabulating, and transmitting proxies and other similar services. ``Shareholder servicing fees'' does not refer to service fees as defined in the NASD Rule.
