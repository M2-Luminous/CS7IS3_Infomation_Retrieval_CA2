Ota, who is on a six-day visit to the Philippines, told reporters during a visit to Subic that he "envies" its conversion, which followed the U.S. withdrawal of forces from the port in 1992. Subic Bay was once the largest U.S. overseas naval base. Ota said he could foresee a bustling commercial and industrial free port in Subic 10 years from now, adding, "I really envy the successful conversion of the Subic naval base into a commercial district." Subic is about 70 kilometers north of Manila. The Okinawan archipelago in southern Japan, still plays host to a strong U.S. military presence.
