EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michelle Frederick or John Brinkmann, Office of Antidumping Duty Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0186 or (202) 482&hyph;5288, respectively. Scope of Order The merchandise covered by this order is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive. Antidumping Duty Order On December 14, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department that imports of silicomanganese from Brazil materially injure a U.S. industry.

These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of silicomanganese from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after June 17, 1994, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 14852). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , U.S. Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following cash deposits for the subject merchandise: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Weighted-average margin percentage Companhia Paulista de Ferro-Ligas and Sibra Eletro Siderurgica Brasileira S/A 64.93 All Others 17.60 This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to silicomanganese from Brazil, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act.
