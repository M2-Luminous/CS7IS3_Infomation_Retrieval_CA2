The so-called city banks are expected to begin brokering businesses such as underwriting corporate bonds this summer, the officials said. The move will accelerate reforms of the financial system, calling for the breaking down of a "fire wall" separating banking and brokerage businesses, a ministry official said. Under the reforms, subsidiaries for brokering businesses were launched last year by the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Norinchukin Bank and two trust banks. The other eight city banks to be given permits are Sakura, Fuji, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Tokai, Sanwa, Asahi and Hokkaido Takushoku Banks.
