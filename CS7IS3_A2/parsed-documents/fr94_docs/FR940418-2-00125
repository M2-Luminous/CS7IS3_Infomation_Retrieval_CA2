FR940418-2-00125 FR940418-2-00073 A. Description of the Hong Kong Option Index The Hong Kong Option Index is identical to the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index, 6 except that the Hong Kong Option Index has a different index level, which was recently set at 0.40 times that of the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index. 7 The Hong Kong Option Index is a capitalization-weighted stock index designed and maintained by the Amex, and based on the capitalizations of 30 stocks that are traded on the HKSE and whose issuers have major business interests located in Hong Kong. 8 The HKSE is the primary trading market for 25 of the 30 Index component stocks, while the primary trading market for all of the Index component stocks is either Hong Kong or London. 9 6 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. The Amex originally established the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index in order to list and trade warrants based on an index designed to represent a substantial segment of the Hong Kong stock market. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33036, supra note 5. 7 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. 8 The Amex has represented that it will not include in the Index any component stock whose issuer is an entity formed and governed under the laws of the People's Republic of China. See letter from Nathan Most, Senior Vice President, New Products Development, Amex to Richard Zack, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated September 7, 1993. 9 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. Since the Exchange created the Hong Kong 30 Index on June 25, 1993, its level has risen from an initial 350 to a current range of 570&hyph;600. In late December 1993 and early January 1994, the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index approached the 640 level, before falling to its present level after a recent downturn in the Hong Kong market. 10 The Amex has stated its concern that introducing options at an index level and volatility as high as that of the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index would create very high premiums on near-term series, and that this concern justifies a lower index level for options. Because the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index serves as the basis for warrant issues, the Amex will continue to calculate and disseminate the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index at its current level, retaining the ticker symbol ``HKX'', since it serves as the basis for the Index warrant issues. 11 The Hong Kong Option Index, which will serve as the basis for standardized options trading, will use the ticker symbol ``HKO'' (or similar symbol) for both standardized options trading and the underlying Index level. 12 The Amex has set the Index level at 0.40 times that of the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index. 13 10 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 3. 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33036, supra note 5; Amendment No. 1, supra note 3. 12 Amendment No. 1, supra note 3. 13 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. As of February 28, 1994, the total capitalization of the Index was US$222.214 billion. 14 Market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from high of US$25.101 billion to a low of US$519 million, with the median being US$5.140 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Index ranged from a high of approximately 11.152 billion shares to a low of 561.392 million shares. The price per share of the stocks in the Index, as of February 28, 1994, ranged from a high of US$14.76 to a low of US$0.76. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the six-month period ending February 28, 1994, ranged from a high of 16.826 million shares to a low of 1.449 million shares, with the median being 3.579 million shares. The highest weighted component stock in the Index accounts for 11.30% of the Index. The five largest Index components account for approximately 43.18% of the Index's value. The lowest weighted component stock comprises 0.23% of the Index. 15 14 Based on the February 28, 1994 exchange rate of HK$7.726 to US$1.00. 15 Amendment No. 2, supra note 3.
