According to its basic plan for rice control, the agency will take various steps, including financial incentives, to encourage rice growers to sell rice through the government-controled channels instead of selling in the grey market outside the government channels, agency officials said. The plan was explained to an informal meeting of the Rice Price Council. For the 1995 rice year that starts on November 1, the production of rice for table use will be increased 38 percent from the previous year to 10.58 million tons, partly by easing the policy of cutting back rice cultivation. The government will try to increase the amount of rice distributed under its control by 89 percent to 7.38 million tons to secure stable supply. The government will also import 379,000 tons of rice in 1995 to comply with the "minimum access" agreement on the partial opening of Japan's rice market reached in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks concluded last December under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. For the 1994 rice year that runs through October 1994, the 1993 production of table rice was 7.66 million tons, of which 3.9 million tons have been or will be distributed through the government-approved channels, the agency said. Japan will import a maximum of 2.48 million tons of rice this year to avoid a possible supply shortfall, according to the agency. Rice to be imported by the government for table use this year is estimated at 1.75-2.15 million tons. In addition, the officials said, 330,000 tons of rice will be imported for processing.
