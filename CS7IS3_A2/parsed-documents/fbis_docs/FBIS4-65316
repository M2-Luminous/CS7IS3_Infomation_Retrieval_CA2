Moreover, he has implied that in the end it will be very difficult to avoid the term "Macedonia" in the name of Skopje. Speaking to Sky's [private radio and TV station] program "Knock Out" the other day, Mr. Pangalos defended his phrase "lost case" on the Skopje issue. He explained: "I say that our attempt to win on the name issue is a lost case, but since we cannot accept a compromise at this time the issue should stay as it is." Theodhoros Pangalos even insisted on his phrase that Skopje "has claims" on the term Macedonia, explaining that: --It was called this from 1950 until 1990, when it was a Federal Republic. "We were recognizing it and Yugoslavia, which included it, and was a most friendly country." --They live in a part, the smallest part, of historic Macedonia. --The previous [Greek] government recognized a name that included the term "Macedonia." "Unfortunately, what Mr. Konstandinos Mitsotakis has done continues to be Greek policy and whatever the current government does is Greek policy... [ellipses as published] So, we have recognized at the United Nations that they are called The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which, if I am not mistaken, includes the word Macedonia, unless I no longer understand anything. We should keep all this in mind if we are to live in the world of logic..." [ellipsis as published] According to diplomatic sources, the meeting between Foreign Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis and Cyrus Vance [UN mediator in Greek-FYROM dispute] will be held tomorrow, or most probably on Monday [16 May]. The same sources noted that the negotiating process is now idle and that there is not any specific convergence of views. At any rate, the Greek side goes to this round of negotiations with two principles: --The Greek countermeasures remain as they are. --All issues are open for discussion.
