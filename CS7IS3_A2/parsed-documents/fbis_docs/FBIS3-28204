The conference took into account the great achievements that we have scored two and a half years following the seventh party congress and the fine results that we have obtained in the framework of the renovation policy adopted by the sixth party congress. The delegates maintained that we have overcome the socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The national economy has not only surpassed many difficulties but has also reached a considerably high growth rate in many domains and begun to develop dynamically. Continued efforts have been made to firmly maintain and consolidate political stability, strengthen the party's leadership role, enhance the work efficiency of state managment agencies, broaden the democratization process, and guarantee national defense and security capabilities. The people's confidence in the party, state, and the renovation undertaking has been consolidated a step further. The mass movement to participate in socioeconomic development has made many changes for the better. Diplomatic relations have been expanded. Our country's position and prestige in the world have been enhanced. The international situation has been improved and developed to the advantage of our people's national construction and defense cause. The above-mentioned outstanding achievements have created necessary conditions for our country to gradually shift to a new development stage and accelerate the national industrialization and modernization program. Realities over the past years testify to the correctness of the party's major renovation policies and to the appropriateness of its steps. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses have been applied to life. While taking into account past achievements, our party has also realized weaknesses, shortcomings, and new problems and hence has worked out practical policies and solutions to successfully implement the Seventh Party Congress Resolution. Lying ahead of our people are great challenges and great opportunities. Our country is facing great challenges, namely the danger of lagging further behind economically compared with many countries in the region and other parts of the world, the danger of deviating from the socialist path in case we fail to overcome irregularities in direction for implementation, the danger posed by corruption and smuggling, and the danger created by the hostile forces' peaceful evolution strategy and subversion and military invasion schemes. Nonetheless, our country is enjoying favorable conditions. Our party has a correct line and displays unity and singlemindedness. Our people are hard-working and intelligent, maintain a steadfast revolutionary stance, and have confidence in the party's leadership. The achievements of the renovation undertaking are creating a new source of strength for our country to move forward. The development of the scientific-technological revolution and our efforts to integrate our economic activities in the world economy, broaden our cooperative ties with the world community, and contribute to peace in the region have created more important sources of strength for our nation. Generally speaking, over the past two and a half years, we have realized to an important extent the general objectives -- especially economic goals -- set by the seventh party congress. In the remaining years of the seventh party Central Committee's term, it is necessary to motivate our entire party, people, and army to make concerted and outstanding efforts to exploit favorable opportunities to the full extent, overcome dangers, and surpass challenges to successfully make our goals come true. The new economic progress and achievements on the diplomatic front require us to pay attention not only to problem-solving methods but also to strategically important policies and solutions to secure not only more stability but also higher and steadier economic growth rate. Therefore, the time has come for us to devote efforts to accelerating the national industrialization and modernization program a step further, regarding this move as a strategic task of primary importance on the economic front. It is necessary to adopt uniform measures to implement the multisectorial economic development policy. One the one hand, steps must be taken to create more favorable conditions for various economic sectors and business establishments to develop quickly and effectively. On the other hand, continued efforts are needed to strengthen and develop the state business sector so it can operate effectively, assume a key role in the national economy, and serve as a mainstay in directing and assisting other economic sectors so they can develop according to socialist orientations. Continued efforts must be made to renovate the economic structure, bearing in mind the need to link economic growth with social progress and social justice. Corruption constitutes one of the dangers that cause the masses to lose their confidence in the party and state and that restrain the national renovation process. The anticorruption struggle constitutes the most burning and most urgent task at present. Resolute and full measures must be taken to deal with corruption in the entire mechanism as well as from the central down to local and grass-roots levels. While discussing measures to accelerate economic renovation, the conference asserted the necessity to renovate the political system, revamp the party, build a law-governed state under the party leadership, strengthen relations between the party and people, enhance the all-people unity bloc, and strive to improve national defense, security, and diplomatic activities. While integrating efforts to build socialism -- our forefront task -- we must strive to carry out national defense tasks; protect our national independence, sovereignty, national integrity, security, socialism, and the peaceful life of our people. Efforts must be made to firmly grasp and satisfactorily carry out the common task in national defense and security, firmly grasp the guiding concepts set by the party Central Committee's Third Plenum. Against the background of the complicated situation in the world and the region, our relations with foreign countries have increasingly broadened. It is necessary to say that hostile forces at home and abroad are attempting to carry out their schemes of peaceful evolution, rebellion, and overthrow using dangerous and decisive tactics in various forms with the goal of eliminating socialism and violating our national independence and sovereignty. We must strive to build the all-people national defense and security while upholding the revolutionary vigilance of our entire party, the armed forces, and people. Efforts must be made to strengthen and consolidate the political base and the movement to defend national security, build the people's combat plan in close association with the all-people national defense task, build firm and strong defense zones and people's security frontiers, and strengthen defense plan at various key areas, thereby firmly defending our national severeignty and territorial integrity in the sea, the airspace, and at the border areas. We must strive to firmly maintain our internal security, detect and curb sabotage activities at home and abroad, strengthen state management over social security, and oppose crimes and social vices. Efforts must be made to renovate the party leadership, enhance the state management over national defense and security, improve the quality of agencies and cadres responsible for national defense and security tasks, and help sectors and echelons to carry out national defense tasks in accordance with their functions. The ministries of National Defense and Interior must strive to satisfactorily carry out their functions and tasks in accordance with their authority. Efforts must be made to institutionalize the state laws, lines, and policies on strengthening national defense and security; perfect the laws on national defense and security and on defending the border and sea areas; and supplement and revise the law on military obligation and other legal documents. Efforts must also be made to promote the enforcement of the promulgated laws, integrate efforts to build the people's armed forces and the revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army. To triumphantly implement the party resolutions, we must strive to enhance our political background, the party leadership and its combat capabilities, enhance the working class' characteristics and the party's vanguard nature, correctly implement the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought on party building task, thereby helping the party to strengthen its political, ideological, and organizational background. Efforts must be made to review tasks and achievements, conduct theoretical studies and researches on pressing issues, uphold the spirit of independence, sovereignty, and self-reliance; create unanimity within the party on the renovation process. We must ensure that all party members have a firm political stand and are loyal to the party's ideals and the people's just cause. Efforts must be made to criticize and overcome deviated concepts and illusions, strive to oppose such phenomena as opportunism, rightism, revision, dogmatism, and conservatism; heighten vigilance, and struggle against sabotage activities of the hostile forces. It our struggle, we must adopt a correct concept and measures while refraining from using conservative and dogmatic concepts to oppose opportunism and revisionism. Reality in the renovation process calls for great efforts and correct actions. In practice, however, there are shortcomings in the implementation of the renovation process. We should strive to promote enthusiasm in implementing this process to encourage everyone to strengthen their correct concept and develop their intelligence to contribute to building the party while hightening vigilance to resolutely oppose hostile allegations and criticize erronous concepts. The party's correct lines and resolutions have set new orientations. However, the effective implementation of these orientations depends on the creativity and intellegence of each cadre, party member, echelon, sector, unit, and locality. This is because truth is concrete and revolution is creative. Each cadre and party member must strive to firmly grasp the party and state's lines and policies. They must base on the political task and the reality of their unit and locality to study and formulate best measures to fulfill the political duties while striving to draw on experiences and contribute to developing and triumphantly implementing the party lines in the renovation process and in building and defending the socalist fatherland.
