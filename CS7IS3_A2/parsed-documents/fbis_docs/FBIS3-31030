Vavra: "The Czech Republic's Exports to the Visegrad Four Countries Last Year Amounted To Almost 93 Billion Korunas"] [Text] According to the Czech Statistical Office, the Czech Republic returned a surplus foreign trade balance last year with all of the other Visegrad Four countries. Foreign trade turnover with Hungary increased by 15.9 percent, compared with 1992, while imports from Hungary increased by more than 50 percent, compared with 1992. On the other hand, exports to and imports from Poland declined, and overall foreign trade turnover fell by 10 percent. Exports to the Visegrad Four countries in 1993 amounted to 93.982 billion korunas [Kc], which is almost one-quarter of their overall volume. Our imports from the Visegrad Four states amounted to Kc79.270 billion (21.6 percent of Czech imports). Naturally, Slovakia accounted for most of our turnover. Exports amounted to Kc74.628 billion and imports to Kc65.017 billion. Goods worth Kc10.470 billion were exported to Poland, while exports to Hungary amounted to Kc7.884 billion. On the other hand, imports from Poland reached Kc9.273 billion and from Hungary Kc5.003 billion. The Visegrad Four countries will in the future be members of the Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA), which should commence operations on 1 January 1998. It will encompass approximately 7,500 different commodities. These are divided into three groups in accordance with the different periods of time involved in breaking down the customs barriers. The first group, where there is already no duty, concerns more than 2,200 products. From the point of view of the percentage of mutual trade, these are less significant products, and removing customs barriers should not influence their ability to compete. The second group contains some 3,700 products. According to the approved agreement, the current duty on these products will be maintained this year; it will be reduced by 66 percent in 1995 and by the remaining 33 percent in 1996. The customs barriers for the last, most sensitive, group will probably be removed in the year 2001. Agricultural products are, in essence, exempt from the CEFTA agreement. Only partial liberalization is envisaged here in the future.
