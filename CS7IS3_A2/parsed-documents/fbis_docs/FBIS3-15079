Moscow has sent the deputy foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, on a special mission to the Middle East. The aim of of the visit, during which Ivanov will meet President Yasir 'Arafat, is to give the peace process in the region a fresh impetus. Russia continues to stimulate mediation efforts aimed at ensuring the success of the Arab-Israeli direct talks. Moscow has agreed to Washington's proposal of sending out an invitation to the negotiating parties to resume the talks in the U.S. capital. After meeting the Palestinian president in Tunis, Ivanov will go to Israel to hold talks with officials there. In the light of these talks, Moscow will decide its subsequent steps in its Middle East foreign policy. This is what Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced at a news conference yesterday. He had a phone conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Shimon Peres, who informed Kozyrev of Israel's agreement to allow foreign civilian observers to visit the Palestinian occupied territories. In the meantime the Israeli Government is taking some measures to reduce the gravity of the negative impact of the Hebron massacre on the talks process. For example, the release has started today of hundreds of Palestinians from prisons, and the policy of limiting contacts between Jewish settlers and the Palestinians to avoid new bloody clashes continues. Representatives of the PLO in the occupied territories think that the release of a few hundred Palestinian prisoners is not enough, because the heart of the matter is the release of all the 10,000 prisoners. On its part, the United States was busy coordinating with the Palestinians and Israelis on the Security Council draft resolution, the main aim of which is to put an end to the bloody acts of violence exchanged in the Palestinian occupied territories. The U.S. permanent representative at the UN said that the agreement on the text of the document [UN Security Council resolution] is being finalized word by word to avoid a different interpretation in the future. The Security Council will continue discussing the consequences of the Hebron massacre today. Representatives of more than 30 UN member states have asked to address the session. Therefore, it is possible that the Security Council's meetings could last several days. The current circumstances indicate that the international community is concerned that the Middle East peace process should continue until a just and lasting peace has been established in the region, and until a secure and peaceful situation has developed for all the peoples and states of the region. Obsessed extremist terrorists from both sides must never be allowed to hinder or stop the progress of the negotiating process, the final aim if which is to reconcile between Israelis and Arabs on a basis acceptable equally to them and to the international community.
