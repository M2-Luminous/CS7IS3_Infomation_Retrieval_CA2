FBIS4-58525 "drnes087_n_94003" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 LEBANON Information Minister Rejects Israeli-PLO Accord Information Minister Rejects Israeli-PLO Accord JN0405145094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1230 GMT 4 May 94 JN0405145094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel Samahah by unidentified reporter on 4 May, following "the signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement"; place not given -- recorded] [Text] [Samahah] Having seen what has taken place in Cairo this morning, I would like to say that in spite of attempts to embellish things, we have witnessed an agreement of concession and the relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights and Palestinian land. The cause has been put aside. At the signing ceremony this morning, Mr. 'Arafat gave up even the title the Arabs have granted to the president of the state of Palestine. I believe Israel continues to follow an arrogant and sly path. This sustains the hatred that cannot coexist with peace and under whose canopy peace cannot flourish. Peace can only survive in an atmosphere of justice, and the recovery of rights. Rights cannot be regained while Jerusalem remains besieged by an agreement and while the Palestinian people have not even regained their basic rights. I believe this is more of an arrangement between dealers than an agreement between two countries, or between a country and a people whose rights are being regained. [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency Minister Samahah, this is on the national level, on the Palestinian level. Why this apprehension by the Lebanese authorities, by the Lebanese Government toward this agreement? [Samahah] Because I view this agreement as being the final Gaza-Jericho agreement. After it was signed today, it is no longer Gaza-Jericho First. Thus, rights have been squandered, and an unjust basis for peace has been established. We fear for the peace process following this signing and believe the peace course is full of mines. [Correspondent] On the Lebanese level, what impact will this agreement have on the Lebanese arena, that is, with respect to the issue of resettlement, and the issue of the presence of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon? [Samahah] If the Israeli leaders or Mr. 'Arafat believe that through such an agreement they will legalize resettlement, they will be ignoring the Palestinian people's rights, which we did not give up and which we want to maintain unharmed. We want to maintain these rights completely, in terms of the right to repatriation, the restoration of rights and land, and the right to citizenship on Palestinian land. Second, in the preamble of our Constituttion, we have reiterated our rejection of resettlement. The Lebanese are unanimous on this principle. The rejection of resettlement is not motivated by a regionalist, or chauvinist approach, but by our concern about Palestinian rights in Palestine and about our rights as Lebanese on our land and concerning our sovereignty. [Correspondent] Minister Samahah, do you believe the conclusion of this agreement will complicate the other tracks, the tracks between Lebanon and Israel, and between Syria and Israel, or will it facilitate these tracks? [Samahah] This agreement has given us an example of the kind of agreements by which Israel seeks to convert the countries around it into suburbs. We reject this. Therefore, we reject this unfair agreement. On the basis of what was agreed this morning, the agreement cannot be a comprehensive one. I believe the negotiations will be more complicated than some tend to believe. The future will tell. [Correspondent] Your Excellency Michel Samahah, thank you for this interview.
