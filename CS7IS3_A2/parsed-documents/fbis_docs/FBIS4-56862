Gregorio Uribe Guillen, who is serving his sentence in Cachiche Prison, said that the peace accord proposed by Abimael Guzman is not a strategy for Shining Path [SL] reorganization. Let us hear what he said: [Begin recording] [Uribe] I wish to voice my resolute support for President Gonzalo's letters asking President Alberto Fujimori for negotiations to reach a peace accord. The fact that there are still acts of violence shows that the actions have still not stopped, and I think this would be the best thing for all concerned. [Unidentified reporter] Is this to give you time to reorganize and resume your struggle against the state of law in a few years' time? [Uribe] No. We are quite aware that this is not a strategy, but rather something that is necessary for the Peruvian people, for Peruvian society as a whole, to reach peace. It is not a matter of strategy but something that is necessary. [end recording]
