The formal reason for this recall was the parliamentary debate which intended to reveal the violations of law in the activities of commercial structures at state and local government bodies. According to the adopted resolution, Shushkevich is blamed for failing to take measures against corruption, a lack of control over the work of law enforcement bodies, and manifested personal immodesty. The same charges with regard to Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich were treated by the majority of the people's deputies as insignificant; in secret balloting, they voted against his dismissal. Half an hour ago, the Supreme Soviet began its regular plenary session. People's deputies are discussing the miscellaneous matters on the agenda.
