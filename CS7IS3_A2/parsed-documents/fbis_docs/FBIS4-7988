They discussed the situation and problems in the economy and the enforcing of the government stabilization program in the first three months of the year. They said the situation in the economy was extremely difficult. Some firms' reproduction processes are highly endangered by financial instability. The total production is on a decrease due to high working expenditure and foreign blockade. The decrease is even up to 40 percent in some companies. All this is accompanied with big losses, debts, no current reproduction, considerable unpaid sums by foreign firm, restrictive monetary and interest rate policies, public expenditure, and absence of foreign investments. The situation is most difficult in agriculture, the metallurgy, production of the means of transportation, the textile industry, construction, and trade. Prime Minister Crvenkovski agreed the situation is alarming and pointed out government's readiness to react daily to it, but said long-term solutions must be sought. Macedonia must produce high-quality products and find markets for their distribution, Crvenkovski said. As for the reconstruction of 25 Macedonian firms, Minister Jovan Andov said the World Bank would aid only those with programs which guarantee the firms would work effectively in a market economy after the reconstruction. Chamber President Dusan Petreski said Macedonia still has no market economy and businessmen must sit down and work out a way out, instead of only criticizing.
