His opinion reflects debates going on in several U.S. circles concerning foreign aid to various countries. Because of pressure, the volume of foreign aid is being reduced annually, because U.S. taxpayers believe the aid serves no purpose now that the Cold War is over. The United States can choose any policy it wants. Any attempts to influence it will not work because they care about the interests of the U.S. citizen. However, why did the announcement that aid to Egypt will stop in three years at most coincide with U.S. attempts to block Egyptian exports to U.S. markets? Egypt is capable of continuing its economic reform measures without U.S. aid. If we shed some light on this issue, we find that the United States, its employees, and companies have greatly benefited from this aid and even shared some of it. How can we prepare ourselves for the end of this aid? We can, if we mobilize our enormous capabilities in various areas, improve our products, encourage Egyptians to invest their money and work harder, and grant preferential treatment by the state to Egyptian investors, citizens, and businessmen. No country in the world can exist without cooperating with other countries, but this cooperation must be governed by rules and conditions, so that no party may benefit at the expense of another and no party may impose arbitrary terms or restrictions, and this is what we should expect from now on. Aid does not build a homeland, and Egypt is rich in resources and people.
