Lebedev at Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow] [Abstract] A novel emission mode of a free-electron x-ray laser with counterpropagating electron beam and optical pump laser (``optical wiggler'') beam, namely its quantum emission mode where emission of an x-ray quantum changes the electronic state appreciably, is analyzed by comparing it with its classical mode of operation. Interaction of relativistic electrons with both electromagnetic pump and signal fields, for simplicity assuming a collinear geometry. Such a laser with an optical pump differs from one with a conventional magnetostatic one in that its emission and absorption lines are completely separated so that the ratio = h/_D_|e of the distance h_o_ (h- Planck constant, _o_- frequency) between them to their effective width _D__e_ is _ee_ > > 1, while with a magnetic pump this ratio is _ee_ << 1. Analysis of three-wave interaction confirms the validity of treating the laser as one with a completely inverted two-level active medium and describing its electron dynamics with the Klein-Gordon equation. By virtue of the conservation laws, the problem of transitions in a continuum reduces to the problem of resonance excitation of discrete levels in an anharmonic oscillator. This leads to a self-consistent closed nonlinear system of four partial differential equations completely describing the emission dynamics of such a laser: two equations the evolution of slowly varying amplitudes a[.sub]0[/](z,t) and a[.sub]-1[/](z,t), one equation the propagation of emission pulses, and one equation the evolution of the high-frequency signal. This system is analogous to the system of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing the interaction of a two-level atomic medium with a resonance field. The performance characteristics of this laser are calculated for the case of quasi-steady amplification with the durations of not only the high-frequency pump and signal pulses but also of the electron cluster much longer than the characteristic dimension of the interaction space divided by the speed of light. The laser is shown to be more efficient in the quantum mode than in the classical mode of operation, transition from the latter to the former being achievable by widening the energy range within the electron beam.
