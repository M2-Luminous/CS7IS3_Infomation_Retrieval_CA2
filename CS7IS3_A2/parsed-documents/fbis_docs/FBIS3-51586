Copre members have handed to the president-elect a document containing the main reforms, which, according to this group, should be implemented during the next constitutional term. Three salient points are highlighted: profound reforms of the constitution and public administration, and decentralization. Among the major changes are a reorganization of the Congress of the republic, a review of the Supreme Electoral Council, and the possible creation of a post that already exists in most European countries; that is, that of prime minister. [Begin Copre President Trino Marquez, as identified by caption, recording, in progress] ...agrees with this proposal. President Caldera told us about the need to reform the Constitution to allow the creation of the post of prime minister, because certain regulations restrict the relationship between the Executive Branch and other branches; thus, a constitutional reform is needed. This was one of his proposals. We must firmly promote a comprehensive reform of the Constitution. [end recording] At any rate, the president of the Republic cannot create a new ministry. As a last resort he could create a ministry without portfolio, however, solely to give him advice.
