A spokesman from the Ministry of Public Security said yesterday detectives had already completed their investigation of Mr Wei, and the results had been handed over to the Beijing prosecutor's office. "We have handed our results to the Beijing Procuratorate, who will take his case before the courts," the spokesman said, adding that he was not aware of a timetable for the indictment or trial. After more than a month of Foreign Ministry hints, sources close to the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Mr Wei could stand trial as early as next month. In what will inevitably be a high-profile trial, prosecutors will charge Mr Wei, the undisputed leader of China's dissident community, with "plotting to overthrow the government using foreign forces", one source said. The far-fetched charge of overthrowing the government, which sources say could be only one of up to three Beijing will bring, demonstrates the authorities' fear of their most vocal critic as public order begins to fray. Treason carries a possible life jail sentence. Meanwhile, Mr Wang told foreign journalists in Beijing he was taken to a police station at 11 am yesterday and released an hour later. The former student leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations was arrested by 10 policemen during an interview with five journalists from the American television network NBC at his home. "They held me for about an hour, mainly to question me about how the interview was arranged, things like that," he said. Mr Wang said he had not been ordered to refuse interviews and would talk to foreign correspondents who sought him out. He also said he planned to leave Beijing of his own accord at the end of the month. Mr Wang said his detention probably reflected official efforts to control news gathering by foreign reporters in the runup to 4 June, the fifth anniversary of Beijing's crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests. It is also the date by which United States President Bill Clinton must decide whether to renew China's low-tariff most-favoured-nation trade privileges. "I will not refuse to give interviews to anyone," a defiant Mr Wang said. Members of the NBC television crew, who were detained separately, said they were released after several hours of questioning. Authorities worried about possible attempts to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre have been rounding up dissidents or putting them under round-the-clock surveillance. Sources in Shanghai said Yang Qinheng, a long-time democracy activist, was the latest to be arrested, and that police told his wife he might be released after 4 June. It was not clear exactly when Mr Yang was arrested. At least six other Shanghai dissidents have been arrested since April. The brother of one, Lin Muchen, said police had refused to give the family any information. In Beijing, police moved ahead of the anniversary to round-up dissidents, send some temporarily out of the capital and warned others to avoid foreign journalists and stay at home.
