FBIS4-18660 "drweu068_h_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 GERMANY Government To Ease Export Regulations for East Europe Government To Ease Export Regulations for East Europe LD0804094394 Berlin DDP/ADN in German 0836 GMT 8 Apr 94 LD0804094394 Berlin DDP/ADN German BFN [Text] Hanover (ADN-Wirtschaftsdienst-Ost) -- The German Government evidently intends to make it easier to export high technology to the former East Bloc states. The HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG reports that following the end of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the German Economics Ministry is currently looking into simplifying procedures for export permits. It will be possible in future to receive multiple export permits. Businesses would then only have to register their exports in retrospect. Until now export procedures for high-performance computers or machine tools, for example, sometimes took over a year. Cocom, the agency responsible for this, was disbanded on 1 April. The Cocom list, specifying high technology items that were seen as sensitive in security policy terms and could thus not be sold to the former communist states, is thus no longer valid either. A special ruling had previously been needed for each individual transaction. The Cocom states -- Japan, Australia, and all NATO states except Iceland -- have resolved to continue using the list as a basis for their decisions. The German Government wants to follow the United States in utilizing the new scope for maneuver, according to the paper. The new regulations will not, however, make arms exports any easier.
