Grlickov] [Text] The reactions of bankers to the enactments in the monetary and foreign exchange sphere can be briefly reduced to the following: The enactments based on the Program for Reconstruction of the Monetary System and Yugoslavia's Economic Recovery are being supported, and the criticism is being directed toward oversights and deficiencies in preparation of the program's application. Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, is critical of the poor preparation for practical implementation of the program in view of the fact that all the enactments were not adopted on time. He therefore poses the question whether the bank will be able to prove the origin of foreign exchange and foreign currencies when it purchases them for new convertible dinars; that is, how much will be expected of it in relations with the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia]. If the objective is to activate holdings of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, and gold in banks and firms, one can guess the answer to the question. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ has said in this connection that they will not be calling for the origin of foreign exchange and currency, since a kind of legalization of these reserves has already taken place through previous commitments and enactments. A separate question is whether and to what extent foreign exchange reserves tied to the issue of the new dinars should be transferred to the NBJ, as it would be better, according to Vitomir Janjuz, director of the Belgrade Credit Bank, that they remain in the bank (with the convertible dinar as an element of their security). One particular problem might be a shortage of new dinars at the outset to cover the foreign exchange and currency that the public is ready to offer to the banks. That might suggest the conclusion that there will be no dinars in cash even if foreign exchange and currencies are offered to the NBJ. There is some question about the foreign exchange reserves in the amount of $200 million envisaged as the basis of for issuing the new dinars. The $200 million cannot be expected to service the anticipated social product of $10 billion. To achieve that, the money supply would have to have an extremely high rate of turnover, one that is not possible anywhere in the world today, says Milo Kaponja of Centrobanka, pointing out the problem of the scant foreign exchange reserves. The foreign exchange reserves are not sufficient to cover the lending operations of the banks, and it is not good to create the impression that they have excessive holdings. Those holdings are mostly committed already in industry or are in accounts abroad. In any case, the reserves would be quickly spent, and unless there are essential changes in the structure of the state, the economy and banking, the program will soon come to an end. Milomir Spasic, general manager of Slavija Bank, believes that it will all come down to expenditure of the foreign exchange reserves unless there are changes and support within industry. The chances of that happening are slim at present. As to supplying the foreign exchange reserves to carry out the program, the bankers support the idea of turning old foreign exchange savings into public debt of the state, covered by a three-year moratorium. they suggest in this connection that minimum payouts of savings nevertheless be made to the poorest segments of the population. At the same time, it would be good to establish the real balance of that debt, since it could differ from what has been recorded as foreign exchange savings deposited in the National Bank of Yugoslavia. It is seen as a good sign that the program contains a break with social ownership and a pity that it was not accompanied by adoption of an enactment to that effect. It would perhaps be good in this connection for property in the form of goods and real estate to be used more as collateral to cover bank loans (mortgages and secured loans), which can in turn be taken as criticism of the policy of linking primary note issue exclusively to coverage consisting of foreign exchange, currencies and gold. The entire program, says Ratko Djuric of Agrobanka, is based on reform of the monetary and fiscal systems and essentially represents an effort to consolidate budget deficits. Nothing is said in the program about primary distribution, prices, disparities, and the like, which was added (with or without the knowledge of the program's authors) to the enactments. The main problem with the program and the enactments is that they do not furnish sufficient foreign exchange reserves to carry it out. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ remains an optimist concerning this question from the bankers, hoping that support for the program will nevertheless come from the IMF. The program does contain elements the IMF poses as a condition for furnishing countries support. But that is still a long way from specific support, and without that there is no chance of lasting success and recovery. Of course any departures from vital commitments in the program, such as those related to the budget deficit, and especially the fact that its expenditures have not been reduced this time either, could raise the question of how long it will last.
