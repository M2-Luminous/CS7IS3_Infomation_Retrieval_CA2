We are currently experiencing difficult times. I am happy to hear the words you deputies spoke on the return of peace to Bujumbura and our country. The current situation does not concern the military alone; the return of peace is the duty of all Burundians from the highest ranking to the lowest. Those who were elected by the people should be seen to be making efforts to assist them, to prove that we are not sitting in offices exchanging ideas which lead us nowhere. There is little peace in the country currently. Reports from upcountry say that in almost all areas no night passes without people dying, without houses being burned down or demolished. In Bujumbura, it is worse. When the president of the Republic was sworn in we thought that things would cool down but you can see how things are. Here in Bujumbura, in all the suburbs, people are dying, houses are being burned down, and now they are being burned down in the daylight. You have just seen when we were outside how they were burning in Nyakabiga. It is shameful that we cannot return peace to the people. You asked me how you can help the minister of defense. I liked the fact that you thought about helping the security services. I also thought about requesting the same from you, but you did it before I had the chance. I would like you to examine together ways of meeting the people, how we can go to Musaga, Cibitoke, and other suburbs to pacify them so that, as you said, the culprits are arrested, tried, and jailed. Regarding the question of how to implement this in peace, we are going to study this situation so that we see how you can visit suburbs in our company without endangering the security of deputies. I do not say that all of you can go there, but a few of you can represent the rest so that we act quickly and see how we can ensure your security. The other thing in which you can help us is to support us when talking to the people in your daily actions, in your work, because the way things are now, we should leave aside the party questions so that people can catch up on their sleep and can attend their work. What took place over the weekend is a shame. Guns were fired throughout the night, there were explosions throughout the night and it is a shame. You can therefore see that in the whole country, especially in Bujumbura, there are too many weapons. It is excessive. Everyone has weapons -- Tutsis, Hutus, and foreigners. [Words indistinct] to return peace as soon as possible, today or tomorrow so that people can sleep and go to work, you should support the idea that people who have weapons should be (?disarmed). This question should find a solution with the help of the people themselves. Because even if we achieved peace today, as long as the weapons are still in circulation they would be used later in other ways, for stealing and killing. That question should not be left behind among the urgent questions. Ministers, deputies, government employees should work together, meet the people and speak with one voice about peace in these difficult times. People are being kidnapped in broad daylight, but we cannot even find their bodies or know where to start looking. This is a shame. This cannot continue while there are services charged with security and administration. We would be useless to the people. [passage omitted]
