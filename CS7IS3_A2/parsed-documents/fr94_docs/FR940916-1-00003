FR940916-1-00003 FR940916-1-00001 Background Section 703(a) of the Wool Act provides that the Secretary shall, through the CCC, make loans and payments available to producers of wool and mohair through December 31, 1995. Section 703(b) of the Wool Act provides that the support price for shorn wool for each of the marketing years 1991 through 1995 shall be 77.5 percent of an amount which is determined by multiplying 62 cents (the support price in 1965) by the ratio of: (i) The average of the parity index (the index of prices paid by farmers, including commodities and services, interest, taxes, and farm wage rates) for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which such support price is being determined and announced to (ii) the average parity index for the three calendar years 1958, 1959, and 1960, rounding the result to the nearest full cent. Based on current reported parity indices, the calculation for the 1995 shorn wool support price (grease basis) is as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) Average parity index, calendar years 1991&hyph;1993: l1991&hyph;1285 l1992&hyph;1303 l1993&hyph;1340 s,n ␣␣3928 divided by 3 1309.3 (2) Average parity index, 1958&hyph;1960 297.3 (3) Ratio of 1309.3 to 297.3 4.4040 (4) 4.4040 x 62 cents/lb. (1965 support price) $2.7305 (5) 77.5% x $2.7305 $2.1161 (6) $2.1161 rounded to nearest cent $2.12 Section 703(c) of the Wool Act provides that the support prices for pulled wool and for mohair shall be established at such levels, in relationship to the support price for shorn wool, which is determined to maintain normal marketing practices for pulled wool, and which is determined necessary to maintain approximately the same percentage of parity for mohair as for shorn wool. Section 703(c) further provides that the support price for mohair must be within a range of 15 per centum above or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported. Section 704(a) provides that payments shall be such as the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the national average price received by producers, to give producers a national average return for the commodity equal to the support price level, and that, in the case of the 1995 marketing year, the payments shall be 50 percent of the amount otherwise determined in accordance with such section. Section 703(e) of the Wool Act provides that, to the extent practicable, support price levels for wool and mohair shall be established and announced sufficiently in advance of each marketing year, as will permit producers to plan their production for such marketing year. Accordingly, the following methods for calculating the support prices for wool on unshorn lambs and for mohair for the 1995 marketing year are being proposed. A. Support Price_Wool on Unshorn Lambs The support price for wool on unshorn lambs for the 1995 marketing year cannot be determined until the 1995 national average market price for shorn wool is calculated. This will occur by April 1996. It is proposed that the method for calculating the support price for wool on unshorn lambs shall be as follows: Once the 1995 national average market price for shorn wool is determined, the support price for wool on unshorn lambs will be determined by multiplying 80 percent of the difference between the 1995 support price for shorn wool and the 1995 national average market price for shorn wool by 5 pounds (the average quantity of wool on an average 100-pound unshorn lamb). Historically, this formula has provided equitable support for wool on unshorn lambs relative to shorn wool and has helped to maintain normal marketing practices for pulled wool. In accordance with section 704(a) of the Wool Act, the 1995 marketing year payment for wool on unshorn lambs shall be 50 percent of the amount otherwise determined in accordance with such formula. B. Support Price_Mohair It is proposed that the support price for mohair for the 1995 marketing year shall be determined based on the October 1994 parity prices for mohair and shorn wool. The following percentages of parity at which shorn wool is supported are being considered in the final computation of the mohair support price: 85, 100, and 115 percent. The support programs conducted pursuant to the Wool Act are subject to the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Deficit Reduction Act of 1985, as amended. As a result, the proposed program support levels announced in this rule may be recalculated to comply with this Act.
