Thus, Nagorno-Karabakh accepted the proposal put forward on April 26 by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on the cease-fire in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. The proposal was backed by Azerbaijan on the same day. The Minister proposed to declare a truce from 00:00 hours of April 28. However, Stepanakert was unable to give an official answer before Thursday. The letter says that Nagorno Karabakh is prepared to observe a cease fire based on the protocol signed following the results of the meeting in Moscow on February 18 by defense ministers of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Pavel Grachev, Sarzh Sargsyan and Mamadrafi Mammadov. The document provides for a cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh, the withdrawal of the conflicting sides and talks on the Karabakh status. The letter by the Karabakh leaders says that because of the absence of observers, the mutual distrust of the conflicting sides, and in an attempt to exclude possible attempts to use a temporary lull to prepare for another large-scale offensive, and to help make the peace process irreversible, the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh believe it necessary to make use of the mechanism of the above protocol. The implementation of the entire complex of military-technical measures, says the document, may guarantee a lasting cease-fire and create favorable conditions for solving political problems. The letter says that leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh are prepared to order a cease-fire after the mediator (Russia) confirms the reception of an identical document from the conflicting side. Interfax was informed about the letter of the Karabakh leadership by an aide to the Armenian president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan.
