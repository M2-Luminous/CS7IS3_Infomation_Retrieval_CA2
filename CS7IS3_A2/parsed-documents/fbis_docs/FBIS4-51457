"I believe that we are now through the worst of the political argument that we have had, alas, with China," the Governor told an invited audience at the conservative Carlton Club in London on Wednesday night. "I hope that we can find ways of co-operating elsewhere." Patten's remarks reflect the Hong Kong government's belief that Beijing has now "ring-fenced" the deadlocked issue of democratic reforms, and is willing to work jointly on projects such as the building of the new airport. Patten drew strong parallels between the legacy of democracy Britain left behind in post-colonial India and his hopes riding on the future of Hong Kong. Asserting that Britain had taught India the "literature of liberty", Patten declared that by the time he left in 1997, he hoped to have "put the stamp of the continuance of an open, plural society" on the territory. Yesterday, Patten reinforced his message about the overwhelming importance of the steps towards democratic accountability at a meeting in Manchester. He said: "If the Joint Declaration is implemented in full, I believe that Hong Kong will have a spectacular future." The territory would be assured, he argued, of the role in relation to the Chinese economy that New York played in the opening up of the American continent. "If the Joint Declaration is not implemented in full, Hong Kong will put in jeopardy the characteristics which make it special -- the rule of law, a free press, a high level of resistance to corruption," he said. "Hong Kong will no longer be special and the potential offered by the historic `one country two systems' concept will have been squandered."
