The threat comes from the Party's general secretary, Dr. (Percival Broderick). A communique from Dr. (Broderick) says the JLP finds Prime Minister Patterson's recent statement most unacceptable [words indistinct] the holding of eight parish council and constituency by-elections. Dr. (Broderick) also says there has been a chorus of pronouncements by the government criticizing the electronic voting system, while an official response to the proposal has been deferred. Only yesterday, the JLP's two representatives walked out of a meeting of the electoral advisory committee. The JLP walkout protested a report from the acting director of elections that all was ready for the holding of a by-election in southern St. Catherine to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Hugh Small.
