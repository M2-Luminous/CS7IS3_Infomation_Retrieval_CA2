[Krslak] Although the new registering of refugees is yet to take place, how many are there in the Republic of Croatia according to the data you have? How many are in private accommodation and how many in organized accommodation, and what is the ethnic composition? [Rebic] Since the beginning of the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, hundreds of thousands of Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees have passed through Croatia, of which 250,000 are still in Croatia. The first refugees were from Herzegovinian towns and villages, as the JNA [Yugoslav National Army] violently attacked Herzegovina first. However, when Herzegovina was liberated from the Serbian JNA and the paramilitary formations, the Herzegovinian refugees immediately returned to their homes in the liberated towns and villages of western Herzegovina and the Neretva River basin. Immediately after the aggression against Herzegovina, the Serb formations attacked all the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in early April 1992, some 1,000 refugees per day who entered Croatia. The greatest number of refugees arrived during the summer of 1992, from the Banja Luka area, from Bosanska Krajina, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, and Bosanska Posavina. In June 1992, there were 280,000 refugees in Croatia. We then held an international conference in Zagreb (on 9 June) and asked for urgent aid in food and accommodation capacities. We were setting up tents, because all the facilities were already occupied. During July and August, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands took 17,000 refugees to relieve the refugee situation in Croatia. In the late fall of 1992, there were about 370,000 refugees in Croatia. We were building refugee camps and restoring the former army barracks and other facilities. We still had refugees living in tents, whom we only managed to accommodate in November. Many were leaving for third countries, especially in Europe. In April 1993, we made a list of all the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and established that there were exactly 269,005 in Croatia in that month. We keep the names and other necessary information in the database that has been used by other local and foreign institutions that needed the exact number of refugees in order to provide better care. No one else was able to state data other than what we collected through the registration, which we keep in the database. The greatest number of refugees after this registration was in February this year: 331,000 refugees. Since then, the number of refugees has been decreasing gradually: some have returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and some are still going to third countries. On 25 May this year, we had 267,516 refugees, of which there are 238,516 registered and some 28,000 non-registered (this is our estimate). Some 67,000 refugees stay in organized accommodation, for which we pay 750 kunas (200 German marks [DM]) per person per month on average, and 180,000 refugees live in families or independently, for whom we pay 100 kunas (DM25) per person per month to the people who provide homes for them. We also provide food for the latter. We allow for the possibility that among the registered there may be some who, in the meantime, went to third countries or returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina without having deregistered. We are therefore going to carry out another registration of the refugees so that we will again have the correct information on the number of refugees that will prove trustworthy both to our public and the international public. Croatia is one of the few countries that carries out these registration procedures and has accurate data regarding the number of refugees and displaced persons. As far as the ethnic composition is concerned, about 55 percent are Bosnians of Islamic faith, and some 45 percent are Catholics, that is, Croats. However, this new registration will show the exact ratio. [Krslak] The fact is that the number of refugees was often used as the "trump card" in the political negotiations, even in economic agreements. The manager of a certain bank has "procured" an arrangement with Kuwait, having given the figure of 70,000 Muslims in Croatia. What is your comment on such manipulations of the refugees? [Rebic] As far as using the number of refugees in political talks or economic agreements is concerned, I cannot tell you anything, as I have no such information. Numbers of refugees and displaced persons are certainly mentioned in all the political talks; it is inevitable. After all, they are persons who are the greatest victims of the Serb aggression, of the war against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. They should be given proper accommodation and enabled to return to their homes. In that context, politics can help a great deal. I do not know of any "procured" arrangement of "a certain" bank with Kuwait. Since the name of the bank, the place, the manager's name, the time of "procuring," and other information has not been stated, I consider it to be simply a rumor. You can be sure that Kuwait would have asked me about the number of refugees before entering such "procurement." In our experience, the Arabic and Islamic humanitarian organizations were, in general, very cautious about giving humanitarian aid, and they were mainly giving it for the Muslims. Therefore, there have been no manipulations with the refugees. On the contrary, many Croatian banks, companies, and humanitarian organizations were very generous with humanitarian aid and money for the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, not asking about their ethnic or religious orientation. Croatia has been the greatest benefactor to the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees. [Krslak] Regarding the expected return of the refugees from Croatia to their homeland, to the liberated areas, you have pointed out many times that Croatia cannot bear such refugee pressure. In Sarajevo you asked that the refugee problem be first resolved in Croatia. What suggestions do you have related to this? [Rebic] Regarding the expected return of the refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities have been insisting on, we will sign an agreement on the organized and safe return of all the refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina with the authorities of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We want the return of the refugees from Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina to be implemented soon in all the safe areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as has been the case with the displaced persons in Croatia. We arranged that in principle while we were in Sarajevo; the specific modes will be agreed upon in the agreement and protocol on our return. Croatia is still overburdened by refugees. It has the greatest number of refugees, that is, more than Germany. I believe that there are no more than 200,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Germany -- I do not want to discuss how many there are from the territory of the former Yugoslavia! [Krslak] You have recently stated that the return of the refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented sooner than the return of the displaced persons to the occupied territories in Croatia. What is your estimate based on, and what plans for the return to Bosnia-Herzegovina do you suggest, having met with the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Sarajevo, and with Mr. Izetbegovic? [Rebic] I said that the return of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented before the return of our displaced persons to the occupied areas, or the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] and pink zones; namely, the return of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees to the free part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is already possible. Naturally, there is still the unresolved issue of the refugees from the areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina that have been occupied by the Serb Chetniks. Their eventual return will depend on the return of the displaced persons to the occupied territories of Croatia. I believe that these two segments of the problem will have to be solved together. [Krslak] Will Croatia be able to offer the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees the freedom of the choice to stay, as some other European countries (for instance, Sweden) have done? [Rebic] Croatia will certainly have to keep some refugees eventually, as they will not want to return to Bosnia. Some have already found jobs in Croatia and bought or exchanged apartments or houses. It is inevitable that some refugees always stay in the country that took them in. However, not too many will stay in Croatia, because Bosnia-Herzegovina is close, and because it is difficult to get a job in Croatia. There are still some 260,000 unemployed in Croatia. This is a great problem for the reintegration of the refugees. Croatia also has 240,000 displaced persons, some of whom will also not want to return to their homes. As far as other countries are concerned, some of them will certainly keep some of the refugees, as they need workers. You can be sure that if they had as great a number of unemployed (relatively) as Croatia does, they would not even have let them into their country. At any rate, you probably know that in France, England, and some other large countries of Europe there are no more than 5,000 Bosnia- Herzegovina refugees. Only Germany (180,000), Austria (40,000), Switzerland (40,000), Slovenia (22,000), Norway (14,000), and Denmark (15,000) took a larger number of Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees. [Krslak] Regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees, the most topical problem are the refugees from central Bosnia, who are accommodated in the Slovenian company vacation homes. Are there any chances for this problem to be solved with a compromise between the three interested parties (the owners, your office, and the refugees)? [Rebic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees who are accommodated in the Slovenian company vacation homes will move to other refugee centers immediately after school is over.
