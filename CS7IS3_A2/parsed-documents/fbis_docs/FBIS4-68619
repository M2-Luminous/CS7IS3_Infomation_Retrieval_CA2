At present, there are 72 of them, but only 41 exchanges are actually in operation. The number of brokerage offices also diminished. At the beginning of the year, 90 brokerage offices were registered at each exchange on the average whereas by the end of the year--only 60. Based on the results of the [as published] nine months of 1993, the volume of transactions concluded on the exchanges of Ukraine exceeded 300 billion karbovantsy. Products, goods, services, and real estate worth 6.8 trillion karbovantsy were put up for sale. The liquidity coefficient came to 4.6 percent during this period. If we characterize the structure of the exchange trade in the republic, real estate, transportation vehicles, quotas (licenses) to export products out of Ukraine, and fuel accounted for the largest proportion. The growth of the volume of transactions involving transportation vehicles was due to the fact that the exchanges were granted the right to sell the assets of state enterprises, including used motor vehicles. For this reason, transportation vehicles worth a total of 46 billion karbovantsy were sold through the exchanges in the third quarter alone. A fuel shortage and the regulatory influence of the government caused a change in the dynamics of transactions involving these products. In the first quarter, the greatest volume of transactions was effected--approximately 30 billion karbovantsy worth. In the second quarter, virtually no fuel was sold because of rigid restrictions on its exportation beyond the borders of Ukraine and a sharp rise in wholesale prices for energy resources in May. In the third quarter, the sale of fuel through the exchanges went down by a factor of five (in value terms) compared to the first quarter. In 1993, 10 times less coal than during the corresponding period of 1992 was sold on one of the largest exchanges of Ukraine, the Donetsk "South" Regional Commodity, Raw-Material, and Fuel Exchange. In the third quarter, the volume of transactions on the Ukrainian exchanges increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to the first quarter. In particular, 22 times more transportation vehicles (in value terms), 17 times more chemicals, seven times more construction materials, four times more metal and metal products, two times more nonferrous metals, 3.5 times more real estate, and three times more consumer goods were sold. Yet, 40 percent fewer transactions involving credit resources were concluded. However, does this indicate a pickup in exchange trading? Of course, it does not. The point is that this is due solely to an increase in the exchange prices for products. By the end of the year, prices had increased by a factor of 12 for a comparable assortment of 42 key exchange-traded goods. The volume of exchanges in natural units declined several fold compared to 1992. In the immediate future, an increase in the volume of sales may apparently be expected only in the cases of the sale of real estate and state enterprise property. The exchanges have selected real estate as the main area of their specialization in the environment of hyperinflation, proceeding from the desire of the population and commercial structures to invest monetary funds in real estate. Exchanges operate in virtually all oblasts of Ukraine, with the exception of Zhytomir and Sumy Oblasts. However, the bulk of the transactions are concluded on the exchanges of Kiev (69 percent), Poltava (10.7 percent), Kharkov (6.5 percent), Donetsk (4.6 percent), and Dnepropetrovsk (2.2 percent) Oblasts. Trading on other exchanges is not large and accounts for 7 percent of the entire volume. The exchanges of Kiev are mostly geared toward noncommodity transactions. Thus, between 87 and 100 percent of transactions involving credit resources, quotas (licenses), real estate, and securities are concluded on the exchanges of Kiev. Transactions involving nonferrous metals, the volume of which ranges between 72 and 75 percent of the volume of exchange transactions in the republic, are the exception. At the same time, 93 percent of transactions involving foodstuffs, 67 percent of transactions involving computer and office equipment, and 50 percent of transactions involving cable products are effected on the exchanges in Donetsk Oblast. Few exchanges facilitating an increase in the turnaround of merchandise remain in Ukraine. As a rule, an overwhelming majority of companies trade in real estate and other noncommodity stocks--quotas, licenses, credit resources, securities. This is a direct consequence of hyperinflation. The current status of exchange trading reflects the overall situation in the economy of Ukraine: Markets for sales are being lost; enterprises have excessive inventories; the payment and energy crises are not dying down. Under the circumstances, only a few exchanges can retain the specialization they selected.
