FR940428-2-00127 FR940428-2-00059 [Release No. 34&hyph;33939; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;65] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Exclusion of Class Action Claims From Arbitration April 20, 1994. On November 4, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 , and rule 19b-4 thereunder. 2 The proposal amends section 12 of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure 3 (``Code'') by barring any NASD member or its associated persons from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate against another member or associated person if that member or associated person has initiated in court a putative class action or is a member of a putative or certified class. The prohibition would extend to all claims encompassed by the class action. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1993). 3 NASD Manual, Code of Arbitration Procedure, Part III, Sec. 12 (CCH), Â¶3712. Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal, was provided by issuance of a Commission release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33506, February 9, 1994) and by publication in the Federal Register (59 FR 7282, February 15, 1994). No comment letters were received. This order approves the proposed rule change. Section 12(d)(3) of the Code currently bars members or associated persons from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate against a customer where the customer has initiated in court a putative class action or is a member of a putative or certified class with respect to any claims encompassed by the class action. The section, however, omits specific reference to claims filed by associated persons against members and claims filed by members against other members. As a result, some respondents have argued that class actions encompassing such claimants can be submitted to arbitration under the Code. The NASD determined that the original intent of the section was to exclude class action claims by associated persons, including employment-related claims, and other industry class actions from arbitration, as well as customer-related class actions. Accordingly, the NASD proposed to amend section 12(d)(3) of the Code to clarify that the prohibition in the provision is total and encompasses class actions in which a member or an associated person may be the subject of a class action. The amendment to section 12(d)(3) of the Code adds references to ``other member and person associated with a member'' to clarify that the prohibition against seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate applies not only to class actions in which a claimant is a customer, but to class actions in which an associated person or a member is a party. 4 4 The amendment limits those disputes between members or between a member and an associated person that are required to be submitted to arbitration under section 8(a) of the Code to the same extent as existing section 12(d)(3) limits those disputes between investors and members or associated persons that are required to be submitted to arbitration under section 12(d)(1) of the Code. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. 5 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, inter alia, that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. Over the years of the evolution of class action litigation, the courts have developed the procedures and expertise for managing class actions. Duplication of the often complex procedural safeguards necessary for these lawsuits is unnecessary. The Commission also believes that access to the courts for class action litigation should be preserved for associated persons and member firms as well as for investors and that the rule change approved herein provides a sound procedure for the management of class actions. The proposed rule change also should prevent wasteful litigation over the possible applicability of agreements to arbitrate between members or between a member and a person associated with a member notwithstanding the exclusion of class action claims from NASD arbitration. Based on the above, the Commission believes that the rule change herein approved should promote the efficient resolution of these class action disputes. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change satisfies the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. 5 15 U.S.C. 78 o -3. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the instant rule change be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
