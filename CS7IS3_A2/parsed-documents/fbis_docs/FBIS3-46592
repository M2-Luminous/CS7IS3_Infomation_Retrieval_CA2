"Let us usher in the new year with an open mind, shedding old things as we have just bidden farewell to the past," Kim said. "Let us also shed selfishness, deceit, indolence, vanity and wastefulness in the New Year and be reborn as a new people. We have to make 1994 a new year in which we have to wipe out the remaining corruption and irregularities and make ours a new and clean society." The president said he wished that everyone would live for their community rather than for themselves in the coming year. "We have to demolish all kinds of obstacles within ourselves and remold a just society that we can be proud of," the president said. "There lies the reason why we cannot delay nor stop our reform." 1994 must be the year during which "we have to open narrow minds and closed doors and take the steps toward the competitive, wide world with the confidence born of cooperation," he said. He said the coming year has to be the period in which Korea not only survives in the new world order of competition but raises its status as a nation still further. "A chance never comes twice," Kim declared. "And it is said that chance and crisis come together." The president urged the people to grab the opportunity that, he said, was being created as a challenge through internationalization and openness, referring, among other things, to the successful conclusion of the uruguay round of trade negotiations under which Korea will open its farm market. "We cannot afford to miss the best opportunity that has come our way in a long while," he said. Everyone will have to take up the challenge of competition, at work, on the street, at home and in school, Kim said. "None of us should ever forget that we are the main player in international competition. And we have to win, at any cost," he declared. "We cannot afford to waste our precious time by engaging in wasteful dissension and enmity," he said. "In order to win the unrestrained competition in international arenas, let us concentrate our creativity and ability to boost our national strength and organization. We have to make 1994 the starting point for reform and progress toward the world and the future. We should not cling to unproductive arguments but find the right answers in practical work." The people had to sort out what was good and beneficial for them. Through such practical reform, Kim said, the country can solve the problems of farmers and fishermen, who face a severe challenge as a result of the market opening for farm imports. "Let us gather our wisdom and strength in order to give hope and courage to our farmers," he said. Lastly, the president said, he prayed for genuine peace to befall the still divided Korean peninsula through a resolution of the North Korean nuclear question this year. "Let us work together to make 1994 a year in which Koreans living in the North can take part in the worldwide trend of reform and openness as well as in our people's historical mission to create a new Korea," he said.
