The three men who filed candidacy papers were incumbent mayor Hidenobu Takahide, 64, and challengers Toshihiko Izu, 67, and Takashi Nomura, 40. All three are independents. Takahide, who is seeking a second four-year term of office, has gained the backing of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, Komeito, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party. Izu, a professor emeritus at Yokohama City University, is backed by the Japanese Communist Party, while Nomura, a former Home Affairs Ministry bureaucrat, has garnered support from new party Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party. Yokohama, the largest international port city in Japan, has a population of 3.3 million, ranking second after Tokyo which has a population of more than eight million. The challengers have accused Takahide of having received a huge amount of election campaign funds from general contractors. Takahide denies the allegation.
