In this plan, Tel Aviv has proposed to Damascus that the Golan Heights be returned to Syria over a period of 10 years and in this interim period, U.S. or peacekeeping forces be stationed in this region. According to political analysts, this proposal indicates that the Zionist regime is trying to postpone its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories to as far in the future as possible, by presenting miscellaneous proposals. Earlier as well, the Zionist regime had suggested to Syria that it carry out a military withdrawal on the condition that Syria would lease the region to Israel for 10 years. Such proposals by the Zionist regime to Syria highlight the following realities: First, this regime, and its main supporter, the United States, do not consider it necessary to act within the framework of the Madrid talks. In other words, the so-called Middle East peace talks that began in Madrid on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 clearly stipulate that the Zionist regime should return the territories usurped by it in 1967 to the Arabs. However, in the latest proposals by the Zionist regime which have been conveyed by the United States to the Syrian leaders, withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights has been enmeshed in various conditions, some of which even violate Syrian sovereignty. The second issue that can be deduced from the Zionist regime's proposals to Syria is: With its various ploys, the Zionist regime is seeking to defer withdrawal from the Golan Heights and other occupied territories to a time as far in the future as possible. This attitude indicates that the Zionist regime is not very optimistic about its future in the region. Tel Aviv is well aware that as a result of the proliferation of the wave of Islamism, public opinion in the region has not even accepted the despotic Zionist regime's existence, much less amicable coexistence with it. The actions by the United States and the Zionist regime to cast aside the Madrid framework and Tel Aviv's tendency to present such invalid plans for withdrawal from the Golan Heights and autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza Strip exposes the reality that the Zionist regime and its international supporters are striving to attain peace with the Arabs without returning the occupied territories to them, but at the same time, to forge friendly relations and cooperation in the political, economic, and security fields. This reality illustrates the outcome of the so-called peace talks, that is, the Zionist regime will get what it set out to get from these peace talks, while the Arab countries will be forced to make peace with the enemy without regaining their usurped territories.
