Only sporadic sniper fire has come from the Muslim side today. The UN troops are taking up positions in their designated locations. The Karadzic-Akashi agreement is being implemented. Units of the army of the Srpska republic are withdrawing to the lines 3 km from the center of Gorazde, while the heavy artillery has been withdrawn to 20 km from the town. The Serbian civilians who fled their houses before the Muslim army's advance two years ago are returning to burnt and destroyed villages on the right bank of the Drina River. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] (?represent a guarantee) to them to return and continue to live safely in their destroyed houses. The Muslim army has been defeated on the Gorazde front. Their offensive did not succeed. Of their four brigades, with more than 8,000 troops, three have been crushed. This was stated by Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic from the Herzegovina Corps command during today's meeting with correspondents reporting from this front. He stressed that in their counteroffensives, members of the army of the Srpska republic liberated an area of 170 square kilometers. The units of the Herzegovina Corps, commanded by General Radovan Grubac, liberated 100 square kilometers themselves. This has created the conditions for the Serbs who have fled the area to return to their hearths. Herzegovina has in this way obtained the shortest possible route to Serbia, this officer said. According to Colonel Lakicevic, the world has finally realized that its investment in Alija's army was futile. In the fighting on the Gorazde front, the Herzegovina Corps lost 30 fighters killed and 160 were wounded. Of these 40 were more seriously wounded.
