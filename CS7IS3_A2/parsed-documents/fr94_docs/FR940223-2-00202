FR940223-2-00202 FR940223-2-00101 Wednesday February 23, 1994 Part VIII Department of Education Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 36␣/␣Wednesday, February 23, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of final policy guidance. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Education issues final policy guidance on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations. The final policy guidance discusses the applicability of the statute's and regulations' nondiscrimination requirement to student financial aid that is awarded, at least in part, on the basis of race or national origin. EFFECTIVE DATE: This policy guidance takes effect on May 24, 1994, subject to the transition period described in this notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeanette Lim, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 5036&hyph;I Switzer Building, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;1174. Telephone (202) 205&hyph;8635. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the TDD number at 1&hyph;800&hyph;358&hyph;8247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 10, 1991, the Department published a notice of proposed policy guidance and request for public comment in the Federal Register (56 FR 64548). The purpose of the proposed guidance and of this final guidance is to help clarify how colleges can use financial aid to promote campus diversity and access of minority students to postsecondary education without violating Federal anti-discrimination laws. The Secretary of Education encourages continued use of financial aid as a means to provide equal educational opportunity and to provide a diverse educational environment for all students. The Secretary also encourages the use by postsecondary institutions of other efforts to recruit and retain minority students, which are not affected by this policy guidance. This guidance is designed to promote these purposes in light of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), which states that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The Department has completed its review of this issue, taking into account the results of a recent study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and public comments submitted in response to the proposed policy guidance. The Secretary has determined that the proposed policy guidance interpreted the requirements of Title VI too narrowly in light of existing regulations and case law. While Title VI requires that strong justifications exist before race or national origin is used as a basis for awarding financial aid, many of the rationales for existing race-based financial aid programs described by commenters appear to meet this standard.
