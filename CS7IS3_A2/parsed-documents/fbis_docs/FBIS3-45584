It was the first meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee since its activities were suspended in 1988. A joint statement was issued at the end of the meeting. According to Chinese officials who took part in the meeting, the successful convocation of the meeting was of positive significance in narrowing the differences in economic cooperation between the two countries, opening up broad prospects for economic cooperation, and improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations. The Joint Economic Committee was established on the agreement between Deng Xiaoping and then U.S. President Carter during Deng's visit to the United States in January 1979. The committee, as a center of Sino-U.S. economic exchange and cooperation, aims to coordinate and supervise the orderly development of economic relations between the two countries. It convened seven sessions from 1980 to 1987. The resumed session today was convened upon the proposal of the U.S. side. Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and the head of U.S. delegation and Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen cochaired the meeting. After reviewing the Sino-U.S. relations in economic cooperation, Liu Zhongli said: China and the United States share broad mutual interests. The two countries are strongly supplementary to each other in economy, trade, and many other fields. The potential is great and the prospects are broad for developing mutually beneficial cooperation. Bentsen said: The United States welcomed the progress China has achieved in its market-oriented economic reforms. An open and vigorous Chinese economy will not only promote the prosperity and stability of Asia, but provide important opportunities for American businesses and help create jobs for Americans as well. The two sides exchanged views on such issues as China's reentry into GATT, the MFN issue, and the implementation of the three memorandums of understanding with regard to intellectual property rights, prison products, and market access, as well as the issue of multilateral development organizations. During the session, delegates of both sides delivered speeches on special topics such as finance and taxation, banking, foreign trade, and external investment. The speakers on the Chinese side included Liu Jibin, vice finance minister; Chen Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China; and Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. During the session, the two sides also agreed that the ninth session of the joint economic committee would be held next year in Washington D.C.
