FBIS3-28308 "dreas025__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-025-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Coalition Officials Criticize Hosokawa Tax Plan OW0502021394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0502021394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Reactions against and criticism of the "Ichi-Ichi duo" -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito [Clean Government Party] General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa -- quickly poured out of the ruling coalition parties on 3 February. The duo is known to have collaborated with the Finance Ministry in pushing for the raising of the [current consumption] tax. After the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] announced its objection to the tax increase, saying it is even willing to quit the coalition government, voices urging a "holding off" [on the tax increase] were raised by the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan New Party [JNP] alliance, which is the prime minister's own camp; and even the ruling party's two powerhouses -- Shinseito and Komeito. They complained that "the issue of raising taxes, about which the voters are most sensitive, has been handled too thoughtlessly," but their complaint may be said to be an eruption of discontent about Ozawa and Ichikawa's practice of holding "consultations behind closed doors." It is probable that this sentiment will have a delicate impact on future discussions concerning the reorganization of the [Japanese] political world. On that day, the SDPJ was high-spiritedly ready to "fight it out," with one senior party official declaring, "Ozawa and Ichikawa are making light of the people." One Diet member of the party spat out: "We have been made a fool of so often in the past. This time we will fight back tooth and nail." The SDPJ has had to make concessions to keep the coalition in power -- first on the question of the partial opening of the rice market and then on political reform issues. It can be said that their resentment, which has accumulated, is erupting altogether. Even a right-wing member of the party said emphatically: "Maybe they forced it on us, thinking that we will leave the coalition. If so, we can get together with Sakigake and the DSP." At an informal meeting of the two houses' members of the Sakigake-JNP alliance, [Sakigake] General Secretary Hiroyuki Sonoda had a difficult time explaining what had happened and claimed, "It was impossible for me alone to present an objection at the meeting of the representatives." But those present at the meeting complained bitterly, saying: "The masters of the government we formed are supposed to be the people. How will you explain this to the people?" or "Do you want to cheat the people in order to shake hands with the Liberal Democratic Party?" Within the DSP, General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa, who had earlier agreed together with people like Ozawa at the ruling party representatives' meeting to the proposal on raising the tax, has reversed his position completely and asked the prime minister by telephone to reconsider the matter, after party Chairman Keigo Ouchi (health and welfare minister) and Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, voiced their complaints about the increase. In Komeito, which normally is proud of its unity, there were voices of complaint heard in a general meeting held on 2 February. One said, "The party had said it would agree with the views of Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura in going ahead with tax cuts without tying this to increasing the tax. Why was the tax increase included in the bill?" Another said, "Is it all right not to hold formal discussions on the problem of the unfair tax system?" With General Secretary Ichikawa being absent from the event so that he could participate in a party representatives' meeting, Komeito members' criticisms and doubts were conspicuous. Party Diet members whispered to each other, "This is a reckless run by the Ichi-Ichi duo while riding on the back of the Finance Ministry's horse." Even in Shinseito, which entrusted Ozawa with decisionmaking on the previous day, voices saying "We should uphold the coalition by presenting some kind of concession to the SDPJ" were heard one after another at the party staff meeting around noon. Now that there are emerging moves even within these two parties -- Shinseito and Komeito -- to reconsider the concept of handling the tax cuts and the tax increase in a package, it has become very clear that objections to the bill within the ruling camp are quite strong.
