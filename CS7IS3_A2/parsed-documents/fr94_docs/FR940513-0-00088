The last listed rate is assumed to be in effect after the last listed anniversary date.

Appendix B to Part 2676_Interest Rates Used to Value Lump Sums and Annuities Lump Sum Valuations In determining the value of interest factors of the form V 0 : n (as defined in §2676.13 (b) (1)) for purposes of applying the formulas set forth in §2677.13(b) through (i) and in determining the value of any interest factor used in valuing benefits under this subpart to be paid as lump sums, the PBGC shall use the values of i t prescribed in Table I hereof. The interest rates set forth in Table I shall be used by the PBGC to calculate benefits payable as lump sum benefits as follows: (1) For benefits for which the participant or beneficiary is entitled to be in pay status on the valuation date, the immediate annuity rate shall apply. (2) For benefits for which the deferral period is y years ( y is an integer and 0 < y > n 1 ), interest rate i 1 shall apply from the valuation date for a period of y years; thereafter the immediate annuity rate shall apply. (3) For benefits for which the deferral period is y years ( y is an integer and n 1 < y > n 1 + n 2 ), interest rate i 2 shall apply from the valuation date for a period of y ^ n 1 years, interest rate i 1 shall apply for the following n 1 years; thereafter the immediate annuity rate shall apply. (4) For benefits for which the deferral period is y years ( y is an integer and y > n 1 n 4 ), interest rate i 3 shall apply from the valuation date for a period of y ^ n 1 ^ n 4 years, interest rate i 2 shall apply for the following n 2 years, interest rate i 1 shall apply for the following n 1 years; thereafter the immediate annuity rate shall apply.
