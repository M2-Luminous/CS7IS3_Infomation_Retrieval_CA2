FR941019-0-00022 FR941019-0-00004 (18) Consistent with existing RTC policy, a new subsection 1609.9(b) has been added which provides that, with respect to eligible multifamily property, the RTC will offer such property, initially, for direct sale exclusively to public agencies and nonprofit organizations for a period of 45 days. If the RTC receives no notice of serious interest, the property will be marketed pursuant to section 1609.7. Other stylistic changes to the regulations have also been made. Because of the length of the interim final rule and the number of changes from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule, this interim final rule is published in its entirety. Administrative Procedure Act The RTC is adopting this regulation as an interim final regulation. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register , without the usual notice-and-comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause''. The RTC believes that good cause exists because the amendments made to the affordable housing provisions of FIRREA by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act took effect immediately upon their enactment. Moreover, immediate clarification of existing policies is necessary in order to avoid undue delays in the disposition of affordable housing properties. By implementing these changes immediately, the RTC is complying with the mandate from Congress to dispose of single family, multifamily and condominium properties expeditiously and to the benefit of low and moderate income households. The immediate effective date of the regulation is also desirable in order to avoid public confusion regarding the RTC's policies and procedures in this area. Such confusion could impede the sales of affordable housing properties and result in deterioration of existing inventory and increased holding costs associated with these properties. Such costs ultimately would be borne by the taxpayer. For these reasons, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting an interim final rule outweigh any harm from the delay in seeking public comment. The RTC solicits comments and will consider those comments in the adoption of the rule as final, which will take place within 90 days after the close of the public period. Regulatory Flexibility Act As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis is hereby provided: 1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim final regulations. These elements have been discussed elsewhere in the preamble. 2. Impact of the interim final regulations on small businesses: This interim final rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RTC expects, rather, that the interim final regulation will result in a benefit to small business entities whose service will be utilized in fulfilling the mandates of the legislation. 3. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules which overlap, duplicate, or conflict with the interim final regulations.
