Yevgeniy Saburov told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the meeting, held on Tuesday, focused on "general aspects of the relations between Ukraine and Crimea." At the same time, "a fairly concrete matter was (also) given consideration, the beginning of economic reform in Crimea." "Since that matter doesn't contradict the law on the sharing of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, there couldn't have been much friction," Saburov said. Asked whether the relationship between Ukraine and its autonomous republic could be based on a treaty, he said, "this would eliminate the problem of (Crimea's) secession (from Ukraine)." As for the possibility of using the Russian ruble in Crimea, Saburov said, "cash rubles are in circulation in Crimea anyway, as they are in Kiev, for that matter." He said the Crimean government planned to shortly open ruble bank accounts for the autonomous republic's enterprises. "As for the idea that Russian Central Bank rubles could be poured into the economy of Crimea, who will give them to us?" Saburov said. He said granting him Ukrainian citizenship was "under consideration." Saburov, who is a Russian citizen but needs Ukrainian citizenship to carry out his duties as deputy premier, said he favored dual citizenship for Crimea's population.
