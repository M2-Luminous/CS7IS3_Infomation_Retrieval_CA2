FR940127-1-00089 FR940127-1-00019 (1) Cases in tribal court . The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in tribal court will be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, unless Federal law prescribes a different rule. Where tribal law does not supply a measure of damages, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed, unless Federal law prescribes a different measure. (2) Cases in Federal court . The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in Federal court will be that prescribed by Federal law. In the absence of applicable Federal law, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed and by the law of the state in which it was committed. (3) Civil penalties for trespass include: (i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority, willfully injures, severs, or carries off from Indian land any tree, timber, or shrub. Proof of Indian ownership of the premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser are prima facie evidence that the acts were committed willfully, intentionally, and without requisite consent. Treble damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued product obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass. (ii) Double damages, whenever a trespasser can prove that the trespass act was casual or involuntary, or that the trespasser had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own or that of the person in whose service or by whose direction the act was done. Double damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued product obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass. (iii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land including, but not limited to, rehabilitation, reforestation, lost future revenue, loss of productivity, and damage to other forest resources. (iv) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with detection and including all processes through the prosecution and collection of the settlement, such as field examination and survey, damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness expenses, demand letters, court costs, and attorney fees. (b) Payment of civil penalties may involve collection of cash, forfeiture of real and personal property, and garnishment. Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment or other goods or forest products damaged or taken in the trespass, shall be applied to civil penalties and other expenses incurred by the enforcement agency and the beneficial owner(s) damaged by the trespass. After disposition of real and personal property to pay civil liability penalties and enforcement costs of the trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the event that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the trespasser result in less than full recovery of civil penalties, penalty damages collected will be equitably distributed among beneficial owners based on the estimate of damages for the trespass. (c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or are involved in trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which such owners have a partial interest, shall not receive damages collected as a civil penalty in consequence of the trespass. (d) Civil penalties collected under ยง163.29(a) shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of forest products from the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred. (e) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass, the agency superintendent or such other representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the reservation may prohibit the removal of such forest products from Indian land or have such forest products seized for safekeeping and use as evidence of trespass. When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass and that such products have been removed to land not under government supervision, the representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the reservation shall immediately notify the owner of the land or the party in possession of the trespass products that such products could be Indian trust property involved in a trespass and that no action to remove or otherwise dispose of such products may be taken unless authorized by the Secretary. The representative of the Secretary shall cause Indian forest products that can be positively identified to be sold where practicable to recover their value for the beneficial Indian owners prior to deterioration. (f) Whenever an individual authorized to enforce against trespass activity has probable cause to believe that trespass activity has occurred, such individual may seize and take possession of the products and/or equipment involved in the trespass activity. All equipment seized shall be kept in the custody of the enforcement agency for use as evidence unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The representative of the Secretary simultaneously with any seizure shall give written notice of the seizure to the party in possession of the products and/or equipment involved in the apparent trespass activity. Such notice shall include the statement that the seizure may be administratively appealed pursuant to part 2 of this Title.
