The ministers, who have their homes in Tripoli, are thus forced to remain in al- Kufrah. The decision to move the venue of the cabinet meetings came as a punishment from al-Qadhdhafi to the ministers after Prime Minister Abu-zayd Durdah submitted a memorandum of reforms that he prepared with 'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, who has secluded himself in his home after al-Qadhdhafi refused to discuss the memorandum with him.
