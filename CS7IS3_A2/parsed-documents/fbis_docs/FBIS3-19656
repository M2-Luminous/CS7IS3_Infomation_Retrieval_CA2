But the Moscovites themselves are also fighting against a strange phenomenon these days: There is not only the familiar ruble hyperinflation, but also soaring dollar prices. This means that there is much more money than goods, and that the Russian economic reform has only liberated one part of the market: demand, but not supply. Supply is still governed by the old monopolies, and even non-Marxists know that monopolies always lower output, not prices. Boris Yeltsin's fate will be decided in this field, and not even the most considerate Westerner can help him there, neither with money, nor with words. Only the Russians themselves can impose a functioning market economy on their country; but to do this they would need a "strong efficient state machinery, which no longer exists," says political scientist Andrej Kortunov. But: (Mainly self-made) obstacles are also piling up for Yeltsin in his relations with the West: Russian interests are meanwhile being defined more comprehensive, "the tone has become harsher," says Vladimir Lukov, an adviser to Foreign Minister Kozyrev. What are the Russian interests? This question was dealt with at a symposium held in Moscow by the Friedrich-Naumann and the Konrad-Adenauer Foundations. The deputy minister for federal affairs said that the Russians have never learned how to conduct realpolitik; like the Germans, they have a rather "metaphysical" approach. For him, the definition is quite simple: economic solutions. He wants fair export prices for fuel and gas and a continuing presence in the arms markets: "Messianism and expansion are over." Even in the Balkans, Russia is "conservative," what counts there is the "balance of power." Kozyrev adviser Kusnetsov said much the same thing: The old imperialism is out; he is not interested in Pan-Slavism and state interests, but in the "rights and interests of the citizens." This is the real revolution that has happened since 1991. If only it were as simple as that. Igor Artjonov, head of the National Patriotic Party, on the other hand said: "The Russian Federation is not the last stage. The future lies with an Eastern Slav Alliance with Belarus and Ukraine." "Reintegration of neighboring countries," has meanwhile become the magic formula; and even for Alexeiy Pushkov, deputy chief of the liberal Moscow News, this includes Kazakhstan beside Kiev and Minsk, and "nobody will be able to prevent Moscow from reintegrating them." The Russians simply cannot accept that their country is no longer a superpower. May the Baltic states remain outside? There, Kozyrev adviser Lukov says, the only issue is the protection of the Russian minority. Yet: "We are now taking a harder line with Estonia and Latvia." Sergei Rogov from the U.S. Institute found bitter, sarcastic words for the new policy: "The Kozyrevs are becoming more radical than the Zhirinovskiys, and what is behind this is not strategy but sheer opportunism." Yeltsin has spoiled the economic reform and lost the confidence placed in him. Now the only thing he wants is to remain in power, and to achieve this, Yeltsin would collaborate with anybody. At the moment, the army is his main support, which saved him during the coup. And now he has to prove to the generals that he "is not selling [Russia off] to the Zionist-Imperialist world conspiracy." This belief has just been proved: While Yeltsin is at the Black Sea, Defense Minister Grachev is standing in for him in Moscow. Yet, the biggest danger are not the ultrarightists, but "the Zhirinovskiy within Yeltsin." What the West can do? "Not much, except for massive investments in the private sector. Russia must be saved in Russia."
