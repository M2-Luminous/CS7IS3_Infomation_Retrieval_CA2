According to him, on the one hand, a negative impact on the development of events was made by the tough stand taken by the Kiev authorities toward the Crimea as a means of consolidating the polarized Ukrainian society on the eve of presidential elections. On the other, the Crimean leadership showed no particular inclination for compromises, being disposed to take decisions made by Kiev too nervously, said Payn. According to him, energetic measures designed to cool the situation should be taken by the Russian authorities urgently. Such steps should be addressed to both Simferopol and Kiev. "They must be not threats, but purely diplomatic measures -- statements and actions aimed at preventing the conflict from further aggravating," Payn said. He drew attention to the one-sided coverage of the developments in and around the Crimea by some Russian news media, in particular television, whose solidarity with the Crimean authorities might stimulate Simferopol's tough stand toward Kiev.
