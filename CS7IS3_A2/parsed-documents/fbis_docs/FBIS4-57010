Castro attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony in Pretoria yesterday. Early this morning, Castro visited Mandela at Mandela's official residence, where they talked behind closed doors. In remarks to the press yesterday, Castro said new possibilities for cooperation between the two countries are opening up, as the African National Congress assumes power. He added that because of the ties of friendship and affection that exist between the two countries, with no other country in the world are there such broad possibilities for cooperation as there are between South Africa and Cuba. After meeting with Mandela, Castro granted the South African Broadcasting Corporation, the local television network, an exclusive interview at the Arcadia Hotel, where he and all the members of his top-level delegation are staying. Regarding his first visit to South Africa, whose army fought Cuban troops in the struggle for the independence of Angola and Namibia, Castro said there are two South Africas and two moments in the history of South Africa. He said there was a moment of strong confrontations but that now there is a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.
