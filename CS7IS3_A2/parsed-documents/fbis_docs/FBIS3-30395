The fire, which broke out shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) at the plant's third reactor, was extinguished two hours later, the agency said. Power was maintained at minimal level throughout the incident, after initially dropping to 30 percent below minimum when the fire broke out, it added. The state of the third reactor had "stabilized" after the incident, which was classed as level 0 on the INES international scale, according to an expert from the state nuclear security office quoted by CTK. The plant, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the Austrian border in Moravia, has four 440 megawatt ex-Soviet-built VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor] reactors. The incident came a day after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus confirmed his country's decision to press ahead with building a nuclear power plant at Temelin in southern Bohemia -- a project which has been heavily criticized by Austria, which fears radioactive fallout from possible accidents. The Temelin plant, to be completed in two or three years at a site only 40 kilometres from the Austrian border, will have two 1,000 megawatt ex-Soviet-type VVER reactors. Austria, which has banned nuclear facilities on its territory, has asked Prague to build a gas-based plant instead. Klaus said his government's decision was "final" and that Austria "should recognize the sovereignty of the Czech Republic." Responding to Klaus's remarks later Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Vienna would continue its efforts to block construction of the plant. A nuclear accident "would not only be a risk for the sovereign Czech Republic, but also for the neighbouring populations," Vranitzky said, adding that the April 1986 accident at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant "was not limited to sovereign contamination." Austrian efforts to block the project were undermined last Thursday when the American EXIM-Bank decided to guarantee a loan needed to complete the Temelin project. Citi-Bank was authorized to grant a 317 million dollar loan to the plant's builder, Westinghouse.
