No fatalities were reported, but severe damage was caused, police have stated. The first bomb exploded in front of a bank office in the center of the city. After the explosion, a fire broke out but was rapidly contained. A second bomb exploded minutes later at the gate of the English Language Academy, which sustained severe damage. According to police, these are new extremist actions perpetrated by movements that oppose the presence of U.S. soldiers in several parts of Colombia, where they have built bases for the Colombian Government to combat drug trafficking. Two weeks ago terrorists detonated bombs against a Mormon church that was operated by U.S. citizens in the western part of Medellin. They also attacked other U.S. interests in this city, which is located in the northwestern part of Colombia. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish at 1200 GMT on 3 February, during its "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast, adds: "Authorities have blamed guerrillas for the explosion of two bombs in the city of Medellin.")
