We are still studying the Russian initiative," PDRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said today in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS. The minister was reluctant to make further comments. He said that he will speak about this question in more detail at a news conference that will take place in Kiev tomorrow afternoon. As is known, Russia had recently come forward with an initiative for solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula by convening an international conference to be attended by the two Korean states, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
