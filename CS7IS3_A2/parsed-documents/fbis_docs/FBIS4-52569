FBIS4-52569 "dreas091_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 North Korea South Unification Minister's Remarks Criticized South Unification Minister's Remarks Criticized SK1105052294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0454 GMT 11 May 94 SK1105052294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Confrontational Agitation Reversing Black and White" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean "unification minister" at the "coordinating meeting on the reunification and security policy" driveled that "sanctions on the North are inevitable" and "the international cooperation system" must be intensified "to increase the pressure," alleging that the North "is delaying" a solution to the "nuclear issue" by refusing to accept the demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Denouncing this as an outrageous and disgusting hokum, an analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: As regards the replacement of the fuel rod at our atomic power station, we voluntarily informed the IAEA of this plan and allowed the inspectors of the agency to observe the process of the replacement and verify that the nuclear materials are not diverted to a non-peaceful purpose. This notwithstanding, the South Korean puppets are again crying for "sanctions" and "international cooperation system" with preposterous arguments. This is an unpardonable treacherous act motivated by the sinister intention to block a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and harm and stifle fellow countrymen over the "nuclear issue". When they linked the North's proposal of negotiations for establishing a new peace arrangement in place of the present armistice body with the "nuclear issue", they sought to obstruct the negotiations between the DPRK and the United States for the guarantee of peace. The reckless remarks of the "unification minister" clearly show once again how frantically the South Korean puppets are trying to harm and stifle the North over the "nuclear issue". Those who commit treacheries must be removed from the nation.
