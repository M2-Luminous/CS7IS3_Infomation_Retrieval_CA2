"We note that there has been no progress in discussions between the United States and North Korea concerning a resumption of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and we think the issue of sanctions should be taken up before the Security Council," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. Pyongyang, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, has been refusing to allow IAEA inspections of two key nuclear sites since last February, despite repeated international pressure. [passage omitted] Although North Korean negotiators agreed last month in principle to allow the inspections, no accord has been reached on the terms of how the inspections will be carried out.
