A tree trunk lying on the ground near the Borel hillside marks the point beyond which no one can enter. This is how a physical assault on the city--i.e., its division into two parts, one of them controlled by criminals--is sanctioned. For some time now, the Red Command has been establishing outposts in the forest reserves. After clearing trees from different areas, the bandits can control the entrances to the shantytowns [favelas] by installing observation posts in the trees. The clearings also serve as miniature concentration camps where enemies can be tortured and executed. A few months ago, the police broke up an encampment in Tijuca Forest where traffickers from the Andarai, Divineia, and Casa Branca hills used to meet to outline plans for distributing drugs. But when the police leave, the traffickers return. By demarcating autonomous territories, preferably inside the favelas, and setting parameters for behavior, the outlaws have challenged this society directly. The authorities must not continue to stand idly by while shantytowns spread out in all directions and the traffickers and numbers-game tycoons set up shop there, creating parallel societies that are out of control. In the no-mans-land of a favela, the rights of other citizens who pay taxes and submit to social and economic rules are being violated. With the dizzying growth of the favelas, everything escapes the control of the authorities--from melees in broad daylight to the nightly "funk" [preceding word in English] dances, interspersed with the bloodbaths of gang warfare. The Red Command and its explosive offspring, the Third Command, can exist and prosper only with the collusion of the police, who allow themselves to be corrupted and even blend in with them on their extermination missions. The gangs live outside the law because the law exists not to be enforced. Day after day, the outlaws advance in a sort of organized looting of the wealth of the State astride the favelas, under the eyes of compliant policemen. A survey done by IPLAN [Planning Institute] in 1991 listed 545 favelas in Rio, but now there are many more, because IPLAN's criteria excluded the minifavelas (not that "mini" after all) under the overpasses and the illegal and clandestine housing developments. There are also favelas that are extensions of others but have grown so big that their communities have started organizing themselves separately. Favelas have existed in Rio for 101 years, but this does not mean they have to be considered as inevitable and eternal. Now they house the underground third of the city's population. They began modestly when the soldiers who had fought at Canudos came to the capital city to ask for government help and camped on Providencia Hill near the military headquarters. As promises remained unkept, the soldiers started building shacks. The hill came to be called "Favela Hill" (later changed to Providencia) because the hills that surrounded Canudos had been covered with a typically northeastern plant known as "favela." A century later, the scenario is much worse. With hegemony between the Red Command and the Third Command at stake, the radius of criminal activities has expanded in the direction of new paiois [strongholds]. The narcotics traffic has now taken over Niteroi, Sao Goncalo, and a large part of the Western Zone, besides the hills and smaller housing projects downtown, in the South and North Zones, and particularly in the wooded areas where the military-style camps that shocked the environment minister are set up. Even the smaller hillsides have at least 15 AR-15 rifles apiece, not to mention 12-caliber shotguns, automatic pistols, and grenades. Most of the weapons in the hands of the traffickers arrive by sea. More than two-thirds of the ships that bring weapons to Rio fly the Liberian flag. Guns manufactured in different countries arrive via Africa, while drugs move in the opposite direction. The Red Command controls 80 percent of the narcotics traffic in Rio, but the Third Command, although it has only the other 20 percent, controls strategic hillsides that are coveted by the Red Command. The shootouts, killings, and corruption--all this characterizes an intolerable situation. The violence is insupportable, society cannot withstand such a deterioration in its standards of respectability, but what is worse is the lenience exhibited by the authorities while traffickers based in the favelas continue to reap profits of $100 million every year with impunity--a sum they split fraternally with the rotten portions of the police force and the political structure.
