According to Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), unions are found in less than ten percent of the 47,000 foreign-funded enterprises already operational, which employ about six million Chinese. "ACFTU is accelerating its work to get them organized in unions in view of the growing number of labor disputes in foreign-funded enterprises; for now we are concentrating on the places where foreign-funded enterprises are concentrated," Yang said. In about one year or two, Yang explained, unions should have been established in foreign-funded enterprises all over China. "From now on," he continued, "talks on union affairs must proceed hand-in-hand with negotiations on any project involving foreign investors, and the union should be in operation not later than one year after a project starts operating." Yang specified the union task in a foreign-funded enterprises as one of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the employees while co-operating with the investor in the development of the enterprise. "There are good examples of investors respecting staff rights and interests and supporting unions in their work," he said. "This invariably results in higher staff morale and better profits for the investors." What Yang called "good examples" are mostly furnished by large- or medium-sized enterprises which follow international standards in management and respect China's labor laws. But problems are "serious" in many others, especially in smaller, labor-intensive enterprises. "Foreign employers often force workers to work overtime, pay no heed to labor safety regulations and deliberately find fault with the workers as an excuse to cut their wages or fine them, in violation of China's laws and regulations," he said. "This only does harm to China's efforts to attract foreign investment, and eventually to the interests of investors," he added. Under China's Constitution and laws on foreign investment, he said, "Chinese employees have the right to protect their own legitimate rights and interests and seek help from ACFTU in establishing unions." ACFTU and its local organizations, for their part, "have the right to help Chinese workers get organized." ACTFU is now busy working on a set of regulations concerning union work in foreign-funded enterprises. In June it will call a meeting to boost the work of organizing unions in such enterprises. Meanwhile, ACFTU is "doing its best" to promote the publication, as early as possible, of a labor law, a law on social security and a law on labor protection. Before that, he said, governments should publish regulations on minimum wages, social security and other matters vital to workers' rights and interests. "Improved legislation is important to all parties: Governments should abide by the law in exercising control over foreign-funded enterprises, foreign investors in handling their day-to-day management and employees in protecting their own rights and interests," the union leader conceded.
