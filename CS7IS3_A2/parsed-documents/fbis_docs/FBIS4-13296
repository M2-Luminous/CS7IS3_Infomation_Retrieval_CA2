How do you intend to keep this promise? [Bhutto] This is our biggest problem. When I assumed office, the economy was in a desolate state. The budget deficit was high, the public sector inflated, the social sector neglected, and the infrastructure underdeveloped. The top priority is to stimulate the economy. From July to December we reduced the trade deficit by $260 million, foreign investment increased by 54 percent, and our foreign currency reserves rose from $200 million to $1.2 billion. [Neujahr] How do your ambitious plans fit in with a defense budget that swallows up 50 percent of the overall budget? [Bhutto] I would like to make one thing clear: Pakistan has never put 50 percent of its budget into defense. We have always spent between 25 and 27 percent on defense. Over recent years the expenditure has even declined a little, in contrast to the rising defense budget in India. It is our top priority to improve the people's economic situation. [Neujahr] Your relationship with neighboring India continues to be tense. Talks to settle the conflict over Kashmir have not yet brought a solution. [Bhutto] First of all, India must reduce its policy of oppression in the Indian part of Kashmir so as to create a favorable climate for the negotiations. If we do not make progress in bilateral negotiations then, both countries should consider other ways and mediation by a third party. [Neujahr] When the Kashmir conflict escalated in 1990, U.S. President Bush was narrowly able to prevent nuclear war between India and Pakistan. Does Pakistan want to establish itself as a nuclear power? [Bhutto] We do not want to become a nuclear state. We are against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they endanger peace and security. Our nuclear program must be viewed from the proper perspective. The use of nuclear energy and the peaceful use of nuclear science are important for our economic development. We want to use the power of the atom only peacefully and not build any weapons. [Neujahr] Will you sign the Nonproliferation Treaty? [Bhutto] We are willing to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty together with India. We can accept the safety checks by the IEA (International Energy Agency) in all nuclear facilities in Pakistan and India. However, we do not accept any conditions that apply only to Pakistan and leave out India, which has just been testing nuclear weapons. [Neujahr] In 1990 you were driven from office with insults and outrage. You were accused of corruption and of abuse of office. Have these accusations been clarified? [Bhutto] At that time more than a dozen accusations were made against my husband and myself and these were dealt with by summary courts. No court found any proof of the accusations. Almost all the accusations have been thrown out. [Neujahr] How fragile is your multiparty coalition? [Bhutto] There are no problems, neither rifts nor trenches. [Neujahr] What kind of influence have the fundamentalist Islamic parties? [Bhutto] The term "fundamentalist" comes from the West and is linked with other associations there. Islam teaches tolerance and peaceful coexistence with other religions. We have had religious parties since 1947 but they are of little importance in the National Assembly. At the elections in 1993 the Islamic Front, which consists of Jamaat-e-Islami and other religious parties, won only three out of 200 seats. The people in Pakistan do not want to entrust these groups with any political power.
