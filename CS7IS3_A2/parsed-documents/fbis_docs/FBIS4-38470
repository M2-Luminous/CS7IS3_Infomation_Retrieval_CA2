On the whole yesterday's situation repeated. Valentin Martemiyanov, deputy from the faction of Communists, again proposed to consider "the president's anti-constitutional decrees". This time more deputies than yesterday voted for his proposal but still the number of votes was not enough to include this issue in the agenda of a plenary meeting of the session. Representatives of the parliamentary lobby believe that the opposition will continue attempts to impede the implementation of Boris Yeltsin's decrees.
