From the point of view of the talks this was a significant day. He met the highest representatives of this enormous state. Our correspondent Michal Michalcik telephoned from Beijing: [Begin recording] [Michalcik] [passage omitted] The most important result is that both sides are interested in broadening and deepening mutual cooperation in power engineering, transport, telecommunications, and chemical and engineering industries. The agreement on trade and economic cooperation was signed at 1115 [local time]. Premier Vladimir Meciar said on this occasion: [Meciar] This agreement creates a new legal basis. [Michalcik] Does this mean that in comparison--for example, with Japan, Asian countries, or advanced West European countries--we have a chance to enter the Chinese market? [Meciar] Let the figures speak for themselves. The turnover of the Slovak Republic for last year was $37 million, while the turnover of the Czech Republic was $370 million. So there is a markedly undervalued potential we can develop in the future and [words indistinct] where we can be successful. [Michalcik] Regarding the agreement, within the framework of bilateral relations with China we signed the following documents: an agreement on prevention of double taxation, an agreement on support and protection of investments, and an agreement on technical and economic cooperation.
