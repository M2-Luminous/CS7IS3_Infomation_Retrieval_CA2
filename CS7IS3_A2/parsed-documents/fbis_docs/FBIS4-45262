This followed the publication of the U.S. decision by the THE WASHINGTON POST on 29 May. According to EL TIEMPO, government spokespersons referred to Washington's decision as "inconsiderate, untimely, unilateral, and rude." THE WASHINGTON POST said that the Pentagon ordered the suspension of the operation of four radars used in the fight against drug trafficking, which are located in Colombia and Peru. In Colombia, the radars are located in Araracuara and Leticia, in the southeastern Department of Amazonas. According to EL TIEMPO, since 1 May, the U.S. soldiers who operate the radars stopped briefing the Colombian Air Force on the flights detected. EL TIEMPO adds that the U.S. Government has not officially notified its Colombian counterpart of its decision. The Colombian Government asked Washington for an explanation 28 days ago, but thus far, it has not received a reply, EL TIEMPO discloses. The newspaper also reveals that a government spokesperson stated that "it is obvious that if the radars are not working, it makes no sense to keep them and the technicians on Colombian territory."
