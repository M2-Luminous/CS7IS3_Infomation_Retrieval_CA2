During a news conference on the occasion of presenting his credentials to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Cuban diplomat said that his mission is to make known and to earn respect for the situation in his fatherland through a ready dialogue with the local authorities. Commenting on his meeting with the Italian president, Rodriguez said that he was pleasantly impressed by the attention Scalfaro pays to and the knowledge he has of Cuba and Latin America. In explaining the absence of conflicts in bilateral relations between the two countries, the ambassador said that annually Cuba receives 70,000 tourists from Italy, the island's fourth most important source of tourists, after Canada, Mexico, and Spain. Regarding investments, Rodriguez explained that one of every 10 Cubans is either a technician or a professional, something that represents a guarantee to any nation, and that investors have legal guarantees that they can export their profits. Cuba is heading for an economy capable of allowing the island to see through a political project that has been obstructed for 35 years by a relentless U.S. economic blockade. It is absurd to see, he said, how at the end of the century and after the occurrence of many international changes that produced political, geopolitical, and economic mutations, the embargo not only is being maintained, it is also being encouraged. Until his designation as ambassador to Italy, Mario Rodriguez was vice minister of foreign relations and before that, from 1986 to 1990, he headed the Cuban diplomatic mission in Prague.
