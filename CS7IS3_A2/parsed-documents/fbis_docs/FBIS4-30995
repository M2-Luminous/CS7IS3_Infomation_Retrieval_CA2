The topic of the meetings was the latest developments in Albanian-Greek relations. Minister Serreqi said that as opposed to Albania's insistence on resuming dialogue there is an escalation of tension by the Greek party which does not hesitate to use unexisting causes for this purpose. Mr. Serreqi said there has been no arrest among the Greek minority, except the six persons made known in the communique of the Tirana Attorney's Office. No Albanian citizen of Greek or Albanian origin summoned as witness has been arrested, and as you know, the courts are independent and processes open and unbiased. The spread of false news as in the case of the socalled arrest of 31 persons from the minority and others like this, the minister said, intends to destroy the image of democracy in Albania, like in the case of the late Sh.M., who months ago died of heart attack, but in which case the Greek propaganda machinery managed to deceive the European Parliament, which described the case in a resolution as a person killed by the Albanian police. Regarding Greece's blocking the European Union's economic assistance for the balance of payments, the Albanian Government says that this is a real cause to block reforms in Albania and destabilize the country. It also intends to lead Albania away from its course of integration into Europe. But, Mr. Serreqi said, this will meet with failure. This action also shows the wish to penalize the regional policy of Albania which serves peace and stability in the region. Under these conditions, Albania asks the European Union member countries not to allow compromise with the course of reforms and not be reconciled to the aid freeze. Also, Albania emphasises that it is open and ready to cooperate with the European Union and the Security Council to overcome a tense situation between the two countries. Minister Serreqi said that Albania has been the first to ask for this assistance and continues to be open to it.
