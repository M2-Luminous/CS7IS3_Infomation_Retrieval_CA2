I think there is only one sphere of life where such an accord may be attempted. It is an agreement for all political forces--first and foremost communists, patriots, and Zhirinovskiy followers--to give up the class struggle and violent methods. That the president expressed a wish to consolidate society is wonderful. But realization of this idea requires systematic meetings with trade unions, including those in opposition; political parties; culture figures; and representatives of different religious confessions--not just the patriarch. Without a continuous dialogue, it will all end up as a purely propagandistic action. I think that the practical result could resemble that in Spain, provided we were already in a state of getting out of the crisis... [Rabotnova] But in Spain the victors forgave the defeated. What about here? [Yakunin] We, the president's supporters, criticize him bitterly and tell the truth in that he has not implemented deep-reaching reforms, has not pushed through a law on vetting, and that for all practical purposes the current winners in our country are the army of bureaucrats. They will try to stay in power at any price, solidify it. And this is probably the greatest danger for democracy today.
