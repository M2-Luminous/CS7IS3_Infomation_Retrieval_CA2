Another two are being prepared, the MSZ told newsmen on Thursday. The programmes called "Wokulski," "Partners," "Transit," "Contact," "Market," and "Democracy" will be implemented and coordinated by a council for eastern policy, which is to be established soon. The "Wokulski" project will promote Polish exporters. "We want to provide equal opportunities to Polish and western investors backed up by investment insuring companies," MSZ official Jerzy Kowalczyk said. "Partners" will promote creating equity ties between Poland and its eastern neighbours. The project also provides for establishing a data bank of investment information and an assistance fund supporting Polish businessmen. Under the "Transit" programme, Poland will be able to use its geographical position by opening duty-free zones, providing banking services and acting as intermediary in business with the east. "Contact" has been designed to support contacts between people at all levels, including the signing of visa-free traffic, readmission, border crossing development, the youth exchange and the promotion of polish culture in the east. Some of the projects have already been discussed by Polish and Russian foreign affairs ministers, Andrzej Olechowski and Andrey Kozyrev and according to Jakub Wolasiewicz, director of the Ministry's Europa II Department, "ninety per cent of the proposals have been accepted" by Kozyrev.
