The news analyst says: Bus union members in six cities under the Federation of Auto Workers Unions of South Korea have courageously risen up in struggle in the current spring season of wage negotiation. Their demand for vital rights including wage hike is a devand for the payment for their work and a demand for the rights and conditions for a life worthy of human beings. It is the minimum demand they have raised on the last line of retreat. Refusing to meet this demand is tantamount to forcing the workers to die. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is threatening a "strong countermeasure," branding the workers' struggle for vital rights as "collective selfishness." The harsher the fascist clique's suppression, the closer the ranks of the South Korean workers and the fiercer their fight for the vital rights and democracy.
