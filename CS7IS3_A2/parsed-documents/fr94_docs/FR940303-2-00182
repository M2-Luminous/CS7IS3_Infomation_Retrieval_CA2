FR940303-2-00182 FR940303-2-00093 Section IV: Use of Advanced Technology This section fulfills the statutory requirement of Title III of the Department of Energy Act (15 U.S.C. 2704 et seq. ) which directs the Secretary of Transportation to submit an annual report to Congress on the use of advanced technologies by the automotive industry to improve motor vehicle fuel economy. This report focuses on the introduction of new models, the application of materials to save weight, and the advances in electronic technology which improved fuel economy in MY 1993. A. New Models I. Passenger Cars a. Domestic. The domestic manufacturers introduced and replaced several cars, as well as updated several previous passenger cars. Chrysler unveiled its new midsize LH models_the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision. These models are built on the new front-drive LH platform, the company's first new platform in 10 years. The main features included advanced technology, roomy interior, ride comfort, handling precision, safety, fuel economy, and power. The LH models' longitudinally mounted engines include a 153 horsepower (hp) overhead-valve (OHV) 3.3 liter (1) V&hyph;6 and a 214 hp single-overhead-cam (SOHC) 3.5L 24-valve V&hyph;6 (standard on some models, optional on others) developed especially for the LH line. Both engines are mated to only one transaxle: the 42LE automatic, a fully adaptive electronically controlled four-speed with torque converter lockup clutch. The low drag coefficient (0.31 C D ) of these models contributed to their fuel efficiency which averaged 24 mpg for MY 1993. Also new to the Chrysler Eagle Talon, is a smaller 1.8L I&hyph;4 engine offered with either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission and delivering an average fuel economy of 27 mpg. The Plymouth Division offered a redesigned Colt coupe and sedan and Vista wagon with a new 1.8L 16 valve SOHC engine that produces 113 hp and a 2.4L 16 valve SOHC engine on the Vista only that produces 136 hp. The average fuel economy on the Colt's 1.5L 4-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual transmission increased by 3 mpg city and 5 mpg highway over its MY 1992 counterpart. Ford has two new models_the Lincoln Mark VIII sport luxury coupe and the Mercury Villager minivan (the latter is discussed later with the light trucks). The Mark VIII features an aerodynamic design style powered by a new aluminum double-overhead-cam (DOHC) V&hyph;8 engine and a new Ford ``4R70W'' 4-speed automatic transmission. The ``4R70W'' stands for 4-speed, rear-drive, 700 pound-feet torque capacity and wide ratio. The transmission's electronic and hydraulic controls work together to provide smooth shifts and torque-converter lock-up in third and fourth gear. This reduces the converter slippage and improves the fuel economy. The average fuel economy on this model is nearly 24 mpg compared with 22.3 mpg for the predecessor Mark VII model. Ford redesigned the 2-door Probe for MY 1993 based on Mazda's latest MX&hyph;6. The Probe has a cab forward design and is powered by multivalve engines. The base model is equipped with a 115 hp 2L, 4-cylinder engine and the GT is powered by a 165 hp 2.5L V&hyph;6 engine. The average fuel economy on the 5-speed manual transmission has improved by 2 mpg over the MY 1992 model. The limited-edition Ford Mustang Cobra specialty model featured a 230 hp version of the Mustang's 5L V&hyph;8 engine, a 5-speed manual transmission, 17-inch aluminum wheels, a spoiler, and ground effects trim. The average fuel economy improved by 1 mpg on the 4-speed automatic transmission version over the MY 1992 counterpart. General Motors (GM) redesigned the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. These two sport coupes received smoother lines and a more gradual profile. The base engine for these models is a new 3.4L V&hyph;6 engine. Fuel economy improves by 1 mpg over the 1992 model.
