Since the first days of the creation of the Cameria Association, in its program we have supported the right for prosperity of the Greek minority in Albania, thinking that only in this way can the two minorities, the Greek minority and that of the Albanians of Cameria, as pillars of the same bridge of the Albanian-Greek friendship, be respected and enjoy the rights they deserve. But, unfortunately, until now we have observed no such sign of good will and humane clearness on the part of the representatives of the Greek minority in Albania. We want to remind the rebels and those following them that the "Cam question" is not a theoretic invention or a technique of Albanian political parties, as stated by the ominous letter of Omonoia's General Council, but an act practically realised by the blackest Greek chauvinism, which expelled us from our millenary hearths through genocide. "The Cam question" is one of the most unprecedented tragedies committed by those who today boast of "the most ancient democracy" in the world, and which Qirie [Mr.] Qirizati wants to bargain over. Also, on this occasion, we want to remind all those who consider our question as illegitimate that the martyred population of Cameria is determined on its way to finding a solution and winning the rights denied to it, not in the way pursued by the present chiefs of the Greek minority in Albania, but guided by the world human principles. Finally, we want to remind all those who see daydreams that Cameria, the land of our predecessors, is the South Epirus, inhabited by us since the ancient times.
