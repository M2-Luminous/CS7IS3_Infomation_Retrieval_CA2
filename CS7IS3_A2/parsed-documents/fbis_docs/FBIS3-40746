A reverse process is occurring there and the Arab majority is growing significantly. Numerous links were formed between the city and its environs in a series of known areas. Greater Jerusalem is a metropolis whose borders spread north to Ramallah, south to Gush Etziyon, east to Ma'ale Adumim, and west to Bet Shemesh. Many settlements in this area have in fact become Jerusalem neighborhoods. The jurisdictional area of Jerusalem, on the one hand, and the autonomy settlements between Israel and the PLO, which are supposed to also apply to the metropolitan area of the city, on the other hand, are creating an area of hundreds of thousands of dunams, which is, in fact, a gray area, not really Jerusalem, at least not according to the definition of jurisdictional borders, and not really the autonomy, at least not according to the reality on the ground. This gray area now requires an updated definition. There is no lack of functional solutions as such or other solutions that can apply to this region. It is possible to annex an additional area to the municipality of Jerusalem without annexing it to the State of Israel. This issue was previously examined and an opinion on the matter was submitted to the director general for Jerusalem affairs. The metropolitan area can also be included, or part of it, in the planning borders of the urban planning committee (without annexation). It is also possible to draft various models of joint functional administration in the metropolitan areas which will enable the continuation of Israel supervision of what goes on there. There has already been an Israeli interest in defining the metropolitan boundaries and its status in the future and, even more, the fixing of facts is clear, principally against the background of the Palestinian goal of accelerated building to the south, east, and north and the migration of Palestinians from the Hebron area to the periphery of Jerusalem. The Palestinians are not concealing their plans to build peripherally around the city in order to close Jerusalem in on three sides and return the city to the status of a city without an exit. Ramallah has already quickly expanded toward Jerusalem. In the eastern part of the city is a neighborhood continuum northward with the Old City to the south. And even Bethlehem and Bayt Jala are being connected to Jerusalem on the south. The relation of Jews to Arabs in the metropolitan area (including Jerusalem) is 50 percent-50 percent. The forecast for the year 2000 is 40 percent-60 percent with an Arab majority. The different orientations of the two sectors--the Arabs building mainly on the north-south axis and the Jews on the east-west axis--adds another dimension of competition on the ground. Against this reality, at least for the meantime, areas west of Jerusalem that have recently been annexed to the city must be granted, and emphasis must also be placed on development of the eastern side, and not only for political reasons. On the west, forest areas have been designated as large reserve lands for west Jerusalem. The urbanization of the western area will indeed damage the green health of the city and many agricultural areas in `Emeq Ha'arzim. It will be very expensive to build on these lands. Against the expense of building and the ecological damage, which would be caused on the east, is a desolate rocky area of land that is not suitable for anything except an urban settlement. The proof of this is that there are thousands of young couples and others seeking to live in Jerusalem neighborhoods who are finding Ma'ale Adumim a solution for cheap housing. Most of the area between Ma'ale Adumim and Pisgat Ze'ev is uninhabited, but if settled immediately becomes de facto annexation, not de jure, which is not now possible. Another area adjoining the city that is sought and has a sparce Arab populace is located to the north and west of the city in the area between Ramot and Giv'at Ze'ev. The urbanization of this area west toward Mivaseret and Sha'ar Hagay does not alter the fact that the central area around which Jerusalem has grown is the area of the Old City. Ma'ale Adumim is located only 5 km (by air) from the Old City. The new areas that have been annexed to the city on the west are much further. Rabin's government, which continues to populate metropolitan Jerusalem (Ma'ale Adumim, Efrat, Gush Etziyon, and Giv'at Ze'ev) needs to operate in coordination with the Jerusalem municipality in order to expand the city eastward. Both have a clear interest in separating the defined area as metropolitan Jerusalem from the area of the Palestinian self-administered territory, and the appropriate time for doing this is now.
