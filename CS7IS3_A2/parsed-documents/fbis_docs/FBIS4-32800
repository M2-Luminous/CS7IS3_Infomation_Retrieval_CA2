Both Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba suffered considerable damage in such areas as agriculture, housing, roads, communications, and electric power generation because of the excess water and mudslides. The latter were the result of torrential rains that lasted several days. According to reports by a special ministerial commission assigned by the government to promote the resumption of services and to assist the victims, Guantanamo has been the hardest-hit of the two provinces. In Guantanamo, the roads suffered considerable damage, with some 3,000 km of highways and roads affected. As for the installations that supply potable water to the population, several aqueducts were destroyed and another 12 are presenting problems. Over 100,000 people currently lack a regular water supply and this prompted, together with urgent efforts to reestablish it, the Health Ministry to decree a special epidemic prevention program and to increase the allowance of medicines and personal hygiene articles to people. As for Santiago de Cuba, the work focused mainly on facing flood-related losses in nearly 1,500 hectares of sugarcane plantations, and facilitating the resumption of the sugarcane harvest, already in its last phase. Efforts have also targeted thousands of hectares of vegetable crops, which were totally or partially flooded because of the heavy rains, hundreds of kilometers of roads destroyed, and nearly 5,000 houses wrecked.
