Kalezic: "A Jewel Among Guns"] [Text] For antiarmor combat at distances between 2,000 and 3,000 meters, according to the price/efficiency criterion and from the standpoint of operational use (the variety of the ammunition kit, high rate of fire, and low flight time of the projectile), the advantage of artillery pieces over guided antitank missiles is obvious and manifold. In view of the fact that there is a need in our armed forces for technical modernization of antiarmor artillery, during the 1980's they began research and development in the Military Engineering Institute on a unified program whereby two activities were effectively accomplished: a 100-mm towed antiarmor gun was developed and given the name TOPAZ. This weapon was designed to incorporate the internal ballistic solution of the T-12 100-mm gun, with elements used from the carriage of the Yugoslav D30-J 122-mm howitzer. A day-night system of fire control (SUV) was also developed for this gun; that system can also be used on the T-12 and MT-12 100-mm antiarmor guns. On the Carriage of the D30-J Howitzer In the procedure that preceded selection of the conception for development of the new cannon, the parameters which from the standpoint of waging antiarmor combat decisively influenced the decision to use the carriage of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer were the following: -- The D30-J howitzer has a three-leg carriage, which affords a circular horizontal field of operation. Even if the butt end of the barrel is over one of the legs of the carriage, firing is possible at elevations from -5 degrees to +18 degrees, which is quite acceptable for direct firing on armored targets. -- The device to combat recoil on the D30-J howitzer has been installed above the barrel. This configuration helps to increase the stability of the gun during firing, which is an important advantage in antiarmor cannon from the standpoint of precision, the rate of fire, and firing conditions. -- The mechanism for the traverse of the barrel on this gun is designed so that the barrel can be quickly and easily trained (by disconnecting one of the elements in the kinematic drive) and the sector of operation changed (with the strength of just one operator!). -- In the traveling position, the two movable legs on the D30-J mount are folded back and fixed to the stationary leg of the carriage. The barrel (which has first rotated 180 degrees) is also fixed to the stationary leg, and the entire gun is towed by the towing eye, which is fixed to the muzzle brake. This unusual, but very worthwhile, design makes the gun short in the traveling position (the TOPAZ is two meters shorter in the traveling position than the T-12 gun). -- The torsion-bar suspension system and 9.00x20 tires give the gun good cross-country ability on all types of roads and terrains and good maneuvering characteristics. A barrel has been designed for the new TOPAZ gun which has the interior ballistics of the T-12 100-mm towed gun, and it can use the same ammunition, which is a particular advantage from the logistics standpoint. The total weight of the TOPAZ 100-mm towed antiarmor gun so designed with the three-leg carriage is slightly greater than the weight of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer at 3,600 kg. The increased weight did not affect the towing characteristics and cross-country ability of the gun, but it did contribute to exceptional stability during firing under all conditions. Incorporation of a seat for the gunner on the gun's carriage has considerably improved the capability for sighting and tracking a moving target. The New Fire Control System In view of the fact that incorporating a fire control system considerably reduces the system's reaction time and increases the likelihood of a kill and effectiveness of operation against armored targets, a fire control system was designed for the TOPAZ gun which has laser range-finding to the target and electronic (digital) determination of the target's angular velocity. The firing elements on this fire control system are determined by a ballistic microcomputer, and fed optoelectronically to the sighting device by the projection of a bright dot in the gunner's field of vision. Weather and ballistic figures for adjustment of the firing elements are fed in manually. This system affords action at night and under conditions of poor visibility. The main components of the fire control system are the day-night sighting device with laser range-finding, the computer and electronic unit, sensors for the target's angular velocities in the traverse and elevation, batteries for power supply, and wiring. In preparing for operation, the gunner activates the program for self-diagnosis and thus checks in advance that the fire control system is in proper working order. After rectification (bringing the axis of the optical sight and the axis of the barrel into the prescribed spatial position), figures are fed in manually on air and gunpowder temperature, air pressure, components of wind velocity (lengthwise and lateral), the change in muzzle velocity because of barrel wear, and the angle of lean of the axis of the cradle shoulder. After the target has been spotted, the gunner trains the barrel onto the target with the levers of the mechanism for movement in the traverse and elevation. Data on the type of projectile chosen and the course of the target's movement are entered in the computer. Looking through the eyepiece, he brings the center of the engraved cross hairs onto the target point on the silhouette of the target and begins to track the target, at the same time activating the main program on the ballistic computer. During the tracking of the target, but after two to three seconds, reliable data are automatically obtained on its angular velocity. After that, the bright mark generated by the computer appears in the field of vision. It notifies the gunner to activate the laser to measure the range to the target. On the basis of that data, the computer determines the firing elements and projects in the field of vision a bright dot shifted by the magnitude of the table angle for elevation and the lead angle in the horizontal plane (the bright dot remains in that position three to five seconds). Adjustment of the barrel brings the bright dot to coincide with the sighting point on the silhouette of the target, and then the projectile is launched. If a projectile is not launched in the envisaged time, the bright spot is extinguished and the target tracking cycle is repeated to determine new firing elements. Significant Tactical Advantages The TOPAZ is a modern towed antiarmor artillery piece to fire on targets at an effective range up to 2,000 meters. It has high firepower, high precision, and a high rate of fire. The probability of hitting a moving target (at distances within the effective direct range) with the first round is higher than 70 percent. Reaction time of the system at the battery level is less than 15 seconds! It uses destructive, hollow-charge, and hard-core shells. It has complete ballistic compatibility with the T-12 and MT-12 100-mm guns. Thanks to the low height of the firing line and the tripod mount (which affords a circular traverse field of operation), the TOPAZ has significant tactical advantages in combat operations of antiarmor defense. The compact consideration in the traveling position and the minimum load on the towing vehicle provide the TOPAZ gun exceptional cross-country ability and mobility under all road and weather conditions. The fire control system of the M91 is used on appropriate mounts on the TOPAZ 100-mm, the T-12, and the MT-12 guns. It is designed to determine and visualize the firing elements (traverse and elevation) in direct and indirect firing on moving and stationary targets. It is simple to operate, reliable, and effective. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and the speed of determining the firing elements (particularly for fast-moving targets), the accuracy in monitoring the firing elements adopted, and the exceptionally low total reaction time, the fire control system is a unique solution on a world scale and an important contribution to improving the firepower of antiarmor artillery. With the new ammunition, that includes a subcaliber projectile, whose conception and design are up-to-date and whose penetrability is at the level of antiarmor projectiles of considerably greater caliber, the TOPAZ system will be a new pet and reliable weapon in the hands of our artillerymen.
