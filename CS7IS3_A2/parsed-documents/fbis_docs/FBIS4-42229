After the draft of a working group in the Chancellor's Office became known within the government, resistance has started to come from the Justice Ministry. The objective of the planned increase in power is to be able to trace the illegal trade in nuclear material back to the place of production and to stop its infiltration into the black market network. Since the examination cannot be carried out on the spot for reasons involving tactics and measuring techniques, the material has to be imported, it is stated. However, the Justice Ministry does not think that the situation on the nuclear black market "endangers security" so much that the intelligence services have to be employed. In Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's ministry it is pointed out that, according to the current law, the BND's intervention will violate the international agreement on physical protection from nuclear material.
