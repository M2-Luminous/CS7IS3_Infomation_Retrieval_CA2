This is seen as a realistic and wise step in adapting to the changes imposed by circumstances in the global oil market. This is according to 'Abdallah Tahir al-Dabbagh, secretary general of the Council of Saudi Chambers, in a wide-ranging interview with AL-ANBA', in which he said that the world is today experiencing a period of enormous changes, which the economic managers of all the GCC countries are trying to grapple with. Their first priority is to maintain the strength of each country's national economy, and their continued growth, through local and foreign fiscal support and stability. The interview also includes an assessment of the joint economic course of the GCC states, from the signing of the unified economic agreement until the present. Al-Dabbagh said that, despite achievements at the economic level, there are some problems and difficulties that hamper the economic course. The interview touched on the GCC states' economic and trade relations with economic and global factors, the development of the dialogue with the United States, the European Community, and Japan, as well as the importance of the commercial arbitration center, which the Riyadh summit agreed to set up. He confirmed that this center would be basic support for the protection of GCC citizens' rights, and would conclude legal difficulties they face in foreign arbitration centers. Al-Dabbagh also shed light on the economic reform measures that have been enacted in several Arab countries, and the extent of their involvement in promoting trade and investment cooperation among Arab countries, in addition to the biggest obstacles to investment that still exist in the region. The text of the interview follows: [Rashwan] How do you assess current economic conditions in the Gulf region? To what extent has the oil slump affected economic activity in the region in general? [Al-Dabbagh] To start with, I must say that we are living in a period in which the world is experiencing enormous changes. So the economic managers in all the Gulf countries are eager to adapt to them in such a way as to maintain, first of all, the strength of the national economy in each of the Gulf states, and their continued growth, by supporting local and foreign fiscal stability. The first tool is the maintenance of the value of the currency of each country, and strengthening them, to handle the prices of foreign currencies; that would be a basic guarantee of the continuity of self-sustaining growth. Naturally, the fall in oil revenues is having an effect on the economies of the region, but not to a very large extent; this is thanks to the Gulf states' policy during the years of high oil revenues of building an infrastructure, raising the citizens' standard of living, and raising the standard of public services, especially educational, health, and social services. This policy was a great success, as anyone who follows the renewal movement of the Gulf states can see. The Gulf states also succeeded, in the same time period, in creating large financial reserves, easing the process of adapting the Gulf states' economic policies to the reality of reduced oil revenues. The governments have adopted wise fiscal policies to adapt the economy gradually to the new level of oil revenues. This can easily be seen in the development plans. Wise and Realistic Decision [Rashwan] All the GCC state budgets announced cuts, as a result of many global factors. How can this be dealt with, in your view, in such a way as to maintain the energy of the development process? [Al-Dabbagh] In the beginning, we may point out that the Gulf states who have announced their budgets so far are Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman. The budgets of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are in the final review phase. Whatever the position now on issuing GCC state budgets, the budgets' major trait is the general trend toward reduction. This may be seen as a realistic and wise measure, to adapt to changes abroad imposed by conditions in the global oil market. In any case, even if these budgets are being reduced, if we want to have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of these budgets, we must look beyond these numbers themselves, to the long-term meanings of a number of local and global indicators and data. If we look at the Saudi budget as a specimen of the GCC states' new budgets, we can say that this budget is excellent, given prevailing global conditions. This is because Saudi Arabia has not become a debtor nation, nor is it unable to meet its commitments; nor has it abandoned its large economic projects; nor has it taken other routes that might have led to doubts about the soundness of its economy. The decision to reduce government expenditure is only an unforeseen, stand-by measure in the Saudi economy; and it represents, in itself, a strength hidden inside the economy, whether in terms of allocating many government assets, or rationalization--especially after the Kingdom's success in creating and developing a national sector that is growing and maturing every year, in a way that has enabled it to play a leading role in stimulating the Saudi economy. This has led to the reduction in the importance of government spending in stimulating economic activity at the expense of that sector's investments. In another sense, government spending now represents just one factor--even if it is the most important one--of a group of factors affecting economic movement in the Kingdom and numerous other GCC states, too. The Private Sector [Rashwan] How do you view the role of the private sector at this stage, with Saudi resources dwindling due to the drop in oil prices. More specifically, what is the role of the private sector at this stage? [Al-Dabbagh] As a result of ongoing conditions in the world oil market, wise government policy has required us to adapt to the drop in oil prices. This is because oil revenues represent 75 percent of the state's total public revenues, and as a result, state spending has declined 20 percent in the new budget. A realistic analysis of this decline is that, in the big picture, it is consistent with the course set out in the development strategy of the Kingdom's plan beginning with the sixth development plan (1415-1420 [1995-1200]), which strongly emphasized a clear policy opening the way for private sector initiatives in the areas of investment and financing. This is in line with the plan's intentions, and to a large extent opens the way for the private sector to have a leading, even a commanding role in the development process. So the decrease is not part of a deflationary policy aimed at lowering total spending in the capital economy; it is the expression of changing places between public spending and private spending. More specifically, it is an attempt to change places in development efforts with a partial transformation of the government's role in funding the development process, into a basic role of the national sector in the future. This would encourage one of the main items in the statement of the minister of Finance and National Economy: that the national sector maintain its effectiveness in developing the growth rates of the local product, despite the decline in oil revenues. This means that one may expect the drop in public spending to be compensated by an increase in private spending, or, more generally, to boost the role of the private sector in the development process, and its financing. Achievements and Difficulties [Rashwan] How would you assess the joint economic course of the GCC states since the signing of the unified economic accord? [Al-Dabbagh] Before answering this important question, I would like to say that, despite the short time that has elapsed since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its economic achievements are clear. Its efforts have made great strides on the road to economic integration, cooperation, and coordination, and this success has led to new effectiveness and increased success. The GCC states' unified economic accord, with its policies and joint economic programs, has had many significant economic achievements. There are, as well, some problems in implementing the accord, which GCC leaders are acting to redress, in order to implement the accord implemented quickly. Perhaps the most significant economic achievements are: First, in the area of economic citizenship and equality of treatment: - The natural and legal citizens of the GCC states are allowed to pursue most economic activities, with gradual equality with the citizens of the countries in which they engage in these activities. All professionals and most vocational workers, including consultants, may engage in their professions and vocations in the GCC states. They will be accorded the same treatment as the citizens of the host countries. This includes wholesale and retail merchants. - It gives the citizens of GCC states the right to obtain loans from banks and industrial funds. - It permits the citizens of GCC states to own land for residential purposes. - It accords all GCC citizens equality in tax treatment, the same as that of citizens in the host GCC-member country in which they are engaging in economic and investment activity. - It allows the citizens of GCC states to own shares in joint ventures and new companies active in various economic activities. - It achieves equality of treatment at the elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of education, and seeks to achieve equality in university-level education and unification of procedures in academic degrees and elementary, intermediate, and secondary diplomas and certificates. In the same area, it was decided that the citizens of GCC states resident in or visiting any GCC state will receive equal treatment when going to health centers, clinics, and public hospitals. - Customs tariffs were voided for agricultural and livestock products, and natural resource and industrial products from national installations, as from March 1983. - Natural and legal [citizen] producers may export their products directly to another member country, with no need for a local agent. - In addition, production units will be allowed to open offices to promote their products and services to their customers with no need for a local agent. - In government projects and government purchasing, priority will be given to national products and products of national origin. Finally, the necessary facilities will be offered to ships and boats owned by any of the member countries or their citizens, and they will receive treatment equal to that of a local ship. Second: In the area of coordinating and unifying GCC states' policies: - Goals and policies of development plans: - A joint agricultural policy. - A unified industrial development strategy. - An oil lending system. - A regional emergency plan for petroleum products and their exchange among GCC states. - Goals and policies for negotiating with countries and economic blocs, in addition to a cultural development plan. - Policies and general principles for protecting the environment in GCC states. - A document on controls on foreign media. - A charter on media honor. - Unification of prices and fees on services, including fuels. Third: the area of joint ventures and the establishment of joint institutions. This is an area in which the GCC states have enacted numerous laws and measures aimed at encouraging joint ventures, among them: - Regulations for coordinating the establishment of industrial projects and the establishment of a permanent committee for the encourgement of coordination in setting up projects, studying any problems faced by existing projects, and finding solutions for them. - Enacting a system for the joint protection of national products. - Adopting unified standards for major commodities. - Organizing annual commercial exhibitions to coincide with summit conferences. - Allowing citizens to own shares in some companies. - Establishing a permanent committee to encourage small industry. Since the founding of the GCC, a number of joint institutions have been founded: the Gulf Investment Organziation, the GCC States Standards and Specifications Commission, the Technical Liaison Office, the GCC Program to Support Development in the Arab Countries, the Joint GCC Office with the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the GCC Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property. Fourth: in the area of intensifying channels of contact and networking, we have seen: - The establishment of the Gulf Marketing Association, registered in Bahrain. - The High-Pressure Electrical Engineering Association, registered in Qatar. There are also joint programs and camps to foster youth-related, athletic, cultural, artistic, and theater encounters. - Regular meetings with chambers of commerce and industry to keep them informed of the GCC's economic decisions, and for them to discuss the formulas of decisions that affect them, listen to any complaints, and give their views on collective action. Gulf Chambers [Rashwan] Will there be a role for the Gulf chambers to play in the future to increase cooperation and help achieve the stage of economic integration among the GCC states? [Al-Dabbagh] Despite the GCC's economic achievements, there are still some problems and obstacles hindering the economic course. So there is an important kind of cooperation and coordination among the councils and federations of chambers of commerce in the GCC states. This cooperation and coordination is based on a partnership in solving the problems and obstacles that are hindering the economic course, so that the implementation experience does not hit stumbling blocks. The councils and federations are working on liaison, coordination, and cooperation among themselves in the area of consulting, exchanging views, arranging meetings and conferences, preparing joint studies in areas of economic activity, or through joint cooperation on service and productive projects to whose capital GCC businessmen can contribute. They are also simplifying the procedures for GCC businessmen engaging in commercial, industrial, and service activiities in other countries, all in accordance with the accord, and with the help of the federation of chambers of commerce. Of course, the councils of Gulf chambers have an important role in the next phase, which will require the GCC states to face all the difficulties that stand in the way of implementing the unified economic accord, on the way to the point of economic integration among the Gulf states. Arbitration Center [Rashwan] How do you view the importance of the Gulf commercial arbitration center the Riyadh summit decided to establish? [Al-Dabbagh] The decision of the recent Riyadh summit to establish a commercial arbitration center for the GCC states came at the same time as the Saudi Cabinet's resolution that Saudi Arabia would join the New York Agreement, to acknowledge and implement the rulings of foreign arbitrators. Needless to say, these two events are the beginning of a new era of international commercial arbitration at the GCC level. Turning to the importance of the Gulf commercial arbitration center, this center will be a basic support for the protection of GCC citizens' rights. It will conclude the legal efforts they are enduring in foreign arbitration centers, because of the lack of recognized Arab or Gulf arbitration centers. On another front, the fact that Islamic law is the legal basis for settling commercial disputes, and the law that must be applied in disputes brought before the center, prevents the Muslim merchants of the Gulf from being subjected to foreign legal regulations that may contain outright contraventions of Islamic law, as used to happen. Naturally, the establishment of this center will encourage foreign firms to invest in the Gulf and boost the volume of their commercial dealings in the Gulf markets; they will have confidence in its legal foundation, and commercial arbitration will be an acknowledged principle in the settlement of any disputes between them an a Gulf entity. It is enough that it will be possible to stipulate in contracts ratified by two sides that disputes between the two sides will be settled by arbitration, in accordance with the measures and regulations of the Gulf commercial arbitration center. Investment Obstacles [Rashwan] What are the chief obstacles to investment you think still exist in the Arab region? Do you think the Gulf region is a place that can absorb funds invested from abroad? [Al-Dabbagh] Actually, the question of investment obstacles in the Arab countries has become a basic subject at any conference or Arab economic meeting. If we look at the laws that promote investing in the Arab countries, we may say that these laws have not had a practical and palpable effect at the pan-Arab level. This is due to many basic factors, chiefly the fact that these laws are just one factor out of many that make up the general investment climate in a given country. There are other economic, political, and social factors that play an important role in attracting and guiding foreign investment. There is evidence that the investment atmosphere in the Arab world, particularly in the private sector, is still full of obstacles. This has been confirmed by the results of a new questionnaire produced by the Arab Investment Guarantee Organization on the investment climate in the Arab world. It was circulated among a select group of Arab investors in diverse Arab countries. The results of the questionnaire indicated that the greatest obstacle was bureaucracy, the difficulty of registration and licensing measures, limited local markets, the lack of clarity and stability of the investment laws in some countries, and instability and slumps in the value of the local currency of some other countries, in addition to the lack of trained manpower. Turning to the investment climate in the Gulf states, we may say that, in light of current circumstances, the GCC states are seen as being among the most attractive areas for investment, thanks to the political stability they enjoy; their financial resources, which are sufficient to fund their industrial activities, or to participate in them with foreign investors; adherence to the principle of free economic activity; and encouragement of private initiatives. I may add that the GCC states have advanced infrastructures and a significant strategic location, and they enjoy a high per capita income and a strong consumer inclination.
