FR941121-0-00026 FR941121-0-00001 iii. Prizes offered at annual meetings, such as U.S. Savings Bonds, a deposit of funds into the winner's account, trips, and other gifts. Such prizes are not bonuses because they are offered as an incentive to increase attendance at the annual meeting, and not to entice members to open, maintain, or renew accounts or increase an account balance. iv. Life savings benefits. (s) Passbook Account 1. Relation to Regulation E. Passbook accounts include accounts accessed by preauthorized electronic fund transfers to the account (as defined in 12 CFR ยง205.2(j)), such as an account credited by direct share and deposit of social security payments. Accounts that permit access by other electronic means are not ``passbook accounts,'' and any statements that are sent four or more times a year must comply with the requirements of ยง707.6. (t) Periodic Statement 1. General. Periodic statements are not required by part 707. Passbook and term share accounts are exempt from periodic statement requirements. 2. Examples. Periodic statements do not include: i. Additional statements provided solely upon request. ii. Information provided by computer through home electronic credit union account services. iii. General service information such as a quarterly newsletter or other correspondence that describes available services and products. (u) Potential Member 1. General. A potential member is a natural person eligible for membership in a credit union, who has not yet taken the steps necessary to become a member. The term also includes natural person nonmembers eligible to hold accounts in a credit union pursuant to relevant federal or state law. 2. Verification of eligibility. It is recommended that credit unions have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for membership. If these procedures include verification measures, such as an application process, verification telephone call or letter to an employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an existing member, or similar procedure, then the credit union may first verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before providing account disclosures or other information to the potential member. This process of verifying a member's eligibility status, making a recommendation for membership, and providing account disclosures should be completed within 20 calendar days. This period also applies when potential members not on credit union premises request disclosures. 3. Nonmembers. Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who are ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If disclosures are made to such nonmembers, it is the position of the Board that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in such disclosures. (See commentary to ยง707.3(d)). (v) State 1. General. Territories and possessions include American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands. (w) Stepped-Rate Account 1. General. Stepped-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates (known at the time the account is opened) will take effect in succeeding periods. 2. Example. An example of a stepped-rate account is a one-year term share certificate account in which a 5.00% dividend rate is paid for the first six months, and 5.50% for the second six months. (x) Term Share Account 1. Relation to Regulation D. Regulation D permits, in limited circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days after a ``time deposit'' is opened. (See 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(i).) But the fact that a member makes a withdrawal as permitted by Regulation D does not disqualify the account from being a term share account for purposes of this regulation (such as withdrawals upon the death of the member, or within a ``grace period'' for automatically renewable term share accounts). 2. Club accounts. Club accounts, including Christmas club, holiday club, and vacation club accounts may be either term share or regular share accounts, depending on the terms of the account. Although club accounts typically have a maturity date, they are not term share accounts unless they also require a penalty of at least seven days' dividends for withdrawals during the first six days after the account is opened. (v) Tiered-Rate Account 1. General. Tiered-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates are paid on the account and are determined by reference to a specified balance level. Tiered-rate accounts are of two types: Tiering Method A and Tiering Method B. In Tiering Method A accounts, the credit union pays the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account. This method is also known as the ``hybrid'' or ``plateau'' tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B accounts, the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the portion of the share account balance that falls within each specified tier. This method is also known as the ``pure'' or ``split-rate'' tiered-rate account. (See commentary to Appendix A, ยงI, D.) 2. Example. An example of a tiered-rate account is one in which a credit union pays a 5.00% dividend rate on balances below $1,000, and 5.50% on balances $1,000 and above.
