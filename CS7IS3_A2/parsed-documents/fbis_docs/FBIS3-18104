As soon as the movement renounces violence, participates in the elections, and accepts the basic principles of democracy, the movement will be entitled to support. This was stated by Development Cooperation Minister Pronk this morning, during a discussion with the House of Representatives. In principle, 100,000 guilders in financial support has been appropriated for the ANC [African National Congress], the National Party, the Freedom Alliance, and the Inkatha movement. The outcome of the elections will then determine how much money a specific party will get on top of that. The Council for the New South Africa, in which PvdA [Labor Party], CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], D66 [Democrats 66], GroenLinks [Green Left], SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union], RPF [Reformational Political Federation] are represented, determines whether or not a request from a South African political party is complied with. For the next two years, 10 million guilders is available. [passage omitted]
