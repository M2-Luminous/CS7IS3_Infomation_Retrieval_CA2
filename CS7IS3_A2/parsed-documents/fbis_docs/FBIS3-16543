The defense minister was commenting on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent order assigning the Defense Ministry before May 30 "to take measures aimed at organizing the everyday activities of the strategic nuclear forces with non-targeted missiles". Pavel Grachev added that the issue on the mutual non-targeting of strategic weapons of Russia and the United States was raised for the first time at a meeting of the two presidents in Vancouver last year. In January this year Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton confirmed in the Moscow Declaration that they would give the appropriate instructions to their defense ministries. According to the Russian defense minister, Britain also joined this initiative. Pavel Grachev believes that terms of implementing this decision will be determined by organizational and technical possibilities, and are specific for each kind of strategic weapons.
