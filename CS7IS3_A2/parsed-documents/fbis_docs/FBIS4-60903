The pretext for the latest session of the tribunal, which was attended by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent, was the article carried in one of the March issues of EKSPRESS-GAZETA entitled "But People...Live!" devoted to the material and organizational provision for State Duma deputies. The lower house of parliament considered this newspaper article to be libelous. The State Duma's Legal Administration sent a statement to the tribunal attesting to the inaccuracy of the EKSPRESS-GAZETA article. I. Zablotskiy, a staffer at the Legal Administration, referred in his statement to the Interim Statute on Ensuring the Activities of State Duma Deputies (it was published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 29 January), which stipulated the rights and privileges that deputies may enjoy. There was no mention of dachas, foreign trips, or personal physicians -- as EKSPRESS-GAZETA had reported. G. Dyakonov, leader of the Duma Press Center, who spoke after I. Zablotskiy, talked about breaches of professional standards by the EKSPRESS-GAZETA journalists, who had failed to check their facts. For their part, the respondents, representing the newspaper's founders -- the "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Joint-Stock Company and the "Segodnya" Limited Partnership -- tried to use different arguments. They said that the article "But People...Live!" had used facts borrowed from other newspapers. But Tribunal Chairman A. Vengerov and the tribunal members deemed these explanations unconvincing. First, EKSPRESS-GAZETA had not indicated the sources of the information it had cited. Moreover, the quoting was inaccurate and not verbatim, and the facts -- lifted from various publications and collated -- created a distorted impression of deputies. The article "But People...Live!" was deemed inaccurate and unobjective, and a crude breach of legal and technical norms. The newspaper's founders were instructed to relieve A. Kupriyanov of his duties as chief editor. We have no grounds to leap to A. Kupriyanov's defense. Nonetheless, we are doing so, because, in our view, the Media Disputes Tribunal is turning more and more into a kind of censorship organ -- a prototype of the notorious "troika" -- where it is becoming the rule not to listen to the accused party. That was the case at the hearings on the article "Buds Swelling. For a Putsch?" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. The tribunal condemned the statement from the Russian Federation Press Committee without even inviting a representative to attend. Moreover, in a phone call to the chief editor of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, A. Vengerov said that they did not consider it necessary to invite committee workers to attend, the statement was sufficient.... The Statute on the Tribunal (Paragraph 12) states that it is entitled to reprimand a journalist who violates generally accepted ethical norms, and "in the event of their violating the legislation on the mass media, to raise the question before the relevant organ (leader) of established legislative proceedings being instituted against them." As we can see, there is no mention here of the tribunal's right to recommend the removal of the chief editor. And the tribunal was conceived so as to ensure that its activity would be based on moral and ethical grounds, without being a substitute for judicial and legal organs. It is probably no accident that in its 4 February issue IZVESTIYA allowed itself to voice some doubts about the tribunal's good intentions: "....under certain circumstances the tribunal is also able to pursue a line of actually restricting press freedom." At the hearing the EKSPRESS-GAZETA representatives suggested that it had been decided to begin with them so as to "stifle" the yellow press. A. Vengerov brushed this aside, claiming that there was no intention to "stifle" anyone and, in general, he did not want to listen to such arguments. Nonetheless, has not the tribunal's ruling turned out to be far too politicized? The hearing saw the use of what was, to my mind, a very symptomatic phrase -- "our patience is exhausted." It has to be admitted that even the tone of the tribunal's ruling was surprising. It used the word "mockery" three times and the journalists were rebuked for their "basic ignorance" and their "unacceptable presentational style." I may not have to read this kind of ruling very often, but I would like to see a suitable tone of gravitas from such an important institution. The tribunal is meant to settle media disputes. At the last hearing there was no dispute as such -- it was clearly one-way traffic. You could not help getting the feeling that you were present at the birth of a media tribunal that had taken on all the "best" punitive traditions of agitprop.
