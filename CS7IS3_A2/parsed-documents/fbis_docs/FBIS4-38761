But Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan, considers that the situation could deteriorate at any moment. [Chechulin] Several hundred armed supporters of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan are concentrated in a number of our neighboring territory's border regions. Their redeployment toward the border has been observed of late. [Khasanova] Some people are of the opinion that Russia is paying too high a price in its soldiers' blood and lives to protect the sovereign Tajik border. Twenty-five men have been killed in the 12th Border Troop Subunit. Could something similar happen again? [Chechulin] The families of the dead will forgive me, and I hope it does not sound blasphemous, but we did learn a good lesson from what happened ten months ago. I can now say with a full sense of responsibility what the likelihood of a repetition of the tragedy is. Everything has been done to ensure that every border subunit or border post, without exception, can repulse enemy attacks until the approach of reserves. We have highly mobile motorized subunits, airborne assault units, artillery, and military aircraft at our disposal. The Tajik-Afghan border today is a system of modern obstacles, including mined obstacles. We are setting up our own air defense system. One in ten soldiers in the border troops is on contract. The border troop subunits and border detachments are manned at wartime strength. [Khasanova] You will agree that such a situation cannot go one for ever. The Tajik border must be taken under the protection of units of the national army and local border troops. When will this happen? [Chechulin] Tajik units now mainly occupy the second echelons, while we occupy the front echelons. This distance, does not, incidentally, prevent our successfully carrying out joint operations. However, I do think the time will come when Tajikistan will have to guarantee the security of its own border by its own devices. I don't, however, think this is going to happen soon. I cannot agree with the opinion that Russian troops should be withdrawn from here. The presence of Russia, which has its own indisputable geopolitical interests here, is a real necessity. The more successful the talks between the Dushanbe authorities and the opposition are, the more nominal the Russian military presence in Tajikistan will become.
