The first party to do so was the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], then the Papa Egoro Movement, the Arnulfist Party and the Liberal Party, and finally the Morena [National Renewal Movement], Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], and Civic Renewal Party. With the registration of the candidates headed by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber on the one hand, and Ruben Dario Carles on the other, the possibility of an alliance that would group the civic [civilistas] forces that struggled against Manuel Antonio Noriega's regime has been frustrated. With these four [number as heard] slates the political panorama is clarified and the uncertainty about the presidential candidacies disappears. Now, only the Solidarity Party and the Democratic Christian Party have yet to register their candidates. Last week, Jose Salvador Munoz registered as presidential candidate for the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party. In accordance with the electoral scheme, there are seven candidates for president of the Republic in the first free and democratic elections to be held after over 20 years of military dictatorships.
