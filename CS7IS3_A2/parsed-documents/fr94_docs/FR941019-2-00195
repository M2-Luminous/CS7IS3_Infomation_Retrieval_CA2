FR941019-2-00195 FR941019-2-00105 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration [Docket No. 27649] Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Effects of Changes of Aircraft Flight Patterns Over the State of New Jersey; Public Hearings AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) DOT. ACTION: Notice of public hearings. SUMMARY: The FAA intends to conduct hearings in New Jersey to gather comments on the supplemental draft environmental impact statement (EIS) released on September 30, 1994. As a result of the analysis phase of the comment period associated with the Draft EIS, new information was developed by the FAA. Additionally, new information was received from the public during the comment period. Since this information is pertinent to the decision process leading to issuance of a final EIS, the public should have an opportunity to examine the new material and comment on it prior to completion of the EIS. The supplemental draft EIS (SDEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Copies have been mailed to individuals that participated in the EIS process as well as to libraries in select locations throughout New Jersey. COMMENT PERIOD: Written comments, in triplicate, must be received at the following address by November 30, 1994: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel: Docket Number 27649, 800 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, DC 20591. During the comment period, the FAA will conduct three public hearings in New Jersey to solicit both written and oral comments on the SDEIS. All persons wishing to make oral presentations at the public hearings are strongly urged to provide a written copy of their statement at the hearing or at the FAA address provided in the above paragraph. The following is a listing of the dates, times and locations of the hearings in New Jersey: ‚ê£ 1Date 1Time/location November 14, 1994 1:00&hyph;4:00 pm and 7:00&hyph;10:00 pm, CRANFORD, Coachman Hotel (Days Inn), Exit 136 Garden State Parkway, 10 Jackson Drive, Cranford, NJ.

The FAA will consider and respond to all comments directly related to the scope of the SDEIS. The geographic scope delineated by Congress for the EIS was the environmental effects of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey and adjacent coastal waters. Please note, however, that the most useful comments are those which provide facts and analyses to support the reviewer's recommendations or conclusions on specific topics contained in the document. Should any comments be received after the close of the comment period, FAA cannot assure they will be considered or addressed in the final EIS. The FAA will issue a final EIS that will include corrections, clarifications and responses to comments on the SDEIS. Issued in Washington, D.C., on October 14, 1994. Richard A. Cox, Deputy Director for Air Traffic System Management. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25894 Filed 10&hyph;14&hyph;94; 1:43 pm] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
