In an interview for today's Hungarian daily PESTI HIRLAP, Entz said that the Slovak Government circles would point to their neighbor as long as cooperation between Bratislava and Budapest is not established in order to settle the position of the 560,000-strong Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. In a declaration approved at the meeting, participants demanded the expansion of the jurisdiction of local government and a new local administrative arrangement in Slovakia. Entz said that documents approved in Komarno, southern Slovakia, over the weekend clearly prove that it is not reasonable to accuse the mayors of the southern Slovak region (at whose initiative the meeting was held) of being separatist only because they rejected as unacceptable state administration reform. At the meeting, ethnic Hungarians peacefully but resolutely formulated their demands which aim at preservation of national identity and their eventual recognition by the Slovak Government circles as partners. After the submission of the claims of an "extensive stratum of society," said Entz, he believed there existed a hope of resolving the standing of Hungarians in Slovakia legally. [passage omitted]
