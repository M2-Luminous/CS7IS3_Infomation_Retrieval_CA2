FR940616-2-00129 FR940616-2-00091 Additional Guidance The Office of Citizen Exchanges offers the following additional guidance to prospective applicants: 1. The Office of Citizen Exchanges encourages project proposals involving more than one country. Pertinent rationale which links countries in multi-country projects should be included in the submission. Single-country projects that are clearly defined and possess the potential for creating and strengthening continuing linkages between foreign and U.S. institutions are also welcome. 2. Proposals for bilateral programs are subject to review and comment by the USIS post in the relevant country, and pre-selected participants will also be subject to USIS post review. 3. Bilateral programs should clearly identify the counterpart organization and provide evidence of the organization's participation. 4. The Office of Citizen Exchanges will consider proposals for activities which take place exclusively in other countries when USIS posts are consulted in the design of the proposed program and in the choice of the most suitable venues for such programs. 5. Office of Citizen Exchanges grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical or vocational subjects, or for research projects, for publications funding, for student and/or teacher/faculty exchanges, for sports and/or sports related programs. Nor does this office provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the Federal Register . For projects that would begin after July 1, 1995, competition details will be announced in the Federal Register on or about December 1, 1994. Inquiries concerning technical requirements are welcome prior to submission of applications. Funding Although no set funding limit exists, proposals for less than $150,000 will receive preference. Organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000. Applicants are invited to provide both an all-inclusive budget as well as separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding. While an all-inclusive budget must be provided with each proposal, separate component budgets are optional. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The selection of grantee institutions will depend on program substance, cross-cultural sensitivity, and ability to carry out the program successfully. Since USIA grant assistance constitutes only a portion of total project funding, proposals should list and provide evidence of other anticipated sources of financial and in-kind support. The Recipient must provide a minimum of 33 percent cost sharing of the total project cost. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E-Cost Sharing and Matching and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide a minimum of 33 percent cost sharing, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution. Proposals with cost sharing of less than 33 percent of the total project cost will be considered ineligible. The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding: 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs. 2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the published Federal per diem rates must be used. NOTE: U.S. escorting staff must use the published Federal per diem rates, not the flat rate.
