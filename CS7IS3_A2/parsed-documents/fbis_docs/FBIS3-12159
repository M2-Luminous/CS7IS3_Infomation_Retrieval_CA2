The government is sending its condolences to the families of the dead and is wishing speedy recovery to the wounded. The government has decided to compensate the families of the victims. The government is calling on all residents, both Arabs and Jews, to exercise maximum restraint despite the grave circumstances. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and all the security forces are adopting all necessary measures to prevent incitement, violence, and a deterioration of the situation. During the meeting, the cabinet ministers and the attorney general raised proposals for various possible measures of handling radical Israeli elements that are instigative elements in the territories. The government believes that these elements gravely and dangerously violate public order, and that every legal measure should be adopted to curb and restrain them. Even concerning an act by a single individual -- as was the case in Hebron this morning -- we cannot ignore the influence of instigative remarks made publicly that threaten the citizen's well-being. The government has entrusted the prime minister and defense minister with the task of examining all measures proposed during today's discussion and of informing the cabinet of his decisions on 27 February. The investigation of today's incidents will be complete. The government is resolved to continue its peace efforts and to promote the negotiations to the best of its ability.
