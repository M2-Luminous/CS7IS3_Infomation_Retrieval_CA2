Stange personally informed reporters of his decision at Government House after meeting with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. The following is a report by Jose Miguel Alfaro: [Begin recording] [Alfaro] President Eduardo Frei and the Carabineros director general held a 90-minute meeting amid an atmosphere of unusual security measures around the La Moneda Palace and great expectation among journalists and the crowd that gathered at the door on Constitution Plaza. General Stange arrived at La Moneda a little after 0930 and entered La Moneda through the door on Agustinas Street. After the 90-minute meeting with the president, Stange went to the Government House News Room where Government House correspondents were waiting for him. He made the following statement: [Stange] We held an extensive meeting during which he had the courtesy to listen to me. Therefore, I am not leaving. Judge Juica's ruling suggests that the military courts should investigate to establish whether or not justice was obstructed. I want to make it perfectly clear that I personally was not involved, nor was my name ever mentioned, in the kidnapping or killing of the three communist leaders. I want to make this perfectly clear. The much-discussed recording does exist. It was recorded secretly. I urge people to read the full transcription of this tape and not just parts of it. The full transcription of the tape clearly shows that the person who made the recording reasserts to me he is completely innocent of the charges of which he has now been formally charged. Therefore, I urge you to read the full transcription of the tape and not just portions of it, because this only distorts a perfectly clear situation. Judge Juica investigated this case for many years. If he recommends the military courts to investigate who is responsible, I will comply with his decision. We are living in a democracy, and anyone can request whatever he wishes under the law. But it is a completely different matter for me to be held responsible for other people's guilt. I have kept quiet precisely to see who wants me to retire. I am now responding to some of these extravagant expressions. I am not leaving. [Several journalists ask questions simultaneously] [Stange] Thank you very much. [end recording]
