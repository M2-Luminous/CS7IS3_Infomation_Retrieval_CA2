A trap from which it is proving very difficult to escape. Although the anti-Belgian feelings aroused in the last few days have not resulted in a "Belgian manhunt" such as some were rather too quick to speak of, Belgium nevertheless finds itself in a very unenviable position in Rwanda today. Is this the thankless and inevitable role of any former colonial power? No doubt. But the colonial past cannot explain everything. The difficulties encountered by Belgian leaders in coming to the assistance of expatriates threatened by further troubles more certainly have their origins in a more recent past. The past of a Rwanda which, like most African countries, has been touched by the wave of democratization born at the end of the Cold War. A wave resisted by the "strongarm" regime of President Habyarimana but which also pushed the Tutsi minority to "try its luck" in the only way possible, that of armed rebellion. Faced with this new situation, Belgium could have continued to support a regime whose principal virtue was its strength or, alternatively, it could have played the democratic card. It chose the latter option. Was it right to do so? Or should it, like France, have continued to side with an antiquated single-party system? Such a choice would have amounted to a pragmatism which although not very honorable would probably have been more effective, at least in the short term. Instead, it chose to gamble in the longer term on improved human rights on a continent where, sooner or later, they are confronted by the compromises of leaders who are still too often encouraged by a West which prefers trading security to the risks inherent in introducing democracy. Democratization has failed in Rwanda. And this failure has caught Belgium in the trap. But does this mean that Belgium should stand accused? Should it stand accused for having chosen to take a chance rather than for the status quo, and for human rights rather than oppression? Belgium has lost. For now.
