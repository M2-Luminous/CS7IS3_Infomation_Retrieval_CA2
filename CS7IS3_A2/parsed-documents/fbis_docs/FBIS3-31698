The chetniks and ustashas are receiving reinforcements from Zepce, Doboj, Prnjavor, and Mt. Ozren. This are definitely the most powerful attacks so far with only one goal -- to conquer Maglaj. The fighters of the 201st [Hill] Brigade have halted their further advances toward the town. An appeal by the Maglaj War Presidency and the Command of the 201st Hill Brigade of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army to the residents that they immediately and urgently place themselves on the rim of the town and prevent the enemy from capturing Maglaj has borne fruit. Volunteers, representatives of the civilian authorities, more than 50 mothers, and even wounded soldiers are reporting to participate in the crucial battle for Maglaj. They could not be prevented in this even by the hundreds of artillery shells fired at the town and several dozens of civilian casualties. The Maglaj is being defended heroically from the heart for who knows how long.
