Government military sources report major troop and military equipment movements by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito and other parts of the country. Reginaldo Silva, the BBC correspondent in Luanda, reports: [Begin Silva recording] Government sources today reiterated their accusation that UNITA is preparing a major attack on the city of Cuito. They expect such an attack to occur soon and their views seem to be backed by the media in Luanda, notably IMPARCIAL FAX, the most recent independent publication to have emerged in the Angolan capital. (?According to that) source, UNITA is strengthening all its positions in the area of Cuito. It has been providing logistical supplies to its forces in the area of Chitundo, some 15 km from Cuito. UNITA troops have been seen moving from Cuanza Commune and heading in the direction of the outskirts of Cuito. ZU- 23 artillery weapons have been set up at the local hospital and at a temporary school. Another two long-range artillery weapons are reported to have been set up north of Chambanda Village. UNITA's (?L-50) Battalion is also reported to have been moving from Andulo District to positions near the hospital area in Cuito's Cantinflas Ward. In Cuito, an alleged UNITA soldier by the name of Antonio Domingos was today presented to the public. He is said to have recently deserted from the UNITA ranks and his statements confirmed that UNITA troops have been moving in the vicinity of the capital of Bie Province. The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, chief of General Staff has also issued a communique reporting constant ambushes by the UNITA forces. That communique adds that UNITA has been planting mines in the roads to Malange, Saurimo, Lucapa, Dundo, Ambriz, Caxito, and Dondo. It confirms that UNITA attacked Cunge Commune, 7 km from Cuito, on 23 February, and lost more than 30 men. What seems to be of greater concern to the government forces at this stage is the presence of UNITA troops along the road linking Luanda and Porto Amboim. That was one of the few roads where there were no reports of military activity. That road is used for many people and goods to travel between Cuanza Sul and Luanda Provinces. It is noteworthy that a large percentage of Angolan-made food products currently reaching Luanda come from Cuanza Sul Province. UNITA sources have kept their silence concerning those developments. Today, they only provided detailed reports about government military operations against their positions in Huila Province and the government's continuing recruitment of South African mercenaries. Those men are said to be assembling at the coastal town of Cabo Ledo, slightly more than 100 km south of Luanda. [end recording]
