Algeria's High State Council Sunday named General Liamine Zeroual, defence minister for the past six months, as head the new regime after the collapse of last week's national conference. "For us the issue is of no importance. The regime has lost its last card after the failure of the national conference. The regime is now politically bankrupt," a spokesman for FIS, Yousuf, told IRNA by phone from Germany. The official FIS spokesman in Europe Rabeh Kabir, who lives in exile in Germany, was not available for immediate comments on the naming of General Zeroual. He will replace the High State Council which was set up by the military two years ago after the cancellation of elections in the wake of a landslide victory for FIS. The appointment of General Zeroul implies that the army wants to continue its role as the main decision maker in Algeria. In a separate statement, faxed to IRNA sunday, FIS blamed the regime for the killing of a leader of the Islamic Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] in Algeria professor Mohammad Bouslimani. "The world should know that this regime has lost all justification for its existence and its days are numbered. Hence it took recourse to assassinating professor Mohammad Bouslimani as a ring in the shameless chain aimed at making Islamists hit each other," said the Arabic statement Nr. 10. It said "FIS strongly condemns and denounces this assassination and all of its kind," and added that there is no solution to the crisis except by "responding to the demand of the people to choose its rulers and to the right to live under the shade of an Islamic state." Last Tuesday's national conference held near Algiers was seen as a last ditch move by the regime to preserve its illegal rule. Major political parties boycotted it and the 2-day meeting ended in failure when former foreign minister Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika refused the post for the presidency. The Islamists in Algeria are struggling to create an Islamic state after they were robbed of certain election victory by the army in January 1992. The regime banned FIS and imprisoned thousands of Islamists. Nearly 2,000 Islamists, security personnel and other citizens have been killed in the violence.
