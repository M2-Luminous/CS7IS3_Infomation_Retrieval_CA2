The reshuffle will include 7-10 ministers. As is customary, all ministers will place their resignations at the disposal of the prime minister at a cabinet session today. Matters began to take shape after His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the Prime Ministry last Saturday, during which he presided over a cabinet meeting. He praised the government efforts and the ministers' services. It was reported that his majesty the king later paid a long visit to Prime Minister al-Majali at his home. The statements obtained by reporters after his majesty's chairmanship of the cabinet meeting said that Jordan cannot much lag behind other peace tracks and that the challenges facing Jordan and the poor peace coordination with the Palestinian side require a cabinet reshuffle to include all political trends in the country in order to deal with the next phase. Accordingly, Dr. al-Majali has over the last 48 hours held consultations with a number of deputies and senators in their capacity as representatives of the nation, and with various key figures and political trends so that the cabinet reshuffle will be based on a broader parliamentary base and will be acceptable to the various political trends. It was reported that some deputies may participate in the government in their personal capacity. Other sources, however, said Prime Minister al-Majali's consultations with some deputies might have been confined to clarifying the various aspects of the Jordanian policy and the accelerating developments of the peace process and whether personalities from outside the House of Representatives are acceptable to the various political blocs and trends in the House. It was reported that Dr. al-Majali contacted Senator Dhuqan al-Hindawi to appoint him deputy prime minister with large powers to run domestic affairs. However, sources close to al-Hindawi neither confirmed nor denied such reports. It was also reported that Dr. al-Majali, who is conducting most of his consultations from his home, has already met with some deputies and senators. Names from outside the House were mentioned to fill some portfolios. Some sources expected Marwan al-Qasim to be appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. The names of Dr. Raja'i al-Mu'ashshir, Jawdat al-Subul, 'Aql Biltaji, Dr. Muslih al-Tarawinah, and academicians from Jordanian universities and former ministers were also mentioned. Once the cabinet reshuffle has taken place, major appointments will be made. These include the post of director general of the Radio and Television Corporation as well as changes in ambassadors, secretaries general [of ministries], and directors of state departments and institutions.
