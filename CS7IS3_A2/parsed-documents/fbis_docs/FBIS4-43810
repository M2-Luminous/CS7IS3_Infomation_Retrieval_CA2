Corrections are necessary. The political world changed in the years 1989-90; hence Germany's position in the world also changed. German politics must draw conclusions from this if it wants not only to follow the developments resulting from the new situation but also to help shape them. This does not at all mean that the foreign policy wheel must be reinvented in Bonn or Berlin. There are principles, orientations, and ties that have proven themselves and that ought to be maintained. Of coure that will not be possible by holding onto what has become customary; it requires adaptations that are obviously difficult. An example is the debate on new tasks for the Bundeswehr that go beyond national defense and collective defense in the Atlantic alliance. It is therefore characterized by confusion, because everything that exceeded this "classic mission" was out of bounds until 1989. If many politicians today are warning against a "militarization of German foreign policy," this absurdity is a result of that situation. The dispute about missions "out of area" is by no means, as often asserted, a marginal subject--because intervention with military means as in Somalia or in the ruined Yugoslavia are said to be the exception anyway and generally unsuccessful and because the role of military power in world politics is increasingly being replaced by the importance of economic power and scientific-technical capabilities. That may be correct in part; nevertheless, the dispute about new tasks for the Bundeswehr leads directly to the core of German foreign policy: to the question of alliance capacity and hence to linkage with the West. One of the absurdities is the fact that precisely the leftists who originally were not pleased about Adenauer's policy of being tied to the West became ardent supporters of this policy after unification but simultaneously oppose new tasks for the Bundeswehr. If linkage with the West means more than just a feel for a way of life or the diffuse perception of belonging together politically and culturally, then the word can only mean that Germany must be willing to share the responsibility and subsequent burdens that its partners and allies are prepared to take on--not only under the coercion of the geopolitical situation as in the four decades of the postwar era but also based on its own resolve after consultations and decisions of competent authorities. Solidarity is not flying blind. Nor can it be discharged through money and nice words but rather it has practical consequences that cannot be avoided by resorting to history or a special national ethos. That also includes a German participation, even with soldiers, in the arrangements that will be a precondition for a peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia--possibly in the guarding of the borders or the formation of buffer zones between the successor states. Every realistic planning for such a case requires forces in a magnitude that NATO cannot provide without German participation in view of the necessary rotation of the units. Therefore, in the event that agreement is reached on a lasting and internationally supervised truce, there will be a call for the Bundeswehr after a year at the latest--not from Bonn but from Washington and Brussels, Paris and London. If the Germans were to refuse that, it will have consequences, not only for relations in the former Yugoslavia but also for the place of Germany in NATO and for the future of the European Union. People are tugging at this second anchor of the commitment to the West--in part in the leftist and in part in the rightist corner of the political spectrum. It is said, for example, that the European Community suffered a failure in 1991, because in Maastricht it wanted to compartmentalize West Europe instead of opening up to the East the union that was decided there. Apart from the fact that the word "compartmentalize" does not become more correct through repetition: How could one have imagined such a rapid opening? As a lightning-accession of the Central and East European countries (by the way, which is in and which is not?) with full rights and duties? Who would have been willing to bear the costs? Who would have benefited from the fact that after the collapse of the Eastern markets the Western markets would also have run into turbulence? And with which West European partner would Germany have found support, and not just politically, but also financially? The step-by-step political opening of West Europe to the East combined with a gradual reduction of customs duties is disdained, just as is NATO's Partnership for Peace, because that does not correspond to the image of the "bold design" that many desk strategists have of politics. But in a world in upheaval, in a Europe that has not yet found its new shape, it is more reasonable to proceed in short steps over secure terrain than to make a great leap and to land in a void.
