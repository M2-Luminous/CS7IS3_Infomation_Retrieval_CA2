Tevyashov, candidate of technical sciences; UDC 536.3:384.326] [Abstract] Experimental materials are given on the appearance of anomalous temperature contrasts of the ground surface over leaks from petroleum product pipelines. A gas surge under high pressure in the area of an underground leak, as a result of its expansion, cools the ambient soil volume and due to heat transfer at the surface forms a spot having a negative temperature contrast relative to the background. Measurements were made using an AGA-780 thermal imager-radiometer from aboard a helicopter hovering at an altitude 50-60 m. The results of specific observations are given. The factors governing the linear resolution of the instrument on the ground and the registered thermal contrast are discussed. Due to the great thermal inertia of the soil layer a considerable time elapses between the break and the appearance of a temperature contrast at the surface. The influence of ambient meteorological conditions on the degree of contrast is discussed on the basis of computed data. The factor exerting the greatest influence on spot contrast is wind speed. The depth of leak occurrence has a decisive effect on the thermal picture. The influence of time of day when observations are made (temperature and illumination) is analyzed pertinent to the middle zone of the country in clear summer weather. The maximum thermal anomaly over a leak site is observed from 1800 to 0800 hours when there are no masking thermal nonuniformities in the soil caused by solar heating.
