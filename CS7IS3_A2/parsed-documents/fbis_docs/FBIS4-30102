The Origin of the Chuche Idea" from "On the Chuche Idea", a famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, was held by the group for the study of the idea and theory of Comrade Kim Chong-il in Lebanon. Saying that the chuche idea raised man's position and role in the world as the fundamental question of philosophy and elucidated the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything, the reporter noted: "The Korean people have built a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence on the land of Korea on the basis of the chuche idea." A seminar on the work "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish" was held at the Secretariat of the Agricultural Hydraulics of the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party of Mozambique. Noting that Korea's socialism is strong because the leader, the party and the masses form a harmonious whole, speakers said: "The imperialists are trying to destroy the socialism of Korea, but it is a foolish dream." A seminar on the work "Young Men and Women, Be the Vanguard Unfailingly Loyal to the Party and the Leader" was held at the society for the study of Kim Chong-il's works in Hwazana District, Harare Province, Zimbabwe.
