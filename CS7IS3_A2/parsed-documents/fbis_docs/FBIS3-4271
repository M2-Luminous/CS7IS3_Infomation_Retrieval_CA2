A spokesman for the ministry said that some foreign and Russian media have quoted an anonymous intelligence source as saying the program was under the Russian Defense Ministry. The spokesman said it is astonishing that the story, circulated by Western media in search of sensation, was thoughtlessly repeated by some Russian mass media organs. "Russia is neither developing nor producing biological weapons," the spokesman stated.
