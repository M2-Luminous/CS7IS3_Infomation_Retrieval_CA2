Mr. Minister, why is this going to be implemented? [Villegas] We have decided, basically, to complement the decisions we have already adopted to protect life and guarantee calm in the Uraba region and to face this violent offensive by the Guerrilla Coordinating Board. In addition to the curfew, we have decided to strengthen our military presence there, prohibit alcohol consumption, suspend permits for the possession of weapons, speed justice procedures, and intensify efforts to implement the Uraba Plan. [Canal] Mr. Minister, are the measures you have just announced enough to guarantee the elections process in Uraba and to reestablish public order in that region? [Villegas] The idea of the government, society, and the people of Uraba is to carry out an elections process capable of strengthening democracy, enhancing that region's political life, and becoming a main tool for facing the Guerrilla Coordinating Board, which once again has made it clear, through bloodshed, violence, and terrorism, that it is interested in preventing the Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement from gaining political support in this region. [Canal] Thank you, Mr. Minister. In the next few days, decrees will be issued to authorize these measures.
