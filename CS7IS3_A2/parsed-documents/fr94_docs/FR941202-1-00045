FR941202-1-00045 FR941202-1-00006 Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.110, concerning the approved exceptions to the requirements that disturbed areas be backfilled and graded to achieve AOC, by adding cross-referenced provisions regarding non-mountaintop removal mining operations on steep slopes, mountaintop removal mining operations, and mining operations on areas with thin and thick overburden. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.120, concerning the requirement for highwall elimination, by cross-referencing provisions containing requirements that apply to previously and continuously mined areas and areas subject to AOC provisions. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.130, concerning the requirement that disturbed areas achieve an allowable postmining slope, be deleting the phrase following a cross-reference to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.530 that reads ``which addresses alternative criteria for stability and the protection of the environment and the public health and safety.'' Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.510, by requiring that, in addition to remaining operations on continuously mined and previously mined areas, remining operations on areas with remaining highwalls subject to the AOC provisions also comply with other cross-referenced program requirements. Utah proposes to delete existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.550, 553.551, and 553.552, concerning references to mountaintop removal mining operations, and thin and thick overburden standards, by inserting the cross-references at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.110. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.611 and 553.612 by referring to the phrase ``continuously mined areas'' as ``CMA.'' Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.650, concerning highwall management under the AOC provisions, by deleting introductory language that reads ``coal mining and reclamation operations which are not located on PMA's or CMA's and are located on areas which are subject to the approximate original contour provisions which include.'' Utah proposes to delete existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.651, concerning highwall management under the Utah AOC provisions, by inserting the cross-reference to non-mountaintop removal mining operations on steep slopes at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.110. Utah proposes to create new Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.651, regarding the applicability date of Utah's AOC provisions, by requiring that where final backfilling and grading was completed and the phase I bond was released prior to June 2, 1992, no redisturbance of a reclaimed highwall will be required. Highwalls which were approved under R645&hyph;301&hyph;553.652, the rule commonly referred to as the ``AOC alternative,'' after December 13, 1982, are subject to the retroactive application of current rule R645&hyph;301&hyph;552.650, providing the subject highwall has not been reclaimed and phase I bond was not released prior to June 2, 1992.
