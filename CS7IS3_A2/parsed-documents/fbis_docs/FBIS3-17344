This was stated by Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev at today's session of the Republic's National Assembly (Parliament). The session continued to discuss the tragic incidents in Baku in January 1990. According to the parliament chairman, the involvement of these two former high-ranking officials in the Baku massacre has been proven. The archives that came to light show that on the night of 20 January 1990 Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist Party, was in the headquarters of the Army unit stationed in Baku and, together with the former Soviet Defense Minister Dmitriy Yazov and the former Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, directed the deployment of the special purpose detachments in the Azerbaijani capital. The investigation has also revealed that Ayaz Mutalibov asked the former Soviet leadership to urgently send an additional contingent to Baku. The dispatch of this contingent resulted in a greater tragedy. Mutalibov exploited the situation to take power. Claims to the effect that the Republic's leadership was unaware of the introduction of a state of emergency and the deployment of troops in Baku were also exposed as lies. The documents and witnesses attest that they knew of these developments a day before the tragedy.
