The EU points out that "this right also forms the basis for parliamentary immnunity of representatives elected in democratic states." More generally, the EU expresses in this text its "concern" at the worsening human rights situation in Turkey and states that "the fight against terrorism must be conducted with full respect for the law and human rights." The EU wants to renew its "appeal in favor of a political solution to the problems posed in south-east Turkey" and is earnestly requesting the Turkish Government "to honor its commitments regarding constitutional reforms in the field of human rights."
