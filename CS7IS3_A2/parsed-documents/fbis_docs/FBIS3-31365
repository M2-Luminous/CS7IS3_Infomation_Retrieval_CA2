Today the KK will make a decision concerning further action of the trade union. "Marian Krzaklewski stated that a strategic strike would be possible; such a strike would force the authorities to make decisions favorable to employees. Nothing seems to show that this demonstration has made any impression on the government, which we expected: There are no preparations for talks or any serious corrections of the budget," we learned from KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak after the Tuesday [15 February] session of the Presidium. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak replied to Krzaklewski (who proposed negotiations in order to "avoid the escalation of social tension") that "a bad tradition, inherited from the former years, is the transferring of each conflict to the central level." This is why their meeting "should be preceded by a debate on the scope of the problems that may be discussed in a different mode and that call for an official meeting." He added that difficult problems should be resolved "in a working mode" and that such talks are already being held by the Labor Ministry. For "S," Pawlak's letter is no answer, as it were. He already proposed that they resume negotiations on social guarantees, but, in this matter, "they presented their opinion and submitted conditions that have so far been impossible to implement." What can a "strategic strike" be like? "We realize that it is no longer the time or not yet the time for us to be able to "galvanize to action" the entire country. However, we are a well-organized and strong union and we are able to continue a strike until we win. One can imagine, for example, the strike of several branches or several regions of great importance to the country, or a progressive strike in all the regions of "S." Or merging all these three strike forms and demonstrations," says Zak.
