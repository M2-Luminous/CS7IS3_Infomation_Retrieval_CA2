Jeszenszky arrived in Belgrade for an official visit, at the invitation of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. Speaking to the press after the talks, Jeszenszky said that Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians (DCVH), was a welcome presence at the talks. He said topics discussed included bilateral relations, economic problems and ways to develop economic cooperation. The two sides agreed that both Hungary and Yugoslavia should form bridges with Europe and the Middle East -- their geographic location should be utilized. Jeszenszky added that a priority consideration for Hungary is that the Hungarians in Vojvodina should have a secure future. "Along with the presence of Andras Agoston, another encouragement was the fact that President Milosevic said the Vojvodina Hungarians will enjoy full equality. He also said they can and will have institutions which they deem necessary for themselves. This is significant not only for our two countries, but can serve as a model settlement for the ethnically mixed region," Jeszenszky said. Milosevic also said the Serbian Government does not tolerate any actions that could lead to citizens fleeing their birthplaces. The main problem today is of an economic nature, and this is largely the consequence of the sanctions. Jeszenszky said he is not competent to judge whether the conditions offered will be sufficient for peace in Bosnia, but he voiced the hope that the proposal tabled by the European Union, based on the Kinkel-Juppe proposal, could bring an end to the conflict. Jeszenszky said the Serbian side is committed to meet the expectations and the motions. The Hungarian foreign minister discussed the so-called Krajina issue with the Serbian president, and the matter of territories near Hungary, such as Baranya. "Large numbers of refugees have arrived in Hungary from there, fleeing the war and threats by people who forced them to leave. I expressed the hope that these people will be able to return to their homes as soon as possible," Jeszenszky said. He also voiced the hope that major facilities like the Adria oil pipeline will again become operational. "It is important for hostilities to finally come to an end here, not only for the two countries, but for all Europe as well," the foreign minister said. Jeszenszky again stated that Hungary would gladly support the lifting of sanctions, but this can only take place if Serbia wins approval from the international community, which can be achieved only through their actions. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said his talks with Foreign Minister Jeszenszky touched upon all walks of bilateral relations and international life. "During our talks on Friday, we should deal more with bilateral relations. With the approach of an end to the south-Slav crisis, it will be possible to expand relations with the neighbouring countries. Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is the first arrival, and his visit indicates we have arrived at the start of normalizing relations with the neighbouring countries," the Yugoslav foreign minister said.
