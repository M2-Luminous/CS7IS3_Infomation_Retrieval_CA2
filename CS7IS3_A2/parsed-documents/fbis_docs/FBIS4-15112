The civil war in that country has been continuing for almost two years. Tajik society is split by not only political, but also clan enmity. Having sat them down around a table, the UN secretary general's personal representative, the Uruguayan Ramirez Piriz-Bollon, noted the historic significance of the moment and voiced the hope that they will quickly find mutual understanding. Russian diplomats have succeeded for the first time in bringing the warring Tajiks together and giving them the opportunity to communicate. The two sides are not setting prior conditions, but it clear from statements made previously that the path to agreement will be difficult. The head of the delegation from Dushanbe -- Tajikistan Minister of Labor and Employment Shukurjon Zuhurov -- suggests starting with the refugee problem, regarding it as the most pressing. The oppositionists, who are headed by former kazikalon [as transliterated] (supreme spiritual judge) Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda, who is currently living in Tehran, have brought their own package of broader ideas. They are demanding the resignation of Emomili Rakhmonov, head of the parliament, the creation of a state council involving all political organizations, the formation of a coalition transitional government, and the introduction of UN peacemaking troops into Tajikistan. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the Tajik opposition is not homogeneous in terms of its views and demands. It can be divided into three categories: democratic, pro-Islamic, and implacable. Turajonzoda himself admits that he cannot speak on behalf of absolutely everybody who disagrees with the current state of affairs and would like a change of political system in Tajikistan. A number of opposition leaders abroad claim a special role in the leadership and do not recognize the current delegation's authority. Taking account of the "delicacy of the matter," none of the mediators will venture an assessment of the sides' positions or predictions. Piriz-Bollon pointed out that the first step toward reconciliation must be an agreement on a cease-fire on Tajikistan territory and the Tajik-Afghan border. Everybody is in agreement with this wish.
