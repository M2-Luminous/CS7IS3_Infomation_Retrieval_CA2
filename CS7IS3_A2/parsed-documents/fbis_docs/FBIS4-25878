During the meeting he stressed that because the Sino-British talks on the constitutional system had broken up, Hong Kong's three-tier councils elected by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council will terminate on 30 June 1997, no matter what methods are adopted; these three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1 July 1997. He hoped that the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions will, under the banner of loving the country and Hong Kong, extensively unite people in all circles in Hong Kong and make contributions to Hong Kong's steady transition as well as its stability and prosperity. Cheng Yiu-tong, deputy chief of the delegation, said after the meeting that Qian Qichen stressed that China and Britain are big countries and need to improve the current situation. Although the talks on the constitutional system have ruptured, there are still opportunities for both sides to cooperate in other fields, including the economic field. Recent talks on the new airport and military sites have made headway and the British Government will send personnel to Beijing soon. These indicate that there will be an improvement in Sino-British relations. That the three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1997 does not mean there is anything wrong with the members but because the electoral system was unilaterally decided by the British side, Qian Qichen said. Cheng Yiu-tong quoted Qian Qichen as saying that he agreed that attention should be strengthened on the Hong Kong people's livelihood, because this is beneficial to maintaining Hong Kong's steady transition in the coming three years and the continuous development of the mainland's reform and opening up serves as a good guarantee for Hong Kong's steady transition. Also present at the meeting was Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.
