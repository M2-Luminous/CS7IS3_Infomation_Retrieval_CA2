FR940216-0-00189 FR940216-0-00010 VOCS1=Total summer VOC emissions in VOC Control Region 1 in terms of grams per mile VOCS2=Total summer VOC emissions in VOC Control Region 2 in terms of grams per mile (ii) Total winter VOC emissions shall be given by the following equations: VOCW=(VOCE/1000) VOCW=Total winter VOC emissions in terms of grams per mile (7) Phase I total VOC emissions performance. (i) The total summer VOC emissions performance of the target fuel in percentage terms from baseline levels shall be given by the following equations during Phase I: VOCS1%=[100% × (VOCS1^1.306 g/mi)]/(1.306 g/mi) VOCS2%=[100% × (VOCS2^1.215 g/mi)]/(1.215 g/mi) VOC1%=Percentage change in VOC emissions from baseline levels in VOC Control Region 1 VOC2%=Percentage change in VOC emissions from baseline levels in VOC Control Region 2 (ii) The total winter VOC emissions performance of the target fuel in percentage terms from baseline levels shall be given by the following equations during Phase I: VOCW%=[100% × (VOCW^0.660 g/mi)]/(0.660 g/mi) VOCW%=Percentage change in winter VOC emissions from baseline levels (8) Phase II total VOC emissions performance. (i) The total summer VOC emissions performance of the target fuel in percentage terms from baseline levels shall be given by the following equations during Phase II: VOCS1%=[100% × (VOCS1^1.4663 g/mi)]/(1.4663 g/mi) VOCS2%=[100% × (VOCS2^1.3991 g/mi)]/(1.3991 g/mi) (ii) The total winter VOC emissions performance of the target fuel in percentage terms from baseline levels shall be given by the following equation during Phase II: VOCW%=[100% × (VOC^1.341 g/mi)]/(1.341 g/mi) for (d) NO X performance. (1) The summer NO X emissions performance of gasolines shall be given by the following equations: NO X =NO X (b)+[NO X (b) × Y(t)/100] Y NOX (t)= (w 1 × N n )+(w 2 × H n )^1 × 100 where NO X =NO X emissions in milligrams/mile Y NOx (t)=NO X performance of target fuel in terms of percentage change from baseline NO X (b)=Baseline NO X emissions as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the appropriate phase and season
