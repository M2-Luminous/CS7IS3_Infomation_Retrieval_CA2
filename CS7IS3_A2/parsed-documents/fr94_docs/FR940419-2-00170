CSO Monitoring_The permittee should develop a comprehensive, representative monitoring program that measures the frequency, duration, flow rate, volume and pollutant concentration of CSO discharges and assesses the impact of the CSOs on the receiving waters. The monitoring program should include necessary CSO effluent and ambient in-stream monitoring and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessment, toxicity testing and sediment sampling. Monitoring parameters should include, for example, oxygen demanding pollutants, nutrients, toxic pollutants, sediment contaminants, pathogens, bacteriological indicators (e.g., Enterococcus, E. Coli), and toxicity. A representative sample of overflow points can be selected that is sufficient to allow characterization of CSO discharges and their water quality impacts and to facilitate evaluation of control plan alternatives. d. Modeling_Modeling of a sewer system is recognized as a valuable tool for predicting sewer system response to various wet weather events and assessing water quality impacts when evaluating different control strategies and alternatives. EPA supports the proper and effective use of models, where appropriate, in the evaluation of the nine minimum controls and the development of the long-term CSO control plan. It is also recognized that there are many models which may be used to do this. These models range from simple to complex. Having decided to use a model, the permittee should base its choice of a model on the characteristics of its sewer system, the number and location of overflow points, and the sensitivity of the receiving water body to the CSO discharges. Use of models should include appropriate calibration and verification with field measurements. The sophistication of the model should relate to the complexity of the system to be modeled and to the information needs associated with evaluation of CSO control options and water quality impacts. EPA believes that continuous simulation models, using historical rainfall data, may be the best way to model sewer systems, CSOs, and their impacts. Because of the iterative nature of modeling sewer systems, CSOs, and their impacts, monitoring and modeling efforts are complementary and should be coordinated. 2. Public Participation In developing its long-term CSO control plan, the permittee will employ a public participation process that actively involves the affected public in the decision-making to select the long-term CSO controls. The affected public includes rate payers, industrial users of the sewer system, persons who reside downstream from the CSOs, persons who use and enjoy these downstream waters, and any other interested persons. 3. Consideration of Sensitive Areas EPA expects a permittee's long-term CSO control plan to give the highest priority to controlling overflows to sensitive areas. Sensitive areas, as determined by the NPDES authority in coordination with State and Federal agencies, as appropriate, include designated Outstanding National Resource Waters, National Marine Sanctuaries, waters with threatened or endangered species and their habitat, waters with primary contact recreation, public drinking water intakes or their designated protection areas, and shellfish beds. For such areas, the long-term CSO control plan should: a. Prohibit new or significantly increased overflows; b. i. Eliminate or relocate overflows that discharge to sensitive areas wherever physically possible and economically achievable, except where elimination or relocation would provide less environmental protection than additional treatment; or ii. Where elimination or relocation is not physically possible and economically achievable, or would provide less environmental protection than additional treatment, provide the level of treatment for remaining overflows deemed necessary to meet WQS for full protection of existing and designated uses. In any event, the level of control should not be less than those described in Evaluation of Alternatives below; and
