FBIS4-29311 "dreas117_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 North Korea Daily Warns Japan Not To Develop Nuclear Weapons Daily Warns Japan Not To Develop Nuclear Weapons SK1706103694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1015 GMT 17 Jun 94 SK1706103694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Dangerous Nuclear Design" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign Minister, Koji Kakizawa, recently said "in view of the actual conditions of international politics, it is hard to state the use of nuclear weapons is a total violation of the international law," while the Japanese Government supported the super power's doctrine of "nuclear deterrent," contending that "it is impossible to deny even the nuclear deterrent by totally denying nuclear weapons." NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that what Japan seeks in accelerating nuclear armament is, in the long run, to use nuclear weapons as a means of realising its dominationist ambition. It is a very grave development that the Japanese Government says "yes" to the use of nuclear weapons, the analyst says, and continues: This sounds a note of warning that if Japan's nuclear armament were not checked, it would bring a serious disaster to mankind. In actuality, the Japanese Government has stockpiled a large quantity of plutonium, seeking to convert Japan into a nuclear power. It launched even a space rocket capable of delivering nuclear warheads. This bespeaks that all the regions of the world are within Japan's nuclear range. Japan, which is seeking the repetition of its past policy of aggression, will make no scruple of plunging the Asian people into a nuclear disaster for the purpose of conquering Asia and restoring its old colonial empire. If the Japanese reactionaries, captive to reinvasion ambition, think that they will get scotfree after using nuclear weapons, it is a mistake. Japan's nuclear armament and use of nuclear weapons will drive it to destruction.
