In a statement made today, al-Qidrah said that although an agreement was reached during the recent Palestinian-Israeli negotiations concerning the establishment of the Palestinian police and its number, weapons, and deployment areas, it would be difficult to sign a final agreement without resolving certain problems. Al-Qidrah expressed the hope that the next round of negotiations between the two delegations next week will be decisive and achieve the desired positive results. He called on Israel to demonstrate its seriousness and credibility by quickly implementing its commitments under the Oslo and Cairo agreements, noting that the Palestinian delegation is abiding by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's instructions to work for the establishment of a just peace to ensure the life and future of the peoples in the area. Al-Qidrah affirmed the importance of the Egyptian role under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa in tackling the causes of any possible collapse in the talks from time to time. Al-Qidrah called for reviving bilateral Arab coordination among the five Arab parties taking part in the negotiations with Israel in accordance with the Arab League Council's decision.
