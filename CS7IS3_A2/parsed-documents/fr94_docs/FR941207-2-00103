FR941207-2-00103 FR941207-2-00072 Economic Development Initiative (EDI) or EDI grants means the provision of economic development grant assistance under Section 108(q) of the Act, as authorized by Section 232 of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;233) (the ``1994 Act''). Economic development project means an activity or activities (including eligible mixed use projects with housing components) that are eligible under Section 108 of the Act and under 24 CFR 570.703. Empowerment Zone means an urban area so designated by the Secretary pursuant to 24 CFR part 597 (see January 18, 1994 interim rule, 59 FR 2700). Qualifying Empowerment Zone area means an urban area nominated by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located for consideration of designation as an Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, and which meets the eligibility requirements for a nominated area pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. Strategic Plan means a strategy developed and agreed to by the nominating local government(s) and State(s) and submitted in partial fulfillment of the application requirements for designation as an Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR Part 597. (C) Background This NOFA provides EDI grant funds to support those communities that submitted applications on behalf of areas that qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone and that have remaining authority to utilize Section 108 funds of at least $40 million, or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application from joint entities, that have aggregate Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment Zone application of at least $40 million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application from two or more entities, HUD will accept a joint EDI application from public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to ยง570.702. However, each of the joint applicants will be expected to execute separate EDI grant agreements and separate loan commitments and issuance documents for their related Section 108 loan guarantees. EDI grant awards will not be made to designated urban Empowerment Zone entities designated under that competition. EDI is intended to complement and enhance the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (see 24 CFR 570.700&hyph;710 for regulations governing the Section 108 program). This provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, and large scale physical development projects. HUD is authorized pursuant to Section 108 to guarantee notes issued by CDBG entitlement communities and nonentitlement units of general local government eligible to receive funds under their State CDBG program. The regulations governing the Section 108 program are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. EDI grants shall also be subject to the rules found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. Additionally, assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). Section 3 requires that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated from certain HUD financial assistance be directed to low- and very-low income persons. The eligible activities for which funding is provided under this NOFA are consistent with the objectives of section 3. Public entities awarded funds under this NOFA and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction must comply with the applicable requirements of the interim regulations published on June 30, 1994. The Section 108 program is authorized at $2.054 billion in loan guarantee authority in Fiscal Year 1995. Under the Section 108 program, units of general local government and States, if applicable, pledge future years' CDBG allocations as security for loans guaranteed by HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under Section 108. In the event that a Section 108 funded activity fails to generate sufficient funds to repay the Section 108 loan and there are insufficient EDI grant funds or other assets available to be used to make the payment, a community would be required to use its CDBG funds to make the loan payment. Without the availability of an EDI grant, this potential disruption in availability of CDBG funds for program activities has made many communities reluctant to utilize the Section 108 loan program. EDI minimizes the potential loss of future CDBG allocations by either providing a loan loss reserve (for use in making Section 108 guaranteed loan payments if needed), lowering the cost of borrowing under Section 108 (making full or partial interest payments), or providing other credit and economic enhancements that reduce the risk that the pledged annual CDBG allocation would be required to fund repayment shortfalls. Because economic development projects carried out in, or serving, the most economically and physically distressed neighborhoods, such as those found in areas qualifying for urban Empowerment Zone designation, face the greatest risk of loss of Section 108 loan funds, HUD intends to provide a maximum ratio of EDI grant funds to Section 108 loan funds of one-to-one. An EDI grant can reduce the risk to future CDBG funds: (1) By directly enhancing the security of the guaranteed loan;
