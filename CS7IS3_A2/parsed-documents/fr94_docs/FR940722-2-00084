FR940722-2-00084 FR940722-2-00056 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration Notice of Changes in Status of Extended Benefit (EB) Periods for the States of Washington and Maine This notice announces changes in benefit period eligibility under the Extended Benefit (EB) Program for the States of Washington and Maine. Summary The following changes have occurred in the States of Washington and Maine since the publication of the last notice regarding States' EB status: •May 29, 1994 Washington State triggered ``on'' to EB based on its 13-week Insured Unemployment Rate (IUR) exceeding 5.0 percent and surpassing 120 percent of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week periods in each of the preceding two calendar years. •June 25, 1994 The EB trigger mechanisms for Maine have been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on'' to EB since the week beginning May 1, 1994. However, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week period ended for Maine on June 25, 1995. Information for Claimants The duration of benefits payable in the EB Program, and the terms and conditions on which they are payable, are governed by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended, and the operating instructions issued to the States by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the case of a State beginning an EB period, the State employment security agency will furnish a written notice of potential entitlement to each individual who has exhausted all rights to regular benefits and is potentially eligible for extended benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(1)). In the case of a Stat ending an EB period, the State employment security agency will furnish a written notice to each individual who is filing claims for Extended Benefits informing them of the ending of the EB period and its effect on the individual's right to Extended Benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(4)). Persons who believe they may be entitled to EB benefits, or who wish to inquire about their rights under the programs, should contact the nearest State employment Service office of unemployment compensation claims office in their locality. Signed at Washington, DC, on July 18, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training.
