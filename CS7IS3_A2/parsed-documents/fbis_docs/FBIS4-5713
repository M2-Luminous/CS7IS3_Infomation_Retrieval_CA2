FBIS4-5713 "dreas071_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 South Korea PRC's Wu Xueqian Meets Press on DPRK Issue PRC's Wu Xueqian Meets Press on DPRK Issue SK1304074294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0729 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304074294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The vice chairman of China's Political Consultative Conference, Wu Xueqian, said Wednesday that Beijing respects Pyongyang's independence and has limited influence over its neighbor. Meeting the press at the Shilla Hotel to wind up his visit here, Wu said the perception that the North Koreans do what the Chinese tell them to "is not true." "We discuss matters of common interest with the North Koreans as this is of help to both of us, but it is entirely up to each side to take action on the basis of such talks," he added. Asked about the need for U.N. sanctions against North Korea if it failed to change its policy in spite of the Security Council president's statement on the nuclear dispute, China's one-time foreign minister simply stressed the importance of dialogue. "Nobody can tell how the dispute will develop," he said. Touching on North Korea's nuclear capability, he said he could not make any judgements because he had no information on its nuclear program. China and North Korea have maintained a long relationship, and bilateral economic links have developed rapidly despite diplomatic normalization between Beijing and Seoul. Wu said, "We'll keep our relationship with North Korea on the five principles of peaceful co- existence, equality, reciprocity and others." Asked to comment on the issue of revising Chinese school textbooks describing the Korean war as an invasion by the South, he said, "I don't know much about it because it's not my area of responsibility. When I return home I'll check into it with the Education Ministry and if the need for revision is justified, I'll see to it that the textbooks are revised." He refrained from commenting on the Northward invasion theory, however. No pressure or sanctions should be used against Pyongyang to maintain stability and peace on the Korean peninsula, because such action would only worsen the problem, he said. "President Kim Yong-sam also shares this view," he added. "I hope for increased economic cooperation between China and South Korea as the two economies are mutually complementary." Asked about North Korean defectors in northeast China, he said, "There may be such North Koreans but I don't think there are many of them in China. As far as I know, they have no influence on Beijing- Pyongyang relations."
