Durban SA Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said Samuel Ndizimbovu, 25, died from gunshot and stab wounds on Saturday. Police, meanwhile, were investigating the attack and no one had been arrested by Sunday night. Four gunmen opened fire on a group of mainly youths preparing for an African National Congress [ANC] voter education workshop in rural Mahehle, south-west of Pietermaritzburg. Fourteen people were killed at the scene and two were seriously wounded. Police said 11 people were killed inside a hut while three died trying to flee their attackers in the early hours of Saturday morning. Midlands ANC Chairman Harry Gwala said those killed were preparing for an ANC voter education workshop in the area at noon. South African Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said a group of about 16 youths had spent the night at an abandoned house, where they came under attack by four men. The attackers opened fire on the group, while some victims were stabbed to death. Maj Naidoo confirmed a voter education programme was being planned in the area. A Creighton police spokesman said the attack occurred about 14km from the rural town, south-west of Pietermaritzburg. He said the attackers used automatic weapons and homemade guns. Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said he suspected "those who don't want people to vote," were responsible for the massacre. He said the area had been relatively stable with no recent incidents of political violence. Nearby Ixopo and Richmond have, however, been wracked by intense political fighting since 1990 with a massacre at Masanagazane, outside Richmond, two weeks ago when 12 people were killed. The ANC was investigating the attack, said Chief Mlaba. The ANC's Natal premier election candidate, Jacob Zuma, on Sunday told reporters he feared rural supporters would face increasing violence in the run up to elections. Maj Naidoo said police were offering a substantial reward for information leading to arrests and convictions of those responsible for the Mahehle massacre. He named the dead as: Mdeni Malunga, 15; Mbuso Nxasane, 17; Dumisani Duzela, 13; Thamsanqa Ngcobe, 15; Sokelazwa Mbanjwa, 16; Bongwela Mbanjwa, 16; Tholozami Cyril Shobo, 12; Mandlenkosi Mbhele, 26; Sifiso Ndlovu, 13; Givi Ndlovu, 13; Sibusiso Dusuzi Maphumulo, 15; Siyabonga Ngubo, 17; Duduzi Mia, 28; and Kulama Madlala, 16.
