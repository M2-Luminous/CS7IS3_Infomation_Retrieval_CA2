Correspondent Yi Il-hwa reports from Tokyo: [Begin Yi recording] The Japanese Government decided on steps it could take if sanctions are imposed on North Korea regarding the nuclear problem. The steps for sanctions worked out by the Japanese Government essentially include 10 points. These points include restrictions on the exchange of people, such as banning diplomats' contacts, and restriction on money and materials. The restrictions on the exchange of people stipulate that Japanese diplomats would be prohibited from contacting North Korean diplomats in a third country, the visit of Japanese Government officials to North Korea would be in principle banned, and government officials would not be permitted to use a special airplane flying between Tokyo and North Korea. The restrictions on money and materials stipulate the banning of intermediate export-import trade, suspension of transactions in capitals, including investment and loans, and the discontinuation of remittance of money to North Korea through the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], a demand of the United States. These restrictions also contain the banning of exchanges of culture, art, and science, including music, sports, and technology. In addition to these steps finalized by the Japanese Government, Japan decided to actively cooperate the United States in collaboration with the ROK, even if the United States independently takes steps on sanctions in the event the UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution. In the event that U.S. forces launch naval blockade activities, Japan will see to it that the Japanese Self-Defense Forces can participate in the logistic support, including the supply of materials and fuel.
