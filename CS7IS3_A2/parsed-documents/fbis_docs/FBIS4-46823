Medina, chief of the Subdivision for the Development of New Economic and Financial Structures of Russia's Ministry of Economics: "Between the Past and the Future"] [Text] Today, in order not to be bogged down in the current chaos of events and to select the correct direction and key positions for a systematic implementation of advanced economic policy, it is necessary to become aware of the objective cause-and-effect relationship and direction of the global processes that have shaken our country's economy. It must be admitted that the dying away of investment processes was the main reason for the downfall of the administration and command economic system. The existing scheme for distributing investment resources and bringing them to the investment process came into conflict with the scale and complexity of the serviced system and became an obstacle to expanded reproduction and further economic development. The continuation of its vital activity led to the fact that the system ate itself away, thereby destroying its future, that is, the future of the next generations. All of us know well the symptoms of this: inefficiency, total deficit, corruption, and so forth. Thus, the need for a fundamental change in the system from the standpoint of providing new opportunities for its economic growth was the objective reality. First of all, this implies the birth of a new scheme for the functioning of investment resources in it and for the appearance of new subjects of the investment process. Attempts at cosmetic corrections through the introduction of cost-accounting elements into the old system could only delay the necessary changes and aggravate the process. The transformations begun in the economic sphere in 1992, which were connected mainly with the transformation of property relations and included price liberalization, privatization, demonopolization of the economy, and so forth, in the end were supposed to serve the establishment of the necessary base for investments from the standpoint of the formation of their subjects. Real results in this area are quite tangible and do not need additional comments. Costs in the course of practical implementation of the presented directions were largely due to the fact that at the moment of the break-up of and impossibility for creative labor flaws and processes serving the goals of destruction in any system, that is, money-grubbing, corruption, group and individual egoism, crime, and so forth, were manifested in hypertrophied form. As a result, in the absence of rational control of processes a situation has been created, in which the economic system is being destroyed to a level exceeding the limits of its viability. This is expressed in the fact that the economic crisis experienced by the country is characterized by a decline in production and by a scale of destruction of the economy unprecedented in their depth. In the last 4 years the general decrease in production has approached 50 percent of the mark and in individual sectors the decline has reached 70 percent. There is an especially difficult situation in science-intensive sectors of industry, which are the basis for present economic growth. The rapid drop in competitiveness of Russian industrial output, destruction of cooperative ties and technological chains in the manufacture of complex types of products, and increase in the export of raw-material goods with a reduction in the export of goods with a high degree of processing point to the growing trend toward the country's deindustrialization and transformation of the Russian economy into a raw-material periphery of the world market. However, the main danger lies in the fact that an uncontrolled complete stoppage of production processes can entail, as a minimum, the elimination of the viability of entire cities and even regions. It is a question of fully civilian sectors, beginning with the textile industry and so forth. At present the maintenance and normal functioning of the social infrastructure serving the population can be ensured only at the expense of operating enterprises. Mass unemployment and poverty as a direct consequence of the indicated process can serve as the basis not only for a sharp rise in crime, but also for a powerful social explosion, which will eliminate any opportunity for revival. Furthermore, the fact that in a number of cases production stoppage requires procedures for a reliable suspension of technological processes should be kept in mind. Taking into account the scale of the possible process, the state does not have funds for these purposes. As a result, there is a real threat of ecological disasters. Our task is to avoid such a tragic development of events! The uniqueness of the moment is that at present the scale of the calamity has not yet acquired an irreversible nature. However, the fact that it is still possible to embark on a steady path of progressive development of the national economy is the chief thing. Confidence in this is based on existing--with respect to a number of questions still in the form of concepts--new approaches to the economic policy of the postprivatization period developed by specialists of the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics with the participation of practical workers and scientists. The essence of the proposed measures lies in the following: 1. It is necessary to carry out work on the determination of priorities of structural policy. At the same time, as the basic goal-oriented task it is necessary to utilize, on the one hand, the demand for the preservation and support of advanced technologies and, on the other, the inevitable suspension of especially harmful and ecologically dangerous backward technologies. Only by promoting advanced technical thought and destroying and rendering obsolete technological processes harmless, can we hope to bring about a new technological spurt and on this basis to hold a leading place in the world economic community. It is this process that should form the basis, in the first case, for investment projects developing and strengthening existing production and, in the second, for investment projects servicing procedures for clearing up finances. 2. It is necessary to bring the formation of the base for the implementation of investment processes to conclusion with a view to ensuring the transfer of enterprises into the hands of individuals, who carry out on the basis of guarantees responsible management of the property transferred to them, thereby ensuring at enterprises a transition to a management regime stimulating a real saving of expenditures. Without this the launching of any investment project is a utopia and a deliberately inefficient expenditure of funds. The process of transition to responsible management can be carried out: --through the transfer of rights of ownership of the managed facility to a real, not washed away, owner, for whom the investment attractiveness of a given enterprise is already obvious and who is prepared to carry out investment activity, at the same time, becoming its "efficient" owner. The responsibility of the indicated individuals for an efficient development of investment processes should be ensured by a sufficient amount of capital invested by them in a given enterprise. For this purpose it is necessary to think out procedures for investment bids and for secondary emission of privatization enterprises, as well as for privatization for money; --through the transfer of property for responsible management to individuals carrying out investment activity at enterprises in the process of clearing up their finances under conditions of strictly regulated responsibility for the results obtained. In this case there is a need for a legislative base ensuring the regulation of procedures for responsibility and the conditions of its occurrence. 3. For the purpose of determining real sources and volumes of available state investment resources, it is necessary to reexamine the distribution of budget funds assigned for the realization of investment policy and to provide for their allocation strictly on the goal-oriented programmed principle according to the established priorities of economic restructuring. Taking into consideration that today large national private capitals and funds of foreign investors are drawn into the investment process with great caution and that it is naive to count on their mass inflow until a really existing favorable investment climate is created, it is necessary to pay special attention to the population's funds accumulated in various kinds of accumulating organizations--mainly check investment funds, nonstate pension funds, and so forth. With regard to check investment funds we must realize that the system of accumulation of the population's funds with mandatory current payments established on their basis at present under conditions of inflation and the economic crisis does not meet the constructive goals of its establishment--to be the social guarantor for the population. In order to survive, in a short time funds must be transformed from the apparatus of accumulation and redistribution of privatization rights in the form of vouchers into a mechanism of an efficient redistribution of real capital. In all cases, only by servicing real social needs and being oriented toward the population's vital interests, not by getting off with current handouts, can accumulating organizations of any type and direction acquire a long-term perspective for their activity. 4. As the main factor permeating the entire investment infrastructure, it is necessary to apply the new scheme for bringing investment resources to their direct consumers. Under existing conditions of inflation and the decline in production currently existing channels--direct investments and investment credit--cannot launch the investment process. Direct investments as a system are not fully justified from the standpoint of attaining some efficiency. With regard to investment credits, under the existing procedure of their allocation, first, they differ little from any other forms of distribution of "cheap" state funds and, second, are a direct channel for forcing the inflationary flow. The lack in the country of investment banks with strict restrictions on the performance of any other, except investment, operations under conditions of the difference--incomparable in profitability--in credit servicing of various spheres of activity inevitably pushes funds, which are allocated through the credit system for investment purposes, into the sphere of financial, trade, and any other business affording the opportunity to obtain a higher, even to the smallest degree, norm of profit. Thereby, the more funds for good investment purposes we allocate through the credit system, the bigger the inflation spiral that we will eventually get. In this connection the scheme of portfolio investments is the only way of bringing investment resources to investment processes without system losses. It is necessary to establish a system of state guarantees for private investments on the basis of the use of stock market tools, because the stock market is the main regulator of investment processes in a market-oriented economy and can reliably protect funds allocated in such a way against nonpurposeful use. Establishing and developing a liquid market of securities with state guarantees issued for real investment processes, we will be able to initiate the inflow of funds of private investors (including the population). The indicated approach was discussed on pages of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, No 14 of this year. Therefore, we will not further dwell on its description. The nature of the present state of the stock market, which fully reflects all the problems of the national economy, confirms the need to turn to it as to the key tool of implementation of state investment policy. On the whole, describing Russia's stock market in 1994, the crisis unpredictability of its development on the threshold of the voucher's departure from the arena of actions should be recognized. This is evident from the increasing volume of proposals and rise in the rate of highly risky and unreliable securities. Attention should also be drawn to the emerging tendency toward the expanded practice of emission of promissory notes by commercial banks. In essence, this signifies an additional uncontrolled monetary emission, which can successfully service settlements among subjects and blow up monetary circulation in the country, which is undermined as it is. The intentions of local authorities in a number of regions, whose finances have been affected by the nonpayment crisis, to accept bank promissory notes as tax payments and to pay for their own expenditures with them are the symptom of this. On the part of the state a feverish, unsuccessful search for a financial tool capable of replacing the voucher on the stock market and of saturating exchange turnovers with a mass liquid and reliable security continues on the part of the state. Experiments with the gold certificate and state treasury bonds do not yet give the proper result. The obvious inadequacy of the legislative base, which regulates the activity and development of the stock market and guarantees the property rights of private investors, who are owners of securities, creates the possibility for unprecedented deceptions of the population and dirty speculations. In order to prevent a future crisis on the stock market under these conditions, it is necessary to carry out the intervention of part of the budget funds, which are intended for the investment replenishment of the economy, in the establishment of a liquid stock exchange on the basis of securities guaranteed by the state and connected with real investment processes, in which the state is interested. In contrast to the credit mechanism of investments, a preferential use of the stock market mechanism for these purposes under present conditions gives three significant advantages: --the rate of turnover of invested funds increases sharply; --a recoverable nature of investments is guaranteed, because securities for investment projects purchased by the state with its shareholding are transferred to government agents, who are responsible for the realization of a given project, for responsible management with the right of their sale or option. In this case securities with state guarantees through stock market channels can be gradually placed among small investors, or will be transferred to the ownership of the indicated private structure as an investor; --the return on investments increases, because the mechanism of the stock market automatically, on a fair competitive basis, ensures the selection and financing of the most profitable investment projects. The following can be specific stock market tools, which realize state guarantees for investment projects with state shareholding: --shares with guarantees of buyout or the payment of dividends for specific technologies depending on the periods of realization and other characteristics of the project. Such a variant can be envisaged in case of the realization of a new or the development of an already existing technological process; --promissory notes with a regulated recording procedure and a discount rate guaranteed by means of a certain regulation. These kinds of schemes can be used in case of the realization of investment projects connected with the clearing up of finances at enterprises. It must be stated that the first tests in this direction are already being performed. In April Russia's Ministry of Finance began the preparation of the output and organization of a secondary circulation of a new state security--the state treasury bill. The development of the transparency of the stock market, which is connected primarily with an improvement in the operation of stock exchanges both on a professional plane and from the standpoint of their technical support, is the most important and necessary component of success of the proposed approach. 5. The proposed concept of state investment policy should be realized by giving wide powers, which also presuppose increased responsibility, to organizers of investment processes as represented by nonstate structures--government agents establishing their guaranteed funds on the basis of state guarantees. The essence of these powers can lie in the right to choose specific investment projects of commercial interest within the framework of investment programs approved by the government according to the priorities of structural policy. In order to ensure state guarantees in the form presented above, along with the use of funds allocated from the budget for investment purposes, it will be necessary to include the resources of Russia's Central Bank as an insurance reserve for the coverage of possible losses. The indicated credit could be determined in the ratio of 10:1 with respect to the total amount of security obligations guaranteed by the state. The state should guarantee responsibility for a successful realization of an investment project not to its organizer and direct implementer, but to persons attracted as passive investors, who have entrusted their funds to this process. A government agent should undertake the remaining responsibility and, accordingly, guarantees in exchange for the powers delegated to him. The multiplicative effect of guaranteed securities, when everyone along the vertical line, beginning with the state and ending with commercial banks, begins to act as a guarantor, is possible only on this basis. The formation of rational and efficient financial and industrial groups concentrated around the investment process and assuming their share of responsibility is possible only on this basis. 6. For the purpose of a complete realization of the expressed approaches, which excludes distortions, it is necessary to carry out significant preparatory work on the establishment of the necessary legislative base, primarily on problems of setting rules of responsibility for actions carried out within the framework of the indicated processes and of the conditions of its onset. It is necessary to work out legislative norms regulating responsible management of property (not its transfer to trusteeship), implying by this all possible variants and objects of management. The urgency of such a formulation is determined by the fact that the sufficiency of guarantees in any case, with the exception of the state, is ensured primarily by strong judicial and legal protection based on existing legislation. The solution of the problem at the level of subordinate legislation is not sufficient as a legislative base during court examination. In this connection it is a matter of the development of an entire package of legislative acts with the indicated direction. In conclusion it must be said that any of the proposed schemes can be doomed to failure if we, each of us, do not realize that only by treating the matter from the standpoint of responsibility, not personal mercenary interest, only by feeling personal responsibility for our country's future, will we be able to build a new society worthy of our children. We have no other choice!
