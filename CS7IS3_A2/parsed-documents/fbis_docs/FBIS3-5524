The government has decided that the Japan Development Bank [JDB] can increase its loans to IDO for this project. As there are signs that progress will be made at Japan-U.S. negotiations, the government wants to help bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion and believes that supporting plans to increase the number of base stations will help. Increasing the number of base stations for the Motorola cellular phone system became a focal point of Japan-U.S. negotiations on mobile and car telephones and the IDO submitted a compromise proposal designed to front-load the expansion plan. The JDB awarded the IDO loans amounting to 17 billion yen in fiscal 1992 and 25 billion yen in fiscal 1993. Under current regulations the loans can cover a maximum of only 50 percent of the investment total. The government, however, is trying to increase this about 70 percent. If it fails to achieve this, it will provide full support for loans to be provided at the 50 percent level.
