[Salas] Right from the start, the COB assembly decided to reorganize the Bolivian labor union movement. Reports by the seven COB working committees all reflect the workers' demands on the need to defend their and the country's interests. We attained our first objective: the first proposal regarding changes and amendments to achieve a modern labor organization in keeping with the current political situation in the country and world was approved in a political document of the 10th COB Congress. The assembly has ended, and the results of the COB Congress are quite clear and objective. The COB ratified its strong opposition to neo-liberalism, to the government's socio-economic policy, and ratified the prospect of changes within the COB to safeguard its institutional existence. The Congress fulfilled the objectives established at the start as a result of the vision and responsibility entrusted to it by its grassroots. [Miranda] What does the approved political document state? [Salas] This document will guide the COB's organic life for the next few years. Aside from the documents that were approved -- the congress discussed three documents -- I want to point out something very important that the workers must follow: To uphold the proposals referring to the struggle and life of the Bolivian workers. More often than not these documents do not tacitly express the legitimate rights of the working class of a nation. In my opinion the most important thing is to organize, guide, and meet the workers' most urgent needs. Political parties should not impose their policies on the workers. The charges made against me in this regard are false and by no means reflect the truth. Obviously I am a member of the ASD [Democratic Socialist Alternative], but this in no way means I will blindly follow the ideology of my party. There is enough will and autonomy to adopt decisions and I will see to it that these principles are respected. [Miranda] What political tendency will the COB follow? [Salas] One thing is clear: Oligarchy and U.S. imperialism is spreading in Bolivia, seeking to impose a long-term hegemony that will affect the Bolivian economy, society, and politics. We are fully aware that this foreign intervention policy causes suffering to the people and affects the country's interests. The policy that will guide the COB's organic life will be to implement a labor policy that will prevent that hegemony. We will wage a total struggle against imperialism and to adopt a staunch civil resistance to neo-liberalism in Bolivia. [Miranda] What are the positive results of the COB Congress? [Salas] A political debate within the Bolivian labor sector is necessary, absolutely necessary. It improves the organization's life and guides fellow workers. I maintain, however, that the legitimate interests of the workers are paramount. I am absolutely convinced that any political stance within the COB is important and deserves to be respected within the democratic framework that has characterized the activities of the workers in the labor union. Ideological confrontations are normal. However, I insist that the workers' plans come above everything else. I urge miners, peasants, railway workers, labor unions, and all other COB members to place the unity of the working class above any ideological disagreement. They must place the unity of peasants, of those who do not earn a salary, above everything because only thus will the COB be strong enough to defend the interests of the working class.
