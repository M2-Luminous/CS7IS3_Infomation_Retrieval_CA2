FR940505-1-00021 FR940505-1-00011 In early 1993, following informal discussions with NHTSA, ACRA submitted a written request for a legal interpretation of a proposal to list both the dealer and the car rental company as joint transferees on a vehicle's MCO. ACRA sought assurances that, under this arrangement, it would be permissible for only one of these entities to sign the odometer disclosure statement as transferee in the initial transfer and as transferor in a subsequent transaction. It was ACRA's hope that this procedure would alleviate the burdens associated with the use of third party agents. NHTSA confirmed that only one of several listed transferors or transferees need execute an odometer disclosure statement in the course of a vehicle transfer. However, NHTSA also noted that, in this case, the listing of joint transferees on the MCO would defeat the vehicle manufacturer's exemption from the odometer disclosure requirements (under Section 580.6(b)), as one of the listed transferees would be using the vehicle for purposes other than resale. It is ACRA's position that vehicle manufacturers would be unwilling to undertake the burden of executing odometer disclosure statements, and it now seeks other avenues of relief. ACRA proposes three alternative regulatory approaches to alleviate the burden imposed on the car rental industry. First, it proposes to exempt the transferor of a new vehicle that is dropped-shipped to a car rental company from the requirement to make an odometer disclosure. It would accomplish this by adding a definition of ``new vehicle'' to §580.3 (``any vehicle driven no more than the limited use necessary in moving or road testing a vehicle prior to delivery by a manufacturer and/or a dealer'') and a new exemption to §580.6 (``a transferor of new vehicle to a business engaged in the leasing of automobiles for a period of thirty (30) days or less need not disclose the vehicle's odometer mileage''). Under this approach, with the dealer and the car rental firm listed as joint transferees on the MCO, the car rental firm would make any required odometer disclosure without involving the dealer. Alternatively, ACRA proposes to extend the circumstances under which a transferor could give its transferee power of attorney to make the odometer disclosure ordinarily required of the transferor. ACRA would also extend the power of attorney from the transferee to the transferor. To accomplish this objective, ACRA proposes to amend §580.13 as follows: (a) If the transferor's title is physically held by a lienholder, or if the transferor transfers the title of a new vehicle to a transferee engaged in the business of leasing new vehicles for a period of thirty (30) days or less, or if the transferor to whom the title was issued by the State has lost his title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of the transferor, and if otherwise permitted by State law, the transferor may give a power of attorney to his transferee, or the transferee may give a power of attorney to his transferor, for the purpose of mileage disclosure only. The power *␣*␣*. As a final option, ACRA proposes to exempt the initial transfer on all fleet purchases of new vehicles from the odometer disclosure requirements. To implement this approach, ACRA suggests including the definition of ``new vehicle'' set forth in the first suggested approach, and adding a definition of ``fleet purchases'' (``the annual aggregate transfer of new vehicles in quantities over 500 vehicles from a manufacturer to a transferee for use in the transferee's rental, lease, or corporate fleet.'') Section 580.6 would then be amended to read as follows: ``Notwithstanding the requirements of §§580.5 and 580.7: (a) A transferor or a lessee of any of the following motor vehicles need not disclose the vehicle's odometer mileage: * * * * * (5) A new vehicle transferred by a manufacturer as part of a fleet purchase. This approach would exempt the manufacturer from the odometer disclosure requirements, even though the car rental company and the dealer are listed on the MCO as joint transferees.
