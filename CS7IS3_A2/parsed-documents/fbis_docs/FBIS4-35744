But the main obstacle lies in the nature of the Jordanian side's view of the Palestinians, which I believe does not regard the two sides as equal partners, but, rather, as a superior and a subordinate. Abu-'Ayyash said that the nature of this view is worrying Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and that the main problem is that "they continue to talk to us on the basis that we are part of Jordan, not on the basis of our independence." [passage omitted] Furthermore, Abu-'Ayyash said that the transitional phase involves great dangers, especially in view of rumors that Palestinian officials have become agents for international companies to distribute their commodities in the areas controlled by the Palestinian authority -- a phenomenon now known as the "commission-seekers" phenomenon. In this context Abu-'Ayyash said: "Regrettably, rumors have cited names of figures close to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat." However, he added: "Nevertheless, matters are still within the framework of rumors. But the important thing is for the Palestinian leadership to understand the seriousness of the stage ahead and thus not link its destiny with Israel, but with the Arab states." He pointed out that the biggest threat to the new Palestinian entity is those who are trying to be clever. [passage omitted]
