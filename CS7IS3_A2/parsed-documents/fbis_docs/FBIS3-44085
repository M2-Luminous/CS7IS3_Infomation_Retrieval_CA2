[Mandela] It is perfectly reasonable that some people should have reservations, but it is the task of our organization to put our policy to them, explain it as fully as possible, and leave it to them to decide. I am convinced that we have the best policy in the country and that there is no other political organization which has got a policy as progressive as we have, a policy that takes into account the aspirations of all our peoples and which is in a better position to address their basic needs. [Snow] Now, over the weekend President De Klerk has called the ANC a party of violence that has lost control of its supporters. This is pretty heavy stuff so early in the campaign. Is there any truth in it? [Mandela] Well, Mr. De Klerk is the last person to make that accusation, because the task of maintaining law and order and making sure that there is no violence is that of the government of the country. [Snow] The relationship between you has been very critical in order to get us to this point. Now that the campaign is underway it sounds as if that relationship is already under very great stress? [Mandela] No, that is a misleading impression because we have never ceased to exchange views on matters of common interest. This last week we have met twice and have had very fruitful discussions. But in the course of the campaign it is likely that we will say very cruel things about each other, but that does not affect our ability to come together whenever it is necessary to address the problems facing the country. [Snow] Well, now can we look at what you are promising the electorate. Let's first start on the question of violence. What is the ANC going to do in government to try to contain what is happening in the townships, particularly amongst young people where it is practically out of control? [Mandela] Well, again that is not a correct impression because although the young people are angry and are justified in being angry, they are at the same disciplined -- when you give them a lead they listen and they follow. As for the question of violence -- after a democratic government has been installed, a government which has state power and which has got the will to put an end to the violence will receive the support of the population. Our problem is that we are dealing with a lame duck president and government who is completely weak, and unruly elements have taken advantage of that. [Snow] On the economic front, Mr. Mandela, the ANC has a close relationship with the Communist Party of South Africa; it has talked of nationalization, of redistribution in the past. What is the economic policy briefly to be? [Mandela] Well, I think as far as the question of the Communist Party is concerned, that is a nonissue as far as we are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it. As far as our economic policy is concerned we are not following any particular model. Our concern is to have sufficient resources to address the basic needs of our people, like the high level of unemployment, lack of housing, education, and medical facilities, electricity, lack of running water, roads -- all those things. Any particular strategy which will enable us to address these problems we will adopt. [Snow] Well, now can I just touch upon what happens with Winnie Mandela after the election. She is very well placed to get a good cabinet position in the post-independent government, in the multiracial government. What kind of reassurances can you give people -- given that she has had to face such serious charges under the old regime? [Mandela] She is a very popular figure and I think that any government when it decides on allocating portfolio's will consider the influence which a particular individual commands. [Snow] Well, can I just ask you finally about yourself. we are talking at six o'clock in the morning. I gather you have been up already for an hour and a half, obviously you are extremely fit but an enormous amount depends on you. This is going to be a most exhausting campaign. [Mandela] Well, as soon as I have finished with this interview I am going to take my coat and walk to the game reserve. That is where I am going to relax for the next five days. We are trying to find opportunities, in the midst of a very heavy program, of relaxing and resting, and I think that will enable me to go through some of the strenuous assignments which I would be given during the next three months. [Snow] I gather that before we talked this morning you have already been through a regime which is pretty similar to that which you used to undertake in prison? [Mandela] Well, I was explaining just the other day that this is something that is part of our system, not because I have wanted to but because of the experiences I have had, and to that extent I am grateful that I am able to get up as early as possible and do some solid work before others start. [Snow] Do you not feel terribly exhausted at the end of the day? [Mandela] There are days, of course, when I do feel tired, but generally speaking at the end of the day I have got a feeling of accomplishment that I have done a good day's work which has been productive and that is very inspiring indeed, and you go back feeling that your day has been worthwhile, and you have done some good for the country and for your people. [Snow] They say you are 76 -- it is hard to believe. How old do you feel? [Mandela] Well, they say that old age is part of your spirit, and if you think you are young you will naturally feel young, if you feel you are old and defeated you will feel old and aged. And I try to think I am younger than I am.
