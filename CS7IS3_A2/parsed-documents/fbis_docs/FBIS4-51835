At the behest of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the 11 banks have created a scheme under which, when one of them lapses into a liquidity crisis through failure to secure necessary amounts of cash in the money market, the others are required to make low-interest, emergency loans to the beleagured bank. The plan calls for up to 300 billion yen in loans per bank, which means the maximum available funds for the troubled bank could run as much as 3 trillion yen. In practice, the loans would be made in the form of the rescuers' purchase of certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by the institution in crisis. The bigger of the 11 "city banks" each procure 2-3 trillion yen of funds daily in interbank trading on the Tokyo money market. Currently, the BOJ is required to come to rescue of institutions which are unable to secure the necessary sums. But concerned that fund shortages could exceed its capacity, the BOJ has strongly called on the 11 institutions to establish their own support system to handle cases of credit crisis.
