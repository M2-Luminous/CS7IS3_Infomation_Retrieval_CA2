Mou Sen, director of Xijuchejian (Garage Theatre), an experimental drama group in Beijing, and arts critic Lin Kehuang, were barred from boarding the plane last Tuesday even though they had cleared Customs. The reasons for the action remain unknown. Other theatre group members were able to leave for Brussels. It is understood the two artists were invited as members of the official delegation sent by the Ministry of Culture. Both were funded by the organiser, the International Arts Festival Brussels. More than 80 Chinese artists from the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong are now in Brussels for the festival's China programme. Mou was to present his group's first piece, File 0, and Lin was to give a talk about drama in China. Festival director Frie Leysen vowed to express dissatisfaction at the incident. "It is an emotional evening but we are also angry. The Chinese authority has no right to keep people who ought to be here," Ms Leysen said before the first show by Xijuchejian. Despite the absence of the director, File 0 had its premier on schedule and won long applause. Also participating in the festival were two non-official mainland artists, independent film-makers Zhang Yuan and Wu Wenguan. Their works have been banned by the Chinese authorities. Cheung Fai, coordinator of the festival's China programme, said Zhang and Wu were not on the official mainland delegation. Xijuchejian travels to France tomorrow.
