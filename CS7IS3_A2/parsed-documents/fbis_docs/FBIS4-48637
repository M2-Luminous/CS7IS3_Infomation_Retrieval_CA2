Announcing the five-year appointment on Tuesday, Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise said that the task of building a legitimate, credible and fully representative NDF that would enjoy the support and co-operation of all South Africans would rest on the general's shoulders. Mr Modise warned that the defence force would become "inadequate" if it faced any further cuts, and said a regional defence accord could play an important role in discouraging internal instability, such as that now troubling Lesotho. "It is my sincere wish that under the command of Gen Meiring the SANDF will do its best towards reconciliation, upliftment, prosperity and peace in our country." The government was also looking at forming a veterans' brigade to absorb people who had left the armed forces as a result of rationalisation. Mr Modise said the final size of a rationalised defence force would be between 67,000 and 70,000 people. This would be adequate to defend the country, but South Africa would "also be looking at the region", and to becoming part of defence and security arrangements on the subcontinent. Integration of non-statutory forces such as former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] guerrillas would have some effect on the coming budget. "I think initially the budget will have to accept this group that's coming, but after rationalisation -- because rationalisation also takes into account an affordable army -- there has to be a ceiling somewhere. The core we have got is the barest we could arrive at. Below that it will be inadequate." It had to be remembered that the defence force would play a major role in the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan] through job creation in concerns such as weapons manufacturers. One of the defence force's major concerns would be social upliftment. It had the capacity and knowhow to play a meaningful role in the RDP. "So money coming into the defence force is money well spent," he said. Asked when South Africa would start to take part in organisation of African unity peacekeeping exercises, he said this was difficult to say. The defence force would "start at home" and see what the needs of the region -- rather than the continent -- were. It would want to reassure its neighbours that they were looking at security and defence in the same light, and that they should not feel threatened by the size of South Africa's army. Problems in neighbouring states such as Angola and Mozambique would hopefully be resolved in the near future: Mozambique was preparing for an election, and there were signals that Angolan negotiators might sign an accord by early June. "We think this will provide the climate to address regional security end defence," he said. South Africa would avoid being drawn into other countries' internal problems, but "those who are inclined to be problematic" would have to know they were dealing with a much wider form of defence. He was not suggesting South Africa would go poking its nose into its neighbours' affairs, but those who wanted to create instability -- such as that affecting Lesotho -- would have to think twice in future because such instability could affect the entire region. The non-statutory forces absorbed into the NDF would start training in the next few days. These forces had not enjoyed the privileges and modern facilities of former SADF troops, and would have to be empowered before they could compete as equals. The fact that the training would be overseen by neutral British advisers would ensure that the final product would satisfy all parties. Asked to comment on the possible prosecution of white South Africans who were called up for service over the election period and did not report for duty, he replied: "Why do you want to start off with controversial questions? Do you want to set me against the old system?" ANC policy was very clear: The organisation was opposed to conscription and would prefer a voluntary defence force. In times of war, when the security of the entire nation was affected, things were different and necessary steps would be taken to ensure the nation was protected.
