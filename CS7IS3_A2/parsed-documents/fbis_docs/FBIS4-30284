Two top researchers at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) have concluded that Thailand is on a muddled path towards economic prosperity. "Unlike other newly-industrialized countries in Asia, where governments helped repair market failures, Thailand has relied on the market to overcome government failures. This formula will no longer suffice, given technological, environmental and human resource challenges at hand," concluded TDRI's Scott Christensen and Amma Sayamwala. The state is indeed struggling to keep up with the demands of a rapidly changing economy. The problems are too well apparent as the two researchers noted: "Even though Thailand has enjoyed some success, it is not well prepared for the next stage of industrialization. Its investments in secondary education and its output of technicians and engineers fall seriously short of the country's needs. Moreover, the state is institutionally ill-equipped to assume the monitoring, enforcement, and social welfare functions for regulating an advanced industrial economy." So what should we do? State intervention? The two researchers stopped short of advocating increased state intervention in the economy but called for more effective government action in those sectoral policy areas where the private sector will increasingly rely upon the government to act. These policy areas include education, worker training, public health social welfare, monitoring and enforcing environmental and safety regulations and supporting and perhaps coordinating scientific research. All these, they argue, do not need more active state intervention but rather more vision to make intelligent decisions, acquire a better information base and initiate better coordination between the private and public sectors. In a parallel tone, Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank and former top economist at the Bank of Thailand suggested that the government should make it a policy to create "national awareness" about technology upgrading, and build up skilled labour, in order for the country to compete more effectively in international markets. The era of cheap labour is gone, Olan said. "National awareness should be made concrete... There may be tax incentives for the private sector to undertake manpower and on-the-job trainings," Olan said. While consensus has emerged on the target areas, the speed to which the government is responding is slow and varies between ministries and agencies. Some are doing better than others but an overall policy strategy and direction is still lacking on the part of the government. Also, profound economic changes are taking place within the Asean region where there is now a high standard of living and a rapid process of industrialization. However, uneven development between and within nations persists and presents numerous contradictory economic problems that ultimately explain the extent of labour migration that is occurring within the region. Thailand is both an exporter and importer of labour, but yet migration push and pull forces have yet to be fully addressed by the government. As the world enters the 21st century, it is inevitable that international labour migration flows will intensify within Asean itself. Brain-drain phenomenon While the government complains about the rapid brain-drain phenomenon in the country, especially among new engineering graduates, nothing is made to prevent them from leaving Thailand to take up lucrative offers from multi-national companies. It is easy to urge Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to exert his leadership in order to create a more effective state. However, his performance in the past two years leaves much to be desired. Moreover he lacks a vision for Thailand in the 21st century unlike many of his counterparts in Asean. Perhaps, more pressure should be exerted on certain forward-looking ministers to take up this challenge. Without doubt, Thailand must put its house in order first before it begins to pull its weight in the 21st century. If it fails to do so, sad to say within a few years it might not be able to keep pace with its vigorous neighbors.
