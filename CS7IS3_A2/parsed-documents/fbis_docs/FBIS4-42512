Zaunitzer-Haase; place and date not given: "Not Easier With the SPD"] [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] You have chosen an extremely dramatic time to take over your new office.... [Schulte] I did not choose anything. However, I did think long and hard about whether and under what conditions I will take over this task -- if I am elected. [Zaunitzer-Haase] The trade unions are in a profound crisis. Are you taking over a heap of shards? [Schulte] An extremely complicated structure is in a very difficult situation. Apart from the decline in the number of members, one main reason for the financial difficulties is the fact that the individual trade unions -- and also the DGB [German Trade Union Federation] -- invested a great deal of money in the new laender after unification to build trade union structures there in the first place. Now it turns out that the high expenditure is not paying off. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What is the reason for that? [Schulte] Disappointment and frustration! At the beginning there was enormous optimism in the new laender. They hoped for miracles from the economic power of the old FRG. Then when a completely wrong policy destroyed the dreams in a rather brutal way, hopes were directed at the trade unions. Then came the sobering insight that the trade unions alone are not able, either, to correct the failed economic policy. Anger was the result. [Zaunitzer-Haase] In only two years the number of members went down by 1.4 million! Members are running away, revenues are dwindling. [Schulte] The trade unions must analyze their situation quite soberly. Their financial potency is a decisive factor. One must be quite clear about that. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What can be done? [Schulte] In the individual trade unions many things are confusing and are running on parallel tracks. Cooperation agreements are necessary. Caring for members! Individual advice! It must be ensured that the trade unions understand the use of their membership. And then recruiting members -- more intensively and in a modernized way. [Zaunitzer-Haase] But what can the DGB alone do? [Schulte] In any case, we do not want to be a paper factory, which we are occasionally accused of. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What are the real tasks? [Schulte] The DGB must be the "advocate of employment" -- not only the advocate of the employed. The DGB must strongly support the social state, fight for achievements the abolition of which would be a relapse into the social Middle Ages. The DGB must pursue a policy of equal rights: for women and discriminated groups. And it must pursue a European policy. In any case, however, a concentration of tasks is now necessary. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Should the trade unions not get rid of their own companies -- such as the BfG [Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft] bank -- because of their financial crisis? [Schulte] No, we should not sell off our silver! I would not like to see the trade union houses sold, either. The financial crisis must not reach that far. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What is to be done in the DGB itself? [Schulte] The DGB must slim down. This is unavoidable. Personnel adjustments will also be necessary. Claims must be reduced. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Are you also thinking of reducing salaries? [Schulte] One can think of anything. However, one should do only something sensible. [Zaunitzer-Haase] There is fear and displeasure in the DGB. Many fear for their job. [Schulte] I have not heard any demands. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Will you yourself still earn more than in the past despite the thrift measures? [Schulte] No. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What would you say if you now had to make a passionate speech to trade union functionaries? [Schulte] That the DGB is there for everyone, be they big or small. And I would point to the reputation of the German trade unions abroad. We must soon achieve this in the FRG again, too. [Zaunitzer-Haase] And what would the passionate speech to your fellow-workers in the DGB be like? [Schulte] I would say that everything is open, that everyone, really everyone, must be willing to think about his own situation. It is incredibly important that there does not develop a vacuum or a lack of orientation. We all must pull in the same direction. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Do you expect support from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? [Schulte] Hardly. I do not even think that for us everything would become easier if the SPD were to lead the next government. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Why not? [Schulte] Trade unions and DGB will struggle for the preservation and the further expansion of the social state. Even with an SPD government this will probably not be easy in the course of the general deregulation. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What will you personally do in order not to be worn down? [Schulte] I will keep my eyes open in order not to fall into traps. I will keep private refuges and play a bit of soccer.
