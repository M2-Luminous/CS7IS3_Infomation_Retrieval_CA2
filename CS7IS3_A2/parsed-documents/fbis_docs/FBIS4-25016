Clinton made the statement in an article published in the LOS ANGELES TIMES on 31 May. Commenting on the reasons for extending the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status to China, Clinton said: "After many years' arguments and repetitive vetoes, we no longer implement two sets of policies toward China -- one set from the Congress and another from the President. Instead, we will implement a single American policy toward China." He added: "Linking human rights to the MFN has brought us to a dead end." Clinton continued: "We will have more contacts, more trade, more international cooperation, and more extensive and regular dialogues on human rights issues with China." Clinton believes that a 21st-century economy is taking shape in China. In 1993, China was the world's fastest growing economy. China is not only an enormous market for American-produced commodities, but has also provided opportunities for more jobs in America. China has a veto power in the United Nations Security Council and it is an important factor for Asian, and even global security. Clinton indicated: The United States and China share major interests in some fields. He said in conclusion: "The actions I have taken on China suit the long-term interests of both the United States and China."
