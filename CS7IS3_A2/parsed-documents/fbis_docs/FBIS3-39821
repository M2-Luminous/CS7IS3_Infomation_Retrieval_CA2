That is not just the responsibility of Israel and the Palestinians, but of the whole international community. That was the message of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during a visit to The Hague on Friday [18 February]. Prime Minister Lubbers was therefore requested amicably but urgently by 'Arafat to offer a helping hand, although it remained open what the Netherlands -- or the European -- role in the Middle East should be. Accordingly it was also important for 'Arafat, under the spotlight of the international press, to meet his "friend and brother" Nelson Mandela. "Rabin always repeats that no date is sacred," an indignant 'Arafat said in a sober room of De Wittenburg, a castle in Wassenaar. "What does he mean no sacred dates? Haven't we signed an agreement?" "We have the United States and Russia as witnesses, President Clinton gave his blessing, the whole international community is behind the agreement," 'Arafat said. "It is not just an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it is an international agreement." 'Arafat made it clear that as far as he was concerned there was a sacred date -- 13 April, when the Israeli Army is supposed to have withdrawn from Gaza and Jericho under the literal text of the agreement in principle. Therefore both parties would have to reach agreement in a month. Was it likely? "I hope so," he said. "If there is no agreement, then the peace is in danger." The PLO leader said that it would not be his fault if no agreement was reached. "I did my best in my three meetings with Prime Minister Peres," he said. "It was clear to everyone that the Palestinians were adopting a positive attitude. We took courageous decisions. Now the other side has to prove that peace is wanted. If not, then the peace process will lose its credibility." The "courageous decisions" referred to by 'Arafat are the concessions from the Palestinian side, including such areas as the border passages with Jordan and Egypt, which will continue to be checked by Israel, the extensive powers which the Israeli Army will keep in Gaza and the limited size of the Jericho enclave. The concessions have earned 'Arafat the usual criticisms in Palestinian circles and therefore it is high time that Israel makes gestures. The release of Palestinian prisoners could be such a gesture. 'Arafat made it clear that he had received promises that some prisoners would be released during Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting now taking place. Does this include the prisoners who were held because they used violence? "Both parties committed crimes," he said. "Many Palestinians were murdered, do not forget that. But peace means peace. For both peoples. For our children and their children. We cannot make a final agreement without having a guarantee that all our prisoners will be released." The growing opposition in the occupied territories to 'Arafat's policies -- from the Islamic Hamas, pro-Syrian organizations and even in his own Fatah movement -- led to a rumor that the PLO leader would not be so fussy about his promise to organize elections this year for the administrative council in the future autonomous area. Could the PLO leader guarantee that the Palestinian elections would be held? "We are already busy preparing for the elections," he said. "Three months ago I signed a decree for the establishment of a special committee. We agreed on elections in Washington, that is settled." And what would happen if Hamas or a coalition of opposition groups won the elections? "That is democracy," he said. "Are you against that? We are proud of our democracy." Was Hamas a threat to the peace process? "No one can hold back history," 'Arafat said, adding neatly that Hamas had already asked to take part in the elections. However, things have not yet reached that stage and on Friday 'Arafat was mainly preoccupied with gaining international support. ANC [African National Congress of South Africa] Leader Mandela promised to visit him in Jericho before visiting Israel. "We have a very close relationship," 'Arafat said. "We are fighting the same struggle for peace, in South Africa and the Middle East." But the PLO leader's talks with Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy and a group of Netherlands business people were the most concrete discussions. They covered not only Gaza's harbor, but also cooperation in agriculture, road and house building and tourism. It was decided to establish a Netherlands-Palestinian business council.
