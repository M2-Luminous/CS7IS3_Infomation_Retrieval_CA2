"TEHRAN TIMES" in its editorial referred to the statements by some U.N. member countries expressing regret over the "miserable" U.N. failure in protecting lives of innocent civilians in the "safe areas" of Gorazde. The U.N.'s inability to carry out its peacekeeping duties also prompted one of its officials to say: "The United Nations died on the hills of Gorazde." "The fact that the United Nations is greatly influenced by the U.S. is no secret. Evicting Saddam's army from Kuwait, which was done mostly through the deployment of American forces, removed any doubt in this regard. It proved that what Uncle Sam wants from the U.N., Uncle Sam gets from the U.N." Stressing that the U.N. is only a mercenary of the U.S. and its allies, the paper said that the only possible conclusion is that the Serbs carried out the West's real objective of decimating the only Muslim state in Europe and are being protected and rewarded by their American and European masters. Commenting on the same subject, "KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL" wrote in its editorial that the world's free people expected the U.N. to stop "being a pawn in the game of rivalry between the powers and quasi- superpowers." The body's passive policy in clear contradiction to the active policy adopted vis-a-vis Iraq and Somalia, had rendered the U.N. weak and unable to assert its will where the world deemed necessary, the article said. Referring to the fact that the U.N. has been created to help alleviate the pain and suffering of the toiling humanity, the paper noted that the body must strive to do its duty within its Charter which calls for the defence of any people that might face extermination such as the people of Gorazde. The U.N. as a world body should represent all its members and should not come under the direct or indirect influence of a few, only then would the world experience peace and happiness, concluded the paper.
