ACTION: Notice of Implementation. SUMMARY: This notice implements special local regulations for the start of the Cock Island Race from the Portsmouth Seawall area of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Norfolk Harbor, Norfolk and Portsmouth, VA on July 16, 1994. The sailboats will race to Hampton Roads and return. These special local regulations are needed to control vessel traffic within the area due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected vessel congestion during the starting of the races. The effect will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of participants in the races. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., on July 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen L. Phillips, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard District 431, Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia 23705 (804) 398&hyph;6204, or Commander, Coast Guard Group, Hampton Roads (804) 483&hyph;8568. Drafting Information: The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Discussion of Regulation: Ports Events, Inc., of Portsmouth, Virginia, submitted an application to hold the Cock Island Race.

Each class will start at ten minute intervals from the Portsmouth Seawall area of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Norfolk Harbor, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia on July 16, 1994, race to Hampton Roads and return.
