This period is chiefly characterized by the fact that the United States has abandoned the region to Russia's influence. Russia has taken the most important step in reestablishing political domination in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as in the Balkans. As we all know well, this domination is based on the foundation of the "Orthodox Alliance". Everyone must now realize that an extremely painful and difficult period has begun for the Balkans. A large number of Turks and Muslims in the region are gradually being dragged into a dreadful predicament. The besieged Sandzak, Kosovo, and Montenegro, as well as Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], on which Greece has imposed an embargo. In the near future, Albania, the Turkish presence in Bulgaria, Western Thrace, and the Turkish and Muslim minorities in other Balkan areas will join these areas. All these people are threatened with extinction within the framework of the Orthodox-Crusader political plan drawn by Russia. This situation paints a picture of desperation, in which the tyranny in Bosnia-Herzegovina will soon become a mere detail. In the coming months, ethnic cleansing policies will be implemented one by one and mass deaths, famine, and refugee movements will be observed in this region. Most of the refugees will move to Turkey. [passage omitted]
