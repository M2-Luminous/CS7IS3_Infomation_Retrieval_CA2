Relating to Non-member Access to SelectNet April 20, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on March 31, 1994 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 The NASD amended the proposed rule change once subsequent to its original filing on February 15, 1994. This amendment clarified the NASD's basis for the rule change and provided a discussion of and the NASD's response to the objections of a commenter. File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;9 (Amendment No. 1). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing two modifications to the operation of SelectNet, the system designed to facilitate communication, negotiation and execution of orders between NASD member firms. The first such modification will provide real-time access to non-members to view all ``broadcast'' orders in SelectNet immediately as they are entered. The second modification provides for the transmission of such orders solely on an anonymous basis through the service. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Nasdaq Stock Market is proposing modifications to the operations of the SelectNet service that would permit access by non-members who are subscribers to the Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 service to view broadcast orders immediately as they are entered into the service. SelectNet is the service operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market that permits NASD member firms to enter buy or sell orders in Nasdaq securities into the system, direct those orders to a single market maker (preferenced orders) or broadcast the order to all market makers in the security. Originally implemented in its predecessor form in 1988 as the Order Confirmation Transaction service, 3 the primary function of that service was to offer an automated alternative to the telephone as a method of contacting market makers in times of market stress. To this end, order entry firms could direct or preference an order to buy or sell a Nasdaq security to a single market maker in the issue. When the service was enhanced and renamed SelectNet in 1990, 4 the broadcast feature was added to permit a wider dissemination of orders to all market makers in an issue. In addition, the redesigned system allowed market makers in a subject security to send a broadcast order to all member firms that had designated that security in their SelectNet ``watch file,'' 5 whether the firm was a market maker or not. In 1992, the service was expanded to add pre-opening and after-hours sessions, 6 so that today SelectNet is available for members to negotiate and execute orders from 9 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. Eastern Time. 7 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25263 (Jan. 11, 1988), 53 FR 1430 (Jan. 19, 1988). 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28636 (Nov. 21, 1990), 55 FR 49732 (Nov. 30, 1990). 5 The SelectNet watch file is established by each member firm and may contain as many as 300 securities. The member will then receive any preferenced or broadcast order selected for inclusion in the watch file. 6 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30581 (Apr. 14, 1992), 57 FR 14596 (Apr. 21, 1992). 7 In 1992, the NASD also proposed expanding SelectNet to include exchange-listed securities in the service, but this proposal met with resistance from the exchanges and is still pending Commission action. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30961 (July 27, 1992), 57 FR 34158 (Aug. 3, 1992). The Nasdaq Stock Market operates SelectNet to provide investors and members with an automated system to facilitate communication of trading interest between members, negotiation of orders with the possibility of price improvement with automated, locked-in executions, and dissemination of last sale reports to the tape. In addition, SelectNet retains the original functionality of the service as a replacement for one-on-one communication between members, especially in times of market stress. Since its enhancement in December 1990, the service has grown in popularity with members and traffic has increased significantly_from an average of 3,000 transactions and 6 million shares daily in the first half of 1991 to over 11,000 transactions and more than 16 million shares daily in the last quarter of 1993. As the system's usage has increased, institutions and other non-members have expressed a desire to see the orders broadcast within the service. The NASD believes that it is now appropriate to disclose SelectNet broadcast orders to non-member Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 subscribers, in order to render the orders in the system more transparent to investors. An important facet of the Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 study was increasing transparency in SelectNet by making SelectNet orders more visible for investors. 8 The Division recommended that the NASD examine how to improve access to information regarding orders entered into SelectNet, consistent with goals of increased transparency. Specifically, the Division stated that expanded dissemination of SelectNet information is essential for providing data to investors regarding the prices at which investors and dealers are willing to transact business in a particular security. 9 Accordingly, this rule proposal directly responds to one of the Division's key suggestions designed to improve the transparency of orders broadcast through the SelectNet service. 8 Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments , Division of Market Regulation, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, (Jan. 1994). 9 The Division also recommended that SelectNet orders be disseminated to the public before the Commission took any action on the pending proposal to include exchange-listed securities in the service. The NASD believes this rule filing is a full response to the Division's request.
