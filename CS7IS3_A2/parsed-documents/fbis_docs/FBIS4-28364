FBIS4-28364 "dreas111__a94038" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 30 May 1994 ANNEX Japan TDK To Increase Overseas Production Ratio TDK To Increase Overseas Production Ratio 942A0280A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 May 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0280A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] TDK will boost its overseas production ratio to 50 percent (38 percent as of end of fiscal 1993) with fiscal 1995 as the goal (March 1996 quarter). It is a measure backed by the overseas production shift of finished goods manufacturers and worsening export profits due to the high yen, and it aims to achieve its goal by partially shifting production such as high-performance magnetic heads and high-frequency parts for mobile communications. The overseas production shift by the electronic parts industry seems to be accelerating further. TDK's overseas production ratio in fiscal 1993 was 38 percent, one point down from the 39 percent in fiscal 1992. It was affected by the reduction in amount of production along with the switch in magnetic heads for hard disk drives (HDD) and HDD IC [integrated circuit] types centering on overseas production. In the plan to achieve the goal of "a 50-percent overseas production ratio in fiscal 1995," the program is to start within the fiscal year production of "MR heads," thin film magnetic heads for HDD, in the Asian region, in addition to beginning production of dielectric filters for mobile communications instruments at the ferrite plant in Oklahoma in the United States within this fiscal year. Both products are products that previously had been produced only domestically, and the aim is to achieve 50 percent in stages by raising the overseas production ratio to 42 percent at the end of fiscal 1994. Moreover, in facilities investment, while holding it down domestically to about 15 billion yen this fiscal year, on par with last fiscal year, it is scheduled to increase facilities investment overseas by more than 20 percent compared to the previous year, to about 25 billion yen. In next fiscal year and thereafter, the idea is to expand the overseas production items with this basic stance. The company is putting effort into avoiding exchange rate risks such as promoting a change of export transactions to a yen basis, besides establishing a budget this fiscal year at $1 to 100 yen. By achieving a 50-percent overseas production ratio, it will have a balance with domestic production and the policy is to link this course thoroughly to strengthen the constitution of the business.
