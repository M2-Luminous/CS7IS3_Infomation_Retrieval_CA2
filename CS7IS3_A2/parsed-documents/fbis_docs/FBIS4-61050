That is why Kozyrev managed to pack a lot into the three hours he was on German soil. He and his team traveled by military helicopter to Bonn's "Petersberg" residence for honored guests, he had a conversation with Kinkel, he had a bite to eat, and he appeared before journalists. The agenda included: putting the final touches to the program for Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to the FRG; an exchange of opinions on the progress of the elections in the Republic of South Africa; discussion of the situation in the Near East; and problems of bilateral relations. But the key question was Bosnia and, in particular, President Yeltsin's proposal to hold an international meeting on settling the conflict with Russia, the United States, the EU [European Union], and NATO participating. In the minister's opinion, it should specifically result in a consolidated approach to this problem from the world community. Russian diplomacy's main thesis is that there must be no reliance purely on a military solution involving force and that it is essential to try to make full use of all peaceful methods to extinguish the conflagration of war in the Balkans. A meeting of foreign ministers of the states and political organizations invited by Boris Nikolayevich to the conversation on Bosnia is due to be held in the near future in order to reach final agreement on disputed points. The world community's next task is to insist on a cease-fire in Bosnia and to start working out the conditions for and principles of a comprehensive peace settlement. And, as progress is made toward the set aim, the vise of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia must be gradually loosened. "Do you represent the Serbs' interests?" a German journalist asked. "No, I represent Russia," Andrey Vladimirovich replied.
