FBIS4-7322 "dreas083_b_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 Mongolia Demonstration Termed `Major' Demonstration Termed `Major' LD2404132394 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1148 GMT 24 Apr 94 LD2404132394 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 24 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The center of the Mongolian capital today witnessed a major antigovernment demonstration for the second day running. According to various sources, between 3,000 and 5,000 citizens took part in it. The demonstrators, chanting slogans demanding the resignation of the Cabinet of Prime Minister [Puntsaqiyn] Jasray, have blocked the entrances to the building where the government is sitting. In view of the peaceful nature of the demonstration, the security forces units that came to the square have not interfered. The latest demonstration in central Ulaanbaatar has become yet another move in the campaign of pressure exerted by the opposition on the government which its opponents call "corrupt." Active protests began two weeks ago when several dozens of mainly young Mongols went on a hunger strike, not expecting, according to them, to achieve their aim -- to make the government surrender -- by other means. However, while the conflict developed those on a hunger strike inclined toward a compromise, trying to achieve not the resignation of, but only a meeting with, the prime minister. They also want to receive from the government a document promising to carry out effective socioeconomic reforms. Among the demands is the need for decisive measures in the fight against crime and inadmissibility of the further impoverishment of the population. According to Jasray, head of the Mongolian Government, he has no reason to resign. Meanwhile, an official investigation has been started into the accusations of corruption made by the opposition. Mongolian legislators appeared alongside government officials in them. Competent bodies promise to finish the investigation within two weeks.
