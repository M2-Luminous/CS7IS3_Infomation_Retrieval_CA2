The Finance Secretariat has issued a short communique that reads as follows: Dr. Pedro Aspe, the finance and public credit secretary, has appointed Dr. Jose Cordoba Montoya as the Mexican representative to the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], which has its headquarters in Washington. Dr. Jose Cordoba was chief of the Office of the Presidency of the republic until today. The Finance Secretariat has not released any more details on this information. It is important, however, to tell our listeners that the IDB governors will meet in Guadalajara from 8 to 13 April. Mexico is hosting this meeting. It will be the first official event handled by Mr. Jose Cordoba Montoya. Cordoba Montoya was the chief of the Office of the Presidency of the republic and, until today, was in charge of all the advisers of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The IDB is very important within the international economic sector. It groups all nations, especially developing nations. At least 23 countries are expected to attend the meeting in Guadalajara. Representatives of all those countries will meet with the IDB in that city. Jose Cordoba Montoya will probably have to move to Washington because all the governors handle their countries' IDB concerns from its headquarters. This is the information we have now.
