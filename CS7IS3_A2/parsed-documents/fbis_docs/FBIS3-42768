As experience shows, these relations are shaping up in complex and frequently dramatic fashion even. The priority relations within the CIS are those between Russia and its Commonwealth partners. It is Russia that is having to seek solutions and approaches that were never practiced formerly. Of the overall directions of Russia's foreign policy which have been identified in the just over two years of the CIS' existence, and this means the Baltic, Belarus, Ukraine, the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and, finally, interior regions, the most complex is the Central Asia direction. The further things progress, the more it is this region that is creating for Russia as a whole and for its Foreign Ministry in particular most complex problems. Reasons for Russia's Interest in Central Asia Although this way of framing the issue does not at first sight seem all that warranted (the dramatic Russian-Ukrainian relations, the problems of the Transcaucasus republics, relations with the Baltic, and so forth immediately come to mind), it is, in my view, perfectly legitimate. For the following reasons, at least: on account of the strategic importance of the Central Asia region for Russia. It has since ancient times been indisputable both from the military and economic and any other viewpoints; on account of the growing penetration of Russia via Central Asia by Islamic extremism, which is fraught with the danger of the proliferation of weapons, social tension, and civil war throughout this space; on account of the active development of the international and, particularly, religious ties of the states of Central Asia, which are reported regularly by the news media and which are already bearing certain fruit, and this is for Russia not only of positive significance (inasmuch as it is reducing its economic burden to a certain extent) but also negative significance: markets for the sale of its industrial products and raw material sources are narrowing, the most complex problem of hundreds of thousands of refugees is having to be resolved, and so forth. There are more than sufficient examples showing that these ties are developing dynamically. And nothing bad should be seen in this (the Soviet republics should have had this opportunity since the time they emerged). It is important merely that the international ties not develop to the detriment of the CIS partners. Were, on the other hand, the strengthening of the independence of the countries of Central Asia, as also the development of their international relations, to be accompanied by a weakening of economic and other ties to Russia, this would for the latter be fraught with the emergence in the not-too-distant future of problems of the movement and demarcation of its borders, the division of contiguous territories, with Kazakhstan specifically, and so forth, the resolution of which would not only be incredibly complex but also fabulously costly and manifestly beyond the capacity of the thoroughly undermined Russian economy. Such a version of the development of events cannot, unfortunately, be ruled out, particularly if we bear in mind the trend toward the regional exclusiveness of the Central Asian states, which was manifested shortly after the signing of the Belovezha Agreement and which has clearly intensified in recent months, particularly in the course of Russia's maladroit maneuvers around the creation of a common ruble zone. Speaking of the reasons for Russia's attraction to and interest in the Central Asia region, the reverse interest has to be seen also. But the reasons for this interest are now far from what they were not so long ago. Thanks primarily to Russia, these countries have not only risen to a new level of development but, and this is the main point, have acquired a new national self-awareness and become, it may be considered, quite modern nations with a highly developed sense of national pride. It follows from this that they are considerably more capable of defending their own interests than before. But militarily their dependence on Russia and the common defense system is, as before, great, if not absolute. But is this the main dependence? Has not the economic aspect become more important than the military aspect for the modern state? The said reasons are today, generally, recognized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. This is clearly indicated by, specifically, the interviews of former deputy foreign ministers Georgiy Kunadze, who was until recently in charge of this area, and Anatoliy Adamishin, who also dealt with problems of Central Asia (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 29 and 30 July 1993). If there really is understanding (and this is not to be doubted), to what extent is the present practical policy of the Foreign Ministry in the Central Asia direction adequate to the country's interests? In addition, how has Foreign Ministry policy in respect to Central Asia in the years of Russia's independence evolved? Evolution of the Foreign Ministry's Views on Relations With the Countries of Central Asia The evolution of the views of the Foreign Ministry has been expressed primarily in the actions of this institution and also in the change of opinions of its leaders. Let us see how it has occurred. A month after the August (1991) putsch, when there was still a Union Foreign Ministry, Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian foreign policy department, said that the foreign policy interests of the Russian state should be subordinated to the historical mission of the conversion of Russia "from a dangerous sick giant of Eurasia into a participant in the Western coprosperity zone." As the sovereignty of the republics strengthened and centrifugal sentiments grew, particularly in October-November 1991, the position of the Russian head of the foreign policy department underwent pronounced changes. While continuing to maintain that "the pointer still moves toward the United States, West Europe, and Japan," that is, toward the most developed Western countries, Kozyrev at the same time defined the first circle of Russia's interests horizontally--the sovereign states situated on the territories of the former Union republics. Despite the fact that by the start of 1992 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, as, most likely, the Russian leadership as a whole, had a general idea of how to build relations with the former Union republics, this cannot be said in respect to Central Asia. The misunderstanding of Russia's new policy in this region was directly reflected in the work of our embassies in the Central Asian states. Immediately after they had been opened, in the fall of 1992, they encountered a multitude of problems--a lack of both official and residential premises and a clear understanding of the specific missions and directions of work. It was for this reason also, I believe, that Filipp Sidorskiy, ambassador of the Russian Federation in Uzbekistan, termed the near abroad "a zone of risk-fraught diplomacy." The situation was complicated by the fact that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not up to a certain point (when things became hot on the Tajik-Afghan border and when the threat of the penetration of Russia by Islamic extremism had become real) paid sufficient attention to the Central Asia problem. Prior to the events on the border, the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia toward this region had been manifestly different. The business of Minister Kozyrev's tour of Central Asia, which was interrupted on 8 April of last year, is highly indicative in this respect. Up to a certain point (until the spring-summer of 1992) the Central Asia direction had been discerned in only very nebulous fashion in the Foreign Ministry's activity as an independent direction and could be viewed merely in the context of Russia's general policy in relation to the CIS members. This policy proceeded, in my view, mainly from the fact that, following the acquisition of independence, each Commonwealth country was required to arrange its destiny independently and least of all from the fact that the monolithic nature of the former Soviet Union excluded immediate and, in addition, uncoordinated steps of its individual members, albeit former, inasmuch as they would certainly be detrimental to the rest. In this period the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pursued, in my view, two main missions: the first: furthering Russia's entry into the circle of the world's most developed states; the second: contributing to the formation of a viable commonwealth of former Soviet republics. Having very soon convinced itself that accomplishing these two missions was extraordinarily difficult (to put it no more strongly), the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs switched, under the pressure of circumstances, to a resolution of specific problems in defined areas. It was at this time that both the Russian-Central Asia direction and the particular Tajik direction took shape. This stage, like the preceding one, did not, in my view, last long: just several months--from spring-start of summer 1993 through September of the same year. Having convinced itself that it was difficult to achieve any positive results in these directions also, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs adopted a policy of the formation of a closer alliance of the former Soviet republics. An important moment in the realization of this policy were the negotiations of the heads of state of the CIS in Ashgabat on 23-24 December 1993 devoted to the creation of an economic union, in the main. It may be assumed that subsequent efforts also will develop in this direction. What kind of new relations should Russia have with the countries of Central Asia in this case? Possible Versions of the Development of Russian-Central Asian Relations In deciding the question of relations with the countries of Central Asia, Russia should on the one hand not lose sight of that to which these countries aspire and the kind of development model that will, most likely, take with them and, on the other, that to which Russia itself aspires and its development model. Nor can the external orientation of this model or the other be forgotten either. Even now the differences are very appreciable and will, of course, be even greater. A great deal follows from this both for Russia and for the Central Asian states. What are the possible versions of the development of the situation? They are, in my view, three. 1. The situation develops in accordance with the scenario that is predominant at this time. Russia endeavors to restructure its social and political and economic system in a Western, monetarist key, whereas the Central Asian states will try to realize something akin to the Chinese development model with all its attributes. The parties will move further and further away from one another here. Sooner or later this will inevitably signify the need for a solution of the problems of borders, including new borders for Russia, and the problem of disputed territories both between Russia and these states and between the Central Asian states themselves. Unless it is forgotten that there have never been precisely drawn borders here, it may be confidently maintained that it will hardly be possible to avoid most serious conflicts and a big war. If we add to this the expansion of Islamic extremism and the tension that accompanies this process, we could arrive at the perfectly definite and clear conclusion that this tragic version suits neither Russia itself, nor the countries of Central Asia, nor the entire world community as a whole. And inasmuch as it is this version that is currently predominant, Russia should do as much as it can to interrupt this development of events. 2. Russia "adapts" its development to the development of the countries of Central Asia, that is, takes as the basis a likeness of the Chinese model. In my view, this was possible up to August 1991, more precisely, before the middle of 1990. But this is now no longer possible. And not only because there is no unified force regulating the processes of social development but also because the parties have already gone quite far in their separate ways. 3. Russia does not copy the Western countries but develops in accordance with its own salient features as a Eurasian state, in a close alliance with the countries of Central Asia, creating which is as yet still possible. At a price of considerable mutual concessions, it is true. There is no other way. Russia is condemned to this path, if it wishes to avoid a great tragedy. The sooner and more assuredly this version is implemented, the better it will be for all. But we are already late, and this is leading to growing losses. A voluntary alliance of Eurasian states created on the territory of the former USSR would not only halt the present destructive processes in this space but also avert a catastrophe of immense proportions. But events are as yet, unfortunately, developing mainly according to the first scenario, from which it follows that it is the Central Asia direction that is potentially the most dangerous for Russia.
