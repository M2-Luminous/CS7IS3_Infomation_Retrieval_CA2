A total area of 1.84 million hectares has now been densely wooded in this forest zone, so far the biggest afforested area in China. The zone, with 80,000 hectares of afforested trees ready for felling, has enlarged the primeval forest in the region, which has only 200,000 hectares of forest for cutting. With its primeval forest used for felling as early as the 1850s, it is the biggest timber production center in China. Reforestation was carried out over the past four decades while planting trees on wasteland as well as desolated hills and mountains. By now 71.5 percent of the zone have been wooded, up 11.4 percent over the figure of four decades ago. Experts say that the afforestation in the zone has coped with the felling. The zone, with an annual afforestation area of more than 67,000 hectares, can provide 240 million high-quality saplings every year. The survival rate of the saplings amounts to 90 percent, an increase of 36 percent over the figure of the 1950s.
