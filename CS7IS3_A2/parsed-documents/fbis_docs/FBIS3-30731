[Gvero] We do not have any new results, except what has already been said in connection with this obviously staged massacre by the Muslims. As you know, the representatives of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] were also unable to say anything more specific, because, really, they have nothing new to say. If they did have something to say this time, it appears this would have to be only in terms of an explanation and clarification that the Serbian side is not involved in this in any way. [Jankovic] How do you explain the refusal by both the Muslim side and General Ramsey for you to set up a joint commission of experts? [Gvero] The reason for this most probably lies in the fact that the Muslims think that the analyses of an impartial commission would prove that they staged the incident. This is why they did not accept it. When the news of the massacre was first aired, we were in the airport building and immediately suggested that a joint commission be set up. They rejected it 15 minutes later. They obviously hold the view that the findings of an impartial commission would not support them and are therefore rejecting it. [Jankovic] Mr. General, what does such a bloody move -- the shelling of civilians causing worldwide indignation -- mean from a military point of view? [Gvero] I am sure that this primarily means the prolongation of the Muslim war option, their lack of readiness to make steps toward peace, and the encouragement of their belief that they can solve something with war, by prolonging the war, probably counting on some encouragement and support from outside. There is not a single rational reason as to why they would do this, why civilians would be killed by those who are supposed to be protecting them, not killing them. However, when one thinks about it, one can see that they have support for such a course of action in Alija's Islamic Declaration, which clearly states that as far as a religious war is concerned, such as the one they are waging now, sacrifices are not important and neither are the numbers nor the quality.
