The main reason for the collapse of democratic power, I am convinced, is related... to the profound disillusionment with the `democracy of thieves.'" One can only rejoice that such a well-known and influential person has turned his attention to this problem, which is, as we liked to put it not long ago, so portentous for the country. One cannot help but agree that "corruption is becoming, not a by-product, but a determinant (at least, one of the determinants) of the political process." Incidentally, this was also mentioned on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, although not in such complicated form. Taken as a whole, however, the arguments of the former first vice-premier impel us to make certain comments. First of all, it is curious that Ye. Gaydar addresses this subject when he is already outside the government and feeling about for a popular platform for his fight to return to power. When he was at Staraya Ploshchad, he did not do this. I see in this, unnecessary confirmation of the fact that the fight against corruption is not -- leaving aside the question of "why" -- among the primary concerns of power. I recall that Nikolay Fedorov, the former minister of Justice (now president of Chuvashia), even spoke of a "lack of the will, among the higher Russian leaders, to fight in earnest against corruption." Not counting, of course, the myriad loud-mouthed decrees and edicts, the dissolved committees and commissions, etc. These spasmodic propagandistic imitations provide, rather, a negative effect, strengthening the corrupters' insolent belief in impunity. The scandalous exposures of corruption in the higher government echelons, which surfaced in the course of the scuffle between the legislative and executive powers, have faded into oblivion. Having fulfilled its function, that of dethroning Rutskoy, the Interdepartmental Commission to Fight Crime and Corruption, created by a decision at the highest level, and appearing to us on the television screen even under the chairmanship of the president, has quietly passed to its rest. Likewise remaining unclear is the Russian-Swedish-Canadian odyssey of Yakubovskiy, reminiscent of a hurriedly cooked-up mediocre detective story, a sprinter's rise -- in the manner of the favorites of the medieval monarchs -- a young reserve officer coming close to a general's epaulets. None of the state and political figures from the official tribunal followed the example of Sergey Shakhray -- he did not publish the data on the property situation and incomes. The press and television also grew tired of -- or seemed uncomfortable with -- the theme of corruption. They prefer to lapse into general discussions, sometimes sluggishly stinging personalities of rayon or settlement scale. Meanwhile, corruption has obtained a qualitatively new dimension. It has not only resolutely widened its boundaries, having covered practically the whole country with its hairy paw and ensnared all the degrees of the administrative ladder. A union of influential groups of bureaucrats, with the criminal and semi-criminal nouveau riche, has actually been organized on the its basis. This not only bleeds the country economically and prevents the growth of production enterprise, but has also become a weighty political factor (let us remember Ye. Gaydar's "determinant"). In many cases, this iniquitous union interferes in the electoral process, turns the practical realization of certain government decisions to its advantage and has a direct influence on other decisions. The Russia of reforms is turning into the Russia of corruption. This is already scaring off its Western partners. The Paris QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS wrote the other day that corruption in Russia was of a scope that created serious ethical problems for those in the West who were doing business with it. Yegor Gaydar, obviously, underestimates the effect of the sluggish stand of authority on the corruption processes. I am not going to find fault with the natural striving to minimize the "exploits" in this field, to use his expression, of "new people," and to give first place to the "former" schedule of appointments: it is dictated by the transparent political biases and gains. In real life, things are going, of course, otherwise -- the division here is not in any way taking place on this basis. In the embezzlement of public funds, both these schedules of appointments merge very nicely, although not without conflicts. When Yegor Timurovich writes that "the main thing is to destroy the objective bases of corruption and the state's monopolistic power over ownership," he is, of course, right. No less important, however -- particularly under the present Russian conditions -- is the way the state parts with its property. A unique process -- even the Chinese phenomenon bears only a distant resemblance -- is taking place in Russia right now, a process of alienation from the state and feverish dividing up of huge property worth hundreds of billions of dollars. It is being done actually behind the scenes, outside democratic control, farmed out to an army of officials, many units of which were corrupted from the start. The formal participation in this process of part of the population and work collectives is, of course, no hindrance to it. They have absolutely no understanding of either the essence or the technology of what is taking place, and are subject to pressure from the management of the enterprises, which makes wide use of the threat of unemployment as a warning to "parliament." This system of privatization is undoubtedly a fantastically powerful supplementary feeding factor for the corruption bacchanalia. Finally, corruption in Russia, as everywhere, incidentally, does not boil down to merely embezzlement of public funds and bribery. Perhaps, though, it is in our country, against a background of the boundless "flood" of them and the loss of ideals that political, moral corruption has taken on immeasurable scope. It has dragged many state officials, parliamentarians and professionals of various colors into its rapids. I am not concerned with the privileges with which the state pays for the stress, fervor and loyalty of its officials, although, of course, I do not agree with Ye. Gaydar when he states that it is "not a struggle against privileges, and especially not unappetizing populist outcries on this subject" that we need to counter corruption. The temptation is great to recall that these "outcries" were the main hobby-horse of the democrats in their campaign for power. The point, however, lies in something different: privileges stimulate corruption, if they are not open and known to society, but are secret. I have something else in mind: not only is conformism widespread among by no means ordinary statesmen, but also a readiness to "swap" their political, civic duty for material and other blessings, for the favors of the top echelons, and also for the strides of authority encouraging this trend. Commonplace on our public scene are the figures of the guardians of the law who manipulate original documents with impunity; generals, changing the oath; deputies hastily privatizing their official quarters; public prosecutors submitting their formal charges to the press; democrats worshiping Pinochet; finally, writers kissing up to the authorities. What is unbearably bad, though, is the penetration of this trend into the relations between various branches of power. Was it not in this spirit that the proposal that the Russian deputies leave the White House in exchange for material reward was sustained in the pre-October days? Can we not now see the obvious striving to make the conditions of work and everyday life of the deputies of the State Duma dependent on their "correct" behavior? Look how Vitaliy Kolbasyuk, in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, describes the mutual relations of the Moscow municipal council and city duma: "The State machine was attached to each of its members, and now they are quietly finding apartments for the people's chosen ones. Perhaps that is why there are no scandals in the city duma, and the Moscow duma members, fully dependent on the municipal council, but with no grounds for complaining that they are paid no attention, are working fruitfully." Such phenomena, of course, also occur in other countries, but usually do not emerge at the level of political manners. World experience has already reliably proved that the leadership of the executive power is above the representative, and anti-democratic structures and procedures are breeding corruption. Corruption and corrupters have advanced far, very far in our country. It is bitter to realize it, but the immune anti-corruption potential of society has been seriously undermined. The boundlessness and falsehood of the hired pens surrounding it has dulled the people's reaction, and many have succeeded in suggesting that this is, if not a normal, then in any case, a common and inevitable phenomenon. There is no doubt about it, corruption has already turned into an obstacle that is hard for any course of reform -- shock or otherwise -- to surmount. This, by the way, is one of the reasons why in Russia "enlightened authoritarianism" is impossible and doesn't work. Its reform is conceivable only along a democratic path and at the hands of democrats who are not mercenary-minded. The fight against corruption, naturally, should be the programmed task of all true democrats and patriots -- both those in the corridors of power and those opposing it.
