Premier Kiet recalled the Vietnamese people's tradition of industry and thrift. He stressed that to practise thrift and fight against public property embezzlement and wastefulness have become ever more urgent in Vietnam, a poor country which is fighting against the danger of lagging behind others in the region, and which needs economic accumulation for its own industrialization and modernization. The prime minister said he himself and many others worried about the situation such as capital construction whose wasteful expenditures and losses accounted for at least 10-20 per cent of its capital. He called for stepping up the on-going nationwide a campaign for practising economy and fight against public property embezzlement. He also recalled the government's responsibility in working out, and guiding the implementation of policies encouraging thrift practice and embezzlement prevention. The authorities at all levels should work out concrete and practical plans of action for thrift practice and embezzlement prevention in state institutions, enterprises and in society as a whole, the prime minister stressed.
