FBIS4-28116 "dreas110_a_94040" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan LDP's Gotoda on Cabinet, Political Realignment LDP's Gotoda on Cabinet, Political Realignment OW0806051194 Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese 2332 GMT 5 Jun 94 OW0806051194 Tokyo FNN Television Network Japanese BFN [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2332 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a 15-minute live interview in Tokyo with Masaharu Gotoda, former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by moderator Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and political commentator Kenichi Takemura. At 2333 GMT, Kuroiwa asks Gotoda for his views on the Hata administration. Gotoda says: "The Hata Cabinet lacks a power base as a cabinet under the system of parliamentary democracy. In the House of Representatives, for instance, little more than one third of the members belong to the ruling parties, and the figure drops to one quarter in the House of Councillors." He adds that as the purpose of political reform is to introduce responsible political administration, the ruling coalition should hand over political power to the opposition LDP and take the blame for causing the recent political chaos. Gotoda then says: "From the viewpoint of parliamentary democracy or the parliamentary cabinet system, the Hata Cabinet is an anomaly," adding that this alone is sufficient reason for the opposition parties to submit a motion of no-confidence against the present cabinet. The topic of discussion moves on to the next general election, and Gotoda says that right now the next general election could not be held under the new electoral system because it is uncertain when the Diet will approve the electoral redistricting bill. Gotoda says that although the present cabinet is incapable of handling the pending important issues, such as North Korea, tax reform, and the Naples summit, the possibility of it facing a no-confidence motion is uncertain because both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are divided over the matter. He predicts, though, that even without a vote of no-confidence the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse, regardless of the SDPJ's standing demand that it quit. Gotoda says he is in favor of completing the redistricting bill as soon as possible so that elections can be held under the new system. He admits, however, that the Hata cabinet may not survive until the bill is passed, and the election may have to be held under the existing system. "If that happens, the political parties should first promise voters that efforts to accomplish electoral reform will not be aborted. Otherwise, the people will not be convinced," he says. Kobayashi says political realignment, on the basis of policy on pending issues, is needed before the next general election. He then asks Gotoda if he would act as leader of a camp opposing forces led by Ichiro Ozawa. Gotoda says: "It would be impossible to complete political realignment before the next general election. I think it will take several years." He says political realignment will be completed by the process of forming successive new administrations over the course of several general elections. He says: "There is also the possibility that when the no- confidence motion is submitted, the coalition may simply reshuffle its party make-up to provoke the LDP and the SDPJ rather than dissolving the lower house to conduct a general election." He adds that it is most important that the LDP strengthens its unity to deal with such a situation. Asked about the possibility of a conservative alliance between the ruling coalition parties and the LDP, Gotoda says: "Such an alliance may result in the revival of the 'Taisei Yokusankai' [an autocratic national political mobilization organization] seen before World War II." Finally, at 2345 GMT, Gotoda says: "While both the LDP and the SDPJ have appeared to acknowledge the end of the '1955 political regime' [post-1955 political order in which the LDP dominated over the SDPJ and other opposition parties], they still unconsciously cling to the way things appeared in 1955. He calls on all parties to deal with pending issues, each from their own different standpoint.
