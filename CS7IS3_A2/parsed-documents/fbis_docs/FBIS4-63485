The president of Ukraine intends to cancel the decision taken by the Crimean Supreme Soviet to restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, according to which legal relations between Ukraine and Crimea are on a treaty basis and the people of Crimea have the right to dual citizenship. Earlier on television, Kravchuk announced that he will act decisively and consistently within the Constitution to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity. At the same time, in Kiev, the republic's Supreme Council is meeting behind closed doors and the president is expected to speak. He intends to persuade the deputies to cancel the verdict by the Crimean Supreme Council and will most likely get approval for introducing a regime of special rule in Crimea. [Announcer Nelli Petkova] Our correspondent has just reported that Ukraine's Supreme Council has adopted the following decision: To recommend that Crimea's Supreme Soviet reexamine and cancel its constitutional decision. If it fails to do so, in 10 days a decision by the Ukraine's Supreme Council on suspending the acts in question adopted by the Crimean parliament will automatically come into force. This decision was made at about 2000 Moscow time. The deputies then started to set up a special deputies' commission, which, along with people's deputies from Crimea, will go to Simferopol to settle all these problems.
