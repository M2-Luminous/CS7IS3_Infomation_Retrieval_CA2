The document, drafted during meetings to examine to U.S. trade pratices, emerged as Washington was threatening Japan with severe reprisals if Tokyo failed to open its markets to U.S.-made portable telephones. The United States has warned that it will prepare a list of Japanese products on which U.S. duties will be increased if Tokyo does not come forward with plans to give foreign portable telephone manufacturers greater access to Japanese consumers. Washington contends that Japan is violating a 1989 accord on such equipment. But the GATT report found that many parties to the agreement see U.S. trade policy as "unilataralist" and contradictory. "They point to what they consider the contradictions inherent in laws aimed at opening markets based on threats to close markets." They cited in particular U.S. legislation known as "Section 301." "There is a growing number of complaints from trading partners concerning the increased resort to these laws and the methods used to determine dumping, subsidization and injury," the report said. It noted that while the United States over the past two years has made "relatively restrained use of these laws," it has nonetheless "introduced new procedures to maintain pressure on foreign governments." The study criticized those voices in the United States urging greater protection against "high-savings countries with which the bilateral deficits are greatest" -- notably Japan. It said that "pressure to take bilateral action against these partners threatens both the openness of the U.S. trade regime and the multilateral system." GATT found that the United States does not always apply the lofty principles of free trade that it defends in debates with its principal partners. While the United States maintains restrictive legislation to protect its own producers it pressures other countries to open their markets still wider, according to GATT.
