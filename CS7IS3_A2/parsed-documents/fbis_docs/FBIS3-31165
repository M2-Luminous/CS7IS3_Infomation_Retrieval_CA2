He assessed the Armed Forces' activity in 1993 as satisfactory, saying that a package of bills required for the Armed Forces' reform had been advanced to the parliament last year, and it would be extended with a bill of the status of draftees and of military hired on contract. The integrated strategy of national security and the national military doctrine were articulated, documents which were being currently adjusted in order to have them harmonized with the mechanisms of the Partnership for Peace, General Spiroiu said. The new leading structures of the Army were endorsed by the Higher Defence Council and became effective on November 1, 1993. The staffs and general staff were established, the military education is being restructured and so are the defence industry and logistic sector, to keep up with the current requirements, the defence minister said. Referring to the Partnership for Peace, the defence minister said the signing of the master document, although expressing Romania's will, did not generate any advantage in point of the Partnership for Peace. But it was a clear proof that "we have chosen the rapprochement with the North-Atlantic Alliance, and, after more stages are covered, the program is expected to be rounded off with another program of joint activities, followed by concrete links with the Joint Command of Europe and the NATO Headquarters in Brussels. As regarded the Romanian Armed Forces' relations with Russia, the defence minister said that serious reasons caused the postponement of the visit by the defence minister of the Russian Federation, which was not "an evidence" of cooling military relations with Russia. General Spiroiu also announced he would visit Spain in early March, when he would also sign a bilateral military agreement as part of the Romanian strategy of expansion of the relations with the Armed Forces of the North-Atlantic Alliance.
