The following are the nine points of the document, a copy of which has been obtained by AFP: 1 - Creation of specialized councils for pursuing national action with regard to Palestinian autonomy and also with the Arab and international worlds. 2 - Calling on qualified people and experts to form councils and the planning and executive structures that depend on them. 3 - Giving priority to professional and political competence in forming working groups and negotiating committees and teams, eliminating favouritism and clan loyalties. 4 - Working out a plan of negotiation based on the text of the (Israeli-Palestinian) declaration of principles and ensuring complementarity [as received] and coordination among the various commissions and negotiating groups. 5 - Forming a supreme authority for guiding, directing and following up the negotiations process (with Israel). 6 - Forming a Palestinian Development and Reconstruction Council (PECDAR) based on specific criteria so that it should be credible in the eyes of (the Palestinian) people and the donors of funds for building the national economic infrastructure. 7 - Finalising the work of the (PLO) legislative committee charged with drawing up the basic law -- constitution -- of the national Palestinian authority in a way that brings out its democratic nature. 8 - Creating as soon as possible a supreme committee charged with organising a wide national dialogue grouping all Palestinian tendencies. 9 - Creating a high consultative committee of experts with a parallel status to that of the PLO Executive Committee, which has already been weakened by the departure of several of its members (hostile to the Washington accord). In this document, the 120 signatories reaffirm their determination to make the Israeli-Palestinian accord succeed, and their attachment to the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.
