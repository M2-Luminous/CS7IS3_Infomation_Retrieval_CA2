FBIS4-10061 "drlat067_g_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Guatemala URNG Asks for UN Verification; Condemns Slaying URNG Asks for UN Verification; Condemns Slaying PA0604144394 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0955 GMT 6 Apr 94 PA0604144394 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] has requested the immediate establishment of the international verification mechanism agreed on with the government on 29 March and condemned the assassination of Constitutionality Court President Eduardo Epaminondas Gonzalez. On 5 April, a URNG communique revealed that "compliance with the Global Agreement on Human Rights and the prompt establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the United Nations constitute the first trial by fire" of the negotiation process. The human rights agreement includes UN verification of respect for constitutional rights in Guatemala and compliance with the agreement's points. In addition, the URNG asked the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio to clarify the incident against Constitutionality President Gonzalez on 1 April. According to Guatemalan authorities, Gonzalez died on 3 April after being shot by unidentified people while driving to his home in Guatemala City. In the communique released in Mexico City, the URNG asked "that the assassination be cleared up as soon as possible," considering this incident "is within the jurisdiction and scope of the security forces, where it originated." In the guerrillas' opinion, the slaying of Gonzalez "constitutes flagrant provocation of Guatemalan society and the international community," following the signing of the Global Agreement on Human Rights in Mexico City on 29 March. In the communique signed by the four URNG commanders, the rebels rejected the implementation of a state of exception, which they consider part of "a preconceived plan to limit the freedom of expression of civic forces." The URNG General Staff urged the government and the Guatemalan Army to comply with the human rights agreement, which it called a "fundamental step" in the negotiation of the peace process in Guatemala. The URNG believes the presidential offer to grant the rebels amnesty reflects "existing contradictions (within the government) and contravenes the negotiation process." Shortly after the signing of the agreement was disclosed, President de Leon Carpio announced the possibility of granting the URNG militants amnesty, an offer rebel leaders believe "calls into question the government's will to conclude negotiations."
