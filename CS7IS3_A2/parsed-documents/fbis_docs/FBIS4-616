Patterton] [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- A campaign to recruit civil servants for the rightwing "Volksrepublic" [Afrikaner people's republic] started on Tuesday [12 April], the Volksrepublic's Transitional President Ferdi Hartzenberg announced in Pretoria. He said each public servant would receive a document enabling them to join the Volksrepublic's civil service when it came into being shortly. "Needless to say, such officials (who respond) will enjoy preference when it comes to appointments in our civil service," Dr Hartzenberg said. It would be assumed public servants who did not indicate they wanted to join the Volksrepublic's civil service wanted to work for the so-called new South Africa, if there were jobs left for them after affirmative action, Dr Hartzenberg said. Referring to public servants strikes elsewhere in the country, especially in the homelands, he said no-one could blame central government civil servants if they also demanded their pensions now in order to get back some of their contributions. Referring to the solvency of the central government pension fund, he noted it was being further taxed by "MK (Umkhonto we Sizwe) [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members who were terrorists in the bush who are also suddenly becoming pensioners".
