Orthodox believers are celebrating their great festival on 7 January, the birthday of Christ. I congratulate in a most heartfelt way all our Christian citizens on their great holiday and wish every success in their work for the benefit of our motherland, health, and happiness. May this solemn festivity unite Kyrgyzstanis around the ideals of good, justice, mutual tolerance, and respect. We highly value the activity of the Orthodox church aimed at consolidation of compatriots irrespective of their outlook and political beliefs, for strengthening of civil peace and interethnic accord, and for spiritual renewal of our existence. Our state sees its duty in helping people to share eternal spiritual values. The new constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, which guarantees rights for freedom of belief and for spiritual and cultural freedom opens up the way to a civilized human communication based on cooperation, mutual help, and unification of all creative forces. I am convinced that this will play an important role in overcoming the current difficulties and creating the life which our people deserve. Happy Christmas!
