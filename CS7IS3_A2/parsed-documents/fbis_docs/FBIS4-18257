Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasid; Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozer Koray; presidential advisers Necati Munir Ertegun and Ergun Olgun, and U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher attended the meeting, which lasted for nearly an hour and a half and continued during a working luncheon. In a statement before the meeting, Ambassador Robert Lamb said that the objective of his contacts was to ascertain the views of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides on the package of confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He stressed that he did not intend to submit new proposals to the two sides. Describing the CBM's as a very important opportunity for Cyprus, Lamb said that the United States is determined to do what is necessary to eliminate any possible difference of views between the two sides on the CBM's. Speaking after the meeting, President Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Lamb informed us of the meeting he held with Glavkos Kliridhis. Nothing has changed on the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots have not changed their viewpoint. Our viewpoint is clear. We have discussed that. With Good will, a way can be found to resolve the matter. I am forced to reiterate that we cannot make any progress if the Greek Cypriot side maintains the attitude that it is the government and can say that it does not agree to this or that. [end recording] President Denktas replied to correspondents' questions as follows: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the UN officials have damaged the CBM's with their interim proposals. Furthermore, they have used pressure to force you to agree to their proposals. [Denktas] They are approaching both sides. [Correspondent] Are they taking sides? [Denktas] No, they say that they are trying to help the two sides. [Correspondent] Have they submitted new proposals? [Denktas] No, but they tried to learn our viewpoint on whether or not this or that can be changed. Naturally, the changes called for depend on what the Kliridhis Administration agrees or disagrees on. [Second unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you disclosed yesterday that you are being forced to hold a referendum. What conditions compel you to do so? [Denktas] We shall wait to see the [UN secretary general's] report. We shall wait to see what else will be done. If we say something, it should not be taken to mean that we shall do it the next day. We are trying to convey certain hints on where the matter is going. We have to wait for the report. What will the UN Security Council do later? Will it adopt a new resolution? We shall wait to see all that. [Correspondent] The report may be postponed? [Denktas] Yes; I read a newspaper report on that, but we have no official information. [Third unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the developments on the CBM's depend on the Greek Cypriot approach? [Denktas] The solution of the Cyprus problem depends on the Greek Cypriot approach. Naturally, the ball will always be in the Greek Cypriot court if they continue to say: We are the legal Cyprus Government; things have to be done the way we want them; we are justified in demanding everything; nothing happened between 1963 and 1974; the Cyprus problem began in 1974; and Greece and Cyprus can adopt joint decisions and cooperate on this or that. [Fourth unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, there was a danger of a deadlock in the talks at the beginning of the week. You said that the package had been pierced and that a state of uncertainty existed. [Denktas] They are trying to find a way. [Correspondent] Have new proposals been submitted? [Denktas] No, new proposals have not been submitted. They are trying to establish whether the two sides can agree to alter their positions on several basic issues and to what extent are they prepared to do so. It is quite clear that there has been no significant change in the positions of the two sides thus far. Therefore, efforts will probably continue. [end recording]
