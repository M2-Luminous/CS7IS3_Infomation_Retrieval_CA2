As early as six months ago, General Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Council of Defense Ministers, spoke about the imminent integration of the commonwealth Armed Forces. Vyacheslav Morozov, correspondent of the Radar studio, talked to him. [Begin recording] [Morozov] Leonid Grigoryevich, has the idea of setting up CIS Armed Forces already been dropped or is it still alive? [Ivashov] I believe that nobody has dropped this idea. It has simply been postponed in connection with quite complex processes related to the formation of national armed forces, which are compounded by economic and financial difficulties as well as other difficulties which our society, our Commonwealth, is going through. Therefore, the idea has not been discarded, but it has simply been decided to move toward it stage by stage. And the things that took place in Ashgabat, at the joint meeting of the Council of Defense Ministers, the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the meeting of the Council of Heads of State show precisely that we are entering a new phase of our military cooperation. Quite specific decisions were adopted there. First, a headquarters to coordinate military cooperation was set up, its statute was approved, and the principles of its financing and the functions of the headquarters were defined. I would note as a second point the fact that more than 18 months after the Tashkent collective security treaty was signed specific steps were taken to implement its provisions. A secretary general was appointed, a decision on priority steps to implement the treaty was adopted, and a mechanism was determined for other states to join the treaty. Georgia and Azerbaijan, for instance, have already joined the collective security treaty. Nine Commonwealth states now support the idea of the treaty, and they are starting to work on creating a collective security system. Army General Vitaliy Grigoryevich Radetskiy, Ukrainian defense minister, made a heartening statement in the spirit of a constructive approach to the collective security system and military cooperation within the Commonwealth framework in general. So the idea is not only alive but has already been filled with specific content. We are now in a period of transition to military integration and construction. An earlier stage was aimed at more or less civilized division of the Armed Forces, at our divorce, as it were, in the post-Soviet period. But now a creative stage is beginning, and I hope I am not mistaken on this matter. We will draw closer, step by step, restore a single defense space, and create a defense and security system by joint efforts. [end recording]
