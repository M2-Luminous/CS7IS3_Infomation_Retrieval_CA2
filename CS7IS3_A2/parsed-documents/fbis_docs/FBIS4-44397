Last year, they tried and concluded 19,074 assorted court cases, 16.43 percent more than in the previous year. Urumqi's courts at both levels tried and sentenced 1,499 criminal elements who had committed murder, rape, hooliganism and robbery, or deliberate assault and other serious crimes. They also held prompt and open public trials, proving that they were serious about their assault on crime. They also launched a series of special crackdowns and tried and wrapped up 578 crime cases involving theft, drug trafficking, and trademark counterfeiting. As the case load increased and difficult cases multiplied, the entire judicial and cadre and police contingent dealing with civil cases further speeded up the handling of real estate, debt, and labor dispute cases, properly dealt with marriage and family and inheritance cases, and promptly resolved disputes and settled conflicts to further promote stability, unity, and the socialist spiritual civilization.
