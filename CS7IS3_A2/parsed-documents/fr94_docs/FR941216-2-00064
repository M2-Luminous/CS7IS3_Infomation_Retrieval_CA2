FR941216-2-00064 FR941216-2-00043 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction On Thursday, August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), EPA, Region IV proposed the issuance of the draft NPDES General Permit. During the 30-day comment period, a request for an extension of the comment period was received, and on Tuesday, October 25, 1988 (53 FR 43035), the comment period was extended to November 15, 1988. On Monday, July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), EPA, Region IV issued the Final NPDES General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida. On Friday, February 22, 1991 (56 FR 7379), EPA, Region IV published a notice of a proposed modification to the NPDES General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida (56 FR 7379) to include dewatering activities. On Thursday, August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), the final modification was issued. The general permit expired on July 16, 1994. On Monday, September 19, 1994, EPA Region IV published a notice concerning the reissuance of the general permit (59 FR 47862) that is being issued in final form today. The Region received comments from eight (8) commentors. All the public comments received during the 30-day comment period are included in the administrative record and were considered by Region IV in the formulation of a final determination of the conditions of today's final permit. For reference, Region IV published a detailed fact sheet with the proposed draft permit in 59 FR 47862. The Region is incorporating by reference that fact sheet as part of the final fact sheet for today's final permit. The discussions presented in the previous fact sheet should be consulted in reviewing the applicability and scope of the final permit conditions. A formal hearing is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under 40 CFR 124.14 except for a general permit. Persons affected by a general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general permit as a right in further agency proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit in court, or apply for an individual permit under 40 CFR 122.21 as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28 and then request a formal hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual permit. Additional information regarding these procedures is available by contacting Ms. Gwen Eason, Office of Regional Counsel, at the address above or at (404) 347&hyph;2309. II. Other Legal Requirements A. Executive Order 12291 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8[b] of that order. B. Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in this final general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. ยง3501 et seq. The information collection requirements of this permit have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget in submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. C. State Certification Requirements Section 301(b)(1)(c) of the Act requires that NPDES permits contain conditions which ensure compliance with applicable State water quality standards or limitations. Section 401 of the Act requires that States certify that Federally issued permits are in compliance with State law. This permit is for operations discharging to waters within the State of Florida. Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53, EPA requested certification of the permit on September 15, 1994. On October 27, 1994, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection waived certification of the general permit. D. Effective Date The final NPDES general permit issued today, December 6th, 1994, is effective on December 7, 1994. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act After review of the facts presented in this document, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง605(b), that this NPDES general permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Moreover, the permit reduces a significant administrative burden on regulated sources. Patrick M. Tobin, Deputy Regional Administrator.
