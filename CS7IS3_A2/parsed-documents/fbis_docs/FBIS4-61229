But what about the ordinary days? What problems does Russia's air force resolve every day? That is the subject of journalist Gennadiy Lisankov's talk with Aviation Colonel General Petr Stepanovich Deynekin, commander in chief of the Air Force. [Lisankov] What is the most important thing in the Air Force's development at the present stage? How is its structure being coordinated with Russia's defensive military doctrine? [Deynekin] On the basis of the air force formations inherited from the former Union an essentially new, highly maneuverable branch of the armed forces is being created. A balanced personnel, the existence of modern aviation equipment and arms, the ability effectively to resolve the entire complex of tasks in joint or independent operations, minimal expenditure on maintenance -- those are just a few of the most important criteria for the development of the Russian Air Force. An important avenue of our work is the qualitative improvement of the Air Force by reequipping the formations and units with new multipurpose complexes with high-precision all-weather weapons. [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, from which CIS states will student pilots be studying in Russian air force schools? How is cooperation with NATO countries developing? [Deynekin] Under agreements servicemen from Armenia, Belorussia [Belarus], and Kazakhstan are studying at our air force higher education establishments. It is planned to admit student pilots from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. We are prepared to collaborate in the development of national air forces and in other directions. As for cooperation with the NATO countries these questions are at the development stage. We are receiving proposals on the mutual exchange of aviation specialists for study and industrial training. We are studying them attentively and where possible we are making contacts. Last year a number of student pilots from the Kacha pilots' school underwent training in France while French students trained at the Kacha school. The result satisfied both sides. Direct context when training air force cadres make it possible to understand each other better and to reduce tension in resolving military issues. Nor should we forget the material advantages, that is the money which will go to develop the air force's training and material-technical base and the solution of social problems. [Lisankov] Is it true that the Air Force's purchase of MiG-29 and Su-27 type aircraft is not planned because of the lack of funds? [Deynekin] The Air Force has indeed stopped the purchase of aircraft of the Mig-29 and Su-27 type but not because of budget restrictions. The reason is simple: The plan to rearm the fighter aircraft has been fulfilled. As Russia's economic situation stabilizes we plan to increase the pace of the air force's reequipping with equipment and arms of a new generation. [Lisankov] What is the fate of the strategic bombers in the former union republics, in particular Ukraine and Kazakhstan? [Deynekin] The armed forces of the republics of nearby foreign parts lack structures capable of ensuring the safe storage of nuclear warheads and the good repair of strategic aircraft. As a military specialist I am convinced that apart from Russia no armed forces of the CIS countries can ensure the good repair of the aircraft component of the strategic nuclear forces since that requires very great material expenditure, the highest qualifications for the servicing personnel, and aid from design bureaus and manufacturing plants. In Kazakhstan there were 40 Tu-95 MS aircraft. In accordance with the commitments adopted by Russia as the heir to the Union with regard to the strategic forces they were withdrawn to Russia. The four last aircraft were withdrawn 19 February. The moving of the heavy bombers, as it is customary to call them under the treaty, although they are in fact strategic missile-carrying aircraft, from the territory of Kazakhstan to Russia does not contradict the provision of the START I Treaty since it is being carried out within the national territory of the former Soviet Union. Aircraft from the air force nuclear forces remained in Ukraine: There are 23 Tu-95 MS bombers at the Uzin airfield near Kiev and 19 Tu-160 aircraft at the Priluki airfield, Chernigov Oblast. Of these 42 strategic aircraft only a few can take off because the repair stocks have been exhausted in the Ukrainian Air Force line units. Talks are under way with the Ukrainian Government on the withdrawal of this grouping of strategic aircraft to Russian territory. But so far we are failing to find mutual understanding. [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, you are a combat pilot. What aircraft have you flown in your time in service? [Deynekin] I have flown a Tu-16 and been in command of a regiment on these aircraft. The forces were cut back yet again -- this was in the early sixties -- and I became a civilian pilot. When I returned to the Armed Forces I mastered the Tu-22M, the renowned "Backfire," the first supersonic long-range combat jet bomber with variable wing geometry. Then I studied at the General Staff Academy and after graduating I was commander and instructor pilot of a Tu-95 strategic combat jet. Later I mastered the Tu-160 strategic jet aircraft. In this period I commanded first an air army and then strategic aviation. In May 1992 in America I made three flights on the U.S. Air Force's Bi-B strategic bomber with in-flight refueling from a KC-135 stratotanker. When I was already commander in chief I flew a "Tucano" in Brazil and a "Jaguar" in India. The latest Russian aircraft I have mastered include the Su-25, Su-27, Mig-29, and Mig-31. Finally I want to take this opportunity to say this. We have spoken of military aviation's present but we must not forget the glorious past of the Air Force and its history and traditions. Without the past there is no future. In the Russian Air Force now there are six twice Heroes of the Soviet Union, 15 Heroes of the Soviet Union, and three Heroes of the Russian Federation. And I bow low to our frontline veterans. The forthcoming victory holiday is particularly dear to me -- both as commander in chief and as the son of an Air Force office who died in 1943....
