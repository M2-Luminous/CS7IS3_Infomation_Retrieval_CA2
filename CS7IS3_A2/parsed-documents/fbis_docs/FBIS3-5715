He decided to present a light grey colour rare marble, which was polished like mirror and engraved with his name, to President Kim Il-song as a gift, and let the Gabonese ambassador to the DPRK convey it. The director of Naomi Trading Company in Hong Kong surveyed famous stone production centres to pick a rare natural stone and processed and engraved it with the letters reading "Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, Long Live the Great Chuche Idea!" and sent it to the Tower of the Chuche Idea. More than 600 stones of good quality have been presented to the tower by party, state and government leaders, political parties, public organizations and groups for the study of the chuche idea of over 90 countries, international organizations and public figures since the construction of the tower (1982).
