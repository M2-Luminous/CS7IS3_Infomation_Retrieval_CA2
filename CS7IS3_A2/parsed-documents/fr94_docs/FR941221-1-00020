FR941221-1-00020 FR941221-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IA&hyph;12&hyph;1&hyph;6529b; FRL&hyph;5125&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of Iowa AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the state of Iowa. The state's request for a revision to the SIP includes updating the state's incorporation by reference and conformity to various Federal regulations. In the final rules section of the Federal Register , the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct-final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 20, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Christopher D. Hess, Environmental Protection Agency, Air Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christopher D. Hess at (913) 551&hyph;7213. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: See the information provided in the direct final rule which is located in the rules section of the Federal Register . Dated: October 20, 1994. Dennis Grams, P.E.
