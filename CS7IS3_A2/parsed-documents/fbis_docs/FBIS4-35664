The Majles speaker also charged the Riyadh government with inciting Iran's neighboring countries against Tehran under the pretext of the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf. The three Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and Greater Tunb are of great importance to the people and government of the Islamic Republic, he said. "A nation who has defended its territory by dedicating thousands of martyrs, will never back down on the issue and such mischievous acts are undoubtedly not in the interest of Saudi Arabia and other regional governments," Nateq-Nuri said at the Majles. It is not the first time that Saudi Arabia, because of its wrong and illogical prejudices has taken position against Iran, he said, adding that already Riyadh had taken the side of Iraq during its 8 year war against Iran. Commenting on the civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan, the speaker said the conflict there had no justification but incited by hegemonism and carnal desires. He called on all the warring sides in Afghanistan to quit hegemonism and try instead to unite and rebuild their war-torn country. Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri instructed the Foreign Ministry to follow up the issue of Afghanistan and do its best to end the ongoing war and fratricide in that country. Elsewhere in his speech, the speaker lashed out at international circles particularly the U.N. and its secretary general for their silence on Israel's recent kidnapping of Mustafa Dirani from his home in Lebanon.
