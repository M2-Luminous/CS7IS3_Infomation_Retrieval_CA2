Addressing the forum, Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], emphasized the necessity of strengthening overall grass-roots construction by firmly taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period as guidance, and meeting the overall demands put forward by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin: "Be qualified politically and competent militarily, have a fine work style, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support." The forum was held with the approval of the CMC, whose leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen have attached great importance to it by putting forward demands. The forum's main topic of discussion was to study ways and means to implement the "Outlines on Grass-Roots Army Building," reissued by the CMC, so as to enhance the combat effectiveness of grass-roots party organizations, raise grass-roots cadres' ability to lead troops, and promote overall improvement in the grass roots. Cadres in charge of political work in various major PLA units and the armed police force attended the meeting. In his speech, Yu Yongbo elaborated Comrade Jiang Zemin's overall demands in standardizing and guiding grass-roots construction. He said: These five phrases: "Be qualified politically and competent militarily, have a fine work style, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support" were based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new period and took into consideration the realities of doing so. Broadly summing up the tasks and criteria of army building, these statements fully reflected the demands and missions of army building in the new situation and are in complete compliance with the objective law of grass-roots construction. Standardizing and guiding grass-roots construction with these "five phrases" is not only a practical application of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in respect to grass-roots construction in the new period, but are also important measures needed for realizing the great goal of establishing a powerful, modernized, regular revolutionary army. Armed with this guidance, we should be able to build a more solid foundation for army building, coordinate various work, strengthen overall construction, and perform the basic functions of our army. We must implement these new "guidelines" with a new attitude and style, and proceed toward the goals of "qualification, competence, fineness, and strictness." Yu Yongbo said: Party committees at company level are the core of unified leadership and solidarity. Efforts should be made to improve quality and grass-roots construction, enhance party spirit and the concept of pioneering among party members; and to strengthen party committees' ideological and political leadership and bring into full play the role of fighting force. Touching on vigorously promoting the fine tradition of unity between officers and men and enhancing the troop-leading ability of grass-roots cadres in the new situation, Yu Yongbo emphasized: Unity between officers and men is the fine tradition of our army; leaders at various levels, particularly grass-roots cadres, should correct their basic attitude toward the soldiers by genuinely understanding and loving them. In improving our overall troop- leading ability, we should act fairly and honestly, build a good self-image, and closely integrate strict control and guidance with patience. Yu Yongbo demanded leaders at various levels and political organs strictly adhere to the "guidelines" in guiding grass-roots construction. He urged them to always keep the grass roots in mind, constantly think of the soldiers, and look for new ideas and ways to help solve real grass-roots problems. Leaders from departments connected with the General Staff Headquarters and General Logistics Department, including Zhou Ziyu, Du Tiehuan, Xu Caihou, and Tang Tianbiao, attended the meeting.
