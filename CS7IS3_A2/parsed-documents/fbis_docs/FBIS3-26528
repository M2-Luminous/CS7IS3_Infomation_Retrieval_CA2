During the forum he pointed out: Personnel engaged in journalism should uphold the correct guiding direction of public opinions. They should vigorously carry forward their major missions, enhance the construction of the journalist corps, continuously upgrade their working level, and create a good environment in public opinion for reform and development. On the morning of 21 January, the meeting room on the third floor of the provincial party committee's building was filled with a happy and relaxed atmosphere, in which the responsible comrades of the provincial level journalist units delivered reports by bearing their working reality in mind regarding their past year's work in supporting the central work of the provincial party committee, in bringing their strong points into play, and in carrying out the propaganda work of journalism, as well as regarding the methods of conducting their work this year. During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang fully acknowledged the work done by the provincial level journalist units over the past year. He said: Over the past year the provincial journalist front, in line with the central work of the provincial party committee, has done a great deal of work in building journalistic theories; publicizing economic affairs; giving guidance to public opinions; investigating and discussing situations; and popularizing knowledge. The front has fostered a journalistic pattern primarily consisting of positive propaganda, multiple propaganda styles, and a method of arousing people to progress which is being adopted. It has played an active role in promoting the province's programs of reform, opening up, and economic construction. The self-improvement of journalist units has also achieved new progress. It has also made active contributions to developing the tertiary industry and improving the conditions for raising funds. Some work done by our province's journalist units were commended or encouraged at the national appraisal events and have expanded the influence and exposure of Jilin Province. In this connection, the provincial party committee is very proud of them and I would like to take the opportunity to extend congratulations on their achievements, to express thanks for their contributions, and to extend cordial regards through the comrades at the forum to all journalist workers throughout the province. During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We are in a period of large-scale development and changes. The year of 1994 is the last period of improving the province's economy to a new level and also a crucial period of building Jilin into a developed, border, and maritime province. In facing such a situation and task, duties assumed by the journalist front are important and great and the provincial party committee places great hopes on the front. Personnel engaged in journalistic work should uphold the principle of regarding positive propaganda as the main task and provide powerful support in public opinions for improving the province's economy to a new level and building Jilin into a developed province by the sea. In line with the demands of unity, stability, and arousal, they should give priority to their major professional missions. Deepening reform and accelerating development represent major tasks of our age as a whole. New demands were set by new situations and tasks. The journalistic work is exerting special efficacy and the journalist units should do a good job in directing the public opinions in the society. First of all these units, themselves, should make a clear distinction between right and wrong and dare to adopt a clear attitude. They should adopt a clear-cut attitude toward what they should advocate, carry forward, and resist. They should resolutely resist the things that have been proved as wrong, negative, and harmful. By no means should they leave these things unchecked. Journalistic propaganda has its own law. Journalists should study the law and deeply carry out investigation and study some problems so as to learn about the feelings of readers, audience, and viewers. They should foster the mental attitude of being high-spirited to make progress, actively conduct healthy and favorable propaganda, and resist or weaken the negative and retrogressed things. In conducting journalistic propaganda, it is imperative to integrate intention with results. Comrade He Zhukang stressed: In conducting the work of journalistic propaganda, it is necessary to uphold a high standard and a strict demand; to enhance the construction of the journalist's contingent and the self-improvement of journalists; and to upgrade the level of journalists. Personnel engaged in journalistic work should steadily engage in study and upgrade their level through practice. Upgrading the work level has a bearing not only on technology and equipment but also on the quality of personnel. Journalists should stress ethics, observe the party's discipline, and implement the party's principles and policies. By no means should they conduct paid journalism. In conducting their work, journalists should advocate an earnest and rigorous work style. Personnel in every link, from reporters to editors and directors of newspaper offices and broadcasting stations, should earnestly take up their responsibility. The journalist units should strictly conduct management and their leading personnel should set themselves up as an example in boldly taking up and handling problems. These units should also do a good job in conducting self improvement, foster the characteristics of their own, upgrade their level, and broaden their influence. (Li Zhongtain), member of the provincial party standing committee and director of the propaganda department under the provincial party committee, presided over the forum and also delivered a speech.
