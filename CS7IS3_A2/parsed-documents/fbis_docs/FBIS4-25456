From 27 to 30 May, the "Seminar on Use of Foreign Capital To Reform State-Owned Enterprises and on the `China Strategic Investment Limited' Phenomenon," was held in Hangzhou, nearly 100 experts and scholars from Chinese government departments, economic circles, and news circles gathered together to seek proper ways to reform state-owned enterprises and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the joint reform efforts by Hong Kong's China Strategic Investment Limited and the mainland's state-owned enterprises in recent years. They unanimously thought that one effective ways to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to use foreign capital to reform them. The seminar was jointly proposed and organized by the Zhejiang Province Committee for Restructuring Economy, Zhejiang's GAIGE YUEKAN [Reform Monthly], and ZHEJIANG JINGJI BAO. Among of those attending the seminar were An Zhiwen, president of the Society for Research on Restructuring the Economic System; Wang Yuzhao, Standing Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and vice chairman of the Economy Committee of the CPPCC; Liu Guoguang, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Yang Qixian, vice president of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System; Huang Daoxia, researcher at the State Council's Development Research Center; and economics professors and theorists from various universities, including Fang Sheng, Wang Jue, Zhong Mingrong, Wei Jie, and Liu Wei, in addition to journalists from some 20 central, provincial, and city news organizations. Yang Bin, vice chairman of Zhejiang Province People's Congress, Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, and Lu Yongxiang, member of the CPC Central Committee and president of Zhejiang University, also attended the seminar. Huang Hong-nien, chairman of the broad of directors of China Strategic Investment Limited in Hong Kong, and the persons in charge of the joint-venture enterprises set up by the company on the mainland, also came to the seminar to hear expert opinions and give briefings on the great changes in joint-venture enterprises after their company injected funds into them. They cited a series of figures and facts to illustrate that importation of foreign capital has not only enabled state-owned enterprises to change mechanisms, but also promoted technological transformation and reform of management systems in the enterprises, aroused workers' enthusiasm for production, and enabled enterprises to swiftly stop losses, earn profits, and have marked economic returns. Wei Jie, a professor from the People's University of China, fully affirmed the "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" from the perspective of development of productive forces. He pointed out that when the shares of state-owned enterprises are controlled by foreign investors, state assets, enterprises, entrepreneurs, and the labor force have their positions fixed, then the big problem which has hindered state-owned enterprises for a long time, namely mixing up of government and enterprises and separation of authority and duty, has been solved. Professor Wang Jue from the Central Party School thought that the "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is not accidental, but is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of deepening of reform of state-owned enterprises. An absolute majority of the state-owned enterprises taken over by China Strategic Investment Limited for reform have cast off poverty and embarked upon the road of development and have changed losses to profits; this is good for individuals, collectives, and the state as well, and this has provided a lot of enlightenment about the reform of state-owned enterprises. He also said that the reform of state-owned enterprises is now an urgent task, and that if initiative is still not actively taken, then many state-owned enterprises will collapse. After carrying out enterprise reform, other steps such as financial and taxation reforms must be swiftly implemented, otherwise the functions of enterprises after reform cannot be further developed. Wang Yuzhao, vice chairman of the CPPCC Economic Committee, said when he addressed the seminar that the crux of the current difficult situation of state-owned enterprises is a system problem and the basic way out is a reform of the system. Therefore, borrowing the strong points from the enterprises under non-state-owned system, especially non-public-owned system, to reform state-owned enterprises, should be an important way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. The "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is precisely this kind of exploration and creation. Its practice has helped enterprises clarify property rights, promoted separation of government from enterprises, expedited enterprise technological transformation, upgraded the degree of enterprise participation in the international market, and, at the same time, maintained a dominant position of party work. At present, society has different opinions on the "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon," but this situation is not strange at all. Since reform and opening up, no innovative practice has avoided causing controversy and criticism. However, an innovation which has real vitality is not afraid of controversy and criticism. During the seminar, the experts and scholars also visited China Strategic Hangzhou Brewery Company Limited and China Strategic Hangzhou Rubber Company Limited, to examine the changes and benefits brought about by importation of foreign funds to these enterprises.
