Because we have now learned our lesson, we know their tricks, the way they operate. We receive our military training in the United States, our radio sets are tuned to those of the police, we now know how to hide, we have learned the rules of underground operations. Just think that almost every night one of our armed units manages to penetrate into Hebron's old town without ever being detected by the army, which nevertheless has orders not to let us through." Kakh spokesperson Noam Federman' words (Kakh is the Israeli extremist movement to which Baruch Goldstein -- the author of the Hebron massacre -- belonged) sounded almost prophetic. They were uttered in the course of an interview held with our newspaper just over two months ago in Beit Hadassah, one of the eight small Israeli settlements in the Arab heartland of Hebron. "A war to the last drop of blood is being fought between us and the Arabs. There is no other alternative: It is either us or them. However, we are very much concerned that Rabin's government is apparently prepared to sell out our country's heartland in exchange for a mock peace. He is hoping that we will abandon Hebron, and therefore he is not providing us with adequate protection against Arab terrorism. This is why we decided that it was high time that we acted for ourselves. We will defend ourselves by all means available. We will attack the Arabs and terrorize them. We will force them to leave." Federman asserted this fearlessly, without trying to hide his intentions behind words. Reading again those notes is almost like reading the announcement of a future massacre. Today Federman is in hiding. In fact, since 28 February the police have been looking for him, as well as three other activists, all of whom are accused of belonging to a movement which, with the massacre nine days ago, has now proved that it is ready to implement the racist theory of "great Israel's ethnic purity" by means of armed terrorism. One of them, 33-year old Baruch Marzel, who, following the assassination of the organization's founder, Rabbi Meir Kahane, four years ago in New York, is now considered Kakh's senior leader, has given rise to a spate of polemics after the national TV network broadcast an interview in which he appeared disguised in a motorcyclist's helmet and a large black coat. Many are asking: "Why is it that reporters are allowed to speak to people wanted by the police, but the police are unable to arrest wanted people?" [passage omitted]
