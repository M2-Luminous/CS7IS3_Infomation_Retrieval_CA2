BKA Warns Against Uranium Dealers''] [Text] The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) is sounding the alarm! Increasingly often, gangs of profiteers from the ex-USSR are trying to sell nuclear material. In 1993 alone, 23 uranium dealers were caught, more than 150 investigation proceedings were instituted, and 50 kg of deadly uranium was confiscated. BKA President Zachert told BILD: ``With nuclear crime, a new quality of organized crime has developed. It seems to be possible that nuclear material of different origins is falling into unauthorized hands.''
