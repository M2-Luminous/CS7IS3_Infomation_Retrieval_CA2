In the meeting, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen noted that China is calling for North Korea's self-restraint from fruitless military conflicts, stressing that concerned nations should seek a settlement of the problem through consultations to the end. The Japan-China foreign ministerial meeting was held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for over two hours. In the meeting, Foreign Minister Kakizawa expressed great expectations for China's role in the North Korean issue, asking it to persuade North Korea to reopen dialogue with the international community. On that ground, Foreign Minister Kakizawa requested China not to use its veto when the UN Security Council [UNSC] discusses sanctions against North Korea, noting China's positive role is very important in the UN process to determine its stance, including sanctions. In response, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that the Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the present circumstances of the problem. [Begin recording of reporter Tadanobu Sakamoto in Beijing] Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the Chinese Government's great concern over the present circumstances of the North Korean nuclear issue. He then clarified that China is trying its best to persuade North Korea to refrain from fruitless military conflicts. On the other hand, he indirectly showed China's negative stance toward UN sanctions, saying sanctions cannot be effective right now and the issue should be settled through consultations to the end. However, the Japanese delegation is paying attention to the fact that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not clearly say China would oppose UN sanctions because this is seemingly the first change in China's official stance toward the issue. The Japanese Government views China may not use its veto when the UNSC is forced to impose sanctions against North Korea. Hereafter, the government intends to strengthen its approach to China in close cooperation with the United States and the ROK. [end recording]
