Gaidar Hopes To Win Support of President Yeltsin and Major Financial Groups", which says that "evidently, by holding a news conference devoted to the final stage of the creation of the "Russia's Choice" party Gaydar and his allies, Anatoliy Chubays, Anatoliy Pristavkin and Sergey Kovalev, intended not only to convince all those interested of bright prospects of this organisation, but show its present powerful organisational and intellectual potential. This has been demonstrated by a statement made by founders of the party and circulated at a news conference on Thursday, which was signed by over a hundred prominent public figures. The newspaper carries an interview with chairman of the Georgian temporary committee for emergency situations, Jaba Ioseliani, who declared that "Abkhazian claims to create an independent state do not conform to existing realities. It is unnatural that 20,000 Abkhazians dictate their will to the predominantly Georgian population numbering around 500,000. This is not the right basis for building up a state, all the more so, because 5 million more Georgians are residing in the neighbouring state. This is absurd... The results of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict which led to a bloody war suit no one today. Naturally, Georgia is not satisfied either... I repeat what I said many times before: Georgia's enemies cannot be Russia' patriots, they are its enemies ..., destroying what was created over centuries for the sake of present-day advantages. These people are "temporary", Ioseliani said. The results of an election campaign in subjects of the Russian Federation are published on the front page of the ROSSIYSKIE VESTI Newspaper. The newspaper Says that "elections held in Russia's regions on March 27, showed several tendencies. An opinion was confirmed that public and political forces centered in Moscow did not show a profound interest in these elections. In fact, the struggle for regions between political parties has not begun yet," the newspaper said. The TRUD daily carries an article by an academician of the Russian Academy of Education, Igor Bestuzhev-Lada, who says that "now and then, both branches of the executive power tell us that the situation is under control and whatever happens is for the better in the best of these worlds. However, we see for ourselves that the situation continues to deteriorate and there are no real signs of improvement or even stabilisation or deterrence of collapse in the foreseeable future. In my opinion, civic accord must begin not from a 'non-attack treaty' (since politicians who cease to attack each other are no longer politicians), but from real political programmes which could unite broad enough circles of the population and party forces, reflecting their interests," Bestuzhev-Lada said. The VECHERNIY PETERSBURG newspaper writes that a coordinative council for fighting drug mafia and drug business was set up at the St. Petersburg mayor's office. The council was established because St. Petersburg is turning into one of European centers of drug business since its location is convenient for transit of drugs from Asia to Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states. The actual number of drug addicts in St. Petersburg varies from 80,000 to 250,000, interior officials said. The newspaper ST. PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI reports that a regional branch strike committee was established at a meeting of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region trade union leaders to coordinate mass actions of the working people in defence of their rights. The first action taken by the committee, addressed to the Federal Assembly, the president and the government, is a demand to change the course of reforms in the interests of economic growth of the country and give a realistic figure of the minimum subsistence level of the population.
