The accord was reached during a meeting between Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, who is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his three-day visit to Japan from Thursday. The joint program will feature acceptance by Japanese companies of South Korean trainees and dispatch of technological experts from Japan to South Korea. This is regarded as an effort to nurture small-sized South Korean companies, particularly "supporting" industries such as components makers, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a news conference. Under the accord, to be endorsed at Saturday's meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Kim, Seoul will provide business incentives to South Korean parts makers through tax reforms and financial systems, the MITI briefer said. He said the program will be formulated so that it can be officially announced on May 26 when Kumagai and his South Korean counterpart meet again. During Thursday's meeting between Kumagai and Kim, Tokyo and Seoul also agreed to cooperate on standards and certificates of industrial products and in insurance fields, the MITI official said.
