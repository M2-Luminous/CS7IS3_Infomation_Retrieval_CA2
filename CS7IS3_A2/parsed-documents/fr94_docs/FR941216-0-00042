FR941216-0-00042 FR941216-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 940958&hyph;4329; I.D. 081894A] RIN 0648&hyph;AH29 Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues regulations to delay the opening of the first (roe) directed fishing season for the 1995 offshore component pollock fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) by delaying the opening of the trawl fishery, the only gear type used in the fishery, from January 20 to January 26. This action is necessary to increase the likelihood of harvesting pollock when roe quality is optimum and thus increase revenues from the BSAI pollock processed by the offshore component during the roe season. The regulations also prohibit vessels used to fish for BSAI or Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery does not apply to vessels used to fish exclusively in the Western Alaska Community Development Quota (CDQ) program prior to January 26 and is necessary to discourage participants in the offshore component pollock fishery from contributing to increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season. These actions are intended to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 12, 1995.
