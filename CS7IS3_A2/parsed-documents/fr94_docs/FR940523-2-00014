FR940523-2-00014 FR940523-2-00007 The fact that the Department's decision in Castings was remanded does not invalidate the fundamental approach outlined therein. In that case, the CIT found that the Department had not made clear until its final determination that the respondents had to demonstrate that they were not subject to governmental control to receive a separate rate. The CIT's decision merely requires that respondents be put on notice that they have the burden of demonstrating their independence if they wish to receive a separate rate. Respondents in this review were made aware of that burden, but were unable to establish that they were in fact entitled to any separate rate. Finally, the Department's decision to issue a Sparklers questionnaire to a respondent in the Shop Towels case does not require that it do so in this case. In Shop Towels, the Department had found the sole responding PRC firm, an import/export firm, to be independent of governmental control in a previous review and sought only to ascertain whether that determination remained valid. The record in this review establishes that Zunyi did not meet the Sparklers standard for independence. Moreover, as already noted, respondents in the present case were provided several opportunities to submit evidence demonstrating lack of governmental control. Under these circumstances, we have determined that issuing a Sparklers questionnaire in this review was not necessary. Comment 2 Separate Rates for PRC Producers: Zuny and Novachem state that the preliminary results do not fairly represent the information already submitted by Zunyi on the lack of state control and that Zunyi merits a separate rate. They assert that state ownership and state control are two different things. Additionally, Zunyi notes that its response included the following information which supported its claim that it functions autonomously. First, Zunyi is totally separate from the import-export corporations with which it deals; second, the import-export corporations sign a purchase contract with Zunyi according to a price agreed upon in a calculation made in U.S. dollars; third, Zunyi's selling prices are decided by the factory according to cost and market; fourth Zunyi implemented a contract system in 1987; and fifth, Zunyi is autonomous in terms of management and accounting, and assumes sole responsibility in paying taxes and for profits and losses. Based on these assertions, Zunyi and Novachem claim that they have submitted enough information to merit a separate rate for Zunyi, alleging that the Department did not ask for further information. Petitioner argues that the evidence on the record indicates that Zunyi is not qualified to receive a separate rate, and that the Department should make an adverse assumption on this issue due to Zunyi's failure to provide certain required evidence to support its claim of independence. DOC Position: We agree with petitioner. Based on the totality of information on the record, we have determined that Zunyi is subject to government control. First Zunyi is under the control of the Economic Commission of Zunyi City (the Commission), and the Commission gave ``guiding instructions'' as to the ``planning of production in terms of value and quantity.'' Second, as a ``Zhongguo Faren'', Zunyi was not allowed by Chinese law to engage in contractual relations with foreign entities, nor was it allowed to export directly. Instead, it was required to export through PRC import/export companies. This point was specifically mentioned in the Sparklers test as a factor weighing against a finding of independence. Furthermore, Zunyi did not provide copies of its financial statements despite our two requests for these, nor did it provide the detailed information we requested regarding its ownership. Without this critical evidence, the Department is unable to affirm that Zunyi is entitled to separate rate status, despite the assertions Zunyi makes in its case brief. With respect to Zunyi and Novachem's claim that the Department should have asked for any information that was lacking, the Department requested on more than one occasion critical information ( e.g., Zunyi's financial statements and specific information regarding ownership), and that information was not provided by Zunyi. In addition, as noted above, the information on the record is sufficient for the Department to determine that Zunyi did not possess the requisite independence to merit a separate rate. Comment 3 Market Oriented Industry: Zunyi and Novachem assert that Zunyi operated under market conditions during the period of review and that the Department should utilize local factor prices to determine foreign market value as outlined in the methodology announced in Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 175 (September 10, 1991). At the minimum, they argue, the Department should base fair market value on a surrogate economy other than Thailand.
