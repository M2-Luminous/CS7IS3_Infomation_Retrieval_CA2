But Britain wants the 62 hectares of land along the airport railway to be granted in one go, without going through the annual Sino-British Land Commission talks. In its latest financing package, which is still being studied by the Chinese side, Britain boosted the government injection to $60 billion, cutting the debts to be borne by the future Airport Corporation and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to $23 billion. But the Chinese side insists Britain abides by a stipulation in the Memorandum of Understanding that any debts above $5 billion must be agreed to by China. A source close to the British side said the Government was willing to increase the cash injection into the airport projects as they were a good investment. But Britain would stand firm on the view that the Chinese should approve granting the 62 hectares of land along the airport railway in one go, on top of the 50 hectares of land disposed of annually. "We must be ensured that this land is available to us without further strings attached," said the source. Regarding China's demand to set up a monitoring group to control costs of the airport projects, the source said the Government would not concede this point. Instead, it would rather allow the Director of Audit to audit the financial accounts of the future airport body, he said.
