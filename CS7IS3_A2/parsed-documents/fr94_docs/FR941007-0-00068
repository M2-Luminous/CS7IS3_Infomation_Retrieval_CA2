SUMMARY: The Director of Defense Procurement has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to require offerors and contractors to report commercial transactions they have conducted with the government of a terrorist country. DATES: Effective date: September 29, 1994. Comment date: Comments on the interim rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before December 6, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, Attn: Ms. Michele Peterson, PDUSD (A&T)DP(DAR), IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 843 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103&hyph;160) requires offerors and contractors under DoD solicitations and contracts exceeding $5,000,000 to report commercial transactions conducted with the Government of a terrorist country. This interim rule adds new language to DFARS Subpart 209.1, a new provision at 252.209&hyph;7003, and a new clause at 252.209&hyph;7004 to implement the requirements of Section 843 of Public Law 103&hyph;160. The rule also revises the provision at 252.209&hyph;7001 for consistency with the terminology used in the new provision and clause. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because the rule only applies to contracts exceeding $5,000,000. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected subparts will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D319 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. A request for approval of the information collection requirement has been sent to the Office of Management and Budget. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 209 and 252 Government procurement. Claudia L.
