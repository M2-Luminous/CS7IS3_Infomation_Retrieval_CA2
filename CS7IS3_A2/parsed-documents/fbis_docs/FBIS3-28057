Dr. Mahathir promised unbridled development and progress for the state if Sabahans reject Datuk Kitingan and his rebel Parti Bersatu Sabah [PBS] in the February 18 and 19 state polls. But he cautioned that the oil and timber-rich state would experience continued economic stagnation if it rejected the NF again. "If you make a wrong choice again, you will have no one to blame but yourselves," he told a crowd of several thousands in this small rural town, 160 km from the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Dr. Mahathir, who is campaigning against the PBS for the first time in a state election since 1985, made no bones about what he thought of Datuk Kitingan, a stocky bespectacled native Kadazan lawyer who is seeking a fourth term in office against the might of the NF. Datuk Kitingan and the PBS earned the NF's wrath when they deserted the federal ruling coalition on the eve of general election in 1990 to back an opposition alliance led by former Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. State-federal ties, never comfortable since the PBS came to power in 1985, had deteriorated since then with Dr. Mahathir laying the blame squarely on Datuk Kitingan. Yesterday, Dr. Mahathir said Datuk Kitingan's conviction on corruption charges on January 17 proved his point that "Pairin just wants to serve his own and his family's interests; not that of the people of Sabah". He said that it was "a shameful thing" for Sabah and Malaysia to have the state led by a chief minister who had been convicted of graft. Dr. Mahathir's address followed that of normally mild-mannered Sabah NF chief Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai who vowed to "crush the PBS for taking Sabah into economic decline". The attacks on the Sabah chief minister were a calculated risk by the NF to demolish the "Pairin magic" widely attributed for the PBS continued success in three state polls. Datuk Kitingan is revered by the mainly-Christian Kadazans who form the majority, in about 40 per cent of the 48 elecoral constituencies in the state and enjoys a wide following amongst the other races. By focusing on his conviction, the NF intends to shatter the Pairin myth and draw support to itself. But some analysts said such attacks ran the risk of drawing greater sympathy for Datuk Kitingan who was perceived by many of his supporters as a political victim when graft charges were levelled against him. Datuk Kitingan was fined [Malaysian dollar] $1,800, a sentence light enough to allow him to remain as chief minister and lead the PBS. Dr. Mahathir also touched on the unsound state-federal ties, saying that Kuala Lumpur had no reason to be unkind to Sabahans. Last week, Datuk Kitingan admitted that investments in Sabah had declined but blamed it on Kuala Lumpur's failure to maintain roads and provide adequate electric supply. Dr. Mahathir's attacks on Datuk Kitingan and the PBS, telecast live over state-owned Radio Television Malaysia, signal that the coming campaign will see state-federal relations further battered. Datuk Kitingan himself has taken a tougher stance in the last week attacking the federal government for not providing enough assistance to the state. Dr. Mahathir leaves for Kuala Lumpur later today.
