FR940202-2-00026 FR940202-2-00015 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;113&hyph;000, et al.] Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. [Docket No. RP94&hyph;113&hyph;000] January 13, 1994. Take notice that on January 10, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) filed a joint petition pursuant to section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.207, requesting an order approving a stipulation entered into on October 1, 1993. Petitioners state the stipulation provides for termination of all firm transportation and storage contracts between them, through permanent assignment of Tennessee capacity to Columbia's customers and through payment of an exit fee to Tennessee by Columbia for abandonment of unassigned capacity on Tennessee. Petitioners state that under the terms of the stipulation Columbia will assign all of its capacity rights under Contract No. T&hyph;2030 (15,637 Dth per day of storage withdrawal under Tennessee's SS&hyph;E rate schedule), and under Contract Nos. T&hyph;4613/T&hyph;4872 (10,425 Dth per day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT&hyph;B rate schedule). Columbia would also assign a portion of its rights under Contract No. T&hyph;3871 (263,998 Dth per day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT&hyph;A rate schedule). The petitioners further state Columbia will pay Tennessee a negotiated exit fee for termination of the unassigned portion of Columbia's capacity rights under Contract No. T&hyph;3871 and for termination of Contact Nos. T&hyph;3869/T&hyph;4870 (6,928 Dth per day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT&hyph;B rate schedule). They state the exit fee will be computed at the time the stipulation becomes effective, based on a formula that takes into account, among other things, the amount of unassigned capacity, estimates of Tennessee's rates over the term of the contracts, and the net present value of the nominal claim. Based on assumptions with a January 1, 1995 effective date, petitioners estimate an exit fee of $36.7 million. Petitioners request an order approving recovery of the exit fee in Columbia's rates through its TCRA (transportation costs rate adjustment) mechanism. They request authorization for Tennessee to retain a portion of the exit fee equal to the amount it would have collected from Columbia in demand charges for the unassigned capacity through July 1, 1995. Tennessee proposes to credit the remaining portion of the exit fee to its firm customers through its GSR cost recovery mechanism. Petitioners further request abandonment authorization under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for the following transportation and exchange services: Tennessee Rate Schedule T&hyph;133 Rate Schedule T&hyph;140 Rate Schedule T&hyph;147 Tennessee and Columbia Tennessee Rate Schedule X&hyph;58_Columbia Rate Schedule X&hyph;78 Tennessee Rate Schedule X&hyph;60_Columbia Rate Schedule X&hyph;90 Tennessee Rate Schedule X&hyph;66_Columbia Rate Schedule X&hyph;119 Comment date: February 1, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;178&hyph;000] January 14, 1994. Take notice that on January 12, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), P. O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1642, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;178&hyph;000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon by sale certain facilities in the Caillou Island area, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Texas Eastern proposes to abandon, by sale to The Offshore Group, a barge and appurtenant equipment located in the Caillou Island Field, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Texas Eastern states that it was authorized to construct certain facilities, including the barge, to connect natural gas supplies dedicated to it by Louisiana Land and Exploration Company (LL&E). LL&E owns compression facilities on the barge which are used to deliver natural gas to Texas Eastern. LL&E has made arrangements with Texaco, Inc. to provide compression service to deliver the natural gas to Texas Eastern. LL&E therefore no longer requires Texas Eastern's barge or the facilities on it. Comment date: February 4, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
