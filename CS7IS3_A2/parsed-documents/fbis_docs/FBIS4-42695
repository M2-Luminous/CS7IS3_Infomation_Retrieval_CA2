The study stage is now completed, the military weekly VOX reports in its latest edition. The contractual stage has now begun with an invitation to tender published a couple of weeks ago and addressed to shipyards able to build these vessels, a naval spokesman told BELGA. These four vessels will replace about 30 existing minesweepers of two types, built about 40 years ago: The MSO's [Minesweeper, Ocean], such as the Breydel type dispatched to the Persian Gulf in 1988 during the Iranian-Iraqi war and the MSE's built of wood. The Navy originally planned to buy 10 of these minesweepers, but this figure was reduced to four following the Army restructuring decided by the government in January 1993. VOX reports that the four new KMV's, like the existing tripartite minesweepers, will be fitted with a hull of composite materials (glass fibre and resin) which sharply reduces the emission of sound waves and the magnetic field in the water. These two characteristics are particularly important for a vessel required to operate in close proximity to mines detonated by sound waves or magnetic force. They will also be fitted with a totally new sweeping system, which will allow it to very precisely imitate the sound wave or magnetic force of a vessel targeted by the mines. The Navy reports that these new minesweepers can also be used for fishing control missions, combating sea pollution, and surveying the sea bed and objects lying on it. These new minesweepers will be weigh around 650 tons and will measure about 50 meters long and 10.5 meters wide. Their speed is estimated at 15 knots (about 27 km) per hour, VOX reports. Thanks to the advanced automation of equipment, the future minesweepers will need a crew of just 27. Existing minesweepers have a crew of 76. The purchase of these new coastal minesweepers is one of the principal elements in the national defense investment plan for the medium term as adopted in July 1993, to which 12.6 billion Belgian francs have been allocated. By the terms of the invitation to tender, the construction of these four new vessels will be the subject of a freely negotiated contract. A prototype will first be built and delivered before production of three "standard" vessels. The first minesweeper should be ready by 1998. The three others could be launched by the beginning of the next century. The Navy reports that this minesweeping program is now a purely national program, following the withdrawal of the Netherlands, which had helped fund the feasibility study. Portugal had observer status within the Belgo-Netherlands working party which drew up the specifications for these new vessels.
