Perger; place and date not given: "I Can Do It Better"] [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Minister-president, Lower Saxony was a good start for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] in this year of many elections. Are Gerhard Schroeder and his red-green coalition the only midwives of this victory or did you and a somewhat calmer SPD also play a part in it? [Scharping] First of all, it was a success for the SPD in Lower Saxony and for Gerhard Schroeder in particular. The fact that the SPD has become more stable at the federal level certainly did not do any harm. [DIE ZEIT] Gains were made by the Greens above all. Does that mean that the party is now a possible Bonn coalition partner for the SPD? [Scharping] To my mind, the central political signal at the federal level sent by the Lower Saxony Landtag elections is that the SPD has remained stable and it has increased its lead over the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] from 2 percent to almost 8 percent. [DIE ZEIT] An increase in your share of the vote of 0.1 percent, as the case in Lower Saxony, would not be of much benefit to you in the Bundestag elections. [Scharping] The key point is the significantly greater lead over the CDU. That means that we can also increase our lead over the CDU at the federal level. The general lesson to be drawn from the election result is that annoyance with the parties is declining. [DIE ZEIT] Following Hamburg and Lower Saxony, is the FDP [Free Democratic Party] still of interest to you as a coalition partner? [Scharping] The FDP is losing its function as a party that can secure a majority and thus, it can be assumed that it has become a matter of greater urgency than ever before for the party to explain what liberalism actually means to it today. Nevertheless, the SPD conducts debates about the main tasks in German politics and not about coalitions. The offers that the SPD receives will certainly exceed demand. [DIE ZEIT] What is striking about the SPD today is its exceptional openness. How did you manage that, Mr. Scharping? [Scharping] Political goals and ideas are being debated much more intensely in the party. I personally have made an effort to ensure that we talk to each other rather than past each other. In addition, the "party ballot" sent positive shock waves through the SPD. Many who had previously taken part in key public debates realized that the same way of acting was not very responsible within the SPD and from the viewpoint of its political goals, and, thank heavens, they acted accordingly. When Social Democrats switch on their television sets in the evenings, they no longer have to be ashamed of news reports about what is going on in the SPD. That has a significant impact on the electorate. Finally, the prospect of winning the 1994 Bundestag makes it easier to focus political attention on the most important programmatic points, and that is undoubtedly a further factor. [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps this openness will cease when the debate about a program for the government begins. That will call for many sacrifices, including sacrifices among your own voters. [Scharping] I think that political models geared solely toward redistribution and telling the other side what it must put up with are finished. We will place the justice angle very much at the forefront as well as the question of who has to make what contribution to the development of Germany, to its economic recovery, and to safeguarding Germany's welfare state and ecological principles. [DIE ZEIT] So, in concrete terms, who is to be given what, and what is to be taken away from whom? [Scharping] We are discussing the issue of how labor costs must be reduced and investment in new products and new jobs must be stepped up. That means that within the framework of the current taxes and dues burden, at the level that it will attain in 1995, which I believe should not be increased, there will have to be realignments. There has to be a reduction in the tax burden on middle and low incomes, if only because of the tax exemption -- provided for by the constitution -- of minimum incomes. In addition, for the development of Germany as a whole, burdens have to be distributed more fairly, which automatically makes a moderate increase in the taxation of particularly high incomes and wealth -- as in the United States -- necessary. The Federal Government wants to reintroduce the solidarity levy for this purpose. I think that a supplementary form of taxation would make more sense. If one wants to create more favorable conditions for investment, then one must simultaneously make raw materials and energy more expensive, which is also a key point for the ecological modernization of the economy. Environmental, information, and communications technologies, as well as rapid transportation systems -- for example cooperation with the French on the ICE and the TGV rail projects -- have a role to play. [DIE ZEIT] So, you would not provide backing for the Transrapid rail project? [Scharping] We will discuss that after Easter, without any reservations. The technology essentially merits such backing, but I do not think that the proposed route makes much sense. [DIE ZEIT] No increases in taxes and contributions, no increase in public debt: Those are the so-called "main planks" of your government program. Will you manage to keep to that? There is criticism in your party. Ultimately, one knows that if the state makes cuts, they tend to affect the poorest the most. [Scharping] First, as for taxation and contribution levels: In 1995, those will almost reach 50 percent and that will be a historically high level in Germany. It is a consequence of the Bonn coalition's orgy of tax hikes and a lack of discipline with regard to expenditure. If tax and other deductions account for between 48 and 49 percent of an average worker's wage that also affects the social acceptance of state activity, which is vital for civilized coexistence. It also affects acceptance of the social welfare system. If the signals that employees receive from politics are, for example, that they must pay higher pension benefit contributions -- they will rise by 1.7 percent to 19.2 percent in 1994 -- but their pensions will not be certain, which is what Herr Biedenkopf said recently.... [DIE ZEIT] And so did Mr. Lafontaine. [Scharping] .... that affects the acceptance of common security in a welfare state. Of course, many employees ask themselves why the difference between their gross and net incomes is so high. Here is a second example: The development of eastern Germany is to a large extent being financed from social insurance contributions. Why should employees who pay contributions and plants with high wage costs alone provide finance for the development of eastern Germany through pension funds and unemployment benefit funds? Would it not be more honest if it were to be done with the help of taxes so that everyone, including civil servants and the self-employed, made the same contribution? [DIE ZEIT] It might be more honest, but probably more difficult to implement? [Scharping] It is linked to the example that should be set by those who consider themselves to belong to elites and possess appropriate economic and financial resources. It is a question of justice and economic reason. Pushing up labor costs -- ancillary and supplementary costs -- to such high levels runs counter to economic reason. Plants with large work forces and payrolls bear a disproportionate burden as a result. It affects their competitiveness. [DIE ZEIT] In your government program, do you define what a higher income is? [Scharping] I do not consider that to be necessary. [DIE ZEIT] But it is something that many people would like to know? [Scharping] That may be so. However, the problem that we face is as follows: The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that as of 1996, the legislature is obliged to ensure that the minimum level of income is exempt from tax. This must be accomplished with the help of a reform of the wage and income taxation scales and improved benefits for families with children. Once those two things have been accomplished, the rest is only a question of what the actual wage and income taxation scales will be. [DIE ZEIT] And what does your government program say on that point? [Scharping] As of 1 January 1995, the coalition wants to reintroduce a solidarity levy of 7.5 percent without the reform that I have described. Instead of that, what we want is a supplementary contribution of 10 percent, a tax exempt minimum income, and better conditions for families. Whoever is paying 2,000 German marks [DM) in tax a month, can expect to pay DM2,200 over a certain period of time. [DIE ZEIT] Thus, medium-sized business will be asked to pay up, because there are not that many rich people who could be fleeced of even more. [Scharping] Reducing the taxation burden on investment and reducing the taxation burden on companies in so far as they invest and create new jobs is a priority. As for medium-sized business: In the case of the Law on Safeguarding Germany's Future as Center for Business, the SPD ensured that depreciation terms would not get worse. The SPD also participated in making the taxation of earnings from commercial activity lower. I consider that to be the right way. I think that one has to always make very precise distinctions. What promotes the creation of jobs? What strengthens a company's own capital base? What facilitates investment? All this is in the corporate taxation field, and one has to distinguish that clearly from private income. I am of the opinion that following the Federal Constitutional Court ruling on exempting the minimum income from taxation and in view of the financial needs linked to the development of Germany, we cannot mislead people into believing that there are no limits to how much their incomes can grow and that such growth has no tax implications. That would be untrue. In the case of the taxation of private entrepreneurial earnings, I share the views of many entrepreneurs, including the views of Herr Necker or Herr Murmann: The higher taxation of profits that are withdrawn would be reasonable. [DIE ZEIT] You do not want to say openly how much this is going to cost whom? [Scharping] Why not? [DIE ZEIT] You have not defined who the "better earners" that the SPD talks about so much are. [Scharping] The term means that one could set a limit above which everyone has to make some contribution to the development of Germany, the preservation of social justice, and economic progress. What I am saying is that everyone has a contribution to make in accordance with his means. There is a social imbalance in the way burdens are currently distributed. [DIE ZEIT] You once said that Germany needs more creativity, boldness, a pioneering spirit. What does that mean? [Scharping] First, what that means is that we need elites and their example. Helmut Schmidt is fond of citing the Hamburg constitution: Everyone has a moral obligation to contribute to the common good. [DIE ZEIT] The SPD has not used the world "elite" in a long time. [Scharping] What can one object to about the term elite if it means a high level of ability and embraces equal access to such elites, which is also why we talk about equality of opportunity. I also think that it is an extreme form of condensing things to just talk of Germany as a center for business. It leaves people's living conditions out of the picture. That is why in debate I always use word that has come from the Protestant Church and talk about Germany as a "center for living." That is because the situation of the 4 million unemployed, the many millions who have to live on social welfare, and the many who do not have a proper home, should not be left out of the picture. [DIE ZEIT] Technology has an important role in the issue of Germany as a center. However, is it not given enough too little attention in political discussion? [Scharping] We are too cautious and slow with new products, with new technical opportunities, the translation of technical progress and new findings in production. In Europe, all these things can be better dealt with jointly than if they were tackled by individual countries. What we need in Germany is a training, technology, and research offensive. [DIE ZEIT] Then the SPD will have to undergo some changes. [Scharping] Yes, on the reformist left-wing side, there is almost a boundless belief in technical progress. Ernst Bloch said that one could solve all the worlds poverty problems with one pile of atoms. Since then, the pendulum has very much swung in the opposite direction. I am in favor of staging a public debate with broad participation that would weigh up interests and ideas, then make decisions, and use the opportunities that are available. [DIE ZEIT] Will you set deadlines for abandoning nuclear energy as was the case in a previous SPD program? [Scharping] It is our firm goal to abandon nuclear energy. However, every deadline is subject to the problem that today one cannot tell when and in what form a consensus will be reached on the questions. I think that it makes sense to have a consensus on energy policy in Germany, because of the need to have a secure energy supply, reliable framework conditions, and the necessary security for the domestic coal industry. I do not know whether achieving such a consensus is possible, but we will carry on seeking it. That means that it does make sense to establish remaining periods of use for nuclear power plants on case by case basis if necessary. The general direction is: We want to get out of nuclear energy as quickly as possible, with an emphasis on this aspect as quickly as possible. [DIE ZEIT] At the Munich security conference, you recently stressed that there were no fundamental differences between you and the government on foreign policy. Would the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] not be able to say that the SPD is pursuing "politics without a beard?" [Scharping] A policy based on the intellect and the heart is any event better than one without a beard. I found that CDU poster amusing. As far as foreign policy is concerned, there is no disagreement over fundamental issues: European integration, a secure place in the community of Western democracies, including NATO, and a reliable relationship with the states to our east that is as friendly as possible. [DIE ZEIT] Do you support the timetable for economic and monetary union? [Scharping] The criteria are more important than the timeframe, which does not mean that one should postpone everything until some never-never day. However, a stable currency is an indispensable pillar of an economic policy for economic progress, growth that takes account of ecological factors, and for instilling confidence in people. [DIE ZEIT] It has almost been forgotten that there was a difficult discussion in the SPD on the role of the Bundeswehr. What does that program have to say about that? [Scharping] Today, there is virtually no disagreement within the SPD about the issue. It is, to a much greater extent, the only point on which we disagree with the government on a key foreign policy issue. I am very much in favor of Germany being active in the United Nations. The United Nations should be strengthened. We want to participate in the measures that the UN has implemented over the past few years and is expected to implement over the next few years if it is able to. It would exclude -- this is the precise boundary --active Bundeswehr participation in the waging of war. [DIE ZEIT] You know the words from the song about "the international winning human rights." What is your position on the far from infrequent cases where German export interests and the requirements of a consistent human rights policy clash, as in the case of China and Iran? [Scharping] It is necessary for negotiations about world trade and appropriate agreements -- GATT for example -- to devote much more attention to human rights, to protection against social dumping and environmental dumping. What should no longer occur is that in the same year, the United Nations can issue a charter on the rights of children while a world trade agreement makes no mentions whatsoever of the brutal exploitation of children. Global environmental and developments policies are an area in which I see a great need and great chances for intensive cooperation with the United States. [DIE ZEIT] But what happens in a specific case. During his visit to China, Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave prominence to human rights. Others who are competing with America in that market do not do that. That poses dilemmas for democratic governments. How would you resolve such a dilemma? [Scharping] One will never find perfect solutions. [DIE ZEIT] Does the SPD support the government's policy on China? [Scharping] To my mind, the consistent pursuit of human rights is too weak an element in relations with China. [DIE ZEIT] What do you think would jeopardize victory in the Bundestag elections the most? The overthrow of Yeltsin in Moscow or -- to use your words -- new "carryings-on" in the SPD? [Scharping] I think that the biggest risk is that far too many people will act on the quite natural assumption the the SPD will win the elections and lead the next government. There is still plenty of hard work to be done. Even with good election results and good ratings in opinion polls, we should not let up at any time, because there are almost exactly seven months to go until 16 October. [DIE ZEIT] Why do you actually want to become chancellor? [Scharping] Because I think that I can do the job and do it better than others.
