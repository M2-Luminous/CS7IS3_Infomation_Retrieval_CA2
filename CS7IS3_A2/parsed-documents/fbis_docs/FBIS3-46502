In a new year message, Mr. Rabuka said Ratu Sir Penaina had always emphasized that Fiji's multiracial population needed to live in peace and harmony. The body of Ratu Sir Penaina, who died of cancer in the United Sates hospital on 16 December, was taken back for burial to his home island of Taveuni yesterday after lying in state at government house in Suva. Under Fiji's racially-biased 1990 constitution brought in by Mr. Rabuka's government, indigenous Fijians are guaranteed 37 of the 70 seats at parliament. Mr. Rabuka faces an election next month after parliament failed to pass his government budget in November.
