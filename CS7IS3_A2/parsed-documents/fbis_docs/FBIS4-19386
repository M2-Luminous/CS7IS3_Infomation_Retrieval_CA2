Is it not very tempting to pull them out? [Lamassoure] No one should lay a finger on French soldiers, no one should lay a finger on the UN peacekeepers, and no one should lay a finger on French soldiers. Since yesterday we have observed that some of them have apparently been surrounded, indeed threatened, by Serbian forces. We will not accept this; the United Nations does not accept this, and has made a statement which was read out a short while ago on your newscast. France is at pains to recall that it absolutely insists that the UN resolutions be accepted and that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] should have the means necessary to fulfill its mission. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, the crux of the problem, which is the war between the Bosnians and the Serbs, remains. [Ardisson] If I understand you correctly, this is a diplomatic error on the part of the Americans. [Lamassoure] No, it is not a diplomatic error. The two agreements [between Croats and Muslims, and between Serbs and Croats] constitute progress, but at the point we have reached at present we now have to...[pauses] It is time for all the parties to the conflict and all the international diplomatic partners --in other words, the European Union, the United States, and Russia -- to sit down around a table to achieve an overall political settlement. Thus, in view of this worsening of the crisis which we have been witnessing for several days now, we now have to wield both the stick and the carrot: the stick, which is that no one must lay a finger on UN soldiers, and the carrot, which is that from the point at which everyone agrees to return to the negotiating table and discuss the political future of Bosnia -- because after all this is how it must end -- we will then be able to see what the international community can do to help with the reconstruction of Bosnia. An operation is already being established in Sarajevo, and will be established shortly in Mostar. We must also take into account the efforts made by the Serbs to implement the resolutions of the international community. [Ardisson] You talk about wielding the stick, but what stick is that? Apparently the UNPROFOR soldiers are powerless, because they are being abducted, detained, as if they had no means of defense, whereas they have the right to retaliate when their security is threatened. [Lamassoure] They have the right, and NATO has the means to do this. It has already done so twice, and if necessary it will do it again. At the same time we should be confident that all of this can end in no way other than a political agreement. [passage omitted] [Ardisson] You are saying that the Serbs will not push the French soldiers into committing a misdemeanor, in other words into war? [Lamassoure] It is not in anyone's interest and in particular it is not in the Serbs' interest for there to be a worsening of the military escalation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]
