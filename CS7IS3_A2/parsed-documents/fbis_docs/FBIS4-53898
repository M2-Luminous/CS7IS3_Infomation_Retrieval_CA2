According to Minister Le Xuan Trinh, the socioeconomic situation in our country has since early this year continued to be stable and developed. Along with the stability and development momentum generated since 1993, generally, in this year's winter-spring crop, almost all localities in the entire country -- except for a number of central provinces where there were difficulties arising from crop failure -- attained or exceeded their targets in both area and yield. It is estimated that the grain ouput in the first half of the year may reach more than 11 million tons, increasing by 1 million ton over the same period last year. Industrially, it is estimated that the gross production value in the first six months will attain 48 percent of the annual target, representing a 11-percent increase over the same period last year with local industrial ouput value increasing by 10 percent. A number of essential products such as electricity, coal, crude oil, steel, cement, electric motors, and the like have showed an increase with certain items increasing by nearly 20 percent. A number of key construction projects have been deployed such as those designed to improve and upgrade a number of segments of National Highway 1-A, to start construction of a project to channel gas onto the shoreline from the sea, and so forth. Apart from the results obtained, over the past months, many difficulties and weaknesses in the implementation of the socioeconomic plan have, however, not been overcome, and the difficulties arising from budget inbalance are still particularly serious. Various sources of revenue obtained have not been able to offset requirements for spending in development. A number of key construction projects of the state that have been deployed in the past years continue to have difficulties in capital. The speed at which a number of projects have been being built is still slow. Minister Le Xuan Trinh presented various guiding and operating measures of the government for the period ahead aimed at overcoming the aforementioned difficulities to ensure that the economic growth rate for this year will attain the target set by the National Assembly in its previous session. At the news conference, Minister Le Xuan Trinh quoted the prime minister as hailing the contributions of the press to the government in its efforts to guide and run various programs of action in the past and expressing the hope that the mass news media will continue to support the government's activities in the period ahead. The mass news media must strive harder to disseminate information on the deployment and implementation of Government Resolution #38-CP, which calls for further renovating various newly promulgated administrative procedures in resolving works related to citizens and organizations.
