A few hundred pilots who are capable of meeting the challenge of air combat, who understand foreign languages, and who know how to operate computers are gradually becoming the Air Force's backbone force for striding from this to the next century. According to a briefing by an Air Force department, the development of modern aviation technology and the improvement in the performance of weapons and equipment demand that pilots be very capable. For this reason, the people's Air Force added mathematics in pilot colleges. In addition, it organized English classes for pilots in 1983 and later added computer science and high-technology subjects, and all pilots are required to attend these classes on a rotational basis. At present, a few hundred pilots are able to understand, speak, read, write, and translate English; they have also mastered computer principles, computer programming, and computer operation and utilization. Through self-study, a number of pilots have mastered Russian and other languages, and a marked change in their level of knowledge has taken place. Their advantages are clearly demonstrated in their flight training and contacts with foreign countries. According to a briefing, these pilots are more able to adapt to and accept new ways of flight training, and they especially do better in test-flying new-model aircraft and undergoing difficult training programs. Some pilots have even raised their training efficiency by 100 percent. In carrying out their flying mission to protect foreign guests, their outstanding performance has won many praises from foreign pilots and experts. An Air Force source said the increase in the number of capable pilots has great significance for raising the combat capability of the Air Force and for expanding contacts with foreign countries.
