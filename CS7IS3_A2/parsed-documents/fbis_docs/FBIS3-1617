But in some localities the "real text" of a socialist market economy has been distorted, and there are frequent phenomena of various powers entering the market. For example, some local government departments change themselves into companies, corporations, or enterprise groups, while their original staff and functions remain unchanged. They then take over the rights and interests from their subordinate enterprises. Some departments, which posses power in certain areas, claim that they are "going to the sea" and "running entities," but what they are actually doing is monopolizing and doing business through power. The exchange of power for money has spread to notes of approval, documents of approval, loans, taxation, examination of goods, and buying and selling of land, and some persons used money to buy power, then used the power to make money, and in this way they quickly earned tens-of-thousands of yuan, hundreds-of-thousands of yuan, or even millions of yuan. Some localities abused power in setting up barriers to block others who wanted to do business, or stop the sales of local products to other markets. Power's invasion of the market has brought about a series of negative effects: 1. It contradicts the law of market competition, and hinders fair competition in the market. Competition is the basic feature and demand of the market economy, but competition must be conducted under equal status, law, tax burden, loan, and interest rate. No unfair competition is allowed by the market economy. The entering of power into the market will cause a kind of unfair competition, because some people, with their power, may obtain special consideration, light tax burdens, good loans, and high profits. Therefore, when power enters the market as a commodity, it will lose its fairness, as well as its qualification for and ability of guiding, cultivating, and managing the market. 2. It destroys the balance in economic structure, and disrupts the order of economic operation. In any country, economic development should rest on structural balance which is on an orderly basis. When power enters the market, it will interfere in the regulation of economic operation by the law of value, the law of competition, and the law of supply and demand. It will hinder the implementation of the principle of a legal system, the principle of distribution, and the principle of taxation system, and it will affect the arrangement of resources and lead to chaos in the market. 3. It weakens the functions of laws, rules, and regulations. The market economy has a legal system as a precondition; the main body of economy participating in the market should be managed and supervised by legal system, and the operational order of market economy should be standardized and maintained by legal system, while the state's macroregulation and control of the market should also be recognized and guaranteed by the legal system. Once power enters the market, and especially when the power of law enforcement organs enters the market to the extent that those who know the law and enforce the law break the law, then the state's laws and regulations will be relentlessly trampled upon to the extent that they lose the authoritativeness they should have, and consequently market economy cannot operate normally. 4. It undermines the building of party work style and clean-government building, and causes the emergence and spreading of corruption. Power is nothing more than a duty of serving the public entrusted to someone by the state and people. Once it enters the market, it will become the tool for pursuing private interests of individuals and groups, leading to the corrupt phenomena of bribery, corruption, abuse of power, exchange of power and money, the running of businesses with power, and assisting business with power. 5. It distorts government behavior and misguides the process of government organ reform. When power enters the market, it will not play the function of promoting government organ reform, but will play the function of degenerating the process. For example, when "renamed companies" enter the market as power, they do so not to streamline organs which should be separated from the government, they enable these organs to be preserved lawfully in the name of "enterprise," "company," and "group." This not only distorts government behavior, but also guides government organ reform in an erroneous way. In order to ensure a healthy development of socialist market economy, we must take forceful measures to stop power from being changed into a commodity for entering the market. First, deepen the reform of government organs, and practice "self stripping" of quite a large portion of power from government departments. Under the old system of planned economy, which was characterized by a high degree of centralization, government departments relied on administrative orders and mandatory plans to manage the economy through allocating funds, materials, and projects. The government not only took charge of macroeconomic matters, but also took charge of microeconomic matters. It not only carried out indirect management, but also carried out direct management, and it did not give enterprises decisionmaking power, but viewed enterprises simply as subsidiary organs. This did not meet the demand of the market economy. From now on in government organ reform, we should practice "self stripping" of certain power from government departments and, according to the demands of the socialist market economy, change from direct management to indirect management, change from micromanagement to macromanagement, and change from allocating funds, materials, and projects to using economic levers and engaging in planning, coordination, supervision, and service, so that we can resolutely give the power and right which originally belonged to enterprises back to enterprises. Second, strengthen legislation and law enforcement, and give appropriate restraint to power. Why has power's invasion of the market become so rampant? It involves the question of restraining power which invades the market. To give restraint, there has to be just legislation and strict law enforcement. For example, enterprise law, company law, competition law, securities law, transaction law, taxation law, planning law, auditing law, budget law, banking law, investment law, foreign trade law, law governing foreign-funded enterprises, individual economy law, private economy law, joint-venture economy law, law on management of state assets, law on protecting the rights and interests of consumers, law against undue competition, and so on, are the laws which we should have. However, we still lack many such laws, and although some laws have been formulated, they are not perfect, to the extent that in some localities and domains, power has invaded the market and disrupted the order of economy, but nothing can be done according to law. In addition, our law enforcement is not strict enough, and there have been frequent phenomena of replacing law with power, replacing law with words, and giving light treatment to serious infringements. Inadequate legislation and slackened law enforcement means loopholes for power to invade the market. A new order of socialist market economy can really be established when there is no loophole. Third, change the planned economy system to the market economy system as soon as possible, and solve problems by the change of system. Analyzed from the viewpoint of theory, we may say that under a completely centralized planned management system, there cannot be any bureaucrat-businessmen, because under such conditions there can only be bureaucrats, no businessmen. In a healthy and perfect market economy system, bureaucrat-businessmen also do not exist, because when they pursue private benefits they will at the same time infringe upon the property rights of certain persons and violate certain laws. Bureaucrat-businessmen are the outcome of a kind of semiplanned, semimarket, semi-open, and semirestricted economy. They have emerged under the "double-track system" and through "fishing in the troubled waters." Therefore, to eliminate bureaucrat-businessmen, we cannot rely only on administrative orders, meetings, documents, and even rectification campaigns. The problem can only be solved by realizing a thorough transformation from the planned economy system to the market economy system as fast as possible. Fourth, wipe out money fetishism and power fetishism, and eliminate the subconsciousness of power invading the market. The most direct reason power has so enthusiastically entered the market comes from the tremendous magic power produced by the exchange of power and money, whereas the catalyst and subconsciousness produced by this kind of magic power are money fetishism and power fetishism. At present, money worship and power worship among some people cannot get worse. "When you have money you can order a ghost to push the millstone, when you have money you can order a ghost to sing a song," and this has already become the basic sense and "golden rule" among some people. Therefore, to prevent power from invading the market, we must resolutely do two kinds of work simultaneously and, as we vigorously carry out reform and opening up, promote socialist spiritual civilization construction. We must eliminate the influence of money fetishism and power fetishism, establish the correct outlook on power and money, and build a mental Great Wall preventing power from invading the market.
