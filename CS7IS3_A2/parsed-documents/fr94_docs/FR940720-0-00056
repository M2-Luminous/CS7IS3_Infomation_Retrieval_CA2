FR940720-0-00056 FR940720-0-00005 a. Section 86.159(a). Pennsylvania proposes in paragraph (a) that the regulatory authority may accept a self-bond to cover all or part of the permittee's liabilities arising from coal mining activities. The State also proposes that an applicant which is a subsidiary may satisfy the requirements for eligibility to self-bond by relying on its parent corporation. The corresponding Federal requirements are similar with the exception of conditions added by the State to address mining activities that may not be self-bonded such as long-term facilities, acid mine drainage, and restoration of prime farmland. The Federal self-bonding rules do not limit self-bond coverage to certain mining activities. Pennsylvania stated in its May 12, 1990, Pennsylvania Bulletin that it was difficult to determine an applicant's financial eligibility to self-bond certain types of liabilities. The acceptance of a self-bond by a state regulatory authority is discretionary and the Director finds it is within the State's discretion to exclude certain liabilities from coverage by a self-bond. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 773.15 prohibits a regulatory authority from issuing a permit if the permit applicant is, among other things, in violation of SMCRA or state and federal laws pertaining to air or water environmental protection. Pennsylvania's requirement that the applicant must have a positive compliance history with federal and state laws is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations. There is also no Federal counterpart that applicants must pledge collateral (see Finding 1.c.) and provide required security agreements in order for the State to allow an applicant to self-bond. However, the Director finds that these requirements are not inconsistent with the self-bonding regulations at 30 CFR 800.23. b. Section 86.159 (b) (5), (6), and (c)(4). These sections, which have no Federal counterparts, are discussed at the Director's Finding 1.c. c. Sections 86.159 (b) (1), (2), (c) (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) and (f). Pennsylvania is proposing that, to be acceptable, the applicant or its parent corporation must (1) be authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, (2) designate a suitable agent to receive service of process, (3) have a history of continuous business operation, (4) meet certain financial criteria, and (5) submit financial statements of its most recent three fiscal years and any completed quarters in the current fiscal year. The State's proposed amendment at subsection (b)(1) establishes the requirement that the applicant must be incorporated in or authorized to do business in Pennsylvania. There is no counterpart Federal regulation. However, the Director finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. The State is proposing at subsection (b)(2) that the applicant designate suitable agents in Pennsylvania to receive service of suits, claims, demands and other services of process. Since this provision is substantively identical to paragraph (b)(1) of 30 CFR 800.23 of the corresponding Federal rule, the Director finds that it is no less effective than the Federal rule. The State proposes at subsection (b)(3) that the applicant's history of continuous business operation is met if the applicant's existence is the result of a reorganization, consolidation or merger involving a company with a history of continuous business operation or the applicant is a majority-owned subsidiary of a corporation with a history of continuous business operation. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b) allow an applicant to qualify for a self-bond even if it did not meet the 5 years of continuous business operation, so long as its parent corporation did meet the 5-year requirement. Pennsylvania's approach, of allowing an applicant to rely on its parent's time of operation, is consistent with 30 CFR 800.23(b). For a complete discussion of the term ``continuous business operation,'' see the Director's Finding at 1.c. Pennsylvania's proposed subsection (c) and the Federal regulations for financial statements are similar; however, the State's proposed rule at subsection (c) requires 3 years of audited financial statements and the Federal regulations require 1 year. Both require the submittal of unaudited quarters for the current year. Both require that the audited financial statements must be accompanied by a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) that contains the accountant's audit or review opinion of the financial statements with no adverse opinion. In addition, the State's proposed rule requires that forfeiture of the aggregate of Pennsylvania self-bonds would not affect its ability to stay in business or endanger cash flow needed for its current obligations. There are no counterpart Federal regulations for these proposed requirements; however, they have the effect of strengthening the proposed self-bonding program and are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director, therefore, finds that the proposed rule at subsection (c) is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (f) that the applicant for self-bonding meet one of the three following financial criteria: (1) A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of either: AAA, AA or A as issued by Standard and Poor's Corporation; or Aaa, Aa or A as issued by Moody's Investor Services; (2) A tangible net worth of at least 10 million, a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times or less, and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater; or (3) Fixed assets in the United States of at least 20 million and a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times or less and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater.
