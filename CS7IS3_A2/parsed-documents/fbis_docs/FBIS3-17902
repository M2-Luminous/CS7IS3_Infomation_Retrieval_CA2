The decision was prompted by a letter to the chamber from the coordinating council of the "Democratic Russia" movement, citing numerous instances of violation of the Constitution and flouting of citizens' electoral rights in the course of the preparation and holding of the present elections in Russia's regions. The opinion of the members of the chamber's council was unanimous: This "election sickness" can only be cured on the basis of a reliable legal foundation, which does not at present exist.
