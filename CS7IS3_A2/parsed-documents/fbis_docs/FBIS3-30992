The signatories gave a briefing on their initiative to members and deputies of the ruling movement at today's session of the HZDS deputies' club in Casta Papiernicka. We quote: Being aware of the fact that a confrontational policy does not guarantee Slovakia's further positive development and that it is necessary to concentrate the efforts and responsibilities of political forces toward overcoming problems Slovakia has been struggling against, taking into account the inevitability of a political reconciliation in the period preceeding early elections, we propose: 1. To form a government with the participation of the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic Movement, the Slovak National Party, and the Alliance of Democrats--without personal participation of the chairmen of those parties and movements. 2. To invite experts without party affiliation to join the government. We consider it inevitable to return to the movement's original democratic principles and to fulfill its liberal social program. With the aim of following these aims, we have created the Alternative of Political Realism within the HZDS.
