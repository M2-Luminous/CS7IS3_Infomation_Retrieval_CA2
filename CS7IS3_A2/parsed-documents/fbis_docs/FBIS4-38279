CONTENTS: 1. Lawyers Escalate Anti-Government Protests 2. Prominent Journalist Urges Better Relations with Iran 3. Document Shows West Scheming To Reduce Muslim Population 4. Writers View Islamists' Ability To Govern 5. Omani Authorities Arrest Islamists 6. Washington Drafts Plans Against Algeria's Islamists 7. Turkish Islamic Party Said Winning More Support LAWYERS ESCALATE ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS An 800-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages 1 and 7 deals with the development of the crisis between the Lawyers Association [LA] and the government. The report says 'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the chief of the LA Cairo branch, who has been staging a hunger strike to support demands for the release of the detained lawyers and the holding of an inquiry into the death of Islamist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody, has been taken to the hospital after a serious deterioration in his health. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights reportedly issued a "press release" calling on the Egyptian Government to meet Muhammad's lawful demands to save his life. The report says that scores of lawyers began a sit-in in the LA headquarters in solidarity with Muhammad, and that some of them joined in the hunger strike. --A related unattributed 150-word report on pages 1 and 7 says the LA branch in Ismailia decided to hold a general congress Thursday, 30 June, as part of the lawyers' activities against the detention of their colleagues and the government's failure to "bring the officers responsible for the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to trial." --An 80-word boxed announcement extending over two long columns on page 1 and signed by LA Doyen Ahmad al-Khawajah and LA Secretary General Ahmad Sayf al-Islam says that the LA Council decided at a 19 June meeting that: 1. Lawyers shall not attend two prosecution sessions on 28 and 29 June to renew the detention order of the lawyers. 2. Lawyers shall stage a general strike on 28 and 29 June "to protest the continuing aggression against lawyers and the legal profession." The announcement says disciplinary measures will be taken against violators of the two decisions. PROMINENT JOURNALIST URGES BETTER RELATIONS WITH IRAN A 600-word front page report by Ashraf Khalil cites well-known Egyptian journalist Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal as calling for improving relations with Iran and healing the rift between the two major regional powers. Haykal reportedly told a Cairo seminar on Iranian-Arab relations that the Egyptian leadership is largely to blame for the bad relations between Cairo and Tehran. He said no one has produced a bit of evidence that Iran supports terrorist acts in Egypt. "I believe that direct action in Egypt is against Iran's interests, and I believe that the Islamists in Egypt -- and they are Sunnis -- are far from being influenced by the [Shiite] Iranian authorities," Haykal is quoted as saying. DOCUMENT SHOWS WEST SCHEMING TO REDUCE MUSLIM POPULATION An approximately 2,500-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad on page 3 discusses "a serious document" obtained by the paper on U.S. and Western schemes to reduce population growth in the Islamic world and thus weaken the Islamic nation. The document, headlined "International Campaign to Destroy Islam," reportedly "reveals new aggression by the U.S. AID against the Muslim countries." It recounts the U.S. agency's birth-control efforts and programs in countries like Nigeria, Niger, Egypt, and Jordan. It says the agency depends on local religious leaders, secular women activists, and the private Future Group of the United States to implement these programs. The document says the plans to reduce the population of the Muslim world, which are given appealing names like "birth control" and "time intervals between births," are facing major difficulties thanks to Islamic opposition, which has largely managed to convince Muslims that birth control is a sin. The document, whose source is not given, discusses the strategy of the United States and the NATO alliance to deal with the population growth in the Islamic countries. It reportedly says that "the rising population growth rate in the Islamic world, at a time when the Western countries and the United States are recording low population growth rates, will necessarily lead to a war against the Muslims--a war in which NATO will use its influence, power, and intelligence resources to contain the growing threat of Islam." The document says all indications are that the Islamic countries will grow more powerful in the future and the international balance of power will change in the next 20 years as a result of the growing population rates. Therefore, "the United States and NATO should do their utmost to curb the population growth in the Islamic world and control its natural resources," the document concludes. WRITERS VIEW ISLAMISTS' ABILITY TO GOVERN AL-SHA'B carries on page 9 an approximately 2,000-word article by Egyptian writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal and a 1,500-word "comment" on the article, signed with the initials M.A.H., presumably the newspaper's Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn. Haykal's article, which mainly discusses the Islamic experience in Algeria and its repercussions on the Muslim world, first appeared in the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN "some time ago" according to the introduction. In his article, Haykal criticizes the Algerian Government and Army for obstructing the Islamists' attempt to reach power through democratic elections. He notes that the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria, like the other political Islam movements in the Muslim world, lack specific programs and plans that can help them to effectively solve the problems of the people once they reach power. The Islamic movements, Haykal adds, lack in the leading cadres to implement their political ideas. Haykal also notes traditional U.S and Arab Gulf support for the Islamic movements against secular nationalist forces. In his commentary, Husayn says that in the absence of real democracy, where the road to government is open to any political force, the opposition can only have general plans and ideas, not specific programs and detailed institutions. He maintains that the Islamic movement, in its general inclinations and broad vision, offers a clearer and more defined program than that offered in the past by the pan-Arab, leftist, and liberal forces when they were in the center of opposition. He notes that all political groups come to power with general principles and inclinations that may be amended and adjusted as practical experience dictates. He says: "It is true that the Islamic creed does not commit Muslim to certain constitutional establishments, an economic theory, or a foreign policy, but it offers terms of reference to all these -- that is, general constitutional principles. Islam has general principles governing relations between the ruler and the ruled, and general rules and principles governing economic life." He also notes general principles that define the relations between the Islamic state and the foreign world. Concerning the lack of Islamic leading cadres, Husayn says that even if this is true, it does not mean a Muslim government will fail. The scarcity of leaders, he argues, is a traditional problem that has faced every new movement seeking radical change in society, but there are short-term and long-term solutions. Regarding the role of the United States and the traditional Arab governments in the Islamic revival, Husayn says those parties tried to use the Islamic movements in the past, when the pan-Arab movement was the source of revolutionary anger. "Now however, the revolutionary awakening comes from the Islamic movements themselves, and this is problem number one for U.S. policy." Husayn concludes that "the Islamic awakening is a return to the nation's identity," not a reaction to frustration or a response to foreign support. OMANI AUTHORITIES ARREST ISLAMISTS An "exclusive" unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says that the Omani authorities, in an unprecedented move, have arrested 70 Islamists of Omani, Sudanese, and Jordanian nationalities and closed a number of Islamic libraries in that country. Among the detainees, the report says, is Muhammad Bin-Ahmad al-Ghazali, undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery; his two brothers; a judge; and an Air Force officer. Sudanese and Jordanian university professors were also arrested, according to the report. WASHINGTON PREPARES PLANS AGAINST ALGERIA'S ISLAMISTS An unattributed 150-word report on page 7 claims that the United States "has prepared a new security plan to confront the Islamists in Algeria." The report cites information that the recent meeting between the Algerian foreign minister and U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake dealt with "new American ideas to combat the Islamic phenomenon in Algeria." According to the information, the United States is asking that the U.S. intelligence agencies and the National Security Council be given a major role in security planning for Algeria. The United States reportedly expressed readiness to support the Algerian Government forces, but wanted the Army to get rid of the elements that support religious activity. TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY SAID WINNING MORE SUPPORT In an approximately 3,500-word report from Istanbul, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses from an Islamic perspective the Turkish developments and challenges, such as the Kurdish problem and the economic crisis. He concludes that "Turkey is at a decisive crossroads. Its secular option and its link with the Western European camp have reached, or almost reached, a dead end." He says the government can no longer tackle the major challenges of territorial unity, economic crisis, and the lost dignity. All this, he contends, is increasingly helping the Islamic Welfare Party, which may win twice as many seats in the 1996 elections as it won in this year's election.
