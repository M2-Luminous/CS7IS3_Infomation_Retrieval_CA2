The distinguishing feature of Russia's foreign trade in 1993 has been the rise in exports (despite the economic recession) accompanied by a drastic reduction of imports. Russia's foreign trade turnover from January-October 1993 accounted for a total of 46.9 billion dollars (exports--31.4, imports--15.5 billion dollars). The industrially developed countries accounted for 40% of exports (18.8 billion dollars), developing countries--for 9.4% (4.4 billion dollars), and the share of ex-CMEA countries--17.5% (8.2 billion dollars). However the favourable quantitative result provides no grounds for positive assessments of foreign trade or its influence on the country's economy.

Oil exports in 10 months grew by 28%, oil products--40%, and timber--39%. Exports of pig iron grew by 20%, aluminium--35%, and ammonia--29%. To preserve the present export growth rates in terms of value, it is necessary to increase its volume in natural terms at higher rates, since the average export prices are substantially reduced. But considering the grave situation in Russia's fuel and energy sector, serious difficulties in ensuring its domestic requirements, the conclusion can be drawn on the increasing instability of the country's export base. To keep imports at a low level means to entail a considerable reduction of purchases, above all, of food. The marked curtailment of the purchases of machines and equipment (by 5.2%) leads to a lessening influence on the development of domestic production and becomes ineffective for the country. Besides, foreign economic activity is characterized by the intensive development of barter, which spells serious losses of hard currency for the country. Yet another negative tendency is the rupture of ties with many partners which held a leading place in Russia's foreign trade, above all, with former CMEA member-countries. And the drive to increase at all costs the volume of exports to foreign countries negatively affects supplies to the ex-Soviet republics--Russia is losing very important markets. The factors that have shaped in Russia's foreign trade in 1993 will, most probably, aggravate the situation still more in the future. It can be predicted with confidence that foreign trade turnover will fall. It is quite possible that already in the first quarter of 1994, because of the need to increase the supplies of fuel and energy resources for domestic needs, exports will fall.
