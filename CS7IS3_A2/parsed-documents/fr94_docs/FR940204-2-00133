The Trust Class will be sold primarily to financial institutions in their capacity as fiduciaries for certain accounts, such as living trusts, irrevocable trusts, foundations, endowments, retirement plans, and agency or custodial accounts. The financial institutions provide services for the beneficial owners of Trust Class shares, such as determining the appropriateness of investments, working with attorneys or accountants under the terms of a fiduciary relationship, providing tax information, preparing and sending account statements, responding to inquiries, forwarding shareholder communications, and establishing and maintaining account records. Trust Class shares will not be subject to 12b&hyph;1 Plans or Services Plans. 8. The services provided under the Plans will not duplicate the services provided to the Funds by the Adviser or the Distributor. Applicants will comply with the recent amendments to Article III, Section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the ``NASD'') regarding asset-based sales charges and service fees. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992). 9. The Funds may in the future create one or more classes of shares that would bear higher ongoing distribution charges and/or services fees (``Class B shares'') and that would automatically convert into shares of another class that bears lower ongoing distribution charges and/or services fees (``Class A shares'') up to six year after the purchase of Class B shares. Shares purchased though the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares also would be Class B shares. For purposes of conversion to Class A shares, Class B shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends and other distributions will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any class B shares not purchased through reinvestment of dividends or other distributions convert to Class A shares, a pro rata portion of the Class B shares held in the sub-account will convert into Class A shares. The pro rata protion will be equal to the percentage of the shareholder's Class B shares not purchased through reinvestment of dividends or other distributions that are converting into Class A shares relative to the shareholder's total Class B shares not purchased through reinvestment of dividends or other distributions. 10. The conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares would be subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling to the effect that the conversion of Class B shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. The conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is not available. In that event, no further conversions would occur and Class B shares might be subject to a higher level of ongoing distribution charges and/or service fees for an indefinite period. 11. Shareholders generally will be limited to exchanging shares only for shares of the same or a similar class of shares of another portfolio within the same group of investment companies, as such term is defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. The exchange policies of the Funds would, in all events, comply with rule 11a&hyph;3. 12. In addition to expenses incurred under a 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Services Plan, each class of shares will bear certain expenses specifically attributable to the particular class as set forth in Condition 1 below (``Class Expenses''). The determination of which Class Expenses will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be determined by a Fund's directors in the manner described in Condition 3 below. 13. Each portfolio of a Fund will be charged with the direct liabilities of that portfolio and with a portion of the general liabilities of the Fund in the same proportion that the assets of the portfolio bear to the assets of the Fund. In addition, all outstanding shares representing interests in the same portfolio will bear the portfolio expenses, which would first be allocated pro rata to each class on the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective class, and then further allocated on a per share basis within the class, except that each class will bear the Class Expenses applicable to such class.
