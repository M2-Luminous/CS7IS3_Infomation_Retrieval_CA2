It was also announced that Fogade will take control of all subsidized banks failing to meet this requirement. The meeting marked the end of the financial assistance agreement with the banks, and now the goal is for the banks to begin operating on their own and to start repaying the funds provided by Fogade. Here are statements by Fogade President Noris Aguirre: [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress] ...Fogade has simply waived conditional ownership. We should remember that in no way have we forfeited the rest of the shares placed under our control as creditors as a result of the financial assistance we provided. It is only [words indistinct] currently in effect in those banks that can replace all of the capital due by 1630 on 15 June. If by that time the stockholders have not guaranteed this capital, Fogade will be entitled to seize operational control. Nevertheless, as of today, the management of these banking institutions remains under the control of the Venezuelan state -- a move intended to ensure the openness of the entire process and the beginning of a new climate of trust. To me personally, it is a pleasure to announce that I have just received the requirements [words indistinct] and many of the banks' clearing houses have responded favorably. [end recording] Meanwhile, Banco Metropolitano and Banco Barinas have scheduled stockholders meetings for Tuesday.
