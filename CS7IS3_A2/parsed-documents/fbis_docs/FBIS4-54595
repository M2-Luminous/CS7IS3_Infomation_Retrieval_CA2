The government is to inform the parliament about every exercise in advance and parliament is to give its prior approval each case foreign troops are to stay in this country. A maximum 700 Czech troops may take part in the exercises abroad lasting up to 30 days, and up to 5,000 foreign troops may take part in exercises in the Czech Republic lasting up to 21 days, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said. The proposal limits the foreign countries (as venues for exercises and participants in exercises held on the Czech territory) to those that the Czech Republic wants to integrate into, those participating in the Partnership for Peace project, and European neutral countries. Joint exercises will involve Czech units, staffs, and commanding officers in the training of humanitarian, search and rescue, and peace operations, and allow Czech Air Force and ground-based anti-aircraft units to receive training of a kind unavailable in the Czech Republic but necessary to maintain their combat readiness.
