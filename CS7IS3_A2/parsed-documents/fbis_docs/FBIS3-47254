FBIS3-47254 "dreas007_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 South Korea President Stresses Economic Recovery, Development SK1101071294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0655 GMT 11 Jan 94 SK1101071294 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam presided over the sixth meeting for promoting "a new economy" on Tuesday as a gesture of determination to materialize his vision of a viable economy based on deregulation and strong competitive edge, commonly called "ynomics." Kim set the direction for economic policy and then listened to reports from 11 related agencies, starting with the Science and Technology Ministry. The man who pledged to be an "economic president" showed his priorities by the order in which he heard the reports from his cabinet. His predecessors had called in ministers with security and diplomatic portfolios first for their new year reports. In contrast, Kim heard from the Economic Planning Board first and then listened to reports from each economy-related ministry. On Monday, he had lunch with three former presidents and heard about various projects to promote science and technology from Yi Sang-hui, chairman of the advisory council on Science and Technology. Kim promised to strengthen the country's economic competitiveness within his five years in office. Naming expansion of social overhead capital, balanced land development, deregulation, science and technology development, resolution of regional economic imbalances, and stronger competitiveness of rural areas as the main tasks to improve the country's economic competitiveness, he said he will personally see that they are carried out. Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and Economic Planning minister, reported that his team will draw up a comprehensive measure to rebuild rural communities to adapt to internationalization, radically improve the business environment to boost business activities, expand the infrastructure fund and create equal regional development, accelerate structural reforms and systems to prepare for free global trade, improve living standards, stabilize prices, and encourage frugality. Emboldened by the first balance of payments surplus in four years, the president is determined to accomplish a second economic leap forward for Korea by keeping industrial relations at peace and by getting the help of businessmen, workers, public servants and farmers, presidential aides say. Peaceful industrial relations and stable pay are most important to raise international competitiveness, Kim said in the meeting, instructing the ministers to rack their brains for ways to cement partnership between labor and management. Designating 1994 the year of economic recovery, Kim was most attentive to economic revitalization and to radical science and technology development, said Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs. He noted that Kim has retired his stock phrase "pain-sharing" in the new year. He did not call for pain-sharing in the economy meeting, but put stress on peaceful industrial relations, stable wages, and reforms in economic thinking and systems. He may believe that pain-sharing, in other words a frugality campaign, took root last year in the gale of reforms and changes, aides say. Or he may have realized that the call for pain-sharing to rebuild the country no longer appeals now that a year has passed since his administration was born, they say. Kim must have concluded that it was time to implant real hope and expectations in the people that the economy can be brought back to life, they speculate.
