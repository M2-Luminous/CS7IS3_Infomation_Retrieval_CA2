The accident occurred during a guard mounting ceremony when one of the soldiers armed with a sub-machine gun suddenly opened fire, killing his commander and several fellow soldiers. The guards on duty did not retaliate, fearing that bullets may hit fuel tanks of nuclear missiles deployed at the site. In that case a catastrophe would have been inevitable. The local newspaper ALTAYSKAYA PRAVDA said that the guards are prohibited from firing in the direction of the missiles even in the event of an attack by a subversive group. It took the commander of the unit three hours to persuade the soldier to surrender. During all this time the soldier, resident of Daghestan, did not leave a combat vehicle he had seized earlier. The newspaper said that the "critical" accident that happened on March 10 was not reported to local counterintelligence officials, which explains why there was no order to send paratroopers to the site. The newspaper did not speculate about possible motives of the accident.
