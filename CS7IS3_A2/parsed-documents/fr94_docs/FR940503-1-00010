FR940503-1-00010 FR940503-1-00002 The Proposed Special Conditions Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Learjet Model 45 series airplanes. 1. Lightning Protection: (a) Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to lightning. (b) Each essential function of electrical or electronic systems or installations must be protected to ensure that the function can be recovered in a timely manner after the airplane has been exposed to lightning. 2. Protection from unwanted effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields. 3. For the purpose of these special conditions, the following definitions apply: Critical Functions. Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Essential Functions. Functions whose failure could contribute to or cause a failure condition that would significantly impact the safety of the airplane or the ability of the flightcrew to cope with adverse operating conditions.
