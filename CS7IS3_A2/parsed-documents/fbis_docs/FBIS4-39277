It says in part: "The hopes placed on the delegations of Russia and Ukraine on the question of the Black Sea Fleet division have not come true. The news of the supposed transfer of the Crimean naval base to Ukraine causes a well-founded anxiety and an uncertainty for the future. Should the Donuzlava base be turned over to the Ukrainian Navy, the naval base along with the settlement would fall into decay. The daily life of most people in the Donuzlava garrison is connected with work in military units. None of us can even admit the thought that the Crimean naval base will be turned over to Ukraine. Should this happen, the more than 7,000 officers and warrant officers and members of their families would be left without subsistence. Comrade Admiral, we have faith in you, and in the common sense of the politicians who are not going to allow the transfer of the Crimean naval base to the Ukrainian Navy."
