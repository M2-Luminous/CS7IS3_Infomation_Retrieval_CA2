If these reports are put next to the Serbs' preparations for full military mobilization and the deadlocked situation at the peace negotiations, the supposition increases that both Serbs and Croats are now getting into position for the last push on the battlefields and the final division of Bosnia. Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen's move to introduce the call for sanctions at next week's meeting of European Union foreign ministers is thus, given the present situation, correct and necessary. In addition, there are better prospects that the sanctions can be made effective and will have some effect as compared with the sanctions against Serbia. Croatia's borders with Slovenia and Hungary will be easier to monitor than the borders between Serbia and her neighbors. Furthermore Croatia is far more sensitive to western pressure than the Serbian government in Belgrade. As their stated goal, the Croats want to link themselves closely to the rest of Europe and even have ambitions of becoming a member of the European Union. So the prerequisites for the sanctions, or perhaps just the threat of invoking them, to affect Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the government in Zagreb are in place. But all of that does not remove the impression that the threat is being made far too late. It has long been clear that Croatia is deeply involved in the war in Bosnia even if there are insistent and unceasing denials from the official Croatian side. It is also very obvious that statements from Bosnian Croats about eventually being incorporated into Croatia have never been convincingly contradicted from Zagreb. So there were good reasons to take a firm stand against the Croats as parties to the war at a much earlier time. The fact that this was not done tells us something about the impotence, the divisions, and the lack of international activity that have unfortunately characterized the rest of the world's stand on the drama in the Balkans right from the start. There are exceptions. Yesterday the flow of news from war observation posts contained the remarkable bit of information that Bosnian Serbs had withdrawn from a blockaded road leading to Sarajevo becauses of threats from the UN to use armored tanks to clear the road with force. The episode took place 24 hours after the UN's top commander in Bosnia announced a new and tougher policy to get emergency supplies through. Of course there was talk of an isolated incident -- but all the same. Just think if this tougher course had been taken somewhat earlier.
