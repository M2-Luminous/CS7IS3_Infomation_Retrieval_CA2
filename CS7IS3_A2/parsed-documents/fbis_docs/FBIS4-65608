The two-day gathering, opening on Tuesday, is billed as a conference to coordinate an action plan for the besieged Bosnian capital. The aim is to mobilise widespread support for restoring the battered city. An appeal for funds is to be made immediately after the meeting, with another conference due in New York within a few months to finalise matters. The Vienna meeting is being chaired by U.S. diplomat William Eagleton, named in March as UN civilian administrator for Sarajevo. Participants are to include 31 countries, UN and other international bodies, non-governmental organisations and municipal associations.
