For example while prospective payments has slowed the growth of Medicare payments for inpatient care, service utilization in post-acute and ambulatory settings has exploded, with a corresponding increase in expenditures. Questioning the medical appropriateness and need for many hospital admissions, third-party payers have adopted policies to encourage the use of less costly providers and settings. Many private insurers have turned to managed care arrangements, using financial incentives, preferred provider agreements, and increased utilization review to curb the use of inpatient hospital care. Private payers are also increasingly regulating and limiting what they will cover and how much they will reimburse, giving hospitals incentives to change the mix of services they provide. Government, on the other hand, has focused its efforts on evaluating, through utilization review, whether specific services should be furnished and determining the setting in which services must be provided. Medicare, for example, requires performance of almost all cataract surgery on an outpatient basis. Both public and private payers have attempted to influence the site and provision of services through preadmission certification and retrospective claims review with possible denial of payment. Legal and Regulatory Environments The legal and regulatory environments that hospitals face at both the Federal and state levels also affect their financial condition and organization of service delivery. The Federal government influences hospitals, for example, through antitrust and tax laws. These regulations significantly affect hospitals' ability to respond to financial pressures by acquiring or contracting with other health care providers. Many states are considering or in the process of enacting comprehensive health reform legislation that will influence how hospitals are paid and which services are provided, even in the absence of Federal health reform.4 Several states_among them Vermont, North Dakota, Florida, and Minnesota_are crafting cost-containment strategies that include expenditure targets or global caps on health care spending and encourage or mandate the development of managed care networks. Minnesota has established state boards to oversee major capital expenditures and to foster collaboration among providers. Vermont is preparing to implement payment limits for all providers within the state, while providing health insurance to all its residents. Hawaii has had universal health insurance coverage for 20 years. If states successfully lower the rates of increase in health care expenditures, hospitals will see their revenues constrained and their ability to cost shift among payers limited. Hospital Responses to Changes in the Health Care Environment How an individual hospital has evolved in response to technological advances, financing changes, and legal or regulatory developments has depended on the hospital's internal and external environments. Among their responses are changes in the services provided; attempts to control cost growth; and innovative arrangements among hospitals, other providers, and insurers. The end result has been significant diversification in the hospital industry. Services Provided A combination of fewer admissions and shorter stays has encouraged hospitals to seek alternative sources of revenue. Inpatient admissions for the population 65 and over decreased with the implementation of PPS in 1983, but began growing again in 1986. Among the nonelderly, both the number and rate of inpatient admissions have continued to drop. Average length of stay fell considerably after PPS was introduced and has shown only modest changes since then. Some hospitals have responded to the decline in acute patient admissions by targeting different patient populations. If hospitals convert to specialty status, they also may be shielded from stringent cost containment. In particular, they are exempt from PPS. Since 1980, the number of general medical and surgical hospitals has decreased by 11.2 percent, while the number of psychiatric hospitals has accelerated by 41.8 percent and the number of other specialty hospitals has grown by 7.3 percent (see Table 1&hyph;3).
