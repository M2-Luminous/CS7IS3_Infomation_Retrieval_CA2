At Sheik Restaurant recently, it saw South African Professor Andre Tomashaussen, legal adviser to UN special representative Dr. Aldo Ajello on behalf of the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, and Raul Domingos, who is extremely well known as one of principal figures in the movement led by Afonso Dhlakama, dining together in rather subdued light. They were talking in a friendly manner, like two brothers, and at times contented smiles came to their faces. At one point, in the heat of their conversation, Tomashaussen either forgot -- or perhaps not -- that there were other people in the restaurant and off he went, loudly warning Raul Domingos to watch out for the Americans. He reminded Domingos of what had happened with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA: The Americans had begun with many promises but had then dropped the organization led by Jonas Savimbi. We looked around but saw no Americans. There were only some opposition party militants who have already lost their "emergent" status and are hoping for some financial aid from Uncle Sam to get going. Bula-Bula does not like to listen to conversations in which it has not been invited to participate, so it withdrew and had a meal at the bar. Let politicians heed the following advice, though: You should not make loud comments in restaurants. Or then, if you wish to, you can talk to the newspapers. Otherwise, you may bother those in the vicinity or be heard by Bula-Bula, which is becoming ever more omnipresent.
