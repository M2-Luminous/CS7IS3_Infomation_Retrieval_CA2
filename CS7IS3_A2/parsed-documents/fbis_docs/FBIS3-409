The Bophuthatswanan cabinet will meet on Monday to make a final decision on the issue. The cabinet meeting will also discuss the present strike by Bop [Bophuthatswana] civil servants which has virtually paralyzed the civil service. The civil servants are striking over pension pay-outs and salaries. They are also demanding the resignation of the director general of the broadcast services of Bophuthatswana. President Mangope said he could not blame civil servants for being concerned about their money falling into the hands of a new South African Government. He said the South African Government, in partnership with the ANC [African National Congress], could not be trusted with his people's pension funds. He said the only way for civil servants to receive their pension money was to resign. President Mangope was opening the ruling Christian Democratic Party Youth Congress in Mmabatho this morning.
