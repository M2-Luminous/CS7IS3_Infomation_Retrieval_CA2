FBIS4-13796 "drnes079dd_94009" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Accord Called `National Achievement' JN2304200794 Baghdad Voice of the PLO in Arabic 1600 GMT 23 Apr 94 JN2304200794 Baghdad Voice of the PLO Arabic BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] Brothers: Despite the acceleration of events and the ferocity of dispute in the arena of political negotiations between the PLO and the Israeli enemy, our Palestinian people are confirming, exactly like they have always confirmed, that they are stronger than all conspiracies and attempts to undermine their internal front. Through their awareness and lengthy experience in confronting the enemy, the Palestinian people have also confirmed that they are always vigilant and capable of replying to enemies' plots, so there will only be room for Palestinian freedom and independence on the liberated land of Palestine. The Fatah-Hamas agreement on adopting dialogue as the only way to resolve political differences as well as prohibiting the shedding of Palestinian blood at the hands of Palestinians is actually a national achievement by the PLO regarding the solidification of the domestic Palestinian position in the face of the Israeli position that has persisted in beating the drums of Palestinian civil war when occupation ends. It seems as if Israeli malice wants to convince the Palestinians that it is better for them to live under occupation and relinquish the rights to their territories and homeland. However, the recent Fatah-Hamas agreement in the occupied Gaza Strip came to deal a back-breaking blow to all enemy delusions, allegations, and schemes which primarily aim at undermining the domestic Palestinian situation against the Palestinian national authority in order to demonstrate that this authority lacks eligibility and credibility in administering the areas from which the occupation withdraws, and, consequently, it would be useless and unnecessary to implement any future agreements on expanding both the Palestinian self-rule areas and the Palestinian authority's responsibilities. This agreement not only contributes to entrenching and consolidating the Palestinian national unity--so it will be a rock on which all enemy conspiracies founder--but it also stresses the bright sides of the comprehensive Palestinian struggle in confronting the enemy and its schemes. This is based on emphasizing Palestinian national principles when democracy is established and when the first and foremost loyalty will be for the homeland and for the interests of its sons, without making any room for differences in political viewpoints. Such differences would be a loophole through which the enemy could penetrate to achieve its objectives and destroy the Palestinian national achievements. Furthermore, this agreement is a qualitative step in running the conflict with the Zionist enemy. Despite stressing continued struggle until the occupation is expelled from all occupied Palestinian territories, this agreement has stressed the anxiety of the Israeli side by emphasizing both the internal stability in the Palestinian self-rule areas and the devotion to the social and economic tasks assigned to all sons and groups of the people in order to lift the suffering which resulted from occupation and its practices. This is because Palestinian security cannot be achieved amid unemployment and strikes. Our people, the people of heroism and martyrs, have confirmed that they are deservedly the people of miracles and that they know how to fight their enemies, safeguard their national unity, and entrench and accumulate their national achievements until independence and great victory are realized.
