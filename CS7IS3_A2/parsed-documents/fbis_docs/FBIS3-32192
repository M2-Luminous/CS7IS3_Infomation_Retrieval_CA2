FBIS3-32192 "drlat023_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 Peru Dailies Assess Impact of U.S. Secretary Watson's Visit PY0302014694 PY0302014694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish on 26 January, on page A2, carries a 600-word article by Rafael Rey Rey entitled "The Mote in Another's Eye," referring to the recent visit by the U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, Alexander Watson. The commentary states that although the U.S. delegation had to admit the progress made by Peru during the past few years in various fields, it still let Peru know that the U.S. Government and Congress "are still concerned and closely watching Peruvian developments and have recommendations to make in the human rights field." It then goes on to say that it would be a good thing if these recommendations were directed to the human rights of the victims of terrorism, the unemployed, the homeless, the hungry, and the uneducated, but that unfortunately there are only 180 alleged cases of torture reported by an unknown organization for the defense of human rights. Rey then rejects the so-called human rights defense institutions that only damage the country's image with their "distorted" reports, and notes that the members of the Peruvian leftist, Marxist, and socialists sectors, as well as opposition members, who used to greet U.S. representatives with insults in the past now enthusiastically applaud the U.S. recommendations. After explaining that a U.S. delegation member was unable to say with what moral authority the United States, with numerous cases of human rights violations, made recommendations on human rights, the article ends by stating that if the U.S. Government and Congress fail to acknowledge Peru's achievements after this visit, it is time for Peru to clearly tell the United States that, although it appreciates its aid and cooperation, it is no longer willing to be humiliated. Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 26 January, on page A26, carries a 1,100-word "commentary" by Federico Prieto Celi entitled "One Should Not Wash One's Dirty Linen in Public," also referring to Watson's visit. The article comments that the visit has revealed that those who followed Moscow in the past now are siding with Washington's reports on the Peruvian Government's alleged shortcomings before another government as if Peru were its subordinate. The commentary says Washington has gained courage with the USSR's downfall and feels entitled to tell Peru how to behave when the United States itself has serious human rights problems. The "commentary" notes that in democracy each country should solve its own problems with its own tools, and that those who "talk about dependency and domination are not valid interlocutors to tell Washington today what they told Moscow yesterday about what the Lima Government should be." The "commentary" ends by stating that democracy is not a product the United States exports, and that Peruvians should calmly realize that the national problems and solutions do not come from abroad but rather from their own roots, their current challenges, and the democratic will of the people.
