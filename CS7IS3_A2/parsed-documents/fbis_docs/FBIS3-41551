Otto Sumarwoto said that bringing old industrial equipment into Indonesia will not only cause pollution problems, but will also be economically inefficient. ``Moreover, the public's growing concern on environmental problems will become a threat to the operation of such old industrial facilities. Their products can, in the long run, be also completely rejected on the international markets,'' Otto said referring to the government's new investment policy, which is partly designed to attract the sunset industries of more developed nations into Indonesia. The importation of second hand plant-equipment was previously banned in Indonesia, but has been made possible by the new package. He warned that the government should be more cautious in licensing such old industries, as their operations will not only cause environmental problems but also create a high cost economy. ``Their operations will not only be inefficient but are also under a threat in the long term, in line with the public's growing concern about environmental problems,'' he said. He said the government should have a long-term perspective in drawing a policy so that its negative impacts can be minimized The government, as part of the deregulatory measures issued last month, also allows foreign investors to own 100 percent of the equity of an industrial company producing intermediary products, raw materials and semi finished products, with paid-up capital of only U.S. $2 million. Minister of Industry Tunk Ariwibowo said the move is an important breakthrough taken by the government to attract the relocation of industries from more developed nations. The restriction on the importation of second hand machinery equipment and other capital goods was abolished as part of the government's package to encourage the relocation of more developed nations' industries into the country. Otto estimated that industries relocated into Indonesia will survive only within five years because after that period they will no longer be able to compete due to their rising production costs.
