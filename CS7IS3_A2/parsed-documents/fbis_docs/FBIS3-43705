Mr. Mandela said the ANC had disciplined some SDU members involved in violence. He was speaking after a meeting of Patriotic Front members and responding to radio and newspaper reports which quoted an East Rand SDU member as saying he killed opponents as he would kill chickens. The SDU issue would be raised at Friday's meeting of the ANC national executive committee, Mr Mandela said. However, he said he wanted to stress, without being protective of SDUs, that problems with the units were the results of a government strategy. "Their strategy is based on the fact that they will have overwhelming suport among whites in the election. They are confident of substantial support among coloreds and Indians, and that the base of the ANC is the African community. The violence is taking place only among Africans. By instigating and conniving in the violence they will be able to cut down the majority of the ANC." The ANC, he said, did not condone the lack of discipline and slaughter of innocent people. Mr Mandela said peace-keeping proposals he discussed with State President F. W. de Klerk on Monday dovetailed with the efforts of the Transitional Executive Council. Mr Mandela said he would report to the ANC national executive committee on his discussions with Mr de Klerk.
