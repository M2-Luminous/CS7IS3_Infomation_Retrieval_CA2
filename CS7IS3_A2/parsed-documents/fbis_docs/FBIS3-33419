FBIS3-33419 "drlat037_g_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 Guatemala Some 3,000 Surround Palace PA2302211194 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1954 GMT 23 Feb 94 PA2302211194 Panama City ACAN Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Some 3,000 Guatemalan Government employees have blocked access to the National Palace, where they gathered today to demand that President Ramiro de Leon Carpio agree to personally negotiate a 40 percent salary increase. About 30 labor leaders have entered the Presidential Palace in hope of seeing De Leon, whom they have asked to meet with them to discuss the two-week-old conflict involving some 200,000 government employees. Meanwhile, another group of workers has peacefully occupied the building that houses the Central American Parliament to request that organization's mediation in seeking a resolution to the labor conflict that has entered its third week. Armando Sanchez, secretary of the National Federation of State Workers Unions (Fenasteg) who is inside the palace, told the press he will not leave until he receives an answer from the president. The police have not intervened, but several units have been deployed to control the demonstrators who marched earlier through several streets in Guatemala City. Government employees have partially paralyzed several state services, including health services, by staging intermittent work stoppages since the beginning of the month to demand a 40 percent pay raise and to demand the abolition of plans to privatize certain state-owned companies and services. Labor leaders headed by Armando Sanchez have detained several government employees, among them National Police Director Mario Cifuentes. The labor leaders are not allowing anyone, including reporters, to enter or leave the palace, and dozens of reporters have surrounded the building. Cifuentes told the press that the removal of the labor leaders is being considered, but he is awaiting orders from ranking government authorities. Meanwhile, Sanchez warned, "We will not leave until we receive a positive answer to our just demands or until the president promises to hold a direct dialogue." Hector Luna, secretary general of the Presidency, met with a commission of union workers to hear to their opinions, and he told them that De Leon is not in Guatemala City. According to Sanchez, the measures are intended to press for a 40 percent salary increase and to reject a government-offered bonus of 360 quetzales a year (approximately $62) -- a bonus Sanchez calls an "affront" to the workers. Nery Barrios, one of the top leaders of Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP), told ACAN-EFE that the organization decided to take to the streets and occupy these offices to support the demands of the government workers in light of the government's "hardening" position. According to Barrios, UASP, which belongs to Fenasteg, and the Union of State Workers support the government workers and remain committed to the call for a nationwide strike. During the demonstration, the workers accused President de Leon Carpio of being "subservient and taking up arms," as well as having "betrayed" the trust given to him when he took office in June 1993. "As long as there is social injustice, the people will be in the streets. Ramiro de Leon, you will be leading the people to their graves," shouted workers in front of the palace where they are demanding the president's resignation. Barrios explained that in addition to a 40 percent salary increase, the forceful measures are intended to oppose government-announced sales of state-owned assets. The strike has paralyzed 95 percent of the public administration, according to the leader of UASP, an organization that claims 1 million members. "We will not end the strike as long as our demands are not met, because the people are starving to death," Barrios insisted. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ana de Molina reiterated today that the government is willing to hold talks, but she clarified that the government does not have funds to meet the demands for salary hikes.
