Nasrollah made the remark in an exclusive interview published in Wednesday issue of the English daily `TEHRAN TIMES'. Turning to political activities of Hizbollah, he said the Islamic movement in Lebanon has been fully active in the political scene for the past year and had sent 12 deputies to the parliament. "The importance of this approach is that it shows Hizbollah's popularity and proves that Western and regional propaganda against us are totally baseless." He described Hizbollah's social and cultural activities over this period as spectacular but voiced its opposition with the so-called peace process from the very beginning. "We have particularly rejected Lebanon's entry into these treacherous talks, because they are against our country's political and national interests and we feel it is illogical for Lebanon to participate in them." Asked about Hizbollah's reaction in case Lebanon joins the peace process and signs a peace treaty, Nasrollah said that such a peace may create obgligatinos for governments but not for people. Stressing that people were after a real peace and not the one on the process, he said "when a peace treaty is finalized we will then announce our stand according to the realities of the time." On the possibility of Hizbollah laying down its weapons, he declined to give any comments in this connection or the consequences of regional changes resulting from the peace accord. However, he said, "we will address both issues when positive changes occure in the area." He called the existing relations between Hizbollah and the Lebanese Government "severely tense, negative and confused". Nasrollah described the present policies of Lebanon as dangerous for the Lebanese people and for the future of the country. Referring to Hizbollah's relations with the Lebanese Government as very disappointing, he said that not only the government of Rafiq Harari was not able to solve the existing problems but it created new difficulties. "What deteriorated our relations with Rafiq Harari's administration was the army's attack on our peaceful September 13 demonstration protesting the Gaza-Jericho partial authonomy treaty," he said and called for Harari's resignation. "Generally speaking, establishment of an Islamic government seems to be ideally suited for all Islamic countries, yet, we are against forced solutions." Turning to the recent Geneva meeting of the Syrian and U.S. presidents, he said that according to the media they disagreed on the issues related to Hizbollah. Reportedly, U.S. President Bill Clinton considered all liberation movements as terrorists while syria regarded them, specially those in Lebanon and Palestine, as legal and natural. "People whose lands are occupied by foreigners have the right to fight for the return of their territorial sovereignty and no one can deprive them of this right," he stressed.
