FR941230-1-00043 FR941230-1-00004 Example 7. Limitation of payments to use not determined annually. City Q issues bonds with a term of 15 years and uses the proceeds to construct an office building. The debt service on the bonds is level throughout the 15-year term. O enters into a 5-year lease of 11 percent of the building with Corporation R under which R will make lease payments equal to 20 percent of the annual debt service on the bonds for each year of the lease. The present value of R's lease payments is equal to 12 percent of the present value of the debt service over the entire 15-year term of the bonds. If, however, the lease payments taken into account as private payments were limited to 11 percent of debt service paid in each year of the lease, the present value of these payments would be only 8 percent of the debt service on the bonds over the entire term of the bonds. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment test, because R's lease payments are taken into account as private payments in an amount not to exceed 11 percent of the debt service on the bonds over the term of the bonds (rather than 11 percent per year). Example 8. Parity bonds. University L, a political subdivision, issued three separate series of revenue bonds during 1989, 1991, and 1993 under the same bond resolution. L used the proceeds to construct facilities exclusively for its own use. Bonds issued under the resolution are equally and ratably secured and payable solely from the income derived by L from rates, fees, and charges imposed by L for the use of the facilities. The bonds issued in 1989, 1991, and 1993 are not private activity bonds. In 1995, L issues another series of bonds under the resolution to finance additional facilities. L enters into 10-year leases for 20 percent of the new facilities with nongovernmental persons who will use the facilities in their trades or businesses. The present value of the lease payments from the nongovernmental users will equal 15 percent of the present value of the debt service on the 1995 bonds. L will commingle all of the revenues from all its bond-financed facilities in its revenue fund. The portion of the lease payments from nongovernmental lessees of the new facilities allocable to the 1995 bonds under ยง1.148&hyph;6(e)(6) is less than 10 percent of the present value of the debt service on the 1995 bonds. The 1995 bonds will meet the private security or payment test because the private lease payments for the new facility are properly allocated to those bonds (that is, because none of the proceeds of the prior issues were used for the new facilities). Example 9. Variable yield issues. (i) City M issues general obligation bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a 5-story office building. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate that is recomputed monthly according to an index that reflects current market yields. They yield that the interest index would produce on the issue date is 6 percent. M leases one floor of the office building to Corporation T, a nongovernmental person, for the term of the bonds. Using the 6 percent yield as the discount rate, M reasonably expects on the issue date that the present value of lease payments to be made by T will be 8 percent of the present value of the total debt service on the bonds. After the issue date of the bonds, interest rates decline significantly, so that the yield on the bonds over their entire term is 4 percent. Using this actual 4 percent yield as the discount rate, the present value of lease payments made by T is 12 percent of the present value of the actual total debt service on the bonds. The bonds are not private activity bonds because M reasonably expected on the issue date that the bonds would not meet the private security or payment test and because M did not take any subsequent deliberate action to meet the private security or payment test. (ii) The facts are the same as part (i) of this Example 9, except that 5 years after the issue date M leases a second floor to Corporation S, a nongovernmental person, under a long-term lease. On the date this lease is entered into M reasonably expects that the yield on the bonds over their entire term will be 5.5 percent, based on actual interest rates to date and the then-current rate on the variable yield bonds. Using this 5.5 percent yield as the discount rate, as a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds, the present value of lease payments made by T is 9 percent and the present value of the lease payments made by S is 2 percent. The bonds are private activity bonds because M has taken a subsequent deliberate action that causes the bonds to meet the private security or payment test. Example 10. Stadium ticket tax. (i) Authority issues its bonds to finance the construction of a stadium. Under a long-term lease, Corporation X, a professional sports team, will use more than 10 percent of the stadium. Corporation X will not, however, make any payments for this private business use. The security for the bonds will be a ticket tax imposed on each person purchasing a ticket for an event at the stadium. The portion of the ticket tax attributable to tickets purchased by persons attending X's events will, on a present value basis, exceed 10 percent of the present value of Authority's bonds. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment test. The ticket tax is not a tax of general application and, to the extent that the tax receipts relate to X's events, the taxes constitute payments in respect of property used for a private business use. (ii) The facts are the same as in part (i) of this Example 10, except that the ticket tax is imposed by Authority on tickets purchased for events at a number of large entertainment facilities within the jurisdiction of Authority (for example, other stadiums, arenas, concert halls, etc.), some of which were not financed with tax-exempt bonds. The ticket tax is a tax of general application and therefore the revenue from this tax are not payments in respect of property used for a private business use. Therefore, the bonds do not satisfy the private security or payment test.
