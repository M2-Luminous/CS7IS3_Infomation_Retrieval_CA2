FBIS4-53710 "dreas099_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea IAEA Negotiation Team Arrives in Beijing IAEA Negotiation Team Arrives in Beijing SK2305024894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0200 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305024894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Report by Correspondent Yi Tong-sik from Beijing] [Text] While additional inspections of North Korea are smoothly coming to an end, a working-level negotiation team of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] arrived in Beijing this morning. The two-man negotiation team led by Inspections Bureau chief (Perry Corse), will leave for Pyongyang at 1520 tomorrow afternoon [0620 GMT 24 May] via Koryo Airlines after staying in Beijing today. While there, the team will conduct negotiations with relevant North Korean officials over the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. The three inspectors, including chief of Inspections Section (Heinonen), who have been watching the replacement of nuclear fuel rods while conducting additional inspections in Yongbyon after entering North Korea on 19 May, will conclude its additional inspections today and leave Pyongyang tomorrow. However, the possibility remains that the three-man inspection team will present to the working-level negotiation team a report on the comprehensive status surrounding the replacement of nuclear fuel rods and join the negotiation team. It is expected that the working-level negotiations will proceed for at least four to five days this time. There is concern, however, that if both sides should stand up to each other tensely by sticking only to their previous positions, the negotiations will directly stalemate like last August's nuclear negotiations.
