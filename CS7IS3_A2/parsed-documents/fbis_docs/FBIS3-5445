The Cambodian government should be responsible for foreign investors, including Thais, Amnuai said. It is common for foreign investors to be involved in unlawful business in other countries, he said. The government has warned Thai business people not to engage in illegal activities in foreign countries, and only a few Thais were allegedly involved in such activity, he said. "Every country has such a problem, which is solvable," Amnuai said. Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said over the weekend that a handful of foreign investors, including Thais, have well-established mafia-type links and were deeply involved in money laundering and drug trafficking activities in that country.
