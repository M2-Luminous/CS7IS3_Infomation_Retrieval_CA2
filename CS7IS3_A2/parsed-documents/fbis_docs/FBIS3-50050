Tibor Keri on statements made to him by Attila Zsigmond, Hungarian Democratic Forum deputy and chairman of the parliament's Cultural Committee: "Media Law Possible by Spring"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Attila Zsigmond (MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]) rejected opposition suggestions that passage of the media law is not in the government's interest. He announced that the government coalition indeed wanted and still wants the law to be created and that the government has a role to play in ending the parliament's negligence, which violates the Constitution. He added that the irregular situation that has developed in the media is not advantageous to anyone. The chairman of the Cultural Committee said that the experts' draft of the media law is finished and that the ministries are now holding discussions on it to resolve their differences. Until conciliation is achieved, the draft cannot be submitted to the National Assembly. The chairman of the Cultural Committee asserted that he is confident that the government's recommendation will build on those elements of the draft law on which a consensus developed previously. He does not see any chance, however, for changing the so-called appointment law, which this parliament passed, or for "upgrading" the role of the Radio and Television Office. According to Attila Zsigmond, if everything goes well, committee debate on the media draft law will start in February, and resolution of differences among the parties will be able to proceed concurrently. Zsigmond would particularly like to urge the latter. If political agreement can be reached, work on the law can speed up significantly, he added. In that case, the media law can be passed by the middle of April, the chairman of the Cultural Committee emphasized. Zsigmond also asserted that a clean campaign does not depend on passage of the media law. What is absolutely necessary is a neutral stance on the part of journalists and honesty on the part of the political participants in the campaign. He added that now even those people who previously paid only lip service to passing the media law want it passed. Countless problems could have been avoided with television and radio if the media law had been passed before, he pointed out. [passage omitted]
