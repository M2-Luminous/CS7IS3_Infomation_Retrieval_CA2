In an intervention at the 63rd session of the Maritime Safety Committee in London, Adhamos Adhamidhis, minister of communications and works of Cyprus, emphatically stated "Cyprus as a major maritime country, fully understands the concerns of the international maritime community on this issue." He said Cyprus strongly objected to the Turkish regulations for passage of vessels through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles Straits adopted earlier this year. The minister said the Cypriot objections were based on reasons of both substance and the way Turkey was trying to impose these regulations. "We consider that a lot of these rules do not correspond to the provisions of the 1936 Montreaux convention on the regime of the straits, as well as other international instruments such as the 1982 UN convention on the law of the sea, existing practice and customary law," he said. Adhamidhis added many articles of the Turkish regulations violated the principle of freedom of transit and navigation in the straits which was recognised and affirmed in the Monteaux convention. He pointed out that if a country, such in the case of Turkey, "unilaterally decides to change the existing rules then the world order, which took the international community so many efforts and sacrifices to establish, will be confronted with many perils and multilateralism will suffer a fatal blow." The minister said Cyprus had a bitter experience from Turkish decisions taken according to Turkish law in violation of international law and practice. "Further to the illegal and arbitrary embargo on Cyprus ships to call on Turkish ports, the recent Turkish behaviour regarding the collision last March of two Cyprus flag vessels, Nassia and Shipbroker, in the Bosporus Straits, is indicative of the dangers of placing such matters at the whim of a single country," he told the London meeting. Regarding last March's incident, the minister said the Cyprus government in conformity with the obligations under the solas, loadlines and marpol conventions, immediately approached Turkey both bilaterally and through the secretary general of IMO [International Maritime Organization] for permission to investigate the causes of the accident. "Regrettably the Turkish authorities refused our legitimate request for access to the ships and the surviving members of the crew, some of whom are still in Turkish prisons... in line with its ulterior motive, the Turkish administration has deliberately and unreasonably prolonged the closure of the straits, on account of alleged hazards resulting from the collision of the two vessels," Adhadmidhis added. The minister added "Cyprus is of the opinion that if any rules for the navigation in the straits are to be considered then the IMO's procedures should be adhered to and the justified concerns of the states bordering the Black Sea, the landlocked ones, whose livelihood mainly depends on the sea-borne trade and those who are among the frequent users of the straits should be taken into account." Adhamidhis concluded calling on Turkey "to withdraw their regulations, which will cause serious damage to the interests of the international community and set a bad precedent" and appealing for respect of international treaties and legality and avoidance of unilateralism. Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's territory.
