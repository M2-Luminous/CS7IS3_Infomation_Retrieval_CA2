Various types of accidents have occurred time and again. Last year, accidents in eight major categories caused more than 2,000 deaths and over 20 million yuan in direct economic losses, both record highs. At a briefing, the person in charge of the commission pointed out: The main problems in safety-in-production work are as follows: In the course of building a socialist market economic structure, people have a weak sense of the legal system in production safety, the existing laws are imperfect, and even these are neither observed nor strictly enforced. The government and enterprises relax safety management. Some enterprise leaders put an undue emphasis on production to the detriment of safety and on education at the expense of management. As they invest little in the safety sector, hidden dangers of safety-related accidents can be found almost everywhere. The problem of production safety is especially pronounced in some provincial enterprises, township and town enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises. Education and safety training are not carried out effectively among employees. Accidents are not earnestly investigated and handled. Furnaces, mines, and fire protection are still the weak links of production safety work. To counter these problems, the provincial commission for production safety urged to further implement the production safety responsibility system, do a good job of the investigation and removal of hidden dangers for safety-related accidents, and at the same time, make good preparations for conducting this year's safety production week activities and the 119 fire production and safety day activities.
