Before flying to Moscow, Urban had talked about buying supplies of military technology worth "over $50 million." The precise sum and the sort of technology to be bought would be decided by experts from both countries over the coming weeks, Urban said, adding that the Slovak Army had been already using the same technology this year. Urban said that during his Moscow talks there was no sign of the crisis which has arisen around the reorganization of the Russian Government. He met Russian Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, and together they signed a plan for military cooperation between the two countries for this year, which covers about 20 joint actions. The plan was not part of the Partnership for Peace, Urban said, because the Russian-Slovak military agreement had been concluded before this year's NATO Summit in Brussels. On November 30 last year Slovakia and the Russian Federation signed a protocol on "The achievement of an agreement concerning the partial reduction of the debts of the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation towards the Slovak Republic in the form of supplies of special technology." On the basis of this agreement, in December Slovakia bought weapons and military technology worth $180 million. The main items were five Russian MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for various types of weapon. During his November visit to Moscow, Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak stressed that Moscow was not capable of paying debts, and the Paris agreements allowed its debts to be shelved until 1996. "It is really a concession on the part of the Russians that they are willing to write off the supply from the debt, and it suits us," Andrejcak said. After the division of the former Czechoslovakia, the former Soviet Union's debts to Slovakia amounted to approximately $1.5 billion.
