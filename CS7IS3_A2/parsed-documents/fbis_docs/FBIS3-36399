This statement was made by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko in Kiev Friday at the meeting with diplomats and journalists. He has said that the absence of the decision on joining the treaty should not be interpreted as a negative attitude to the document. The issue is still on the agenda, believes the Ukrainian Foreign Minister. The parliament resolution, said the Minister, opens the way to the implementation of tripartite documents on nuclear disarmament, involving Ukraine, the United States and Russia. Zlenko believes that it is planned to hold shortly bilateral and tripartite talks of experts on the implementation of the Moscow documents. He said that the date for the talks is about to be set. Zlenko believes the parliament resolution will provide the possibility to boost the negotiations with international financial organizations to offer Ukraine effective economic aid. The Minister also pointed to the need to speed up the financial and economic aid to Ukraine. "I am absolutely sure," he said, "that the treaty should not be an obstacle to providing aid to Ukraine," said Zlenko. The wording of the resolution's second provision unambiguously points to the fact that the exchange of the instruments of ratification on the START-1 treaty will be the first step. At the same time, he said, the parties involved will negotiate concrete intergovernment agreements which proceed from the reservations contained in the parliament resolution of November 18, 1993. Asked by Interfax-Ukraine about possible debates in parliament over the timetable for Ukraine joining the treaty, Zlenko did not rule out that the present parliament would also consider the issue.
