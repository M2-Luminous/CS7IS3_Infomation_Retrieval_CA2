Such a strike, in his opinion, could be delivered only if Serbian troops engage the peacekeepers. According to Grachev, Russia's position is that a decision on a bombing raid should only be made by the UN Security Council rather than by the peacekeeping forces' command. He outlined this position at his meeting with his French counterpart Francois Leotard in Moscow on Friday. Commenting on the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Grachev said that to secure a cease-fire in Bosnia, Russia would press for "equally restraining" not only the Bosnian Serbs but also the Croatian and Moslem communities. Explaining his government's position on a settlement in Bosnia, Grachev urged the conflicting sides to call a cease-fire, ensure the passage of humanitarian relief convoys, and guarantee security in the region.
