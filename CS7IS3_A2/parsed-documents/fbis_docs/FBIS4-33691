This is Straight Talk here on Radio Rebelde. If the economic measures are good, why do they affect me? Luis Sexto and yours truly, Osvaldo Rodriguez, both of BOHEMIA magazine, will talk straight here about this topic. Luis, I think many good people are asking this question. They have yet to understand why they must be affected during this phase. In fact, many people are talking about this and are even feeling some rejection of the measures. They ask: Why? Why do I have to continue sacrificing? I recently spoke with a young woman with a 19-year-old son. She faces a very difficult economic situation because they live on her salary and the meager salary her son recently began to earn. She has to face a black market that, as we all know, swindles people; and now she faces these measures. She exclaimed: I see no way out of this situation! I see no solution! I do not think the measures will solve my problem! I think that, inspired by the young woman's example, we should answer those who think like this, who believe the measures affect them without necessarily presenting a solution to their problem. [Sexto] I think the situation is similar to that of a critically ill patient who asks his doctor: Doctor, if you are trying to save me, why are you making me go hungry? In this hypothetical case, I imagine the doctor would answer: Precisely to save your life. In other words, I believe the measures to restore the internal financial situation became effective on 1 June as part of a series of measures that I imagine will also be implemented in the near future within our economy. They are intended precisely to save the citizen's life, figuratively speaking. I believe that in almost all cases, saving a life involves a heroic action, or a painful action, or a daring action. I do not believe a life can be saved with a smile on your face or a sweep of the hand. Like I said, the action per se implies heroism, daring, and pain. Continuing the metaphor, we might add that these measures strive to save our economy from excessive liquidity, which as everyone knows, hampers productivity and discourages work. It even boosts prices in the so-called underground economy. We will talk about that later. [Rodriguez] I think this is important to discuss because the young woman I mentioned complained precisely about this. She said: The measure only worsens things. On the one hand, the state charges more; and, on the other hand, the speculators raised their prices as soon as the measures were announced. While she was debating this with me, I realized that her desperation did not let her understand everything I tried to explain. That is why I believe this analysis -- this is a message to our listeners today -- must be made calmly, without anger, without thinking about negative things. Think positively, as the saying goes. You must think positively because the financial measures may be something new for us, but they have been enforced all over the world. The problem is that other types of financial measures have also been enforced throughout the world. They provoke large-scale unemployment and privatizations -- that is the new liberal trend -- but they always yield results when it comes to truly reducing the balance of internal finances. [Sexto] We have said this on previous occasions. Given the current situation in Cuba, there is no option but to implement this type of measures. They may resemble measures that were implemented, or are being implemented, in other countries. We said a few weeks ago that the measures strive to reduce citizens' purchasing power. In other words, when there is an excessive amount of money circulating because of scant mercantile availability, the citizens, the workers accumulate large sums of money. It is a salary that practically cannot be spent in the official market, and is therefore accumulated -- or else circulates in the so-called underground economy. It is the same thing. In other words, the worker can give his money to the speculator, to the black market vendor, but the money never reaches the bank; the money never again reaches the state vaults. It remains in circulation and negatively affects the economy. Osvaldo, please allow me to continue for a moment. I think this must be considered unavoidable. We cannot believe there is any alternative under these circumstances. We must understand this. I think that when we realize these are bitter dregs that must be drunk to attain curative, therapeutic results from the economic viewpoint, then we will begin to understand the measures. Suppose the Cuban Revolution does not implement these measures; suppose another regime comes to rule the country tomorrow; suppose it is another person with other ideas, another social organization, another economic organization, they would solve the situation the same way. I want our listeners to realize this. There would be no other alternative but to implement these measures. There would be a difference, however between what the Cuban Revolution, what the revolutionary government does today and what -- hypothetically speaking -- another government, another social regime would do. Evidently, it has been said that these measures... [pauses] I have read some foreign news agencies' reports. They state: Cubans claim these are not shock measures but, if the price of cigarettes is raised almost 700 percent, or 500 percent, is this not a shock measure? Well, it depends on how you look at it. If the cigarettes' usual price is raised 500 percent or 600 percent, but the public health budget remains unchanged, and the education budget remains unchanged, then the measures are not exactly shock measures. [Rodriguez] Nevertheless, it depends on who evaluates them. Some have called them moderate measures. They have not necessarily called them harsh measures. [Sexto] They are the most intelligent ones. [Rodriguez] Yes, they are obviously the most intelligent ones. Nevertheless, we are here, being affected by the measures, and we consider them neither exaggerated nor weak measures. The measures are negative; the measures undeniably affect us today; but they will improve our situation. Furthermore, they represent our only option. The only other possible option would be to have enough products to fill the market. We all know that given the current circumstances in our economy, we have no money to import the necessary products or the raw materials to manufacture them in the country. In due time -- technicians and experts say in not less than 18 months -- we will realize the essential results of these measures. The peso -- the value of which has decreased, which is devalued, and which people practically do not even consider nowadays -- will be much more valuable. The peso will assume more value, proportionate to the degree to which I must use pesos from my salary to pay for services and products. We will see the peso recover its value to the extent that money circulating in the country achieves a rational, stable value, a value recommended by experts, a figure suggested by common sense, so far as financial sense is concerned. In fact, to reassure certain people... [pauses] you know that many people worry about the black market and the underground economy. Many think that the black market and the underground economy solve the people's problems. I wish to dispute what those people say. I say the black market does not provide for the country because I am quite convinced that the amount of merchandise circulating in the black market is a minimal amount; it is a minimal volume of merchandise. Aside from that, no family can afford black market prices. You must clearly realize that. No one can live on the black market. The problem is that the black market also creates an illusion, the same illusion created by the peasant's free market, the illusion of a store window full of things that I can buy. The truth is that you buy two pounds of rice today, two pounds of beans another day, a chicken on another day, and a piece of pork on yet another, but when you add up two pounds of rice, two pounds of beans, a chicken, plus a piece of pork, it represents much more than the income of a family in which four persons work. [Sexto] Of course. But there is more, Osvaldo. There is more. It is an illusion. The amount of merchandise in the underground economy is a mixture of black market mechandise and merchandise that, in one way or another, comes from legal sources. The minimum volume of the underground economy is indicated precisely by the high prices of that economy. The blind, deaf laws of a market economy prevail in the undergound economy, the so-called black market. If I have a small amount, the prices go up. If there was a lot of merchandise in that market.... [Rodriguez, interrupting] The prices would drop. [Sexto] The prices would not be so enormous, so brutal. [Rodriguez] We will now have to see how the cigarette prices react, for example, where there is a sufficient supply [words indistinct]. [Sexto] Of course, of course. [Rodriguez] If there is a need to sell cigarettes in the undergound economy... [pauses] I think some people buy their quota even though they do not smoke. They will buy it at 6 or 7 pesos; and, if they want to sell it to get additional income, they will have to sell it for less than the open market price, which is 9 pesos. In other words, they cannot sell it for a much higher price because there is a volume of cigarettes on the open market and the black market therefore has no reason to exist. The underground economy has absolutely no reason to exist. [Sexto] You said the black market prices are high because there is a small amount of merchandise. [Rodriguez] That is right. Also, to the degree that excess circulating money and excess money in the Cuban people's hands decreases as a result of all these measures... [pauses] for the sake of calming some people who worry about this -- personally speaking, I have had altercations with certain people -- I state that the black market will tend to decrease because it must be proportionate to the volume of circulating money and the people's purchasing ability. [Sexto] Of course. To the degree that there is less money, there will be less opportunity to demand a high price. Therefore, Osvaldo, to conclude -- I think you are reminding me that we are running out of time -- I believe this must be considered a sick person's unavoidable step toward recovery. He must undergo a treatment that many times proves uncomfortable or painful. I also issue an appeal to the people's patriotic spirit. The citizens cannot think only with the lower levels of their conscience. They must also think with the superior levels. We have a debt toward the Cuban Revolution. We might talk about that in another program. I believe that we must protect the Cuban Revolution's achievements by making a contribution today -- this sacrifice.
