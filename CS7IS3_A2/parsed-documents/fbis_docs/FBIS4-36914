Information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says that Colonel Muhammad Salih al-Ahmar, half brother of the Yemeni president and commander of the Air Force and Air Defense, was behind the official invitation sent to the five Russian engineers, as mentioned in the original version of the invitation document sent by the General Staff in Sanaa. Sources say that Yemeni Embassy officials in Moscow pointed out to the Russian experts that there was no means of transport to Sanaa as a result of the fighting, but the experts surprised Yemeni diplomats by saying they would go to Sanaa by a special plane -- which confirms the existence of direct contacts between Sanaa and the Russian experts without the Yemeni Embassy's knowledge. The sources add that northern military [officials] visit Tashkent to purchase various types of weapons, especially fighter aircraft.
