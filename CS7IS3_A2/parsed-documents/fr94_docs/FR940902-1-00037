FR940902-1-00037 FR940902-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MN20&hyph;1&hyph;5880; FRL&hyph;5064&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On December 11, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted proposed revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). In the proposed revisions, MPCA is attempting to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO 2 as required by Sections 110 and 172 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410 and 7502. The submittal consists of Administrative Orders representing the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131. In this action, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State's submittal based on enforceability and attainment demonstration concerns. The MPCA must address the concerns detailed in this action and submit the Administrative Order to USEPA before the end of the 30-day comment period. If no other substantive, adverse comments are received and MPCA adequately responds the USEPA's concerns before the end of the 30-day comment period, USEPA intends to proceed with a direct final approval of the submittal. If, however, the concerns are not adequately addressed before that time, USEPA will finalize the disapproval. The direct final rulemaking would provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the final rulemaking action. DATES: Comments on this requested revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the SIP revision request and USEPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Randy Robinson at 312 353&hyph;6713, before visiting the Region 5 office.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Written comments should be sent to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On December 11, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The seven-county metropolitan area (AQCR 131) has been designated, by the USEPA, as nonattainment for SO 2 (40 C.F.R. 81.324). The submittal is intended to demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO 2 in AQCR 131 for the area surrounding the Ashland Petroleum Company. The remainder of the area (Dakota County/Pine Bend and the rest of the Twin Cities) is being addressed in separate rulemakings. Background The USEPA published the designation of AQCR 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO 2 on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). The MPCA submitted a final SO 2 plan on August 4, 1980. USEPA published its final rule approving and promulgating the Minnesota Part D SIP for SO 2 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20997). The MPCA submitted a request for redesignation to attainment of AQCR 131, except for the Pine Bend area of Dakota County, on September 2, 1983. The redesignation request included permits for several facilities, as well as, monitoring data and dispersion modeling intended to support the request. The USEPA requested several revisions to the permits and compliance data included in the 1983 submittal. In addition, the Stack Height Rule promulgated on July 8, 1985, required the State to review all existing emission limitations to determine whether any of these limitations had been affected by stack height credit above Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack height or by other dispersion techniques. As a result of this review, MPCA determined that Ashland Petroleum Company (in addition to NSP-Riverside, and Koch Refining Company-Pine Bend) would require additional permit revisions due to modeled violations using the reduced creditable stack heights. Given the numerous changes which had occurred since the original redesignation request was submitted in 1983, the submittal was withdrawn by the MPCA. A new SIP revision for Ashland Refining Company was submitted on June 30, 1987. A SIP revision and redesignation request for the remainder of AQCR 131, excluding the Pine Bend area of Dakota County, was submitted by the MPCA on September 10, 1987. The MPCA later withdrew the June 30, 1987, SIP revision because Ashland Refining Company could not meet one of the emission limits listed in the permit. On December 11, 1992, the MPCA submitted a SIP revision for SO 2 for the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of AQCR 131. The submittal includes an Administrative Order for Ashland Petroleum Company_St. Paul Park Refinery, in addition to dispersion modeling and technical support intended to show that the limits in the Administrative Order are sufficient to attain the NAAQS for SO 2 in the AQCR 131 nonattainment area near Ashland Petroleum Company. II. Attainment Demonstration Review This section will provide a general description of the State submittal followed by USEPA's review of the attainment demonstration, including modeling specifics of the Administrative Order for the Ashland Petroleum Company. A more detailed description of the Administrative Order and the attainment demonstration is included in the technical support document associated with this action. Description of State Emission Inventory The emission units at the Ashland Refining Company_St. Paul Park facility that discharge sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere are: three process steam boilers, 27 process heaters, one fluidized catalytic cracker regenerator, two sulfur recovery units with a common Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) tailgas unit, two diesel generators and heater decoking operations. Specific emission limits and operating limits are listed in the administrative order for these sources. In addition, sulfur control limits are applied to the diesel fuel and hydrogen sulfide limits are applied to the refinery gas. Compliance with the emission limitations and operating restrictions shall be demonstrated through the combined use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) designed to measure SO 2 emissions, continuous monitoring systems (CMS) that record fuel flowrate, and hydrogen sulfide content, and regular fuel analysis and supplier certification to determine the sulfur content and heating value of the fuel oil and diesel fuel. A stack test will be used to determine initial compliance at Emission Point 15 (SRU's and SCOT, and boilers 4 & 6). It has been determined, based on guidance in the ``General Preamble for Future Proposed Rulemakings,'' published in the Federal Register on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that the compliance methods listed above provide for continuous compliance monitoring. Description of State General Modeling Methodology The modeling techniques used in the demonstration are based on the modeling guidelines in place at the time the analyses were performed (i.e., ``Guideline on Air Quality Models, (Revised),'' July 1986, including ``Supplement A,'' July 1987). Model The dispersion modeling conducted for this demonstration was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term (ISCST) model (version 90346) for calculation of the 24-hour, 3-hour, and annual concentrations. The model was run using the regulatory default option and urban mode 3 (McElroy-Pooler) dispersion coefficients. Although a land use analysis around Ashland Refining Company would classify the area as rural, urban dispersion coefficients were applied based on the results of a preliminary model/monitor comparison study which indicated that the available rural models underpredict ambient concentrations. To assure attainment, MPCA found it necessary to apply the more conservative urban dispersion coefficients. The State did not use the most recent version of the Industrial Source Complex model, known as ISC2. The MPCA had completed the modeling to determine appropriate SIP limits before the ISC2 model was released. Therefore, based on USEPA guidance concerning grandfathering in the January 2, 1985, memorandum from Joseph A. Tikvart, Chief, Source Receptor Analysis Branch, to the Regional Modeling Contacts, the use of the ISCS2 version 90346 model is acceptable for this particular submittal. Future modeling of the AQCR 131 area will need to be conducted using the ISC2 model.
