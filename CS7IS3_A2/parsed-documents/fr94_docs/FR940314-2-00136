Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to these standards.

Applicants' compliance standards will also require all investors eligible to purchase an Indirect Investor Class of shares of a money market series offering such shares, to invest in an Indirect Investor Class of shares of such money market series. 14.
