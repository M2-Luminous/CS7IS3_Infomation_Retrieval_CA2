All the nitty-gritty of 17 rounds of Sino-British talks over eight months ending with barriers lowered on 30 June, 1997. No more through train, no smooth transition, perhaps no replacement airport until after the transfer of sovereignty, no new container port, no new highways into southern China, no recognition by the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] of any contracts or international loans going beyond 1997. All the details contained in 36 pages entitled Representative Government in Hong Kong, otherwise known as the White Paper on how the talks went. A few points need to be stressed at the outset. Firstly, this is a British version of the talks. As such it is intended to serve British interests. Beijing has given notice that it will respond by publishing its own version. No doubt it will serve Chinese interests. Secondly, by going public the British side has cast away the key to a reopening of the negotiations. Of course, the blame has been put on China: the People's Daily went public with a detailed version of the 17 rounds last month. But, no doubt, Beijing had read an equally authoritative blow-by-blow version in London's Financial Times weeks earlier. So much for confidentiality--both sides have been leaking like mad while trying to keep Hong Kong people in the dark. Thirdly, this document is not all that it is made out to be. On the matter of functional constituencies, for instance, we are told the British were prepared to compromise. But we are not told what those initiatives were. That is just one example of details the British regard as unimportant for Hong Kong people. Finally, how credible is this paper? The answer appears to lie in omissions and in details which have been glossed over. Before the negotiations began and at the outset of the talks China had insisted on one condition: that there be no unilateral action on political reforms if the talks broke down. The whole world now knows that the original proposals are being pushed through the Legislative Council and the contents of the talks, at least the British side of it, are on display in this dreary and repetitive document. We know from the Chinese side that the British at one point proposed a functional constituency for civil servants. This has been omitted. What else is hidden from Hong Kong people? It would also appear that the issue of appointed members to the district boards and municipal councils was more crucial than was made out to be [as published] by the British while the negotiations were going on. It now appears to have been a major obstacle. That Britain also wanted a say in the affairs of the future HKSAR government is irrefutable. What other construction is one to put on the admission that Britain wanted China to accept an agreed formula for the composition of the Election Committee as "the same model for the future selection and election committees for chief executives"? [sentence as published] China has long maintained that Britain has been manoeuvring to retain its influence, if not its power over Hong Kong after 1997. The document now confirms this. It does not serve the interests of Hong Kong and its people to dwell on the past. The talks are over, there is no way to reopen them. What matters now is the future. As we move towards 1997 the British will become more irrelevant with each passing day. We must learn to take the long-term view and plan accordingly.
