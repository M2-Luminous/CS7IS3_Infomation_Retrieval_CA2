Spero, who is currently visiting Japan, gave an interview in Tokyo on 12 January. Touching on the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Spero stated: "No progress has been noted in the talks on different sectors. It seems that there are situations in which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be asked to handle issues on the basis of his political responsibility." In this way, Spero disclosed her expectation that Prime Minister Hosokawa would make political decisions on the final settlement of various issues in such priority sectors as automobiles and auto parts, government procurement, and insurance, over which the two countries are currently locked in tough negotiations.
