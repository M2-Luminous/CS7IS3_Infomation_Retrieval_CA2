[[Unidentified interviewer] Good afternoon minister. What consequences may the Manila conference -- namely the Indonesian pressure -- have on the talks between the Portuguese and the Indonesian Governments? [Durao Barroso] Good afternoon. First, the consequences of the Manila conference, up to now, have been to draw the attention of the entire international community to the question of East Timor. I am very happy indeed with this development. The whole of the international press is highlighting Indonesia's high-handed attitude toward the Philippines. The big international TV networks too have been drawing attention to this. So I regard the overall fruits of this conference as positive and even encouraging. It is altogether the opposite result to that sought by the Indonesian authorities with their high-handedness towards the Government of the Philippines. As for the talks, I believe these events will obviously weaken the Indonesian position, because Indonesia cannot tell the UN secretary general that it wants to set up confidence-building measures and, at the same time, adopt attitudes that really reveal its true nature, that of a country that not only does not respect democratic values within its own territory but also does not want other countries in the region to be free to apply their own democratic principles. [Interviewer] What do you think will be the practical consequences of all this on the next round of talks? Will Portugal step back? [Durao Barroso] No, I cannot tell you that because I cannot foretell the future. The next round of talks will be as far away as January of next year. What I believe is that these events will considerably weaken the Indonesian position and this will be an encouragement for all those -- the Portuguese Government included -- who continue to believe that there is a possibility of reaching a solution, in accordance with the international law, for the East Timor question. [Interviewer] It is exactly three years today since the Bicesse [Angolan peace] agreement was signed. Do you think it was a worthwhile exercise? [Durao Barroso] It believe it is always worthwhile when you are trying to work toward peace. The truth of the matter is that, thanks to Bicesse, the Angolans managed to experience peace -- even if only for a short while -- as well as a democratic process and elections the results of which unfortunately were not respected. A war was then resumed that the Angolan people have so far not managed to get rid of. The truth of the matter is that the effort made by Portugal, by the observers and the international community, was a legitimate one, it was worthwhile and is within the context of those talks that the sides are now looking to the principles subscribed to in Bicesse to provide a model for national reconciliation so that peace may again become a reality in Angola. [Interviewer] You were in Morocco today when the prime minister asked King Hassan II for help. What sort of help can the Moroccan king lend to this process between the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola and the Angolan Government? [Durao Barroso] What the prime minister stated -- as you said, it is true that I was next to the prime minister -- was that any influence by King Hassan II can indeed be useful to lead the sides to reach a compromise. The link between Morocco and the Angolan process is widely known and within the framework established by the United Nations -- the UN mediation with the support of observers -- any push, any support from personalities with international recognition, such as King Hassan II, will indeed be positive for the process. [Interviewer] Now for a final question. France and Germany are getting ready to take to the European Council a joint French-German joint presidency proposal to start on 1 July. Are you not afraid of a one-year presidency by these two European powers? [Durao Barroso] We are not afraid at all. On the contrary, I believe that one of the great victories of the European Union over these years was that it has managed to end with the wars between Germany and France. Let me remind you that we are just at this time commemorating the anniversary of D day, which contributed toward putting an end to World War II. Nowadays we tend to forget that, my generation did not live through it. The truth of the matter is that, up to a few years ago, Europe was always being devastated by wars among European countries and therefore it is a great European victory for France and Germany -- for all European countries -- to make it practically unviable and impossible nowadays for anyone to even imagine a new war in western Europe. Therefore I am happy with any kind of collaboration among European states. It is obvious that this does not mean that we will ever accept any kind of European directorate. Neither we nor other countries will accept the idea that there are two, three, or four European countries that by virtue of their size will impose their will upon others. I know that is not the wish of either France or Germany -- both of whom have from the outset done much for the construction of the European Community and European Union. We are both available to collaborate both with the Germans and the French because I am sure they will be a very strong stimulus for the progress of the European Union. [Interviewer] Thank you very much, minister. That was Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso, speaking to us live.
