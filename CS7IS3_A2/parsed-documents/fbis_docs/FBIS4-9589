The first Serbian rebellion against civilization, as publicist Milomir Maric beautifully described the absurdity of the current implementation of the Serbian national program, has had many predecessors, ideologues, and executors. Let us start with Olga Lukovic-Pjanovic, author of the book The Serbs: The Oldest People, who stated that Jesus Christ was a Serb and that all the European peoples were derived from Serbs. The painter Milic of Macva stole the discovery of the Sorabs as the ancestral people from the above-mentioned author, and he himself "ascertained" that the Serbs were the center of the world--territorially, linguistically, and by destiny. Among the older authors, Dr. Milovan Grba, in 1920, published a discussion of the Serbs as a special race that differed from others. Vuk Karadzic was also surprised that "the Croats do not want to be Serbs, just because of Roman law and the Catholic religion." Geographer Jovan Cvijic thought that the Croats are "only an appendage of the Serbian people." Maric follows that the red thread of Greater-Serbian nationalism goes from the "plans" of Ilija Garasanin, through the partially fulfilled plan of Vasa Cubrilovic for resettling Albanians from Kosovo to Turkey, to the Serbian Academy of Science and Art memorandum. Since the moment when that notorious program was proclaimed their own by the victors at the eighth session and by the SPS [Serbian Socialist Party] party and state apparatus, the war for territory began. The implementation of the program has been taken over by the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] and the new "Serbian defenders." Let us look at how General Mladic spoke out. "During the war I broke down as a Communist and a Yugoslav, and I became the biggest Serb. It is only a question of time when I will liberate the Serbian city of Zadar, which the traitorous supreme command of the JNA already prevented me from doing some time ago. Trieste is also an old Serbian city, which will fall into our hands once again. The Serbian army will end the war at the Trieste-Vienna line, like the previous two as well." The justifiably celebrated Dr. Vojislav Seselj, in contrast to Mladic, would satisfy himself with a western border on the Karlobeg-Virovitica line. When the United States threatened to bomb bridges and airports in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], a joke arose precisely on that subject, according to which Zemun and New Belgrade, in the future, will be named Karlobag and Virovitica. Zeljko "Arkan" Raznjatovic, still one of the tiresomely large number of candidates for the title of the most important Serb, is promising that Jasenovac will not be repeated. "We will no longer be sheep, but rather wolves, or even better, tigers. The blood of Obilic, which does not permit me to possess a house, flows through my veins. With the aid of all our enemies, a Greater Albania in Serbian Kosovo, a Greater Croatia in the Serbian Krajina, and a Greater Bulgaria in Serbian Macedonia are appearing before our very eyes. The Muslims, who are actually Serbian martyrs who are not aware that they are Serbs, have become vampires in Bosnia. Zadar, Sibenik, Dubrovnik, and Split are Serbian cities, where the Catholics moved in by force, and it is high time for us to drive them away from there. We are fighting to restore the borders of the former Yugoslavia, up to Sezana, since those are the Serbian borders. Slovenia will be Serbian Slovenia again, Croatia will be Serbian Croatia, Bosnia will be Serbian Bosnia, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will be Serbian Macedonia again. Slovenia is Serbian because I was born in it, and because the Slovenes had sex with our enemies the Ustase. That is why my battle cry is `F... their mothers and fathers!'" The fact that Arkan has supporters on whom he can rely is also confirmed by a statement by his "Colonel" Mile Ulemek, who, in his cafe in Pazova, strictly forbids serving non-Serbs. It follows from his geopolitical views that "the Croats received a lot of money from abroad in order to do a dirty job on the Serbs." "Since they have not done it yet, they will have to engage in conflict again. They will also try to involve the Hungarians in their work. Then there will also be an explosion in Kosovo. We are just waiting for it! The Albanians are fortunately concentrated in one city, so we will be able to flatten them with the air force in just three hours. Only then will there be a final settling of accounts in Serbia itself. The hungry will attack the rich, who have enriched themselves disgracefully in this war at the expense of the populace. Of course, Arkan and I will defend the exhausted Serbs. We will fight against the rich on the side of the poor until we subjugate Belgrade, the last nest of traitors in the heart of Serbia." The most serious candidate for the most important Serbian woman is Dr. Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of Srpska. Her racist statements, especially the claim that it would even be worthwhile to sacrifice 6 million Serbs to establish a unified state, in fact, have even been condemned by Milosevic. In view of its life to date and some recent actions, we can justifiably suspect the ethnic purity of "her" state. In the "world conspiracy" against the "celestial Serbs," only the Greeks and the Russians have proven to be friends, and from time to time it has also been possible to observe signs of Serbian-Jewish friendship. The news that they are preparing to issue the notorious "Protocol of the Elders of Zion" indicates that the paranoia about the world conspiracy is approaching its logical conclusion--anti-Semitism. Does that mean that there has been a lack of claims and evidence about genocide against Albanians, Croats, and Muslims, and that the hostility toward Macedonians, Hungarians, and Slovenes is melting away? Is it only a question of introducing new melodies on the Serbian political scene that are compatible with the new orientation on the Russian political scene? With Mladic's help, Dr. Radovan Karadzic has gone furthest in carrying out the plan. In order to fulfill Karadjordje's dream, which in Karadzic's opinion is of divine origin, and erase the border on the Drina, the Sarajevo psychiatrist has used all means available. Whether all means will also be permitted in carrying out the Serbian plan for the unification of all Serbs into a single state, however, does not depend solely on the Serbs, although in various stages of its development and implementation it has already been supported by almost all the political parties, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Academy of Science and Art, almost the entire intellectual "elite," and the vast majority of Serbian protesters and citizens inside Serbia, and even more outside it. Now others, primarily the great powers, are deciding on the Serbian national program. It will be shown in the very near future whether conclusive action will prevail over verbal support for the generally accepted principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Declaration. The assertion that this moment is the decisive one is also supported by the new mobilization of the Greater-Serbian intellectual elite. A second congress of Serbian intellectuals has been scheduled for the second half of April, at which they are to discuss the Serbian people's right to self-determination and to life in a common state. The meeting has been envisioned as "patriotic resistance to the demonization that has encircled us and is encircling us on all sides." Milosevic, however, is allowing all the above-mentioned people to work for him, while he himself is preparing for various results of the implementation of the Serbian national program. If the international situation allows him, he will, of course, assume the laurels of the unifier of all the Serbian states. Since he would rather have power than citizens, we can believe that with respect to his noticeably more peace-loving and calmer statements, he will certainly not sign anything that could later be used against him, while he is also preparing for other--less comfortable--possibilities.
