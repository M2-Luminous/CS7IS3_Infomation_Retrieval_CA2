FBIS4-54774 "dreeu087__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-087-A Daily Report 4 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic CTK Reports Hurd Comments on Visegrad, EU CTK Reports Hurd Comments on Visegrad, EU AU0405203094 Prague CTK in English 1938 GMT 4 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0405203094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] London, May 4 (CTK) -- Central European states' "cooperation with other countries -- be they Visegrad partners or elsewhere in the region -- remains a useful preparation for the discipline of eventual membership (of the European Union [EU])," British Secretary of State Douglas Hurd told CTK today. However, it is "quite possible -- perhaps even likely -- that different members of the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) will fulfil the political and economic conditions for EU membership at different times," Hurd said in an interview with CTK before his visit to Prague next week. "Appllications from individual Central European countries will be judged on their own merits by the member states," he added. Hurd said "the main task for the Czech Republic is that of adjusting its legislation and administrative rules to European standards so that it will be able to play full part in the single market." Asked about EU trade restrictions of the imports of the goods that the Central Europeans produce most efficiently, Hurd stated that "politicians must be prepared to act if (Western) markets are to be kept open" for the goods from Central and Eastern Europe. "That is why the United Kingdom has consistently opposed proposals for measures restricting trade to the Czech Republic unless they have a clear economic justification," Hurd said. As for the Czech Republic's membership of NATO, about which Russia has had reservations, Hurd said it was "important to bring home to the Russians that integrating the countries of Central Europe into Western institutions will enhance regional stability -- which is in the interest of us all." He said he welcomed and considered still valid the statement made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visits to Warsaw and Prague last August, that "it is the sovereign right of every nation to decide to which alliances it belongs." Hurd pointed out that the Czech-British relationship was "very close" now, and mentioned the Czech and Slovak servicemen who had fallen in defending freedom during the Second World War.
