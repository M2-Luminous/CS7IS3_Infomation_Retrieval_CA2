Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in today's proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA (ICR # 1699.01) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W. (2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public record keeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 4.7 hours per response annually, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the required data, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2236, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. X. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine whether small entities will be affected by the regulation. If affected small entities are identified, regulatory alternatives must be considered to mitigate the potential impacts. Small entities as described in the Act are only those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.'' The only entities directly subject to today's proposed rule are small and large quantity generators of spent mercury containing lamps (conditionally exempt small quantity generators are not directly subject to today's proposed rule). In order to meet the definition of a regulated entity under today's rule, a generator must produce over 100 kg of spent lamps (350 four foot fluorescent lamps) in a given month. It is conceivable that some of these generators would meet the definition of ``small business'' as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (i.e. mid-sized firms that group relamp and generate in excess of 346 spent fluorescent lamps in a given month); however the Agency does not have an estimate of the number of such ``small entities.'' However, both of the proposed options are expected to result in net savings to the regulated entities. Option 1, excluding mercury containing lamps from Subtitle C management standards, is estimated to result in per generator savings of between $2,000 and $2,250 annually. Option 2, managing spent lamps under a special collection system is estimated to result in an average annual per generator savings of approximately $300. Thus, since generator impacts are positive for both options, EPA has determined that small regulated entities will not be adversely impacted, and thus, no ``mitigating'' options are being analyzed in this section. Hence, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), ``the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of entities.''
