Based on the struggle of our brave and resourceful scouts -- who uncovered a spy network that had lain low for 40 years and who frustrated the "Emperor's Sister Plan," according to which enemy spies sneaked into China to steal secret information under the command of the "intelligence king" -- the teleplay vividly reproduces the soul-stirring fight between China's national security organs and hostile forces outside its borders since the reform and opening-up policy were introduced, through a true story and complicated plots. The teleplay was conducted by well-known conductors Ding Yinnan, Zhao Wenxin, and Ma Zhongyi, and was written by Ma.
