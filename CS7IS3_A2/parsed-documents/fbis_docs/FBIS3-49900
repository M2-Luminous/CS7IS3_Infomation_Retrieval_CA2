Reporters were addressed by Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO]; Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New Democracy; and Vesna Pesic, president of the Citizens' Alliance. Dragoljub Stankic has the details. SPO President Vuk Draskovic immediately stressed Depos's position that there was no civil, state, or national interest more important than preventing poverty, hunger, mega-inflation, and the criminal hoarding of wealth. [Begin Draskovic recording] Therefore, any program that secures the realization of these goals, in the government, the assembly, and in the public, will have Depos's full support. [end recording] However, Draskovic later stressed that not every program could count on such support, particularly not the Federal Government's and Professor Dragoslav Avramovic's latest program. According to Draskovic, a good program requires certain prerequisites: lifting of the sanctions, an end to the war, the deblocking of assets abroad, and international financial support. Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New Democracy, stressed that Depos would not support a Socialist government, nor would it be a part of it. He expects the opposition to be given the post of assembly chairman.
