FR941213-2-00010 FR941213-2-00005 2. Absence of De Facto Control The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether a respondent is subject to de facto government control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by, or subject to the approval of, a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide). In response to our questionnaire, COTCO, GLIP, and Gao Yao have each asserted that they: •Are able to borrow at market rates from commercial banks; •Maintain their own bank accounts, including foreign exchange earnings; •Are not restricted in their access to their bank accounts; •Operate at a profit; •Make independent business decisions, including what to export; •Set their own prices independently and that the prices are not subject to review by trading companies or government authorities; •Base their relationships with suppliers and customers on arm's length negotiations without governmental interference; •Are not subject to foreign exchange targets set by either the central or provincial governments; •Have the ability to sell, transfer, or acquire assets; Exporter-Specific Information: The following is a summary of additional information provided by the exporters: Gao Yao has stated that: •It is a Sino-Hong Kong 50&hyph;50 joint venture; •It has no legal relationship with either the local, regional and/or national government; •It maintains a bank account in Hong Kong where all monies received from Gao Yao's foreign sales are deposited and that the allocation of foreign currency is not subject to governmental review or approval; •Chinese joint venture and other laws confirm Gao Yao's independence (Gao Yao submitted an exhibit consisting of laws pertaining to Sino-Foreign joint ventures in its response); •Management is selected by the board of directors, without any governmental interference; •Profits are divided evenly between the joint venture partners according to the shares invested; •The managing director of Gao Yao is a Hong Kong resident; and •All contracts are negotiated and signed by the officials of Gao Yao's Hong Kong sales office. GLIP has stated that: •Management is selected by its board of directors; •Current ownership of the company is by ``all the people.'' The company received authorization to privatize on March 5, 1993, and ``is in the process of totally privatizing;'' and •It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response as an exhibit). COTCO has stated that: •It is a limited liability company, owned by COTCO Beijing, which, in turn, is an ``all the people'' company; •It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response as an exhibit); •Its manager is hired following a public notice of vacancy, screening, and hiring negotiations; the manager then selects the company's management committee; the decisions regarding the selection and promotion of management are not subject to any entity's review or approval. The information submitted on behalf of each of the three companies supports a preliminary finding that there is a de facto absence of governmental control of export functions of each of the three companies. Consequently, COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported by verifiable documentation.
