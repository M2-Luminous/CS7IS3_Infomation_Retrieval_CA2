During the symposiums, a group of over 100 government officials and entrepreneurs from China's 20 provinces and municipalities will hold talks with their Australian partners on 519 investment projects they brought with. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that the projects, totalling seven billion U.S. dollars, include those of agriculture, communications, electronics, building materials, petrochemistry and service sectors. The talks will be the largest of its kind China has yet held in Australia. The delegation, to be headed by MOFTEC's Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang, will also give Australian entrepreneurs and businessmen a systematic introduction on China's current economic reform, investment climate, Chinese laws and rules concerning the protection of foreign investment, the MOFTEC official said. Since 1972 when diplomatic ties were established between China and Australia, bilateral trade has seen a constant development, the official said. Statistics show that trade volume between China and Australia in 1993 hit a record high of three billion U.S. dollars, among which China's import was 1.94 billion U.S. dollars and its export was 1.06 billion U.S. dollars. According to the official, for the sake of its construction, China needs to import various raw materials and advanced technologies in production, processing, storage and transportation of grain, in telecommunications, mining, metallurgy as well as in port construction. China spent 485 million U.S. dollars last year importing 17.06 million tons of iron ore, 440 million U.S. dollars importing 130,000 tons of wool and over 100 million U.S. dollars importing 1.09 million tons of grain. During the same time, China exported 335 million U.S. dollars of clothing and 135 million U.S. dollars of textile products to Australia, and its export volume of machinery and electronic products to Australia reached 243 million U.S. dollars last year. Meanwhile, economic cooperation between the two countries has also seen marked progress, the official said. By the end of last year, China had set up 134 trade institutions and enterprises in Australia with a contractual investment totalling 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, among which some one-fourth was to be funded by the Chinese side. And Australia has become one of the countries China has so far invested most. On the other hand, among all the countries and regions in the world, Australia is the 9th largest investor in China. By the end of 1993, australia had set up 1,310 projects in China with a contractual investment of 1.245 billion U.S. dollars, among which 338 million U.S. dollars had been actually put into use. Therefore, the MOFTEC official said, Chinese and Australian economies are much mutually complementary and the prospect for their cooperation is broad. The upcoming symposiums and talks will provide more opportunities for further cooperation in industrial and commercial circles between the two countries, the official said.
