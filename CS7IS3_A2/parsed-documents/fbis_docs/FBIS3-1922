How do we evaluate this struggle? How will the future anticorruption work be conducted? Bringing along reflections on these issues as well as the high expectations of the people, responsible persons from the discipline inspection departments of various party and government organs at the central as well as local levels gathered in Beijing to discuss the situation and problems. People have a consensus that the anticorruption struggle must be deepened to serve reform, development, and stability. [passage omitted] New Attempt, New Review Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection [CCDI] Wei Jianxing said at the opening ceremony of its third plenary session: "This anticorruption struggle is not only a tempering for party and government cadres at all levels and the vast contingent of cadres of our discipline inspection and supervisory organs, but also a new attempt to combat negative and corrupt phenomena under the new circumstances." At the meeting, comrades in charge of discipline inspection and supervision from relevant departments in 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as organs under the party Central Committee and the central government gave briefings on their measures in unfolding the anticorruption struggle. Through these measures, experiences were accumulated for waging a deep-going anticorruption struggle in the next stage. [passage omitted] A Deep-Going, Sustained, and Effective Way Holds the Key How do we carry out anti-corruption work in 1994, a year in which the most reform measures yet will be formulated? This is the issue most frequently pondered by discipline inspection and supervisory cadres. CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing pointed out clearly that under the new circumstances, discipline inspection and supervisory organs should unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic principle of "fostering both material as well as cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to both," resolutely combat corruption in a down-to-earth manner, and strengthen the building of party work style and clean administration to provide conditions and guarantee the proper implementation of various reform measures; the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of economic construction; as well as political and social stability. Over the last few days, the 103 CCDI members attending the plenary session earnestly discussed General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Wei Jianxing's work report to the meeting, holding that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech and the work report given by Comrade Wei Jianxing on the CCDI Standing Committee's behalf conformed to reality and would serve as a guide for waging a deep-going, sustained, and effective anticorruption struggle in the next stage. During their discussion, CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin pointed out: To conduct the anticorruption struggle in a deep-going, sustained, and effective manner, first, we should consolidate the achievements of struggle in the previous stage and keep up the good work until the end; second, earnestly carry out the various work arranged at this meeting in a down-to-earth manner; and, third, persist in fighting corruption throughout the entire process of reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic construction. In addition, he pointed out: In taking charge of the anticorruption struggle, it is necessary to heedfully guard against two one-sided understandings: one being the belief that "the anticorruption campaign has already been carried out quite adequately", which leads to complacency about the achievements in the previous stage; the other being the attitude of focusing excessive expectations and efforts on a single operation so much so that interim objectives and achievements are neglected. [passage omitted] The establishment and improvement of an effective mechanism for supervision and restriction is a hot topic discussed by many delegates. CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing stressed: In waging an anticorruption struggle, we must effect a permanent cure besides taking stopgap measures, and should strengthen regular education on party work style and clean administration among party members and cadres to gradually form a system. It is necessary to accelerate legislation for rectifying party work style and strengthening the building of a clean administration and to gradually establish and improve a code of conduct for party workers and state functionaries. It is especially necessary to establish a mechanism of supervision and restriction at law enforcement departments and positions directly in charge of personnel, property, and material to guard against the abuse of official power for personal gain. CCDI Standing Committee member Fu Jie believes that it is necessary to persistently bring the interim results into line with the protracted nature of the anticorruption struggle to effect a permanent cure while solving its current problems, as the struggle is a long-term task. In effecting a permanent cure, we would have to rely on rule by law and education.
