However, the question on mineral resources in the contentious area won't be included in the joint efforts at the moment since it might only create friction between the two countries, he said. The Philippines and China both lay claim to the islands in the South China Sea along with Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia. The islands are believed sitting atop rich resources of oil and minerals. They are also considered an important sea lane. The joint efforts between Manila and Beijing are expected to start next year as soon as internal consultations among government agencies concerned begin. Mr. Severino was likewise informed by the Chinese delegation, headed by Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Yingfang, that Beijing prefers to deal with the South China Sea issue on a bilateral level, although they are also open to discussing the issue with more than two claimants. On the issue of Hong Kong reverting back to China, Mr. Wang assured government the status of Filipino workers and local companies in the British colony will not be affected by the time the island reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. "This is in line with the fact that the social system will not change, even after the transfer of sovereignty. They don't even have objections to the extradition treaty we had initialed with Hong Kong. They said it will remain valid as long as China is consulted even after 1997," Mr. Severino said. The two sides also discussed the need for more political consultations between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, particularly on regional security issues. Although the One China Policy was tackled, Mr. Severino declined to give further details on what the two panels discussed. He said he assured Beijing that Manila will continue to adhere to the One China Policy.
