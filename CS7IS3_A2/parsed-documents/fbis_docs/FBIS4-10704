In a communique sent to the media, EZLN leader "Subcommander Marcos" indicated that the EZLN has no military position at all or troops in the area where the attack took place. Unidentified persons early Friday morning attacked an Army post in the town of Chicoasen, some 8 km from the Chiapas State capital, in which a sergeant was killed. "The EZLN does not have good weapons or sufficient vehicles, but it does have military honor and its word; the EZLN promised, if it is not attacked, not to carry out offensive military operations against federal troops or their positions," the communique stated. The rebel group reiterated its commitment to respect the cease-fire and promised not to carry out offensive military actions against government forces in the entire national territory under the conditions set forth on 12 January when the truce was accepted. Marcos reiterated the guerrillas' commitment to continue working for a dialogue in search of peace with justice and dignity. He added that the EZLN is waiting for the reestablishment of the proper conditions to resume the dialogue with the government. The EZLN rose up in arms on 1 January to demand social justice for the Indians, and their clashes with the government forces lasted until 12 January, when a cease-fire was decreed by both sides.
