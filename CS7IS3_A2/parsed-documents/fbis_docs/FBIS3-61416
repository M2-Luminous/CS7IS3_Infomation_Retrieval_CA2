The studies were performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 11 weight percent tin and 2 weight percent gallium after homogenization at 700�C for 20 hours, as well as on a single filament of Nb/Cu plus 11 weight percent tin and 2 weight percent gallium after hot compaction and on a composite consisting of 7,225 filaments of the same composite that had been subjected to diffusion annealing at 700�C for 72 hours. The study specimens were examined under a JEM-200 CX transmission electron microscope and JCXA-733 scanning electron microscope/microanalyzer. The addition of gallium to the study composites was demonstrated to cause an increase in the number of twins and _e_-phase formations in the bronze matrix due to a decrease in packing defect formation energy. During the course of diffusion annealing, the gallium diffused into the Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer and was partially preserved in the bronze matrix. Gallium was also found to increase the grain size in the superconducting layer and to not facilitate any increase in its thickness. The dissolution of gallium in Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn in large quantity during the course of diffusion annealing was found to result in an increase in the electrical resistance of the said phase in its normal state and, consequently, in an elevation of the upper critical field. This result is in turn associated with the higher current-conducting capability of gallium-alloyed conductors in high magnetic fields versus that of their nonalloyed counterparts.
