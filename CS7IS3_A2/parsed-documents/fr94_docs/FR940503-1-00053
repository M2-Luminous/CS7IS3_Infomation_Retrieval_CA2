ACTION: Notice of proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule sets forth criteria and procedures for the granting of awards as authorized by an amendment to the Clean Air Act (the Act). The amendments added section 113(f) to the Act, which authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency discretion to pay an award, not to exceed $10,000, to any person who furnishes information or services which lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty enforced under section 113 of the Act for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, as amended. Section 113(f) also authorizes the Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility for such an award. This proposed rule sets forth such additional criteria for eligibility. In addition, this proposal establishes procedures to petition the Agency for consideration for an award, including what information must be submitted in such petitions, and describes award criteria. This proposed rule also provides an assurance of confidentiality as to the identity of persons who provide information or services on a confidential basis. Furthermore, to implement the goal of the program, this rule provides direction for providing information or services regarding potential violations. DATES: Comments. Written comments on the proposed rule must be received on or before July 5, 1994. Public Hearing. A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed rule. If anyone contacts EPA requesting to speak at a public hearing by June 6, 1994, a public hearing will be held June 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Statutory Requirements Section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7413(f), authorizes the Administrator discretion to pay awards to persons who provide information or services regarding potential violations of the Act. Pursuant to section 113(f), the information or services must result in a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, enforced under section 113 of the Act, before an award may be issued. The statute specifically authorizes awards only for enforcement actions brought under section 113 of the Act. Thus, information or services which assist actions brought under State law (e.g, enforcement of SIPs under State law or citizen suits brought under State law), under other sections of the Act (i.e., citizen suits under section 304), or under other statutes, do not qualify for an award under this provision. However, in cases where the Agency intervenes, overfiles, or otherwise takes over the enforcement action under the authority of section 113, the awards authority may become applicable.
