The People's Assembly, which was designed to radically transform the republic's legislative power, has been already formed: This name was assumed by the republican parliament under a decision taken by its session. Official elections to the People's Assembly will be held after Karachayevo-Cherkessiya passes its constitution. It is to be drafted by the National Council and then submitted for the people's discussion. The same decision by the parliament made unnecessary a republican referendum also scheduled for Sunday. Put to people's vote was the question about the need for presidency in Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. When passed, the constitution will solve this problem. Primarily, the decision to hold elections to the People's Assembly and a referendum in the republic was taken by the republican parliament last year. But then it was revised at the initiative of the republic's major political parties and mass movements which decided that it would be difficult to build truly effective bodies of government without a constitution.
