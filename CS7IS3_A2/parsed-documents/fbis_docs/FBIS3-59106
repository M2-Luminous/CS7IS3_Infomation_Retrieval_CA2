The suspicion that they had arms with them was substantiated when their two buses were searched. A total of six hand grenades and one pistol were found. By evening, 67 UN soldiers could continue their journey home; three others are still being interrogated. Inquiries so far have led to the conclusion that the three soldiers probably took the weapons with them only as "souvenirs" of their mission in the former Yugoslavia.
