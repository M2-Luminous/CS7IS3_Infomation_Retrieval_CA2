"The prime minister must take responsible action and live up to the words he has uttered so explicitly," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a lecture delivered in Tokyo. On the issue of tax policy, Kono said the government "cannot take a sweeping political decision without the cooperation of the LDP, but we are reluctant to extend support since the government is so indecisive." Kono was apparently referring to the ruling coalition leaders' decision last Friday to rescind Hosokawa's plan to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut this year with the imposition of a 7 percent indirect levy on most goods and services sold in Japan, starting in 1997. "When the coalition cabinet was inaugurated, Hosokawa used to say he will formulate policies from the standpoint of ordinary people. Where is his standpoint at this moment?" he asked.
