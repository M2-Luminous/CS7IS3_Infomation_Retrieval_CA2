Availability of NPRM's Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;230, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3484. Communications must identify NPRM 93&hyph;71A. Background On July 14, 1993, the FAA issued NPRM 93&hyph;71 (58 FR 38028), and the comment period closed November 12, 1993. The NPRM proposed to amend the airworthiness standards for commuter category airplanes by upgrading the seat restraint and seat cushion flammability requirements. On September 17, 1993, GAMA requested the FAA withdraw the proposal until additional supporting documentation was made available to the public. By letter dated October 4, 1993, the Joint Aviation Authority requested that the comment period be extended to enable the JAA Study Group additional time to review the proposal and prepare a recommendation. The FAA received an additional report on commuter airplane accident data analysis in October 1994. This report is the additional information that GAMA requested be available before the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was made available to the public for comment. Conclusion In view of the possibility of obtaining additional technical information and to provide for a more consistent set of airworthiness standards, the FAA agrees that it would be in the public's best interest to reopen the comment period.
