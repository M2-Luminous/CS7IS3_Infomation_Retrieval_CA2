Kamenev, cand tech sci, and Capt 1st Rank (Ret) A. Votyakov, cand tech sci, docent: "Seismic Mine Firing Mechanisms"] [Text] Many countries of the world--the USA, Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and others--are undertaking significant efforts to improve mine weapons because, in the opinion of specialists, mobility, covertness of their placement, selectivity of destruction and the possibility of a prolonged effect upon the enemy during war raises them to the rank of strategic weapons. Mines are also viewed as a variant of psychological and economic weapons, finding wide use in naval operations and local conflicts. The navies of many countries possess a substantial arsenal of mines and a sufficient number of carriers for their mass use, beginning with shallow coastal and ending with deep remote regions of the world ocean. Recently, the "countenance" of mine weapons changed significantly in connection with use of the latest advances in science and technology. Microprocessor technology, capable of quickly analyzing and processing a large volume of information, has come to be used extensively in mine initiation, targeting and detonation systems. Progress in development of such systems also made it possible to put nontraditional fields to work, ones which had not been utilized earlier to create proximity firing mechanisms for mines. Being a material body, a ship is known to be the carrier of a number of physical fields (magnetic, acoustic, hydrodynamic, seismic and so on). By its presence it unavoidably creates certain distortions in most natural physical fields, to which proximity systems of mine weapons react, isolating a useful signal from these distortions, to be used for analysis and to activate its devices. We will dwell here only on use of the seismic field for these purposes. A ship's seismic field is secondary, and it is formed in the material of the sea-bed in response to the ship's hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic fields. Therefore, the corresponding sensitive elements of such mines evaluate and analyze the features of this field with the purpose of revealing perturbations introduced into the material of the sea-bed as a result of the presence of a ship or vessel in a particular region. Figure 1 is a basic model of how a ship's seismic field is generated. It shows formation of a system consisting of a chain of elements that generate and shape the signal: the source of oscillations (the ship), the water column, an elastic medium (the sea-bed material), and a receiver (a mine with a seismic proximity firing mechanism). It is arbitrarily referred to by specialists as a complete seismic channel. A block diagram of a complete seismic channel is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Basic Model Showing Formation of a Ship's Seismic Field Figure 2. Block Diagram of a Seismic Channel The sum of characteristic signals of some force in a certain frequency band forms at the source of the oscillations. These oscillations transmit a perturbing effect through the water column to an elastic medium (the sea-bed material), evoking a seismic wave, which reaches the location of the mine and its seismic proximity firing mechanism. After the logical circuit analyzes the obtained information and compares it with a set of standards, the firing mechanism "makes the decision" regarding destruction of the object (target). Judging from communications in the foreign press, mines equipped with seismic firing mechanisms began appearing in the ground forces of the USA and then in other armies in the 1960's. Sea mines appeared in the 1970's. They came to be used widely together with land models in shallow water, especially in anti-assault landing minefields. The advent of such proximity firing mechanisms was brought on by: - the high speed with which seismic waves spread through the material of the sea-bed, owing to which the corresponding receiver could detect the ship's motion with some lead time, thus increasing the time the mine's equipment has to analyze the received signal in order to classify the object; - presence of a number of unique characteristics of seismic waves, which in contrast to hydroacoustic waves for example, make it possible to develop proximity firing mechanisms that are more resistant to interference; - the possibility of using geophysical methods for analyzing the signals--their grouping, correlation analysis and so on, making it possible to employ effective means of isolating the useful signal from the background of interference of natural (microcircuit) and artificial (explosions) origin. The basic characteristics of mines of the world's leading countries with proximity firing mechanisms containing seismic channels are shown in the Table.

Intensive development of such mines is making it necessary to study the fine structure of a ship's seismic field more carefully, and to seek ways and means of fighting these mines.
