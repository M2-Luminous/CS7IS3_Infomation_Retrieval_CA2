SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Notice announces the availability of funds for assistance under VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program. This is a new program authorized by Pub. L. 102&hyph;590, the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992. Funding was appropriated by the Department's appropriations act for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993). Funding applied for under this Notice may be used for: (1) Expansion, remodeling or alteration of existing buildings; (2) acquisition of buildings, and acquisition and rehabilitation of buildings; (3) new construction; (4) procurement of vans; and (5) per diem payments, or in-kind assistance through VA in lieu of per diem payments, for eligible applicants who established supportive housing or supportive services programs after November 10, 1992. Applicants may apply for more than one type of assistance. Applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government to assist homeless persons. For existing projects, VA will fund only the portion of the project that will expand the program. A proposal for an existing project that seeks to shift its focus by changing the population to be served or the precise mix of services to be offered is not eligible for consideration. Not more than 25 percent of services available in projects funded through this grant program may be provided to clients who are not receiving those services as veterans. Authority.
