When will the reduction of unemployment start? [Necker] We are not yet quite that far. First of all, foreign demand has started to go up. Now we are all waiting tensely for whether and when the spark will jump over to Germany itself. This year, one cannot speak of a considerably more vivid demand for investment goods and a tangible increase in private consumption -- and certainly not for less unemployment. [Zaunitzer-Haase] When will the turnabout come? [Necker] I expect a turnabout in unemployment for 1995. However, an increase in employment does not mean a decline in unemployment. This will be the case only as of 1996. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Increase in employment without a decline in unemployment -- what does that mean? [Necker] First of all, the silent reserves will be mobilized and activated. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where do you see "silent reserves" on the labor market? [Necker] These are the many people in waiting positions. Often they have not even registered as unemployed. Others are engaged in "job creation measures" or in retraining and advanced training subsidized by the state. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Thus, first it will come to a redistribution. [Necker] Quite so! What I call the "silent reserve" are the people who are working on themselves, who are ready at any time to reintegrate into the working process. They can be taken over by industry without any major problems. [Zaunitzer-Haase] And the long-term unemployed will be left behind? [Necker] At least for the time being. The decisive group that poses problems comprises almost 50 percent of all unemployed. They are suffering from a loss in qualification, which is almost unnoticeable at the beginning, but continues to smolder below the surface. Before the companies take them on, those who really want to work and are capable of work will be accepted. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Will there never again be as many jobs as applicants? [Necker] Anyone who wants to enter working life will always have an opportunity. However, the threshold for creating new jobs -- that is not the replacement of closed-down capacities, but the establishment of additional capacities in the companies -- does not only lie in the economic sector. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where else? [Necker] In the institutional conditions! The more I protect the person who holds a job, the more difficult and more expensive it is to dismiss him in the case of a bad economic situation, the longer an entrepreneur will hesitate to hire new people. The state has created virtual barriers for dismissing and hiring. In addition, there are the labor costs. [Zaunitzer-Haase] The latest wage contracts were absolutely sensible, even in the eyes of the entrepreneurs. [Necker] They were good -- and, above all, necessary. However, one swallow does not make a spring. In other words: One year alone is not sufficient to correct the mistakes of several past years. Things must be continued with a sense of perspective. Otherwise, there is the danger that the "process of emigration" -- that is the employment of far cheaper labor outside our state borders -- will continue more quickly than the hiring of additional labor in our own country. [Zaunitzer-Haase] The net income of the working people is shrinking. [Necker] This is a very essential point. An average of 44 percent is deducted from the working person's gross income. He is left with a net sum of 56 percent. Twenty years ago he still received 66 percent in cash. In addition, the ancillary wage costs, which must be paid by the companies, have also grown strongly. [Zaunitzer-Haase] But not the wages themselves. [Necker] Just take into consideration that a master craftsman must legally work for five hours to be able to pay for one hour of the work of another craftsman. This leads to a shadow economy and to the destruction of jobs. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Do you see any way out? [Necker] We must put an end to the excessive state mechanisms for redistribution. Over the past three years, the state and the partners to the wage negotiations distributed more than was achieved. The GDP declined, but the sums that were redistributed were inflated nevertheless. [Zaunitzer-Haase] Thus, what do you demand from a future federal government? [Necker] Not even more redistribution, but cost reduction. The state sector must be slimmed down. According to the Bundesbank, the share of the state is 54 percent. This must not be a permanent condition. The state must privatize, deregulate, and gradually reduce the tax burden -- for everyone, by the way, not only for the entrepreneurs. And what happens. Just look at the new nursing-care insurance. It is constructed in such a way that there are enormous side-effects. A grandmother will often be declared in need of nursing-care just to get the nursing-care money. My criticism is directed both at the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], which has "social-democratized" itself to a certain extent. [Zaunitzer-Haase] What should the new federal government be like? [Necker] We will cooperate with any federal government. It is no secret that red-green is not something we desire. It is interesting that the most outstanding economics ministers of the postwar period -- Ludwig Erhard of the CDU and Karl Schiller of the SPD -- were renowned professors of economics with scientific experience. This does not mean that economics ministers always have to be professors of economics, but I do wish for this high degree of knowledge on this matter.
