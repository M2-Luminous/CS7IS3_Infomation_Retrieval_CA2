"A decision has to be made sooner or later," Hata told a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee reviewing the long- delayed state budget for fiscal 1994, which began April 1. The remark showed Hata's positive stance concerning such a new tax in line with the government's tax system reform program, observers said. Government sources said, however, that the Finance Ministry opposes the idea for technical reasons, including complicated tax- collection procedures. A local consumption tax would increase revenues of local governments and could be used to ease the burden of medical and other costs to care for aged residents. Backing up Hata's remark, the head of the government's tax commission, Kan Kato, told reporters commission members have agreed on the need for new revenue sources, and the local tax idea cannot be ignored when a hike is implemented in the present 3.0 percent consumption tax.
