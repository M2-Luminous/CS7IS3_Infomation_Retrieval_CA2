FBIS4-10966 "drlat077__a94005" FBIS-LAT-94-077-A Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ANNEX Brazil Documents: Numbers Game Linked To Arms Smuggling Documents: Numbers Game Linked To Arms Smuggling PY1604023994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 15 Apr 94 p 14--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1604023994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Article by Vera Araujo] [Text] Documents found at the house of Detective Inspector Nestor Silvio Soares Maganinho, who was assigned to the Robbery and Cargo Theft Division in Bangu and served as a bodyguard for numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, are proof of the link existing between the numbers game and the smuggling of arms, possibly those used by drug traffickers and by robbers of armored bank vehicles. The documents were picked up by the PM-2 (Military Police Secret Service) squad five days before the raid of Andrade's main accounting office in Bangu on 30 March. The documents will be submitted today by the 34th Precinct to the Civilian Police Internal Affairs Department. All of the 183 ammunition requisition forms found at the bodyguard's house are in the name of Castor de Andrade, his bodyguards, numbers game kingpin Ailton Guimaraes -- who is also known as Captain Guimaraes -- and even in the name of police officer Idovan Ferreira, who is the head of the 4th Civilian Police Regional Division in Araruama. Through the documents seized, the police reached the conclusion that the arms smuggled by Andrade's gang were coming by ship through Sepetiba, Itacuruca, and Angra dos Reis. Ironically, Captain Guimaraes' name has in the past already been linked to arms smuggling. Early in the 1970's, Guimaraes had to answer charges at a military police inquest on charges of withholding smuggled goods. As a result of the inquest, Guimaraes had to retire, and thus his life of crime began. The chief of the 34th Police Precinct (Bangu), Carlos Alberto Campagnac, said the smuggled goods are not entering the city through the international airport or through the port of Rio de Janeiro. Castor de Andrade may be using remote beaches outside the area of influence of the Federal Police. Campagnac, who is also listed as having received bribes from Andrade, said: "Andrade's ships can navigate on the ocean. We are thus looking into his fleet of ships." According to police, because the bribes demanded by federal agents for the release of the arms "are high," Andrade has been using his own ships to transport ammunition and arms imported from the United States and Israel. According to a Federal Revenue Secretariat [SRF] source, "there is no way to stop smuggling in the port of Sepetiba and the surrounding area." The SRF source added that there is not even enough manpower to discharge its 60 tasks. The Federal Police reported that its function at the port of Sepetiba is just to check passengers. In addition to the documents found at Maganinho's house, which is located at 771 of Doze de Fevereiro St., the police also seized a sizable amount of ammunition and imported weapons -- such as a Smith and Wesson revolver -- plates for identification cards, licenses and CPF's [Individual Tax Payers Registers], and even Point Blank bulletproof vests manufactured in the United States. Judge Marcos Antonio Bakker of the Second Bangu District has already issued an arrest warrant against Maganinho, who remains at large. Campagnac reported that the items seized at Maganinho's house will be examined by experts, along with the weapons confiscated at Andrade's headquarters -- where his bodyguards used to stay -- 18 days ago, which included an Uzi submachine gun. The writing on the requisition forms will be compared with that of the accounting books seized at the Andrade's accounting office.
