The SDRP Presidium stressed such a system should not be aimed against anybody but has to function effectively in order to solve the existing conflicts and counteract potential threats and international crises. In this context, the SDRP said it supported Poland's strivings for joining NATO and added that from the point of view of Poland's interests it considered the "Partnership for Peace" a step in the right direction though not a fully sufficient one. The SDRP said that the initiative needs to be appropriately specified and Poland should actively participate in this process. "We believe that the content of the "Partnership for Peace," which will be specified with the participation of all the interested parties, will produce a system of mutual links which will provide solid foundations for a common and effective security system on the European continent. We are aware of the significance of Russia's participation in this extremely important process," the SDRP said and added that it was particularly important to create a favourable and constructive political climate around the initiative so that the "Partnership for Peace" plan could ensure security and stability of democratic development to the states participating in the process.
