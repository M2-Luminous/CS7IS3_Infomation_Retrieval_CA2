SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed transportation improvement project in Santa Fe and San Miguel Counties, New Mexico. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Reuben S. Thomas, Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, 604 W. San Mateo, Santa Fe, NM 87505. Telephone: (505) 820&hyph;2022. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on three alternative alignments for connecting NM 50 to I&hyph;25 in the vicinity of the Glorieta Unit of the Pecos National Historical Park. Alternatives under consideration are: 1. No build, including, a. Do nothing, b. Resurfacing of NM 50 through the Glorieta Unit and c. Widening within the existing right-of-way through the Glorieta Unit; 2. West Ridge Alignment. This would be a new alignment beginning approximately 12,500 feet east of the Glorieta Unit east boundary on NM 50, bending southwest to old US 85, then extending west along the interstate to tie in to the existing Glorieta interchange, and 3. La Joya Underpass Alignment. This alignment would begin approximately 1500 feet east of the Glorieta Unit east boundary on NM 50. It would proceed south to I&hyph;25, utilizing the existing La Joya underpass location. A new interchange with I&hyph;25 would be required. Public involvement to date has included two ``open house'' public meetings. The first was held August 12, 1993 in Pecos, NM, and the second was held October 28, 1993, also in Pecos, NM Comments received at those public meetings were incorporated into the planning process. The draft EIS will be made available for Native American, public and agency review and comment. A public hearing will be advertised and held after document distribution and review. To ensure that a full range of issues related to this project are addressed and all significant issues and impacts identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the alternatives and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
