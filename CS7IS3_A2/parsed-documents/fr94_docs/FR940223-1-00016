FR940223-1-00016 FR940223-1-00001 these markets, with manufacturing plants located in heavy production areas distant from most distributing plant locations, are more comparable to the situation of Whatcom County. Such increases, that update location adjustments to correspond to the significant increases in hauling costs that have been experienced since most location adjustment provisions were written, are actually the only means of ``modernizing'' location adjustments. It is very possible that it would be appropriate to modernize or increase the location adjustment at Whatcom County as urged by Northwest Independent Milk Producers Association and Carnation Company. However, there is inadequate data and testimony in the record of this proceeding to determine an appropriate change in the level of location adjustment for Whatcom County. The witness pointed out that the same theory underlying the 1988 decision relative to Whatcom County is applicable to Proposal No. 3, and expressed the view that based on the current harmonious relationships within the marketplace, the 15-cent location adjustment should be maintained if location adjustments are going to continue to be recognized within this Federal order. Olympia Cheese Company opposed Proposal No. 3 relative to changing the zone classification for plants in Yakima County from Zone 4 to Zone 2 to reflect the same location adjustment as Whatcom County. The witness testified that Olympia Cheese Company currently procures a substantial portion of its milk supply in Yakima County. That milk has to be shipped over the mountains in order to get to western Washington where its plant is located. The company subsidizes part of those hauling costs. The witness maintains that the proposed reduction in the location adjustment in Yakima County will further add to milk costs because in order to keep the milk supply from that county, hauling costs will have to be subsidized further by the same amount as the reduction in the location adjustment in order to stay competitive in milk procurement in that region. The witness testified that Olympia Cheese Company's suppliers are going to be competing precisely against those suppliers in the Yakima County area, forcing them to come up with the same amount, even though its suppliers go across the mountains to western Washington. The witness contends that if its suppliers were breaking even before with respect to hauling cost, with the adoption of Proposal No. 3 they would be nine cents worse off. The Olympia Cheese Company's witness stated that a location adjustment's traditional role is to reduce the payment to individual farmers for any milk that stays in the county_i.e., that milk which is not shipped to a heavily populated area. This provides a disincentive and promotes the shipment of milk from high production/low population areas to high population areas. The witness stated that in the case of Proposal No. 3, it appears the location adjustment is doing the opposite of intended, in the sense that all of a sudden the incentive is reduced, therefore increasing the incentive for the milk to stay in Yakima County. The witness pointed out that location adjustments are there precisely to promote shipment of milk to populated areas, and that they were used as a mechanism by USDA for this purpose. Inland Northwest Dairies, Inc., also expressed concerns over the adoption of Proposal No. 3. The witness emphasized that there has been a very harmonious relationship in the marketplace. The witness stated that, with the adoption of Proposal No. 3, the company might be in a much tougher position in the future to recruit milk from producers in the Yakima Valley, from where 80 percent of its milk supply comes. He contended that because of competitive conditions, Darigold's producers may not have to pay as much in the future to get their milk to the Sunnyside plant as what others would have to pay to bring milk from the Yakima region to Spokane, Washington. The witness was further concerned with adjusting the location allowance because of the situation that also exists in Moses Lake, where Safeway 85, Inc., a pool plant, has a 15-cent location adjustment. He stated that reducing the location adjustment in Yakima County could create some disparity in the marketplace because Safeway is definitely competition. The witness emphasized that the majority of its milk comes from the Yakima and Benton County region and that in the long-term there may be some inequities should the amount charged Darigold producers in the future be adjusted by the location adjustment in Proposal No. 3.
