By adjusting the heat exchange cycle, the new machines can be used for heating up to 50째C and for cooling to -10째C. HFC-134a has less impact on the environment than "CFC-11" and does not deplete the ozone layer. The turbo refrigerating machines using HFC-134a are the third type to employ a CFC substitute, following those with "HCFC-123" and "HCFC-22." The new type consists of six models with different refrigeration capabilities ranging from 150 to 400 refrigerating tons and priced from 짜39.5 million to 짜56 million. Large capacity models of up to 7,000 refrigerating tons will be developed based on the sales conditions of the smaller models.
