The document, which may be published only simultaneously in Poland and the West, consists of 32 typewritten pages. It includes a one-page political declaration; the following pages contain details of various undertakings. The first part of the IPP document recalls the declaration made at the NATO summit on 10 January of this year and the offer of the Partnership for Peace, then the fact that Poland signed the so-called framework document of the PFP on 2 February (general rules of participation in the program). It is also recalled that our goal is participation in the organization and the incorporation of operational forces into the integrated military structure of NATO. Therefore, we are ready to attain the capability for joint operations and to adjust to the requirements of the Western Armed Forces. In the second part of the document, all intentions are marked with the symbols P1, P2, and P3. These symbols denote the sequence of the implementation of the various intentions. Each page is divided into six vertical columns: Code, Areas of Cooperation (Goals of the Partner), General Activities of the PFP, Type, Executive Instance, Remarks. NATO has recognized the fact that the main Polish priority in cooperation with this organization is to ensure our country's effective air defense, which is possible exclusively in a system integrated with NATO. NATO has generally agreed that the issues of the so-called three "C's" (communication, command, control [preceding three words in English]--that is, the systems of communication, command, and control) are the most important to us, and it also wants to include them in the area of cooperation with Poland. According to Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in the Ministry of National Defense [MON], who has all along been responsible for the shape of the agreement with NATO, an agreement that was proposed by NATO at the January summit meeting and that is now at the final stage of negotiation, the final agreement will not differ, at least basically, from the joint decisions that have already been made. The IPP will be accepted any day now, certainly before the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Poland (6 and 7 July). Poland was the first country to present NATO with the so-called presentation document (25 April), in which it specified its priorities for cooperation (after the so-called framework agreement, containing general rules and plans, was signed on 2 February). Now it will be the first country to sign the IPP with NATO. It will be of symbolic significance to both us and the "16." To us, because we stated already a long time ago that our strategic goal is to join the Euro-Atlantic security structures, and to them because they perceive Poland as a country that is determined to join NATO. We Are Setting Off Without an Umbrella When they started negotiating IPP, Poland and NATO had relatively little cooperation experience; however, there were no serious problems in the friendly atmosphere in which the talks were held, stressed Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in MON, in an interview for RZECZPOSPOLITA. We were able to draw on bilateral agreements--that is, on undertakings that were planned earlier by Poland and the individual NATO member states, such as the joint exercises with the Dutch, the British, and the French. Also, we could take advantage of the contacts within the framework of the North-Atlantic Council, which existed until the end of 1991. In its presentation document, Poland listed its wishes and proposals in 40 points. NATO experts codified them in a method practiced in contacts among the member states of the "16." They marked them with appropriate symbols, letters, and numbers. As a result, the entire IPP document, except for the one-page preamble, consists of tables. There Were No New Ideas Then negotiations started (on the level of officers of both sides), the goal of which was to explain the various points. "During these talks," Milewski emphasizes, "NATO did not have any new concrete ideas; however, the organization's intentions for cooperation with us became increasingly clear." NATO's negotiators wanted Poland to do the following: - Agree to use the principle of clarity in the activity of the Armed Forces--that is, agree to introduce the fundamental standards that would make the planned activity predictable for all partners. - Agree to democratic control over the Army (exercised by elected civilian authorities). - Be able and ready to take part in UN peacekeeping forces because peacekeeping missions are currently becoming the basic type of military activities and of preventing destabilization in the world. - Be able to take on peacekeeping, rescue, and other types of operations thanks to joint defense planning and exercises. - Make clear its intentions concerning its future cooperation with the organization. Poland accepts all these conditions. Jerzy Milewski underscores that Poland's participation in the PFP is subordinated to our strategic goal, formulated two and a half years ago: full membership of Poland in NATO. This is why Poland declared in the IPP that it will incorporate all of its operational forces into the military structures of NATO, even though we were only expected to double our participation in peacekeeping missions. Poland will take measures that may help us incorporate our own Army in the NATO structure: The commanding staff of our Army will cooperate with the various--land, air, naval--commanding staffs of the joint NATO forces in Europe and with the combined task forces [preceding three words in English], which are being established by NATO right now. Cooperation with NATO would consist of the following: - The beginning of permanent consultations concerning the defense policy. - Communication between our General Staff and SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe) and AFCENT (Allied Forces Central Europe). - Installation of technical means of communication (mainly digital communication, coding methods). - A striving to adjust the Polish Air Defense and incorporate it in the integrated NATO system (which in the West is at least 50-percent automated). Poland mainly wants to get access to the air reconnaissance system. - Adaptation of the command procedures and all other procedures, such as signs on maps and methods of commanding (in NATO, there are approximately 2,000 signs that codify their procedures). The IPP envisions various individual undertakings that are supposed to help achieve these goals. In Entirety or in Part According to Milewski, we must strive for a situation in which both all our Armed Forces and smaller formations (such as one corps, three divisions, two battalions) can be used--in cooperation with NATO. Contrary to what it seems to be, the second possibility may be more difficult to implement because the isolated units must be able to operate on their own, must be well equipped and mobile. Later at least some Polish airfields and martial ports should be adjusted to Western standards; in addition, appropriate supply needs should be satisfied--for example, fuel characterized by appropriate parameters. Minister Milewski believes that cooperation with NATO should develop "step by step." As a result of concrete minor organizational and technical measures, as well as greater undertakings, the Polish Armed Forces should be considered to be adjusted to NATO requirements, adjusted to cooperation so that all or part of those forces could be commanded by international commanders, should a NATO summit decide to launch a military operation. Under the Name PFP Cooperation within the framework of the PFP is practically under way. Before that, even before an agreement is reached, the planned undertakings have already begun--under the name PFP. From the formal point of view, the first joint undertaking will be international exercises of the peacekeeping forces, which will be conducted on the firing ground near Zagan in September. Participating in it will be 400-500 U.S. Army soldiers, soldiers from other Western countries and from Poland and some Central-East European states. Because NATO is the one that issues an invitation, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the Russians will also come to Zagan. Soldiers will use only light personal arms. Central-East European states unofficially inform each other about their negotiations with NATO. Individual programs of partnership will not be secret. It will be possible to review these documents every year. Without Political Protection The question whether the IPP is satisfactory to Poland evoked many words that were critical of the entire PFP; Jerzy Milewski told us that two aspects should be distinguished in this program. The first concerns so-called temporary guarantees; the other pertains to a long-term program of full integration with Western structures. The PFP was rightly criticized as a program that would not give us any political protection from pressure on the part of the Russian Federation, the goal of which is to leave Poland and other Central European states in the gray zone. This pressure caused anxiety among the people. Because the pressure did not encounter a counterreaction from the Western states, the entire situation began to be increasingly similar to Yalta. If we were offered membership in NATO or at least some form of association with the organization, political protection would be expected. Full integration into NATO is not possible right now. It calls for an adaptation process, as a result of which our defense structure would be adjusted to the NATO structure. This should make our future membership real, not only formal. We look upon the PFP as a mechanism to help integration into NATO, and, from this standpoint, it can be considered sufficient. Jerzy Milewski stresses that Poland should make efforts to be admitted to the NATO structures gradually. The political integration might be made right now; military integration, because of the necessity of defense planning and adapting the Army, would take some time. The example of Spain, which signed six agreements on gradual integration before it was actually admitted to NATO, shows that gradual integration is possible.
