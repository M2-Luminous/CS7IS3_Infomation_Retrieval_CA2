"There is mega-pressure on everyone to get it up and running," he said. NATO leaders signed the Partnership initiative at a summit here last week. It has not yet been formally accepted by the countries of the former Soviet bloc. However, East Europe plus Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union said during U.S. President Bill Clinton's swing through the region after the summit last week that they intended to sign up to the initiative. Senior NATO military officials are scheduled to tour East European countries and possibly Russia in coming weeks to explain exactly what options for cooperation with NATO are on offer. The NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said the team could be headed by U.S. General George Joulwan, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe. The options range from joint military manoeuvres, peacekeeping, search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations to military communications, defence planning, training and the clean-up of old Soviet military bases. Each country will be allowed to choose from the options and decide the level of participation in Partnership for Peace, the source said, adding that the choice would depend partly on what each country could afford. Military officers from East Bloc countries are expected to establish themselves before mid-year at NATO headquarters here and at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) near the Belgian city of Mons. The first joint task force exercises are expected to start later this year on a small scale in disaster relief or peacekeeping. "But they will have a high symbolic value to show that things are moving," the source said. He added that quick implementation of the initiative was critical to its credibility. [passage omitted] Asked whether Russia might object to NATO exercises with countries of the former Soviet bloc, the NATO source said initial projects would involve "things that the Russians in their wildest dreams could not consider provocative." He said Russia had so far expressed no objections to German-Danish-Polish military manoevres scheduled in the European autumn, involving naval exercises in the Baltic Sea and land exercises in Denmark.
