FBIS3-11031 "drlat051_c_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-051 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 MEXICO Banamex Confirms Top Executive Kidnapped PA1603020694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 16 Mar 94 PA1603020694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] [Excerpt] You have probably already heard about this next report, although yesterday it was only a rumor. Nevertheless, the National Bank of Mexico [Banamex] confirmed the news at about 2315 on 14 March. I am referring to the kidnapping of Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the Banamex Stock and Securities Co. He is the president of the Administration Council of this important financial group, which is also known as Banamex Accival. Harp was kidnapped on 14 March in Coyoacan neighborhood just before 0800. The Grand Marquis in which Harp and his chauffeur, Eliseo Ortiz, were traveling was apparently intercepted by three people; another report says as many as seven individuals may have been involved. The car was stopped at the intersection of Caballo Calco Street and Hidalgo Avenue across from Hidalgo Park, a few meters from the Coyoacan council building. According to reports, Eliseo Ortiz was drugged and handcuffed by the criminals. Alfredo Harp, according to Banamex sources, did not resist the kidnappers. Harp was heading for his office on Madero Street in the historic center of Mexico City at 0800 on 14 March, where he was scheduled to have breakfast with other Banamex stockholders. After the kidnapping, chauffeur Eliseo Ortiz received medical treatment at Angeles Hospital. The vehicle in which Harp was traveling, the Grand Marquis, was found at El Rosedal neighborhood, very close to where the crime was committed. The chauffeur, after receiving treatment at Angeles Hospital, was taken to Banamex headquarters on Madero Street, Mexico City, where he was interrogated by officials from the Attorney General's Office. Other sources reported that there was a shoot-out with the kidnappers in El Rosedal neighborhood and that one of them was reportedly arrested. Isidoro Resa Valdes, director of the Federal District Judicial Police, telephoned Harp's residence at 1430 on 14 March. At that time, Harp's family denied Harp had been kidnapped, saying that he was in Acapulco. Harp, however, failed to attend the official unveiling of the Mexico Red Devils, a baseball team he had just purchased along with other stockholders of the Banamex Accival financial group. Roberto Mansur, president of the Red Devils and one of Harp's partners, has commented on the kidnapping. Mansur said this incident has affected his partners and the Red Devils' owners so much that there will be changes in Mexican baseball's opening day ceremonies. We will have Mansur's statements later. As of last night, the kidnappers had not contacted Harp's relatives or representatives of the Banamex Accival financial group. Officials from various agencies requested that information not be disseminated because Harp's safety is at stake. Stock market analysts who were consulted said they believe that the drop in the Mexican Stock Exchange's price index on 14 March was strongly influenced by reports of Harp's kidnapping. A Banamex news release states that the kidnapping has not yet been confirmed. Meanwhile, the Mexican Stock Exchange suffered another sharp decline today. [passage omitted on stock market activity]
