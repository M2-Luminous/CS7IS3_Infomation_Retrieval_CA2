This point has been disclosed in a report of the MUJAHED newspaper, Jami'at-e Eslami's [Islamic Society of Afghanistan's] publication organ, in its recent issue. The report says that after consecutive defeats in Kabul and in northern areas of Afghanistan, General Dostam asked for political asylum in Turkey, which turned it down. The report adds that he has bought a house in Germany in preparation for an escape. A Bakhtar Information Agency political commentator in this respect writes: General Dostam attempted a coup d'etat on 11th Jadi [1 January] at the instigation of foreign countries and in cooperation with Golboddin Hekmatyar. He now seeks ways of escaping. The report says Dostam and Golboddin believed at the outset they would do away with the islamic state in two hours. But four months later the putschists increasingly receive crushing blows.
