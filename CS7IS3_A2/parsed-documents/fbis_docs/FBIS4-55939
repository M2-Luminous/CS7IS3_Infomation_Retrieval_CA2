The conclusion of the Stability Pact between the European Union (EU) and Central and East European countries is primarily aimed at solving ethnic minority problems as well as the border issues between some states, he said. He said that though the current working shape of the document is acceptable to Slovakia, certain changes could be expected at the Paris conference scheduled for next week as some states voiced certain reservations against it. "The inclusion of the passage on the inviolability of the existing Slovak-Hungarian border in the basic treaty was proposed by Slovakia," Moravcik said. He said that Slovak diplomats proceeded from the fact that during the discussion on a similar treaty with Ukraine certain reservations were raised. The guarantees for the joint border, about which the Hungarian side is "reserved", is a sensitive problem for Slovakia. "We have to unambiguously and consistently reject the fear of irredentism in Slovakia," he said, adding that the guarantee of borders have been and are part of international documents. "We have come to believe that EU participation in the formulation of a Slovak-Hungarian treaty would not necessarily to bring positive results," Moravcik said asked why Slovakia refused to conclude a treaty with Hungary under EU supervision. "There is no reason for such treaties to be agreed upon under the auspices of third countries," he added. He pointed out, however, that the Stability Pact could provide necessary guarantees for its member states and create the necessary conditions for the "gradual integration" of nine Central and East European countries into the EU.
