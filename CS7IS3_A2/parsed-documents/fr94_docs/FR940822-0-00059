FR940822-0-00059 FR940822-0-00019 FRA has concluded that a thorough analysis of a railroad's operating procedures requires adopting the proposal as stated. Accordingly, all railroads must retain their operational testing programs and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections for three calendar years. FRA believes that trend analysis of this data will serve as an effective tool to assess a railroad's regulatory compliance. Inspectors can better recognize patterns of rules noncompliance and efforts railroads have made to remedy safety problems uncovered by previous tests. The results of these tests may be used as a barometer to measure the safety of a railroad and determine whether its level of compliance is improving, deteriorating, or remaining steady. 3. Whether FRA's proposal requiring railroads to retain their operating rules, radio rules, operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections at the system headquarters and all division headquarters is overly burdensome. The proposed rule identified two locations where railroads were required to retain pertinent rules and programs: division headquarters and system headquarters. The NPRM proposed that railroads would retain their operating rules and Radio Standards and Procedures paperwork at all of their division headquarters and at the system headquarters. See proposed §§217.7&hyph;217.13 (introductory text). FRA believed that most railroads already maintained copies of these records at these locations and that, therefore, FRA's enforcement personnel would be able to effectively and efficiently enforce Parts 217 and 220 by visiting any one of these sites. This proposal prompted a number of parties to comment on its usefulness. Four commenters argued that requiring the railroads to retain the pertinent documents at their system headquarters and at all of their division headquarters would impose additional administrative costs with no offsetting safety benefits. Two organizations suggested that the operational testing programs and annual summaries be retained only at the railroad's system headquarters. Another two parties recommended that each railroad's division headquarters retain only information that applies to operations within that geographical division. FRA agrees with the commenters that the proposal was overbroad in scope. The final rule departs from the NPRM by requiring that each division headquarters retain only those documents that the division applies and enforces ( e.g., operational testing programs and operating rules instruction programs). Likewise, each division headquarters must retain the records of operational tests and inspections conducted by that division. The proposal that each railroad retain its operational testing program, operating rules instruction program, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections (for railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours) at the system headquarters has been adopted unchanged. FRA assumes that railroads with extensive operations conduct operational tests and inspections at all division headquarters. Railroad safety requires that all employees responsible for train operations comply with a railroad's operating rules governing train movements over a territory. Therefore, under final rule §217.9(d), railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours will be required to retain their annual summaries on operational tests and inspections records at their system headquarters and at each of their division headquarters. Although two parties asked that the regulation be amended to require railroads to retain all of their annual summaries only at the system headquarters level, FRA believes that this data must also be available at all division headquarters in order for inspectors to determine the extent of rules compliance in other divisions and system-wide. This requirement will not impose any further burdens on the railroads because, as one commenter noted, the railroads already maintain copies of these documents at the division level and provide copies for FRA inspectors upon request. FRA believes that effective inspections of annual summaries are best served by examining these records at a railroad's division headquarters and system headquarters. 4. Whether FRA should permit electronic retention of documents. The NPRM never addressed this issue specifically. However, the proposal's emphasis on deregulation encouraged several parties to recommend that FRA allow railroads to retain records and reports by electronic recordkeeping. Both the written and oral comments stressed the cost savings that computer filing would provide to railroads. Requiring railroads to retain the information in paper form would impose additional administrative and storage costs. Computer storage of these documents would also enable the railroads to immediately update any amendments to their operational testing programs and operating rules instruction programs. Moreover, one commenter argued that retaining ``hard copies'' that contained historical data could create confusion in the offices that utilize the information. After reviewing the written comments and the transcript of the public hearing, FRA agrees with the commenters that electronic retention is a practical alternative for railroads to comply with the regulatory recordkeeping requirements. FRA thus authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection records (including annual summaries), and instruction programs on operating rules by electronic recordkeeping provided that certain conditions are met to safeguard the data entered and stored in a computer system. These stipulations are stated in §217.9(e) and explained in the Section-by-Section Analysis. Railroads that elect to use electronic data processing systems to store their operating rules information must be certain that proper security measures are implemented to ensure the integrity of the documents retrieved for inspection. Moreover, the information produced by computer must be organized in a usable format to afford FRA inspectors complete access to the records. FRA believes that electronic record retention is a viable option for the railroads provided that FRA's monitoring activities to measure compliance remain unimpeded. Section-by-Section Analysis The final rule contains substantial revisions to the proposal to amend the Railroad Operating Rules and the Radio Standards and Procedures (49 CFR Parts 217 and 220) in response to the written comments received, the testimony at the public hearing, and further review and reflection within FRA. Where terms or paragraphs in the final rule differ from those in the NPRM, the final rule provides designations or citations to reflect these amendments. 1. Definitions. In new §217.4, definitions of ``Class I,'' ``Class II,'' and ``Class III'' railroads are included to explain the classifications by which regulatory requirements are assigned. The definitions of ``division headquarters'' and ``system headquarters'' have been discussed earlier in this preamble.
