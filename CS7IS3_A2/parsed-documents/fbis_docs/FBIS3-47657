FBIS3-47657 "dreas011_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Construction Reform Plan Set, Support Noted Plan Approved OW1801004694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0036 GMT 18 Jan 94 OW1801004694 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The government decided Tuesday [18 January] on an action program aimed at boosting foreign access to Japan's construction market. The program calls for introducing an open bidding system on public works projects ordered by central and local governments and 84 public corporations. At present, only designated contractors are allowed to participate in bidding for most public works projects. Under the new program, the open bidding system will be introduced for central government-sponsored public works projects worth 4.5 million special drawing rights (SDR), or about 720 million yen, or above. One SDR is presently valued at 160 yen. On eligibility to take part in open tenders, the program makes it clear that construction firms, whether Japanese or foreign, will be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner. Projects, valued at 4.5 million SDRs or above, will be opened for bidding to foreign enterprises. If public works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures, 12 designated major cities and 84 public corporations like the Japan Highway Public Corp., the threshold will be 15 million SDRs. For public works worth less, the existing designated competitive bidding system will be applied, on condition that the ordering body ensures greater transparency and objectivity in designation and other related formalities. The government drew up the action program to be in time for the January 20 deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions. The United States initially threatened to retaliate if Japan failed to come up with effective measures to open the construction market by October 31, 1993, but in October extended the deadline to January 20. On design and consulting services concerned with public works projects, too, the designated bidding system has so far been applied. But the new program introduces a system for choosing participants from among those wishing to get orders which will apply to such services worth 450,000 SDRs or above to be ordered by the central government and public corporations, and services valued at 1.5 million SDRs or above ordered by prefectures and designated major cities. The existing construction procurement checking committee will act as an agency for disinterested parties in taking up complaints relating to open bidding. To prevent bid-rigging practices and bribery, a plan to make the guidelines for supervising and dealing with those found to have engaged in such acts much more severe than at present will be drawn up by the end of March. The Fair Trade Commission will also lay down guidelines by this summer to prevent bid-rigging in public works projects. The existing "construction guidelines" which are notorious for their numerous loopholes will be abolished.
