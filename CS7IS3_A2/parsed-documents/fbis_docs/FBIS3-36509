He announced that on February 7, the Abkhazian army continued to eliminate Georgia's bandit formations. Some of them have been pressed into the mountains, while others have been encircled or taken prisoner. Georgia has lost about 60 men near the village of Okumi. Mikanba alleged that there had been about 1,500 Georgian militants in the Gali Region, who had been given the order to seize the Gali region and the city of Ochamchira. He also announced that the Georgian formations located on the left "Georgian" bank of the Inguri River opened artillery fire to support their units stationed in Abkhazia. Abkhazian forces did not open fire at the left bank, he said. He denied the reports by the Georgian media about the execution of Georgian civilians in the Gali region's village of Bagdadi. According to sources in Sukhumi, since September 30, 1993, when the Georgian troops had to leave Abkhazia, combat operations in its territory have not been as fierce as they are now. Abkhazians are using tanks and artillery.
