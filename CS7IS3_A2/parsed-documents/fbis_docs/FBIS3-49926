Attending the meeting of Visegrad group heads of state and government with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Pawlak and Olechowski stressed that, partly as a result of Polish pressure, the original U.S. concept had been broadened to include the question of relations with Russia, and the willingness of the Atlantic alliance to strengthen the independence of the former Soviet republics. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak stressed the importance of the "Partnership for Development," under which the United States would make its economy more open to cooperation with the states of Central and Eastern Europe. For Andrzej Olechowski, the "Partnership" proposals offered enough security to the states of the region, in the event that in Russia, "historical reflections took precedence over democratic thoughts."
