In GATT's view, introducing special policies will affect unified implementation of the foreign trade system throughout the relevant country and will thus create an environment for unequal competition, weakening the central government's ability to fulfill its GATT obligations. Therefore, preferential policies granted to special economic zones [SEZs] and development zones will be gradually withdrawn. In its 12-point suggestions, GATT demanded that China abolish the different investment and taxation policies applied in different regions. The SEZs Office pointed out: When China is admitted to GATT, the discrepancy between local policies will disappear gradually and the market system will be adjusted according to the international practice represented by GATT. In future, there will be only differences in the development of a fully fledged market rather than in market policies. Naturally, since the SEZs have set up a complete set of market systems which suit the international economic pattern on the strength of preferential policies, they will possibly continue to lead the way in building a fully fledged market. At present, some places are still vying with one another to introduce preferential policies. The SEZs Office believes it is necessary to draw lessons from the growth of the SEZs. The unparalleled role played by policies will come to naught with the gradual improvement of the market and legal systems. Policies can only play a role for a short period.
