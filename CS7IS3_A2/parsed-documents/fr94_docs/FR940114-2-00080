FR940114-2-00080 FR940114-2-00049 National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Furan The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of furan, used primarily as an intermediate in the synthesis and preparation of other organic compounds and also in the preparation of numerous polymeric compounds used for preparation of temperature-resistant structural laminates. Copolymers of maleic acid and furan form complexes with alkaline earth ions and are used in metals, foodstuffs, and machine dishwashing products as alternatives to phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing detergents. Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering to both sexes of rats doses of 0, 2, 4, or 8 mg furan per kg body weight and 0, 8, or 15 mg/kg furan to both sexes of mice in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 2 years. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity 1 of furan in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of furan in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland. 1 The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study''). Nonneoplastic liver lesions associated with furan administration in rats and mice included biliary tract fibrosis, hyperplasia, inflammation, and proliferation, as well as hepatocellular cytomegaly, degeneration, hyperplasia, necrosis, and vacuolization. In rats, increased severity of nephropathy with an associated increased incidence of parathyroid hyperplasia was associated with exposure to furan. The study scientist for this bioassay is Dr. R. D. Irwin. Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Dr. Irwin at P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541&hyph;3340.
