The 40-minute meeting with the man touted as the Saudi regime's "businessman" covered political, economic, energy, and defence issues, the officials said. It took place three days after Balladur returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia, during which the two countries agreed to create a bilateral commission of experts on financing maintenance of French military equipment sold to the Arab state. But the French premier failed to seal hoped-for business deals during his stay. A spokesman for Balladur said the meeting had "given a major boost" to bilateral relations. The prince, who is the governor of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, had talks with France's defence and interior ministers Tuesday. He was also due to meet President Francois Mitterand later Wednesday.
