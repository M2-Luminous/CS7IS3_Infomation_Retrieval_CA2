Fuzhou is separated from Taiwan by the Taiwan Strait and is the closest mainland city to Taiwan Island. Because of human, geological, and blood relations, trade, economic cooperation and various kinds of exchanges between the two places have been increasing in recent years and remarkable results have been achieved. Xi Jinping believes that Fuzhou City has a lot of favorable conditions for attracting capital from Taiwan and, at present, the investment environment improves with each passing day. As far as the "hard" environment is concerned: Various counties (cities) under the city have gone all out to build high-grade major highways from north to south and east to west and the 7,500-tonne passenger wharf open to the outside world has been completed and put into operation; after expansion, Fuzhou's Yixu Airport opened more than 80 air routes to various major cities in China and preparatory work for the construction of the Changle International Airport is almost complete and construction work will start soon; and the Fuzhou Huaneng Power Plant will be expanded. As far as the "soft" environment is concerned, Fuzhou City has set up a Taiwan Compatriot Investment Service Center to help Taiwan businessmen solve problems in making investment in a timely manner. Xi Jinping told these reporters that capital introduced from Taiwan this year would be used mainly in infrastructure, such as transportation and power facilities, agricultural production which could earn foreign exchange, and industries using new and high technology. Preferential treatment would be given to investment in major construction projects and infrastructure projects such as airports, wharves, roads, and power plants. Taiwan businessmen would be encouraged to set up bonded warehouses and carry out entrepot trade in the bonded zone and they would also be encouraged to transform, lease, contract, and purchase various enterprises by setting up joint ventures. He said that in the Fuzhou Bonded Zone, tariffs and permits were exempted, international trade organizations were allowed to be established to carry out international entrepot trade, and the establishment of a capital goods market would also be allowed. He said that in attracting capital from Taiwan this year, Fuzhou City would further improve the system for keeping in contact with Taiwan enterprises involved in investment of over $10 million, do a good job in providing services for Taiwan enterprises, organize the functional departments concerned to carry out investigation and study on Taiwan enterprises and to help solve various difficult problems, and strive to make new breakthroughs in attracting investment from major financial groups. At the same time, Fuzhou would further strengthen the construction of the "soft" investment environment, establish and improve the joint examination and approval system, simplify procedures for examination and approval, properly organize activities on reception days for Taiwan and foreign businessmen, carry out official work on the spot in the economy and technology development zone, and the Taiwan Businessmen's Investment Zone, and strengthen the building of Fuzhou's Taiwan Compatriots Investment and Trade Service Center and Foreign Businessmen's Investment Service Center to improve efficiency and service functions. Talking about how to urge Taiwan businessmen to abide by laws and how to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff members of enterprises following the increased number of Taiwan-invested enterprises in Fuzhou year after year, Xi Jinping said that it was necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots who make investments in Fuzhou and to assist Taiwan businessmen to make investment and operate enterprises in Fuzhou City in the long-term. On the other hand, it is necessary to earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff members; to urge Taiwan-invested enterprises to implement the state laws, decrees, and regulations concerned and inspect how they implement them; and to ensure proper labor insurance, labor protection, welfare, and wages for workers and staff members so that state laws, decrees, and regulations can be implemented smoothly in Taiwan-invested enterprises and those enterprises can develop in a healthy direction.
