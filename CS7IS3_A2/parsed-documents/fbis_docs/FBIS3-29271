The option to impose ad valorem rates or special rates in proportion to volume on the 250 imports will be contained in the country schedule of tariffs the government is scheduled to submit to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today, the ministry said. Special rates applied in proportion to volume can be applied to control imports of low-priced textiles, footwear and other products from developing countries in particular. Currently, the government applies special rates on 21 types of film for movie production in proportion to import volume. In the tariff schedule on the trade of agricultural products, industrial products and services, the government will commit itself to the reduction of agricultural subsidies from 1,718.6 billion won in what is called the total aggregate measurement of support to 1,490 billion won in 2004, said the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. During the 1989-91 base years, the total aggregate measurement of support amounted to 1,568.4 billion won for rice production, 52.3 billion won for barley production, 72.9 billion won for soybean production, 22.6 billion won for corn production and 2.4 million for rape seed production. In the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, which were concluded Dec. 15 last year, the government committed itself to the opening of the domestic agricultural market to imports and tariff cuts. Under the Uruguay Round, Korea will have to increase its rice imports from 1 percent of its needs in 1995 to 4 percent in 2004. The government is required to open the domestic market wider for other agricultural products, beef, pork and chicken through tariffication, quota increases and liberalization. During the 10 years from next year, the government will have to cut the average concessionary tariff rates on industrial and fishery products from 17.9 percent in the 1986 base year to 8.1 percent in 2004. With applied rates standing 7.9 percent now, the Ministry of Finance said, the scheduled concessionary tariff cut will have little impact on Korea's imports. Applied rates on only 10 nonferrous metals are now higher than concessionary rates, or rates the government will commit itself to in its country schedule of tariffs to be submitted to the GATT, the ministry said. The government will also commit itself to reducing tariffs on 128 items in 10 sectors, including steel, construction equipment and agricultural machinery, to zero rate during the next 15 years. As a result of tariff cuts and removal, the ministry said, revenues from import duties will begin to decline in 1998.
