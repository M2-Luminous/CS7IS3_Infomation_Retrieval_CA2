As it has already been reported, the 10 June IAEA Board of Governors meeting shamelessly demanded the opening of our military sites on the pretext of the nuclear issue and adopted an extremely unreasonable resolution on the suspension of the agency's assistance to our country. Regarding this, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement protesting the IAEA Secretariat's unreasonable resolution, announcing our withdrawal from the IAEA, clearing that inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed, and reaffirming that UN sanctions will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. Our withdrawal from the IAEA is, by all means, a just measure to protect the nation's dignity and sovereignty. As everyone knows, we joined the IAEA to strengthen international cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities and to further develop our independent nuclear power industry, not to receive somebody's pressure or sanctions while be bound by the agency. However, some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat who kowtows to the U.S. policy of crushing the Republic laid from the beginning obstacles and difficulties in the way of resolving the issue by creating nonexistent inconsistency [purilchi]. By doing so, they compelled us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] [urirohayogum haengmugijonpabangjijoyakeso taltoehagi anumyon andoege mandueosumnida]. Furthermore, they have led the situation to the extent they will finally impose sanctions, not satisfied with making demands on allowing inspections not for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards in our special status following the temporary suspension of our withdrawal from the NPT but tantamount to routine and ad hoc inspections [chongimit pijonggi sachal]. The more we receive inspections from the agency, the more pressure and difficulties are imposed on us and our Republic's security and sovereignty are threatened. All these are clear proofs that the United States and the agency's Secretariat are attempting to encroach upon our sovereignty and to crush us by using the leverage of inspection [sachariranun kongganul]. Under such condition, is there any reason for us, who regard sovereignty as our life line, to remain in the agency and receive unreasonable pressure, having the nation's dignity and sovereignty infringed upon? Likewise, how can we promote international cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities and develop our nuclear power industry independently when the agency arbitrarily tyrannizes [chonhoeingul pursinugo] over its member nations by standing on their heads and serves as a maid of the United States, losing its impartiality and principles of democracy? Our decision to withdraw from the IAEA is a just self-defensive measure against the agency which is scheming outrageously to impose unreasonable sanctions against us and to penetrate into our military sites. The IAEA Secretariat's recent adoption of a resolution on us is an unpardonable act that gravely encroaches upon our Republic's dignity and sovereignty, and is an intolerable insult to our people. With the adoption of an unreasonable resolution, the IAEA Secretariat has failed to perform its mission as an international organization and openly joined hands with the imperialist forces who attempt to crush our socialist system. By doing so, the IAEA Secretariat, as a stooge of the imperialists, resulted in smearing ink on its face with its own hands by weakening its credit in international community. The agency's sanctions against us is, in essence, a prelude to a UN resolution. We have clearly affirmed that the UN resolution will be regarded as a declaration of war. No pressure nor threat will get through on us. Pressure and threat will in fact strengthen our will and conviction all the more. Our people will resolutely deal with it in case any unreasonable sanctions are imposed on us in the wake of the unreasonable resolution the IAEA Secretariat recently adopted.
