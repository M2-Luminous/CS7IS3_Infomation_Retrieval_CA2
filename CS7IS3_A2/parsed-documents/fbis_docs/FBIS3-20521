In the course of building and developing our socialist market economy, CYL organization-building is obviously facing many new challenges, as well as the need to respond to many new questions. China now has 56.8 million CYL members, only a few million more than overall party members; but in China's rural areas, CYL membership is actually millions lower than party membership. As to the ratio of national CYL members to all youth, the CYL organizational system's database on youth show this to be 19.9 percent; but this figure seems to inadvertently show a sizeable mistake, as the CYL organization's data on the overall number of youth throughout China is 70 million less than that of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB], so that taking SSB data on the number of youth, this ratio of CYL members to all youth is even harsher at only 5.8 percent. And if we shift our attention to the new economic groups that have grown up in recent years, we will be startled to discover that in the new economic growth zone, such as the three kinds of foreign trade, wholly foreign-owned, private, and township enterprises, the zones and parts with CYL organization-building gaps are even larger. While these figures and data are quite abstract, they are certainly like an unparalleled and harsh warning signal, admonishing the whole CYL that we must pay attention to and intensify CYL organization-building. We need to face up to the immediate need for courage, as well as to the fact that reality is sometimes a bit painful, particularly since we have done our utmost to emphasize in recent years the rectification of grassroots CYL organizations. Faced with China's ever-more dynamic economic and social development, we absolutely must soberly and reasonably examine and consider CYL-organization building, development, reform, and progress. Of course, self-knowledge is wisdom. Just as we were facing such challenges, not long after the CYL Central Secretariat had conducted a large nationwide investigation and study, we held the "National CYL Organizational-Work Conference," where CYL Central Secretariat Standing Secretary Liu Peng [0491 7720] set forth on behalf of the secretariat the basic future missions of national CYL organizational work: To conscientiously meet the needs of our socialist market economy, by actively pushing forward with CYL building and reform, focused on increasing CYL membership, in order to build a CYL membership corps that is great in numbers and capable of playing an exemplary role; to aim at producing more talent, in order to train CYL cadres into multi-talented personnel who meet CYL work realities and our socialist modernization needs for the next century; to focus on promoting social and economic development and serving youth development and progress, by taking a new CYL grassroots-building route, and gradually establishing CYL-organization operating forces that are on track with our socialist market-economy system, in order to pave the way for national CYL work to rise to new heights and create a new order. CYL Organizations in Places Such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Gansu Are Facing the Challenges, Exploring New Routes, and Making New Responses in CYL Organization-Building Faced with challenges, the CYL has never lost its confidence and nerve, with CYL vigor and vitality also growing and developing precisely in the midst of challenges. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Jiangsu has developed its industrial and agricultural production very quickly, with its industrial and agricultural output value ranking foremost in China, to create the nationally-noted "southern-Jiangsu model" -- a rural economic-development model marked by collective industry. In Jiangsu's economic development process, the CYL's Jiangsu Party Committee has always paid attention to building the CYL membership ranks among township enterprises in rural areas. CYL Jiangsu Party Committee Secretary Xu Ming [1776 7686] gives the following briefing: While statistical difficulties have kept us from yet making a full investigation of township enterprises throughout Jiangsu, samplings show Jiangsu's township enterprises to have a CYL-organization rate of 80-85 percent, far higher than the CYL average for township enterprises. In the course of CYL-building in township enterprises, the CYL Jiangsu Party Committee has acted in line with industrial needs to flexibly set up CYL organs, through CYL leadership of villages, village leadership of the CYL, or CYL-enterprise mergers, to gradually grow and steadily achieve its current heartening successes. Since 1993, they have been focusing on the large army of youth among transient workers. They began with the inflow sites, first organizing after-hours recreational and sports activities to attract young workers from other provinces to take part in CYL activities; then, to raise the quality of young workers to meet enterprise development needs, they launched all sorts of technical-training and competitive activities; finally, they actively built up CYL membership among young workers, conscientiously carrying out CYL-building. While this task has just begun, it has already received the attention and support of all areas of society. The CYL's Shanghai Party Committee has also shown unique foresight in building the CYL membership ranks, which CYL Shanghai Party Committee Deputy Secretary Xue Chao [5641 3390] sums up as "moving to the forefront, and providing early guidance." In CYL membership expansion, they emphasize sources, by expanding CYL membershp among high school, technical high school, and technical school students; in industrial distribution, by emphasizing places where new organs and employees in economic development congregate, and by conducting active CYL-building in financial institutions that are springing up in large numbers, such as foreign banks and securities and trust investment companies, as well as industries, such as hotels and tourism. The CYL Shanghai Party Committee holds that these industries have rapid youth mobility, high employee quality, and a large guidance role of work and life styles on youth in other industries. Moreover, in the course of developing Shanghai into an international financial and trade metropolis, as the number of youth employed in these new lines will continue to grow, Shanghai's CYL membership-building has had to "move to the forefront, and provide early guidance," in order to keep the initiative. In training "multi-talented" CYL cadres, the CYL Shanghai Party Committee is also in the CYL front ranks. Having summed up experiences in recent years in this area, they hold that "multi-talented" CYL cadres should be defined as combinations of political and economic quality, practical grassroots work experience and leadership management skills, and different positions and experiences. So the training of "multi-talented" CYL cadres is aimed at overall political quality, appropriate work skills, rational knowledge structure, and rich practical experience. As to training ways, the CYL Shanghai Party Committee has created a style combining diversified forms, such as on-the-job training, work-release for study at party schools, commissioned training at specialized schools, job-related training for CYL cadres, and job rotation and exchange of CYL cadres. While Gansu is an inland province with a relatively undeveloped economy, the CYL Gansu Party Committee has also made its own successes and explorations in grassroots CYL-building. Based on the demonstration counties that they have established in CYL grassroots organization in recent years, they have proceeded from the grassroots-building goal of "permanent invigoration," combined with local economic-development realities, to conduct an experimental "youth S&T development zone establishment" in Gansu's Yumen City and Gaolan County. After CYL Party Committee help in getting loans as starter funds, organizing various specialized joint-production collectives in the form of rural youth share cooperatives, investment-project declarations by various CYL branches, and examination and approval by departments, such as municipal and county CYL committees, they selected feasible and practical S&T projects for development in industries, such as breeding, cultivation, manufacturing, and cultural activities, organizing youth to get rich through work and S&T. This developed the local economy by enriching CYL youth, while strengthening CYL grassroots cohesion. These two places' CYL rates are now up from the former 11-12 percent to 19-20 percent. Moreover, as the establishment and development of these applied S&T projects were all controlled by the CYL organization, their operating efficiency has sharply added to the CYL's economic might. Xu Weizhong [1776 4850 1813], director of the CYL Gansu Party Committee Organization Department, predicts that the original goals for participaion in this project, of rural CYL branch income of 1,000 yuan a year, township CYL Party Committee income of 50,000 yuan a year, and CYL Yumen City Party Committee and CYL Gaolan County Party Committee income of 200,000 yuan a year each, will be realized. So while the CYL is certainly facing severe organization-building challenges in our establishment and development of a socialist market economy, our creative CYL is also responding with new explorations and successes. And while we certainly do not expect CYL organization-building to be accomplished in one stroke, to reach our goal in one step, or to accomplish our heavy CYL organization-building task once and for all, CYL members will continue to fight, advancing steadily to lay a fine organizational foundation for CYL work to reach new heights and create a new order.
