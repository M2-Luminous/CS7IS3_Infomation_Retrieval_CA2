A Transvaal IFP spokesman, Mr. Hennie Bekker, told the Afrikaans radio news program, Monitor, that although provisional lists had been drawn up some time ago, numerous candidates had to be confirmed before the national and regional lists could be finalized. He said Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi would head the national list, but that the decision had to be taken within the next few hours on whether he would head the kwaZulu-Natal regional list. Mr. Bekker suggested that the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] consider installing polling booths in what he termed beleaguered hostels in Thokoza.
