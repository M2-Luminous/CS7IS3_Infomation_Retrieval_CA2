Although she recognized that the Mexican Army is well-organized and is capable enough to face and quell the rebels' actions launched on 1 January, the military spokesperson said that Guatemala could provide some logistical support, if requested by authorities of the neighboring country. The statements by the military spokesperson came as news agencies reported that Mexican soldiers were approaching the Guatemalan border (10 km away) to counter the actions of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). Vargas de Marroquin explained that since the fighting in Chiapas began Salinas de Gortari's government has not officially informed them of the events, but Army units patrol the border areas to prevent any eventuality. Regarding a possible entry of Mexican troops into Guatemalan territory, the officer explained she does not think that may happen, although Guatemalan soldiers have sometimes entered the neighboring country, chasing members of clandestine groups, the participation of which in the Zapatist movement has not yet been confirmed. Concern over the PMA [Mobile Military Police] Vargas de Marroquin also stated that the military forces have expressed their great concern over recent bank robberies, because police investigations indicate that members of the PMA are involved. To avoid that situation, Vargas de Marroquin added, the Army has decided to review each of the contracts, as well as the weapons of agents assigned to the security of private enterprises. In addition, the military officer said that Obdulio Carias Garcia, who died in the robbery of Banco Uno, located in Vista Hermosa, was one of the security agents. Eustaquio Ramos Vasquez and Pilar Florian Cordero, who were arrested the evening of 12 January, the National Police have reported, also participated in that action. The Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE) has confirmed those individuals are PMA members.
