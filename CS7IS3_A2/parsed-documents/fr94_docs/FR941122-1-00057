FR941122-1-00057 FR941122-1-00015 38. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission presents two alternatives for a small business definition. One alternative is the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard where an entity would qualify as a small business if its net worth is not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. A second alternative is adoption of a gross revenue standard like that used in the broadband PCS context. The Further Notice requests commenters to address whether the SBA definition or a gross revenue standard should be used and the appropriate gross revenue threshold for the 800 MHz SMR context. 39. The Commission seeks comment on Whether bidding credits or other special provisions should be provided for rural telephone companies, but does not propose to adopt such special provisions. 40. In addition to the special provisions proposed above for designated entities, the Commission solicits comment on the following alternatives and related issues for the 800 MHz SMR service: (1) expansion of eligibility for installment payments to designated entities other than small businesses; (2) reduction in upfront payment for any class of designated entities; (3) the costs and benefits with respect to auction administration and designated entity participation associated with a reduced upfront payment in the 800 SMR service in the absence of a spectrum set-aside; and (4) whether the ``lower 80'' channels should be designated as an ``entrepreneurs' block.'' The Commission tentatively concludes that it would not be feasible to designate an MTA channel block as an entrepreneur's block because the large number of incumbents already licensed throughout the proposed MTA band make it virtually impossible to identify a particular block that would be suitable. On the other hand, an entrepreneurs' block approach could be more feasible for the ``lower 80'' channels, which we contemplate will be used primarily, if not exclusively, for operation of local SMR systems. 41. In addition, if the Commission adopts an entrepreneurs' block approach, it seeks comment on how eligibility for the block should be defined. Specifically, commenters are asked to address whether applicants other than designated entities should be eligible to bid for entrepreneurs' block licenses, whether the same financial caps should be applied for determining eligibility for SMR entrepreneurs' block licenses, how designated entities should be treated within the entrepreneurs' block in terms of eligibility criteria and special provisions. The Further Notice also requests comment on whether the definitions for small businesses and business owned by minorities and/or women should be different for purposes of determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block, what specific special provisions should be afforded to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' block, what type of attribution and affiliation rules should apply, and what additional measures are needed to protect against unjust enrichment. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IREA) of the expected impact on small entities of the policies and rules proposed in this Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making. Written public comments are requested on the IRFA. A. Reason for Action This rule making proceeding was initiated to secure comment on proposals for establishing a flexible regulatory scheme for the 800 MHz SMR service that would promote efficient licensing and enhance the service's competitive potential in the commercial mobile radio marketplace. The proposals advanced in the Further Notice are also designed to implement Congress's goal of regulatory symmetry in the regulation of competing commercial mobile radio services as described in Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332, as amended by Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The Commission also seeks to adopt rules regarding competitive bidding in the 800 MHz SMR service based on Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 309(J), which delegates authority to the Commission to use auctions to select among mutually exclusive applications in certain services, including 800 MHz SMR.
