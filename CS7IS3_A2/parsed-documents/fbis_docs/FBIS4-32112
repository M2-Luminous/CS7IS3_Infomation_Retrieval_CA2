The Muslim-Croat coalition is obviously not adhering to the one-month cease-fire agreement that had been reached with many difficulties. There is also a serious danger of what will happen in the days ahead. It is also uncertain as to whether the one-month cease-fire will ensure further negotiations on the settlement of the crisis on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, the most important thing is to preserve peace at any cost. The second most important thing is to invest additional efforts so that the negotiations on the final solution to the crisis can continue. The most important thing is what the contact group is going to do with the maps, because it is obvious that the latest meeting in London has not resulted in an accord among the countries that are participating in the meeting. There is even a mention of major differences in the views of West Europe and the United States, while not much is known as to what Vitaliy Churkin was promoting at these talks in the contact group. If one is to judge this according the results of Radovan Karadzic's visit to Moscow, and what [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev said after that visit, one could expect the Russians this time to insist that some vital interests of the Srpska republic be satisfied. This vital interest does not only amount to percentages, that is, to the 49 percent, but to the integrity of the Serbian territory in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Without that territorial integrity, the Srpska republic could obviously not accept any agreement, even if this were to the detriment of an agreement for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. At this moment all the factors that protect and defend the interests of the Srpska republic and the interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must be extremely careful not to find themselves in the situation that could be abused against the Srpska republic -- here I, of course, also refer to the republic of Serbian Krajina -- as well as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At this moment it would not be prudent to discuss anything else but focus on the soonest possible establishment of a lasting and just peace. The Srpska republic has obviously been, is, and will be prepared to accept any just peace. On its part, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is ready to accept any agreement that would satisfy the interests of all three sides in the conflict. However, one should be wary of those forces in the world who obviously do not care for a lasting and stable peace on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I primarily refer to some West European quarters and the United States, and especially to the Republic of Croatia. A just settlement of the crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is obviously not in its interest as it expects that further complications in the crisis there would help Croatia to achieve some of its aims vis-a-vis the republic of Serbian Krajina. I do not know whether the international community is sufficiently ready and able to realize the essence of the current crisis, but one thing is clear: If the United States and the European Union cared for a lasting and stable peace, that peace could be established as early as tomorrow. They must exert additional pressure on the Muslim-Croat coalition to accept peace. Contentious issues can be discussed and negotiated until a lasting and stable solution has been found. Therefore, the situation is extremely uncertain. The greatest danger comes from the uncertainly of what the maps will look like. This time I believe Russia will finally realize all the behind-the-scenes activities of the United States, Germany, and some other member countries of the European Union aimed at granting the Muslim-Croat coalition something that does not belong to them, to the detriment of the Srpska republic and thus to the detriment of the Serbian people and the Serbian lands as a whole.
