The main Brazilian arms industries -- CBC [Brazilian Ammunition Company], Taurus, Rossi, Boito, Urco, and Imbel [War Materiel Industry] -- which are currently earning $300 million annually, export about 75 percent of their production. CBC, which belongs to the Arbi and Imbel groups, is investing $2.7 million in a publicity campaign to promote its Pump CBC 12 shotgun. CBC expects to sell 9,000 of the shotguns this year, at a price between $400 and $800 each. Domestic sales amount to nearly 220,000 units per year. Taurus and Rossi from Rio Grande do Sul sell mainly handguns and revolvers. They account for nearly 90 percent of legal arms sales. CBC believes it may double its domestic sales this year. The publicity campaign, which began in March and which will last until December, with striking adds that explain the product, is part of the sales support strategy. Distribution is the strong point of CBC. "We deliver our product within five days," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio Salvany. CBC sells its products through 500 stores. CBC turned to the domestic market after a restructuring process which combined productivity and a dollar price reduction of up to 54 percent. "We will expand domestically, taking advantage of our increased production capability," Salvany said. CBC has invested $1.8 million in machinery, equipment, and new processes. CBC will invest $10 million in 1994 and 1995 to increase its ammunition production. CBC is considered the largest Brazilian ammunition manufacturer with a production of 221 million cartridges in 1992. It also produced a total 32,000 units of the Pump CBC 12. CBC sells ammunition in the United States under the trademark Magtech. It expects to manufacture 90,000 units this year, only 10 percent of which will remain in Brazil. With the recession at the beginning of the 1990's, other national manufacturers targeted the international market. As a result of large export operations -- mainly to the United States -- Taurus opened the Taurus International Manufacturing subsidiary which is responsible for 52 percent of its $51.2 million sales last year. It produced 400,000 handguns and revolvers. Taurus is the third most popular handgun in the United States. For Rossi, which was founded 105 years ago, selling abroad was a way to survive. Rossi's .38-caliber 5-shot revolver -- the main competitor for Taurus in revolvers -- is the company's best-selling product. It accounts for $30 million worth of annual sales. In 1989 Rossi adopted a Total Quality Program to improve productivity and to compete with the United States and Canada where it must compete with the famous Colt, Rugger, and Smith and Wesson revolvers. "When the recession hit the United States we had good quality and the best market prices," says Rossi Sales Manager Paulo Schilling. He said that 60 percent of Rossi's production is exported. The Boito company, a small hunting weapon manufacturer, is based in Veranopolis, Rio Grande do Sul. It has annual sales of $12 million and is also engaged in exports. Following the philosophy of its founder, Elias Ruas Amantino, the company has never produced the personal security weapons that could increase its sales in Brazil and in the countries to where it sends 95 percent of its production. "We know we are losing an opportunity to make money, but we respect the principle established by our founder," says Commercial Manager Manoel Ruas Amantino. CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family to produce bullets for hunting weapons. The company currently belongs to the Arbi and Imbel groups. It is investing $10 million to transform itself into one of the most modern ammunition manufacturers in the world. With the purchase of new, totally automated equipment from Germany, Italy, and Belgium, CBC will soon be producing four cartridges per second. "We will be able to modify our production at any moment without quality loss," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio Salvany. Installed in Maua, greater Sao Paulo, the company manufactures from .22-caliber ammunition to projectiles for FAB [Brazilian Air Force] fighters. Of the $100 million CBC plans to earn this year, 88 percent will come from cartridge sales. Beside the modernization project -- quality control will be computerized -- the CBC is linking its network of distributors. "The sales team will work on cellular telephone-linked notebooks [preceding word given in English]," Salvany says. Orders will be logged in the central CBC computer so as to inform the production line. "The saving of time is essential for competitiveness," he says. The idea is to deliver orders within 24 hours. Having conquered the Brazilian market, CBC intends to do the same abroad, where it has 45 distributors selling in 65 countries. "We want to be among the main weapon and ammunition manufacturers in the world," Salvany said.
