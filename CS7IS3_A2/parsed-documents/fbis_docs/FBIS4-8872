Bozinovska; place and date not given: "Strong Measures Lead to Strong Currencies"] [Text] The final verification of the agreement between the Macedonian Government [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and the World Bank will take place in the next two to three days. It should result in an $80 million loan. This will complete talks, which have lasted more than a month, by a Macedonian team headed by Dr. Ljupco Trpevski, minister without portfolio. [VECER] Mr. Trpevski, last Tuesday the board of directors of the World Bank accepted a structural adjustment program drafted by the Macedonian Government. What are the initial impressions concerning the possible results? [Trpevski] Last Tuesday, the World Bank Directors approved the development policy letter relative to the structural adaptation program, as agreed upon in the final months of last year with the World Bank. The International Development Agency approved a loan of $40 million and the World Bank approved a loan of $40 million. It is expected that some time around 14 February the agreements will be signed and that we shall start to repay first all of the $107 million owed, so that we may subsequently use the loans. We have already drafted documentation submitted to the World Bank for an immediate loan of $30 million from the IDA [International Development Agency] from imports for the past four months. The balance of up to $80 million will be received subsequently with a monthly submission of import documents. The first $30 million will be used to settle the old debt while the balance will go to increasing foreign currency reserves and meeting current commitments to the World Bank and to the other so-called privileged international financial institutions. Precise Figures [VECER] A number of figures have been mentioned on the amount of loans we need, totaling $200 million. Is it possible now, after the adoption of the program by the boards of directors of the International Monetary Fund and the Bank, to cite a specific figure of the dollar sum on which we could safely rely? [Trpevski] We can rely on a loan of $80 million from the World Bank. Furthermore, we have secured a loan of $35 million from the International Monetary Fund, $17.5 million of which will be used to repay the amount owed to the bank. The remaining $17.5 million will be received toward the middle of the year, based on our meeting the stipulations agreed upon with the Fund. [VECER] Therefore, let us mention precise figures: as a result of this program we could expect $80 million from the Bank and the balance of $50 million if we regularly supply documentation on imports, and $17.5 million from the Fund. Therefore, at best, we can safely rely on obtaining $97.5 million. The specially stipulated conditions will have to be met for us to obtain the balance of up to $200 million. [Trpevski] This will depend on the way we implement the program. It will determine obtaining the remaining $17.5 million from the Fund. In the next few months, we shall resume talks with the World Bank on a loan for structural adaptation, for $60 million. Meanwhile, a very positive initiative was launched, involving us. We were recently informed of it through a variety of channels: a Japanese Government's decision to put together an economic package for Macedonia, a substantial share of which will be planned jointly with the World Bank, which will participate as a co-financier. The World Bank will collect the funds which will be subsequently lent to us. Now one of the main sources for investments in Macedonia by the World Bank will be Japan. [VECER] Let us look at the other loans. To begin with, is it necessary to initial a new standby arrangement and obtain the second half of the loans from the World Bank, or else will the implementation of the present program suffice? [Trpevski] No, we shall initiate talks about a standby arrangement but this is not strictly related to the balance of the loans. Actually, from our point of view, we would be interested in signing a standby or ISAF [expansion unknown] arrangement, providing that it is kept, for we know that the STF [system transformational loan] arrangement is a preliminary for a standby arrangement. Even with the signing of a standby arrangement we appear as a country pursuing a stable economic policy. [VECER] To sum it up: Does it mean that the standby arrangement is not a prerequisite for obtaining the balance of the loan from the World Bank? [Trpevski] It is not. The loan depends on whether we meet the conditions stipulated for the first half of the year. [VECER] Shall we be able to meet these conditions? Inflation has already substantially exceeded the projections by something like 15 percent. [Trpevski] Inflation is not a parameter. In terms of the dynamics of inflation we must apply the other parameters, such as wages. [VECER] The second condition is that the privatization must yield results. Naturally, when it is a question of obtaining the second loan of $60 million, a certain share will be used to improve the situation of the banks. However, in the privatization area something is obstructing developments. [Trpevski] It is accurate that one of the conditions set by the World Bank is that we must show privatization results. I believe that there will be no problems, for, based on what we have agreed upon, this year essentially the enterprises should submit plans for privatization, and the privatization achieved so far must be checked. With the control and the approval of the privatization carried out so far, certain results will become immediately apparent. [VECER] However, circles close to the government have indicated that the content of the Privatization Law does not meet the full approval of the World Bank. [Trpevski] The World Bank rated the concept most highly. Its main remark is that privatization is developing slowly and that the bank believes that it must be faster and more extensive. A New Arrangement [VECER] The signing of a standby arrangement depends to a certain extent on the timing--from the second half of this year to the start of the next. What is the basis for the government's optimism that it would be able to meet the stricter requirements earmarked with such an arrangement, if it can be reached prior to the elections? [Trpevski] The optimism is essentially based on the fact that in terms of the conditions we have agreed upon with the Fund for concluding an STF arrangement there will be no major difference between it and the conditions stipulated in the standby arrangement. [VECER] Does the government consider the STF arrangement much more liberal? [Trpevski] This seems to be the case, based on the agreements concluded by the Fund with other countries. Meanwhile, we have agreed with the Fund on a framework which is much stricter than the usual standards, so that we should not expect the standby arrangement to stipulate conditions much more difficult than the present ones. The difference lies in the consequences of the nonfulfillment of the STF or the standby arrangement. In terms of the standby arrangement, the Fund is stricter: the agreement becomes invalid if the conditions are not met. [VECER] In such a case, would it be politically wise for the government to make a standby arrangement before the elections? [Trpevski] It seems to me that the main talks will be held during the period of elections. My job is to work on concluding the arrangement and let those involved in the political aspects determine whether this is wise or not. [VECER] The question inevitably arises whether the government needs the loans which, with an STF arrangement, will lead to concessions that go beyond the usual standards applicable in the case of such arrangements. [Trpevski] Generally speaking, these are not concessions. They express the belief of the government about the economy, to the effect that this is the best way for resolving the situation in which we find ourselves, bearing in mind the interests of the state and not narrow party interests. The state interest is for this country to have a stable economy, for that is the only way in which it could participate in international affairs. [VECER] What about the interests of the economy? [Trpevski] They should be the same. It is in the interest of the economy to work under conditions of stability and there can be no stable conditions if inflation is high. [VECER] You said that we had rejected selective loans to finance agriculture, without any pressure on the part of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The budget will reduce its financing of agriculture and this entire burden is now being shifted to the banks, which are as yet to improve their situation. To what extent would they be able to do so, and how much would go to agriculture? [Trpevski] Let us be clear about one thing, to begin with. The worst solution is to finance any kind of production by printing more money. In most countries, agriculture is given some protection. However, all such protection is based on real sources. Only thus could we have a healthy noninflationary economy. If we agree on this point, I think that there would be no problems and we should not raise the question of whether we should have selective loans or not. This would mean that such selective loans could be abandoned and ensure support from budget funds. [VECER] Will there be less budget support? [Trpevski] It is the same as last year's. [VECER] Is this a suitable time for such an operation? [Trpevski] If we wait, tomorrow will be more difficult. Postponing this step for the future has brought us to a dead-end, and we can no longer go on like this. [VECER] Does such an impasse force us to borrow more to be able to repay the old loans? [Trpevski] Yes. In the eyes of the international financing institutions we must be viewed as paying old debts regularly. It is only thus that we can improve our chances in holding discussions with the other two creditors: the Paris and London Clubs, in order to settle our debts to them. Such conditions must be met before we sit down to talk with the Paris Club. We are not in a position to impose upon them our own conditions. To begin with, we must have an arrangement with the Fund. The second condition is to solve problems related to repaying the amounts we owe to these privileged international financial institutions. We are doing this. There is also another condition that has as yet not been settled (it was settled by Slovenia and Croatia). It is the matter of $3 billion of the so-called nonallocated share of the debt of former Yugoslavia, so that our share would be the one agreed upon according to the quotas assigned by the International Monetary Fund. As a government, we have not stated our position, but we must do so quickly, for without this there will be no talks. False Dilemmas [VECER] Does this not indicate that, once again, the economy will be burdened with new loans? [Trpevski] Let us clear up this issue. We owe the World Bank $107 million, which we must repay if we wish to obtain new funds. Currently we are repaying this debt in such a way that $25 or $30 million will be paid by someone else (the donors). This means that in the worst case we would be owing less to the bank. Second, one share of the debt, let us say the loan from the International Development Agency, is interest-free and we repay debts which are interest-bearing so that, if nothing else were to happen, at least the interest on the debt has been paid. Another share of the loan is repaid from loans granted by the Fund and the World Bank under the same or somewhat better conditions than we had in the past. [VECER] However, there is a stipulation according to which we have substantially exceeded the level of indebtedness. [Trpevski] With the conclusion of the arrangement with the Fund and settling our obligations to the World Bank and the other privileged institutions, as well as membership in the International Development Agency, we are engaged in talks with the Paris and London Clubs with a view to finding a way to reduce our indebtedness. They may agree to this. This is a way to relieve the economy. Chances are good that as a result of our steps the indebtedness coefficient will be lowered. [VECER] Is it a standard option for IDA members to expect a lowering of their indebtedness between 35 and 50 percent in the course of their talks with the Paris and London Clubs? [Trpevski] At this point I cannot be more specific. I will insist on the need to appoint an expert team for the talks. In general, this is not a question of any kind of party involvement, for if such were to be the case I would give up. [VECER] When should we expect such talks to begin? [Trpevski] The moment we clear the problems with the World Bank and reach an agreement within the government concerning the third problem, which is assuming a share of the unallocated debt. At that point we shall be prepared to begin the talks, above all with the Paris Club. [VECER] What is the latest plan for repaying the $107 million owed to the World Bank? [Trpevski] This is based on the funds supplied by the donors, estimated at about $25 million. However, the final answer will be known by the 14th of this month. For example, Turkey has indicated that the $1 million it has pledged will be given to us somewhat later. That is why we shall have to use more of the funds coming from the Soros Loan. [VECER] The use of the Soros Loan is probably a forced step, for the government believed that this option is much more costly than the use of foreign currency reserves. [Trpevski] Yes, this option is more costly. However, we have already transferred $24 million from the currency reserves, $25 million from donors, $17.5 million from the Fund, $30 million from the IDA and between $11 and $15 million from Soros. [VECER] In the system of repaying our debts, the Netherlands is playing a rather sensitive leading role. However, it is unclear why, let us say, the European Union was so strict and did not allow the FARE [expansion unknown] and the EKO [expansion unknown] funds to be used to pay a share of the debt? [Trpevski] In my view, there are three reasons. First, bureaucracy is not slow only in Macedonia but virtually throughout the world, which also means the European Union. The second reason is the budget problems which are affecting all members of the European Union, above all due to the deep recession. In this case we should also take into consideration the influence of our southern neighbor. [VECER] Finally, are you getting ready to be the first Macedonian representative to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank? [Trpevski] The Macedonian quota is so small that we can have no representative at the Fund or the World Bank. For example, in our World Bank group the executive director comes from the Netherlands, and his deputy from Romania; the representative in the Fund is from Ukraine.
