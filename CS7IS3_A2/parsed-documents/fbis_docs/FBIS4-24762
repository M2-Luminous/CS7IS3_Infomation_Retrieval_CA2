Ding Xinhua, president of the Shanghai U.S. Studies Society, Shanghai International Research Institute research fellow, and Shanghai U.S. Studies Office director, also provided some background material for reference. Ding Xinhao had just attended the "International Symposium on Economic Sanctions" in the United States. Big Differences Within the Clinton Administration Ding Xinhao said: According to an executive order signed by President Clinton on 28 May, 1993, the U.S. President has to announce his decision on whether to renew China's MFN status before 3 June 1994. As there were two antagonistic views, one favoring economic interests, the other favoring political interests, in the country and major differences of opinion within the administration, the President was caught in an embarrassing dilemma. Within the Clinton administration, nearly all of the officials in charge of economic affairs opposed applying sanctions against China, including Treasury Secretary Bentsen, Commerce Secretary Brown, the president's representative for trade negotiations, and some others. They greatly differed in opinion from Clinton's China policymakers. The U.S. officials insisting on sanctions against China were Secretary of State Christopher; National Security Adviser Lake; Suterbo [suo te bo 4792 3676 0130], national security committee executive chairman; and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord. As the two opposing factions had great influence over his China policy, Clinton had no choice but to reconsider his position on the MFN issue. Ding Xinhao noted that, since coming into office, Clinton has adhered to three foreign policy principles, specifically, revitalizing the U.S. economy, maintaining a certain military strength, and implementing democracy in the world. On the premise of differences of opinion within the administration, Clinton began comprehensively reevaluating U.S. interests. In the end, he decided to unconditionally renew China's MFN status with a view to "revitalizing the U.S. economy." On the other hand, while Clinton was caught in this dilemma, the Chinese Government, without compromising its basic principles, adopted a positive approach toward the human rights issue, thus giving Clinton an honorable way out. Why the China Policy Had To Be Changed The executive order signed on 28 May 1993 exposed several flaws in the Clinton administration's China policy. The executive order, a product of compromise between the President and the Congress, stated: China's MFN status can be renewed with no strings attached for the year 1993. However, China's MFN status will only be renewed for the year 1994 on condition that China has met seven "human rights" conditions by that time. These unrealistic "human rights" conditions placed Clinton in a "vicious circle": To lose "face" by renewing China's MFN status or to cause a retrogression in Sino-U.S. relations and make China and the United States suffer in respect of economic and trade growth by revoking China's MFN status. All these problems were actually the result of a very confused China policy. The "WASHINGTON POST" published on 5 May of this year a letter written by Winston Lord to Secretary of State Christopher. Both Winston Lord and Christopher are Clinton's Asia policymakers. In the letter, Winston Lord complained about Clinton's unsuccessful Asia policy as well as the confusion in the Asia policy prevalent at that time. The letter fully exposed the differences and policy confusion among the administration's Asia policymakers. The decision made yesterday by Clinton to unconditionally renew China's MFN status and delink the MFN issue from human rights was unmistakably a sign of an impending end to the administration's confusion about its China policy. No sooner is the MFN issue resolved than it is time for Clinton to comprehensively and realistically evaluate his China policy. How Should the Human Rights Issue and MFN Be Delinked? Why did Clinton announce yesterday that the human rights issue will be delinked from the MFN issue? Ding Xinhao made the following two points, believing that Clinton had no choice but to reach this conclusion. First, historical facts have borne out that applying sanctions against China by revoking China's MFN status to attain a certain political goal will never work. In the Cold War years, the United States imposed an "embargo" on the socialist countries to no avail. The embargo on grain shipments to the Soviet Union in 1980 failed to prevent the Soviet Union from sending troops into Afghanistan. Since the end of the Cold War, tremendous changes have taken place in the world. It has now become even more impossible to attain political goals through economic sanctions. The economic sanctions that the United States has imposed against certain small countries have only resulted in the loss of those countries' markets for the U.S. "allies" and have not achieved any benefit for the United States. As the economic sanctions applied against those small countries have failed, how could they succeed when applied to a country as large as China? Second, the practice of unilaterally linking human rights with economic issues and imposing sanctions against China is bound to make both sides suffer. According to a World Bank report, should the United States decide to revoke China's MFN status on the basis of human rights concerns, China would no doubt retaliate against it, thereby resulting in a disaster for both China and the United States. As a result, China's exports to the United States would drop by 42-96 percent, while the U.S. consumers would have to pay an additional $14.6 billion to find substitutes for the lost Chinese commodities. Moreover, China is expected to import commodities worth $700-1,000 billion over the next seven years, and the U.S. economy would certainly lose this opportunity. In 1993, China-bound U.S. exports, which were valued at $8.8 billion, created a total of 168,000 jobs in the United States. Should the United States impose sanctions on China, these jobs would certainly be lost. On the basis of these considerations, Clinton in the end decided to adopt a positive approach in order to avert possible losses.
