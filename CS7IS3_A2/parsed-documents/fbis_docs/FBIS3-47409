Amb. Kim Sam-hun and working-level aides will meet with Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state and top U.S. negotiator in the nuclear talks with Pyongyang, and other White House and administrative officials to tune their positions. The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, expected soon after Pyongyang agrees to resume inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will be the third round of such meetings. Seoul and Washington officials have said this meeting will discuss overall issues related to completely solving the North Korean nuclear problem, including U.S. relations improvement with the Stalinist state. North Korean Embassy officials in Vienna held a second contact with IAEA headquarters Monday [10 January] and are said to be nearing an accord on resuming the inspections, suspended in March last year. Another set of working-level talks between North Korea and the United States will precede the high-level meeting, and Kim will coordinate stances for both of these talks during his Washington trip, officials said.
