The first round of talks took place late on Wednesday [27 April] evening. Conducting a policy of positive neutrality and open doors, Turkmenistan is seriously concerned by the security problems close to its borders. As the Turkmen leader noted during the talks, the country's decision to adhere to the Partnership for Peace Program will enable it to pursue more actively ideas of broad international cooperation in its foreign policy. He pointed out that the program could become a real means of guaranteeing not only the security of the peoples of Europe, but of the regions that it borders. The Turkmen side took pleasure in noting that by displaying its practical aspiration toward organizing a dialogue between East and West, France had of late been paying more attention to the Central Asian region -- an explosive region of the world. In the opinion of Turkmen diplomacy, the conflicts in Tajikistan and Afghanistan pose a serious threat to international security. In turn, Francois Mitterrand welcomed the role being played by independent Turkmenistan in helping to resolve conflicts and overcome crises in the region peacefully. "We wish for a return to civil peace in Afghanistan and want that country to find internal accord once again. The United Nations must be brought more actively into this process to relieve the suffering of a people that has come into collision with the misfortune of war," the French president said. Recalling the proloned conflict in Afghanistan, he voiced his hope that Ashgabat would continue in the search for a peaceful settlement in that country. [passage omitted]
