The meeting included those who adhere to campaigns to discredit Cuba on the basis of highly manipulated and politicized issues. In this regard, Robaina stressed that Cuba is willing to listen to any idea or opinion, but that it cannot allow anyone to decide Cuba's destiny and future, for this lies only in the hands of the Cuban people. The issue of the Cuban debt to Argentina, estimated at $1 billion, was also discussed during Robaina's meeting with Carlos Sanchez, first vice economic minister [name and title as heard], and a large group of businessmen from various sectors. Regarding Cuba's debt, Robaina stressed that Cuba does not currently have the money or enough products with which to pay its debt. However, Cuba does not intend to pay its debt to Argentina or any other country by making an issue of it. Robaina added that Cuba believes the profits from foreign investments in sectors that generate exports is one way to pay the debt. He added that Cuba truly wishes to repay its debt and to create a climate in which to bilaterally take things one step at a time and with both feet firmly planted on the ground. Robaina's agenda also included a meeting with former President Raul Alfonsin, and friends of Cuba who met to express their support and solidarity with the Cuban people.
