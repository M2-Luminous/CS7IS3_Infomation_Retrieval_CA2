The maintenance written plan will also include a description of the equipment to be maintained and the recommended maintenance procedures and frequency of performance. Preferably, the plan should contain the equipment maintenance manuals issued upon completion of facility construction. For establishments in buildings with natural ventilation, employers will develop a plan to assure that windows, doors, vents, stacks and other portals designed or used for natural ventilation are in operable condition. The cost associated with compiling such information will vary depending on the size of the establishment building, the complexity of the building system, the extent to which such information is already available, and type of occupancy (e.g., single establishment or multi-establishment). In some cases some establishments especially the large ones may already have developed such information. For example, in 1986, IBM initiated a program by first evaluating building design, operation and maintenance and as a result, an IAQ program was devised to include: a model operation/maintenance and IAQ awareness program for building operation/maintenance personnel, an updated building commissioning document and appropriate building lease and contracted operation/maintenance agreements [Ex. 3&hyph;904]. There are no data on the number of establishments with IAQ programs. Based on information in the docket, OSHA assumed that 95 percent of all establishments are required to develop the IAQ compliance program information. In addition, employers are required to: (1) identify a designated person who is given the responsibility of the IAQ compliance program, (2) keep written records of employee complaints of building-related illness and maintenance records, and (3) set up procedures to be utilized during renovation and modeling to minimize degradation of the indoor air quality of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the building. The cost equation for developing the written IAQ compliance program: C o =E n ×P c ×((W t ×T 1 )+(W m ×T 2 )) where C o =the cost of developing operation and maintenance information E n =the number of establishments P c =the percentage of establishments to develop operation and maintenance information (95%) W t =the technician wage rate ($15.51 hourly compensation rate) T 1 =the technician time required to compile and develop building system operation and maintenance information (1 hour) W m =the managerial wage rate ($30.48 hourly compensation rate) T 2 =the managerial time required to develop some requirements of the written plan (15 minutes) As presented in Table VI&hyph;9, the one time annualized cost of compiling and developing the written IAQ compliance program is $21.2 million.
