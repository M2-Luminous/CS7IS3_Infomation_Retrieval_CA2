FR940930-1-00065 FR940930-1-00020 (3) That liabilities be associated with failure to examine and act upon prenotifications that may be originated by the Government. (4) A regulatory framework for equitable adjustments when a financial institution either has been enriched, or harmed, as a result of erroneous ACH entries. The provision will allow Federal agencies to abide by industry rules if they have independent authority and choose to do so. (5) That after due consideration of commercial practices, the Service may publish procedures under which it may authorize reversing entries to correct duplications or errors. (6) Improvements to the reclamation of post-death benefits portion of the regulation, and a framework for paperless processing of the information and money associated with these transactions. (7) To substitute certain terms used in the ACH Rules for terms which the Government uses in the same way as those defined in the ACH Rules , and to include those terms the Government uses differently from the ACH Rules or which are not contained in the ACH Rules . For example, current Part 210 uses the term ``payment date,'' while the ACH Rules use the term ``settlement date.'' Since both of these terms are used in the same way, the Service will use the term ``settlement date.'' The Service will accept or reject amendments to the NACHA Operating Rules and NACHA Operating Guidelines which may affect Government ACH transactions. Therefore, Section 210.2(a)(4) proposes that ``The Service will indicate its acceptance or rejection of amendments to NACHA Operating Rules and NACHA Operating Guidelines in effect on September 27, 1994, by publishing a notice in the Federal Register prior to the effective date of the amendments.'' Rulemaking Analysis Treasury has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The included changes are expected to result in improvements to the ACH process with advantages to institutions and recipients.
