Indeed, the dialogue was interrupted by telephone conversations with the military command, the Foreign Ministry, and Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil in Sanaa to follow up on the raging battles in Yemen and their domestic and foreign repercussions. After war broke out between the forces of what were two parts of the country, why did President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih turn down the Arab mediation offers to contain the deteriorating situation in Yemen and the Arab League's offer to send forces to disengage the two warring factions? [Basindwah] Let me first explain the situation. When 'Ali Salim al-Bid secluded himself in Aden in the middle of August, we accepted all national, Arab, and international mediation offers to persuade him to return to perform his duties in Sanaa. We even accepted all his personal conditions to return and agreed on all the proposals and formulas proposed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to resolve the political crisis. President Salih and the People's Congress agreed without reservation because our main objective was to preserve the Yemeni unity for which the people struggled. Since unity was established in May 1990 the YSP leadership has continued its political pressure and blackmail to gain more posts, influence, and funds. Despite this, our response was immediate, appreciating the YSP's choice of merger, its ceding leadership in the south after 23 years of rule, and because we wanted the unity process to continue as it started, with the integration of the unified political will of the People's Congress and the YSP. Regrettably, despite the success in merging the official state's institutions in both parts of Yemen, the YSP continued for four years to place obstacles before the merger of the Armed Forces, although the General Command of the Northern and Southern Armed Forces and the post of defense minister were given to the YSP so that it might not evade responsibility or claim that the merger was hindered by the People's Congress during and after the transitional stage. The YSP hindered the merging of the two Armed Forces so that it would remain in control of the command of the Southern Forces and use this card to blackmail, pressure, and terrorize anyone who rejected total obedience in the provinces of the South, as was the case when it ruled the South. [Al-Sharif] Do you believe that the continuing separation of the Armed Forces was the main factor behind the political crisis and its aggravation? [Basindwah] In the pluralistic democratic formula that the YSP called for as a framework for unity, it was politically unacceptable to remain a partner in the government with sovereignty and legislative and executive powers and at the same time play the role of opposition to the constitutional and legitimate regime of the unified state. Logically, it had to choose between siding with the government or the opposition. But al-Bid chose a duplicitous stance and rejected all the solutions put forward by the mediators to heal the rift and ease the political crisis through dialogue with President Salih or between the two parties or among the tripartite ruling coalition that includes the Reform Grouping. From his seclusion in Aden, he persisted in increasing the differences. The People's Congress called for a comprehensive national dialogue on the causes of the crisis and its negative repercussions and to find a way to emerge from the labyrinth created by the YSP. The participants in the dialogue worked out the Pledge and Accord Document with the participation of all parties in the government and opposition and public figures. I would like to ask you if al-Bid returned to Sanaa to take the constitutional oath as vice president, for which the agreement in Amman provides. Why have the YSP ministers and deputies retrenched in Aden? What is their goal and purpose? [Al-Sharif] I am afraid I cannot answer that question; the Yemenis know more about their affairs than anybody else. [Basindwah] They leaked their intention to return to the days of partition three and a half years after the establishment of unity, in an unexpected statement by Salim Salih, the YSP's assistant secretary general. Salih dropped a bombshell by proposing federation as a substitute to merger unity. They threatened that if we reject federation, we may regret it later on. Naturally we rejected it because unity came to rectify an error and handle conspiracies that were not created by the Yemeni people. Unity also affirmed a fact that was known on the ground and in the history books, namely, that we are one people. It was not a unity between two peoples, two parties, and two countries, as was the case in the unity between Egypt and Syria. You know that throughout Yemen the entire people, even simple-minded people, refused to refer to the North and South before the establishment of unity. We used to say the southern part and the northern part. [Al-Sharif] We are past this stage now. In the absence of reason and dialogue, the military option has triumphed over the political options that were always available, even in the darkest moments. Egypt has been a major partner in supporting the 26 September revolution in the North and 14 October in the South. It has sacrificed thousands of its best men and supplied Yemenis with weapons, which we imported with our own money, and technical experts to modernize Yemen so that it could restore its past glory. On this basis, we have a right to ask: Why did you get involved in the military option? [Basindwah] It is my right and duty to admit with pride and honor Egypt's military, political, and cultural role. Were it not for this role, the fate of our revolution would have been similar to earlier revolutions and uprisings in Yemen, which were wiped out after a few weeks or days, simply because our Arab brothers ignored our legitimate humanitarian desire for liberation and freedom. But what do you have to say about the Scuds that the YSP troops are now firing at random against Sanaa, Ta'izz, and Dhamar? Is the murder of dozens of defenseless civilians and the destruction of homes and vital installations the practical embodiment of the plan of the cultural modernization of the unified state of Yemen, about which the YSP leadership has been bragging? [Al-Sharif] Didn't the Northern Army carry out similar military operations against civilians in Aden and other Southern governorates? [Basindwah] We challenge the YSP to prove any military act committed by the Armed Forces of the unified state against civilians. These were the strict orders of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his capacity as the supreme commander. I would like to correct many of the mistakes persistently made by the media organs of the YSP and the external forces that support its conspiracy with regard to the military plan to extend the authority of the constitutional legitimacy of the state of unity throughout the country. This plan does not place the seizure of Aden at the head of its priorities; it merely seeks, in what I am at liberty to say, to lay siege to its approaches, exit points, and roads leading to it. As for the collapse of the secessionist clique in the YSP, which is fortifying itself inside Aden, this is the job and responsibility of the people and the unionist leaders and elements in the YSP and its Armed Forces. Our wager is on the people's adherence to unity and on the suffering and oppression that have pained them under the fascist and totalitarian rule of the Southern part. [Al-Sharif] We have not settled the issue of who is responsible for starting the fighting and choosing the military option. [Basindwah] The conspiracy scenario began to be implemented immediately after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in Amman. We were surprised by a ferocious attack by the YSP's Armed Forces on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which was stationed in the Abyan area in the Southern governorates. The attack failed. The president, who is also supreme commander, made a strenuous effort to contain the military crisis provoked by the YSP's separatist leaders. They provoked it after their political efforts to repartition the country failed. Several days later they provoked another military clash in the Harf area in the Northern governorates and failed again. They repeated these military tactics near Shabwah's oil fields in the Southern governorates. These battles were limited to offensive action by their side and moves to repulse them by the legitimate forces. Earlier it was possible to contain any attempts to expand the fighting and handle the issue by political methods, regarding what had happened as a mere escalation of tension. This situation continued until the YSP forces carried out an all-out offensive in the 'Imran area. It was a criminal, separatist, premeditated attack. [Al-Sharif] The reports on who began the fighting in 'Imran were conflicting. [Basindwah] Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Yemeni military committee that includes Jordanian and Omani officers and the U.S. and French military attaches was carrying out its duties in the 'Imran camp at the time. This committee is more competent and reliable than other parties in giving testimony and pointing an accusing finger at the guilty side. The committee members had a miraculous escape when fighting erupted between the 2d Armored Brigade, which receives its orders from the YSP separatists, and a brigade serving under the legitimate command. The 2d Brigade's commander fired several shots as a sign to begin the fighting. The brigade under the legitimate command took no heed and refused to fire back. Mujahid al-Kahhali, a reserve officer who leads a so- called corrective movement and who was in the camp without having official business there, detonated a highly explosive charge. This caused confusion and the two brigades clashed, destroying each other in hours. The military committee could not contain the situation. The president immediately visited the wounded from both brigades and supervised the aerial transfer of seriously wounded troops to a medical center in Jordan. He announced that the wounded troops from both sides were Yemenis and that their plight pained the entire nation. He said the dead troops were martyrs of a united Yemen and ordered compensation of 20,000 rials for every dead officer of the YSP brigade and 10,000 rials for every dead soldier. He also ordered that new weapons and ammunition be issued to those who survived, giving them leave from duty until after the 'Id al-Adha feast. But the premeditated political crisis resurfaced in the Dhamar area. A YSP commander ordered the units of the Ba Suhayb Brigade to deploy outside the camp with their tanks and large and medium-caliber guns. This was a blatant violation of the agreement reached within the military committee and constituted disobedience of the orders issued by Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, defense minister, commander of the Armed Forces, and a YSP official. The brigade commander subjected the city of Dhamar to tension and apprehension. I carried out several contacts with the defense minister in Aden--most YSP ministers were by now living there until the situation cleared up--but his brother the commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade maintained his attitude and insisted on deploying outside the camp. At 2010 on a Wednesday evening two weeks ago we were with the president at the Presidential Palace in Sanaa when he received an urgent telephone call from the Army General Command reporting that the brigade had opened fire on a Republican Guard battalion stationed on the other side of Dhamar and that the city's main electric power plant had been destroyed. The president, in his capacity as supreme commander, issued an order to both sides to observe a cease-fire. He also ordered the Republican Guard battalion not to return the brigade's fire but to take precautionary measures. [Al-Sharif] Information has it that the Ba Suhayb Brigade observed the cease-fire. [Basindwah] Yes. The two sides observed the cease-fire for a short time. But 45 minutes later a ferocious attack with tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery was launched against 1,200 officers and men of the Central Security Forces in Aden who carried only light weapons. This was a brutal act of extermination in full view of the public. The YSP forces launched a second brutal offensive against an armored brigade under legitimate command in the Radfan area. The situation erupted and it became impossible to control the synchronized attacks in most areas, all of which were part of the separatist conspiracy. Some YSP forces joined the legitimate forces, other YSP forces fled, and some are still fighting. No one is saying this side won and that side was defeated. All are Yemenis and the loss is the entire country's loss. It is difficult to replace troops and weapons. [Al-Sharif] Don't you think the president has the necessary powers as supreme commander to order a cease-fire so as to avoid further casualties and destruction and before the fighting turns into a full-scale North-South civil war? Some enemies of Yemen would like to attribute a sectarian nature to this strife, saying that it is a conflict between the [Shiite] Zaydi tribes and the [Sunni] Shafi'ites. [Basindwah] Civil war always occurs between two groups of the same nation or even between two sects. This is what Yemen's enemies hope for. But Yemen is united now in a state made legitimate by popular referendum. The people were unanimous in choosing unity and a single constitution. I believe things will return to normal in a few days, that the conspiracy will fail, and that those who plotted against unity and constitutional legitimacy will stand trial. [Al-Sharif] What is the aim of your diplomatic tour, which began in Cairo and took in Jordan, Syria, and the Gulf countries, after the president rejected mediation and turned down the Arab League's offer to send Arab forces to disengage the two warring sides? [Basindwah] Arab and foreign mediation was required during the political crisis when the YSP was keeping its conspiracy against unity, constitutional legitimacy, and the elected government under wraps. Mediation now should focus on persuading the rebellious conspiring group to accept the legitimate authority and listen to the call of reason and democracy. This is why the government has declared that what is happening is a domestic Yemeni affair. Those who wish to carry out good offices must help us to control the situation and preserve the country's unity. They must not deal with those officials who have lost their legal status. [Al-Sharif] I would like to remind you of Yemen's position during the Gulf crisis. Yemen urged an inter-Arab solution. [Basindwah] Yes, that was our position. We still want an Arab solution that will defend constitutional legitimacy, maintain our unity and sovereignty, and safeguard our nation. This is why we turned down the offer to have Arab forces sent to us, because what is happening--as I said--is an internal Yemeni affair. The disengagement of forces would mean recognizing the separatist rebels as an independent entity. We have responded to every mediation effort and agreed to make every possible concession. But the conspirators have always backed down and refused to implement the agreements. They insisted on the return of the YSP forces to the South and the return of the legitimate forces to the North. This was an introduction to their declared secession. We knew of this conspiracy from the beginning. We rejected it politically. They tried then to make it a fact by military secession. [Al-Sharif] Does this mean the abolition or dissolution of the YSP? [Basindwah] Certainly not, because Yemen has chosen democracy and pluralism. We are discussing a conspiratorial and secessionist group. But this does not mean the YSP leadership has no elements who support unity, adhere to legitimacy, reject hegemony, and believe in democracy. The decision to dismiss the vice president was adopted with the unanimous legal vote of the House of Representatives, including YSP representatives. The same applies to the dismissal of Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who suddenly and without the permission of the president traveled to the United States, where he spent four days in hospital on the pretext of receiving treatment. He and his entire family are now enjoying themselves in the parks of Florida. The same goes for the dismissal of the Aden governor and the defense minister, who are the heads of the sedition. As for the dismissal of the petroleum minister, he is accused of stealing over $350 million in oil royalties. These dismissed officials will be replaced by other honest YSP elements. [Al-Sharif] The telephone rang and the Yemeni foreign minister lifted the headset and started a long conversation with the General Command in Sanaa, the Foreign Ministry, and the Interior Ministry. He asked about the military situation, affirming that his meeting with President Husni Mubarak was positive and that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry constantly briefs him on the current situation in Yemen. I asked him if I could speak with Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil. I asked al-Mutawakkil about the widespread rumors of the arrests of YSP officials in North Yemen. Al-Mutawakkil said: These are seditious rumors by the YSP. Only very few people were arrested to secure the rear of the legitimate forces when accusations of provocation and political mobilization were proved against them. Among those arrested is 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Saqqaf, chief editor of the YEMEN TIMES, who published seditious and alarming statements that 12,000 people were killed in the fighting, while news agency correspondents and the statements issued in Aden and Sanaa put the dead in the hundreds. Al-Mutawakkil said: We hope to end the state of emergency once the fighting stops and the constitutional legitimate authority imposes its authority throughout Yemen. The overall security situation is reassuring. The indiscriminate shelling of Sanaa and Ta'izz by Scud missiles has alarmed the people but has increased their determination to confront those who rebel against unity and those who plot against constitutional legitimacy. I asked Basindwah about the course of the fighting in light of his conversation with the General Command in Sanaa. [Basindwah] The legitimate forces are now besieging Aden at Dar Sa'd near the Shaykh 'Uthman quarter and at al-'Alam and al-'Anad, 50 km from Aden. The fall of Aden is a matter of time, because we want to preserve the life of the inhabitants and the vital installations. [Al-Sharif] And what about foreign reaction to the events in Yemen? [Basindwah] Diplomatic and security reports indicate that ships have arrived at Aden and Diya' al-Mukalla carrying weapons from particular states. [Al-Sharif] Which states? [Basindwah] We refuse to accuse anyone until we have tangible evidence. Generally speaking, the YSP has received arms consignments from East countries, including Bulgaria. These weapons were paid for from the $250 million in the Treasury of the Southern part before the days of unity. [Al-Sharif] We are afraid that rumors and misleading reports leaked to Sanaa and Aden are designed to worsen the military situation. [Basindwah] Can we deny that a consignment was seized in al- Hudaybah before the fighting started? The consignment contained military communications equipment and listening devices. From where did they bring the money? That is the question. [Al-Sharif] In a statement to a London-based Arab television station during the political crisis, President Salih said some sides paid to create the crisis. [Basindwah] But he refused to name the sides that pay. [Al-Sharif] Reportedly, Sudanese and Iraqis are fighting alongside the forces of legitimacy. [Basindwah] I will tell you of an incident showing the failure of the tendentious YSP propaganda: Nasir al-Sabili, the dismissed governor of Aden, announced the arrest of a group of people affiliated with the Egyptian al-Jihad organization and claimed that the General People's Congress objected to their extradition to Egypt. Egyptian Ambassador in Sanaa 'Ata Harun was contacted and he assigned the Egyptian consul to investigate. Meanwhile, the interior minister officially ordered the Aden governor to hand over the detained group to the Egyptian security authorities without any conditions or restrictions. But in Aden, the Egyptian consul discovered that the whole issue was a fabrication and that no arrests had been made. This is how the YSP uses its propaganda to incite the world against the legitimate authority. We challenge them to produce one Sudanese or Iraqi fighting within the ranks of the legitimate forces. This fact was confirmed by Ambassador Badr Hammam, Egypt's envoy to Yemen, during the political crisis. In my meeting with President Husni Mubarak to explain the situation in Yemen, Ambassador Hammam testified that Sanaa is innocent of those accusations. Similar rumors were disseminated during the Gulf war, with fabricated reports that Iraqi planes sought shelter in Yemen. Regrettably, the other day I read an article by an Egyptian writer claiming that 50,000 Iraqis remained in Yemen after the Gulf war and are now fighting against the forces of the YSP. What are foreign embassies and news agency correspondents doing in Yemen? Have they said anything to support these allegations? We must wonder about the motives and the mission of Salim Salih [a YSP official], who arrived in London before the military action and who is still there. And we must ask what Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas is doing in the United States. He said his mission was to try to get a cease-fire. So, did he know the YSP would soon ignite the war? [Al-Sharif] The YSP has accused the constitutional government of importing chemical and biological weapons before the war broke out. [Basindwah] This accusation deserves no response because it denies itself by itself. If it had been true, the United States would have announced it and imposed international sanctions on us. [Al-Sharif] By the way, how do you assess the U.S. position toward the disaster of the fighting in Yemen? [Basindwah] The United States has announced that it is eager for Yemeni unity, not out of fear for its economic and strategic interests in Yemen, because these are safe, but because it is no longer in conflict with any other superpower now that the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War and the policy of polarization have ended. The United States believes that unity is a factor of stability, security, and peace in the Arabian Peninsula. Divisions have always been a cause of tension and unrest. The Americans praised and valued our options for democracy and pluralism and they sent a high-ranking official to congratulate Yemen on successfully emerging from the experience of free and peaceful elections. In the oilfields, U.S. companies are continuing their activity, digging, building pipelines, and exporting oil regularly and efficiently. This perhaps explains our reassurance that the United States remains concerned about Yemeni unity. [Al-Sharif] But statements by the U.S. assistant secretary of state, which he made in the Gulf after his visit to Yemen and the eruption of fighting there, were interpreted by some observers as a change in the U.S. position toward unity. [Basindwah] He only answered correspondents' questions following his visit to Yemen. His answers were his personal interpretation of the progress of military operations and he did not commit the U.S. Government to them. Naturally, some observers are optimists, others are pessimists; some are realistic and credible in their analyses while others are not.
