"We are paving the way, in the light of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, for the smooth transfer of power in Macao at the end of this century. We are determined to do so in the next few years, for the purpose of guaranteeing greater social, economic and cultural development in Macao," the prime minister said at the meeting.
