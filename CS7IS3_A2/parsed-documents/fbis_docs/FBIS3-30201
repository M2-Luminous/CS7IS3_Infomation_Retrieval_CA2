All creative forces and teams of experts will gather to implement the program. There is no place for political splits and all parties must subordinate their activities to national and state interests. As far as economic measures are concerned, the president of the RSK announced the introduction of the "super" dinar. According to Martic, a unified monetary policy of Yugoslavia, the republic of Srpska and the RSK is the first step toward the creation of a joint state. Martic announced that he would meet the president of the republic of Srpska, Radovan Karadzic, after he had talks with Serbian President Milosevic. As far as the make-up of the new Krajina government is concerned and taking into account the multiparty structure of the Krajina parliament, due to meet in about ten days, Martic announced consultations and talks with the heads of parliamentary groups and party leaders and went on to express his belief that an agreement would be reached. In any case, the government will be competent, the RSK president stressed. He did not even hint who the new prime minister could be or which party he belonged to. When the largest parliamentary group, the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina, was mentioned in this context, Martic said that it did not have an absolute majority (32 out of 84 deputies) in the RSK parliament. Explaining the defense program, Martic said that an efficient and more economic army should be created, an army which would be prepared to defend and preserve the borders. As the supreme commander of the Serb army of Krajina, Martic announced his first steps after the parliament's session, pointing out that all incompetent people would have to go. This will also be true regarding all other state bodies and the police. Replying to one of the questions, Martic pledged that all state bodies would have their headquarters in Knin, including the ministry of foreign affairs, if this would prove to be efficient and appropriate. Outlining his plan for a more aggressive foreign policy, the RSK president pointed out that Krajina must achieve full status at all negotiations in the peace process. According to Martic, the RSK must achieve the status currently enjoyed by the republic of Srpska. Commenting on the declaration on the normalization of relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia, Martic said: "The declaration does not change anything in Krajina's status and it does not mention that Krajina is back in Croatia as Croatian politicians are claiming. In reality this is a document which seeks political solutions in a peaceful manner." This is also our aspiration and we want to hold talks with Croatia on an equal footing, to reach a peaceful agreement on life as neighbors and not under the same roof. As far as final demarcation with Croatia is concerned, Martic said that an internationally controlled referendum could be held so that the Serbian people would get their right to self-determination as all other peoples in the world.
