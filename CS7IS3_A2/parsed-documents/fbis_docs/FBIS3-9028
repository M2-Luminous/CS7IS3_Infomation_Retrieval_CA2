FBIS3-9028 "dreeu053__a94025" FBIS-EEU-94-053-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Christian Democrats Insist on Coalition Talks AU1703144194 Prague CTK in English 1340 GMT 17 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1703144194 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) insists on the necessity of conducting government coalition talks on fundamental political laws, including election legislation, KDU-CSL Chairman Josef Lux said on Thursday [17 March]. He stressed that along with Jan Kalvoda, chairman of the coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and head of the government's Legislative Office, he had asked that the government not discuss election bills before they were dealt with by the coalition. In spite of this the government dealt with the bills because Lux and Kalvoda had been outvoted by 11 votes in the "coalition thirteen." The coalition thirteen consists of the parliament chairman and deputy chairmen, the chairmen of the four coalition parties -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the ODA, the KDU-CSL and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- and the chairmen of the parliamentary deputies' groups. In February the government approved a bill on parliamentary elections. It has met with sharp criticism particularly from the ODA. It said that the ODS, the strongest government party, wanted to create one-mandate constituencies to ensure its dominance of the Senate, which is to be elected under the law. Lux said today his party did not feel bound by the government's decision. He also dismissed the opinion of KDS Chairman Vaclav Benda, who said on Tuesday [15 March] that he would vote in favor of bad election bills rather than to be left without the laws. The failure to pass legislation would be a tragedy, he added. "We are not voting for bad laws," Lux said today. He also addressed the security situation in the Czech Republic, saying that the development of society, including economic transformation, was threatened by rising crime. The KDU-CSL resolutely rejects the re-introduction of the death penalty, Lux stressed. He said the solution rested in prevention, in which a great role is played by a well functioning family. The party will seek ways of curbing the publicity given to brutality in the media, he added.
