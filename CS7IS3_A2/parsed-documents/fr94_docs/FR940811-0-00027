Compliance: Required within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the tail rotor blade (T/R) spar elliptical centering plug (centering plug) from disbonding and moving out of position, which could result in loss of tail rotor control and loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following for blades, part numbers (P/N) 76101&hyph;05001 and 76101&hyph;05101 series, with more than 130 hours' time-in-service: (a) Remove the blades in accordance with the maintenance manual and inspect the centering plug for disbonding of the polyurethane filler that fills the space between the aluminum centering plug and the graphite T/R spar in accordance with Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin 76&hyph;65&hyph;35A, Revision A, dated February 29, 1984 (ASB). (1) If the inspection of the centering plug shows no evidence of disbonding greater than one-half inch in length, install a retaining pad in accordance with paragraph 2.C. of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB. (2) For disbonds greater than one-half inch, but less than 2 inches in length, repair the blade in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(1) of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB. (3) For disbonds equal to or greater than 2 inches in length, but not complete disbonds, or for disbonded centering plugs with the polyurethane filler excessively cracked or deteriorated to the extent of breaking away from the T/R spar or the centering plug, remove the blade from service and replace with an airworthy blade. (4) For T/R spars with complete T/R spar to centering plug disbond in which the polyurethane filler is intact and remains fully bonded to the centering plug, repair in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(2) of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB. (5) For T/R spars with complete polyurethane filler to centering plug disbond in which the polyurethane filler is intact and remains fully bonded to the T/R spar, repair in accordance with paragraph 2.B.(3) of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB. (b) Install retaining pad, P/N 76102&hyph;05004&hyph;111, in accordance with paragraph 2.C. of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB.

Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Boston Aircraft Certification Office. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished if a retaining pad has been installed.
