The contracts' total value is over $6000 million. Kiselev told Interfax today that the deals envisioned launching the 21st low-orbit satellite within the framework of the global telecommunications system "Iridium" designed by the American "Motorola," one of the satellites of the third series of the international consortium INMARSAT, another one of the American company Loral, etc. Kiselev pointed out that the cooperation with Lockheed and signing the deals was possible only thanks to the Russian government's decision to join the system of international control of non-proliferation of missile technologies. At the moment, Russia does not have deals running counter to this treaty. According to Kiselev, the year of cooperation with American partners who took up marketing the most powerful Russian booster ever used and licensing satellites manufactured by western companies enabled the Russian Space and Missiles Center to pack up the program of commercial launches up to 2000 and look into the future with optimism.
