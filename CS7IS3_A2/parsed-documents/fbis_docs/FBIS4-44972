The senator is partly right in saying that the current "acrimony and bitterness" are the result of the Indian belief that a Democratic administration should be more friendly towards India than a Republican one. If, as he says, things have not quite worked out that way, it is presumably because Mr Clinton's ignorance about the complexities of politics in this part of the world has been compounded by the strange conviction in Washington apparently shared by both the Democrats and the Republicans that only the American viewpoint is valid. Otherwise, it is difficult to follow the logic of some of Mr Hamilton's observations. For instance, he wants India not to deploy the Prithvi missile as this will lead to greater tensions in South Asia, but it does not strike him that Pakistan's acquisition of more F-16s may do the same. Referring to India's contention that its security concerns relate to China as well, Mr Hamilton argues that Prithvi can be used only against Pakistan. But against whom will the F-16s, the M-11s and the Hatf missiles be used? The real thrust of Mr Hamilton's remarks is evident, however, in his gratuitous advice to India that it should aspire for a close partnership with the United States. His concept of partnership, however, is akin to what Ayub Khan once found hard to accept, as is clear from the title of his autobiography, Friends, Not Masters. With disarming candour, the good senator wants India to accept the fact that the United States today is the only superpower, for if it does not, "an antagonistic America would pose a substantial obstacle to Indian aspirations." Clearly, the principle of agreeing to disagree which is central to all democracies is currently at a discount in Washington. Mr Hamilton has also spelt out how the United States will bring India into line (for a close partnership, of course): "The U.S. support for concessional financing from the World Bank and the IMF is crucial if India hopes to address the economic and social needs of the people." The threat is obvious and even tends to confirm the long-standing Leftist belief that the two organisations are mere extensions of the American foreign policy establishment. But perhaps the most extraordinary part of Mr Hamilton's speech was his explanation for the current calm in Punjab--the ruthlessness of the Indian security forces "in suppressing the insurgency." His belief, however, that the people of Punjab may still be dissatisfied underlines a touching concern for popular feelings that was not much in evidence when the United States backed any number of brutal dictators ranging from Syngman Rhee, Ferdinand Marcos and Lon Nol to the Shah of Iran, Papa Doc and Baby Doc and General Pinochet.
