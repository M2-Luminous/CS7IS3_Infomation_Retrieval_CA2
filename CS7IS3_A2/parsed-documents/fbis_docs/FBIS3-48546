Colonel Rudi Supriatna, commander of 012 Military Area Command, said Thai trawlers flying Indonesian flags, who operate in the western Aceh waters, often violate this clause. The commander, who was aboard the Indonesian Navy's Nomad plane along with Navy Commodore Widodo, commander of the Western Fleet's Naval Combat Group, made an inspection tour of western Aceh waters today. During the inspection tour, they found three foreign fishing boats in (Calang) waters, western Aceh, at about 156 km west of Banda Aceh and they were operating within 12 miles from the coast. Another violation committed by the trawlers was the use of drift nets, which are capable of catching all types of fish.
