Lt-Col Andy Miller, SAPU national and Western Cape president, said on Monday [4 April] that members were prepared to "sacrifice the election" if their demands for wage parity were not implemented by April 13. The union, which represents 20,000 members, made the threat despite a Transitional Executive Council (TEC) proposal to treble police salaries from R22.50 [rands] to R61.50. The TEC Law and Order Sub-committee is expected to hear the proposal on Thursday. Col Miller said, however, that a crippling strike on the eve of the election could only be averted if police were paid the same as their NPKF counterparts, many of whom earned double. "I wouldn't call that blackmail. I'd call it justice. We've been treated like animals," he said. He said the TEC's proposed increases would fail to match those of the NPKF, whose members would earn an additional R35 per day once they were deployed. "We will not allow policemen to strike," Law and Order Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said on Thursday. He said there was "no reason" for a stoppage and "all channels were in place" for policemen to air their grievances.
