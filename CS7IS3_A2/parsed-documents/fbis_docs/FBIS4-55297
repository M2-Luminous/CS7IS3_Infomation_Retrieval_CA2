The decision has not yet been submitted to the National Assembly office. The decision might sound strange, but legal experts in the National Assembly pointed out that according to the aforementioned articles the National Assembly could adopt such a decision and then adopt a special procedure for setting new elections, whose date should be fixed by the president of the Republic. According to a member of the Radical Democratic Party, of which Yordanov also is a member, Yordanov's motives are related to the fact that the National Assembly is not adoptingthe important economic bills and is thus blocking reform in the country.
