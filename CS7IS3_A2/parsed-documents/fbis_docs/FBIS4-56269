The president said he would guarantee the strike scheduled for 2 May. During an open meeting at Lopez Palace, the presidents of the San Pedro, Caaguazu, Misiones, and Central Colorado Party precincts asked the president for Education Minister Nicanor Duarte Frutos' head. Colorado Party mayors and governors were also present. The Colorado Party leaders, including the controversial Emiliano Garcia, who allegedly was the leader of a mob involved in the attack against Congress [on 7 October 1993, to protest the approval of a bill banning military people from becoming involved in partisan politics], placed themselves at Wasmosy's disposal for the 2 May strike. The Colorado Party leaders said they were willing to mobilize if the president so orders. They even used indecent terms, involving sexual positions, to describe their unconditional willingness. Santani Colorado Party leader Victor Quintana literally said: We are putting ourselves on all fours before you. The Colorado Party grassroots leaders also asked the executive branch for more assistance and the ability to appoint and remove officials. In response, Wasmosy began his speech by furiously attacking the press. Concerning the strike, he said it has political grounds. Wasmosy added: We will demonstrate that we can remain calm. He also indicated that they were teasing a tiger, and that the government would not be weak in its actions. [Begin Wasmosy recording] I can guarantee you that we will act firmly and abiding by the law. We will protect those joining the strike because they have a right to strike. Nevertheless, they have no right to prevent other people from working, as do those professors, teachers, and movements disguised as democratic that tell the students: Do not come to school on 2 May because it will be dangerous, or because there will be no transportation. These people are insincere democrats. The Colorado Party is democratic. Tell me if there is one journalist here who has been harassed, if one medium has been harassed, or if one person with a different political leaning has been harassed. They say what they please, and even what they should not, every day from 0600 onwards. Nevertheless, the Colorado Party is great, and it will always emerge a victor. Gentlemen, we should actually take into account what has been raised here: a firm organization, with republican bases and principles, an unequaled nationalist, agrarian, and republican party. Nevertheless, we have been branded as having implemented neoliberal policies, with being absolutists, when the party actually takes the people into account, created solutions, and proven itself.
