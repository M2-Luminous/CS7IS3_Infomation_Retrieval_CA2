Trial production is now being carried out on the site of a Menzolit factory in Germany. Kobe Steel and Menzolit have been in a tie-up since 1990 for development of resin molding processes and related technology mainly for auto parts. The German firm has been committed to developing an intermediate material and the Japanese firm, a heat-applied molding process, to complete the new process. The intermediate material is in the form of a cylinder--measuring 20cm in diameter and 15cm in length--made from thermo-plastic resin powder such as polypropylene and from glassfiber (6-25mm in length). The material is press-molded (extruded) in an atmosphere of inert gas at the temperature which is the melting point of the resin used. The new extruder can heat the material uniformly so as not to deteriorate the resin on heating and not to break the reinforcing fiber. Molding products made in this way are said to have better appearance. This process is claimed to be most suitable for producing parts with complex shapes and of uniform strength.
