FR940602-2-00165 FR940602-2-00094 The agency recognizes that a holder may pay annual fees on both permits if the current use is kept while the use on the in-lieu lot is being constructed. Thus, it has inserted guidance that a partial fee waiver under existing agency policy may be appropriate on the in-lieu lot. Readers are also advised that for consistency in terminology, the word ``lot'' replaces the word ``site'' throughout the policy when referring to in-lieu locations. 7. Termination During Term of Permit. Three provisions of the proposed policy discussed actions to be taken when a recreation residence permit had to be terminated before its term expired. The overall policy at FSM 2347.1 listed four reasons for terminating a permit: (1) When it is in the public interest; (2) when there is an uncorrected breach of a permit provision; (3) when the site has been rendered unsafe by catastrophic events; and (4) when there is other cause as provided in 36 CFR 251.60. In adding this language, the proposed policy removed a provision of the 1988 policy that required termination actions to follow the same procedures established for permit continuation or nonrenewal. Termination actions would follow procedures for the four listed events, rather than for those procedures for continuance or nonrenewal as the 1988 policy provided. Direction at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 16, of the proposed policy reflected revisions to the overall policy, stating termination could occur only in accordance with applicable regulations and the terms and conditions of the permit. It also required the authorized officer (Forest Supervisor) to submit a proposed termination for review by the next higher official (Regional Forester). This review would only examine the adequacy of the analysis and documentation. If deficient, the proposed action would be returned to the authorized officer for correction and reconsideration. This provision also proposed use of the term ``monies'' in place of ``appropriations'' as used in the 1988 policy to describe the requirement that the Government must pay for the holders improvements if terminating a permit before expiration of its term, except when termination is the result of breach of the permit's provisions. The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23i gave direction only for termination actions resulting from noncompliance of the terms and provisions of the permit. It required written notice to the holder and a reasonable period to correct the violation. The action could be taken only if noncompliance continues after the holder receives notice and the period allowed for correction. This provision was nearly identical to the 1988 policy. Comment. There were 5 responses to these provisions of the proposed policy. Respondents felt the phrase ``in the public interest'' was vague and apparently confused the phrase with direction elsewhere in the proposed policy dealing with permit expiration and alternative public use. They felt that termination should occur only when covered by the Forest plan and other alternatives to removal of the use considered. Most of the respondents agreed that termination during the permit term should occur only when funds are available to purchase the improvements. They agreed that the word ``monies'' is preferable to the word ``appropriations.'' One respondent, however, felt that payment for the holder's improvements should be based on the cost of the improvements less depreciation. Commenting on the direction in FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 16, one respondent suggested that ``applicable regulations'' should be specified. Most of the respondents agreed that proposed termination actions by the Forest Supervisor should be reviewed by the Regional Forester but suggested that the standards for analysis and documentation for the proposed termination should be made clear. Response. Readers are reminded that the agency, in seeking consistency in policy terminology, has substituted the word revocation for the word termination when describing actions that end a permit before the end of the term specified in the permit. Further, the word termination is used to describe the cessation of a permit as a result of a fixed or agreed-upon event, which would include reaching the end of the term specified in the permit. With this in mind, readers are advised that revocation of the permit during its term and termination of the permit are two separate and distinct actions, each unrelated to the other. Revocation of the permit occurs when one of the four actions listed in FSM 2347.1, paragraph 5, is triggered. Revocation of the permit when in the public interest is not an action resulting from direction in the Forest plan. Rather, it results from an urgent and pressing need to reclaim the land for another public use before the action can be considered through the Forest planning process and the procedure for considering alternative public uses can be implemented. For example, the construction or relocation of a public highway may require removal of the recreation residence because the only feasible right-of-way is on land occupied by this use. Authority to revoke a permitted use before the permit term is completed is found at 36 CFR 251.60. This citation is added to this provision in the final policy. It is the need to reclaim the land before completion of the permit term that requires the Government to pay for the improvements that must be removed. The Forest Service recognizes that an action to revoke a permit before completion of the term must be done under a procedure that ensures fairness and equity to the holder. It has revised paragraph 5 in the final policy to clarify that revocation would occur only when there is an urgent need to use the lot and the forest planning process cannot be used. The agency also recognizes the concern of respondents that revocation actions be reviewed by a higher agency official. However, it must point out that to maintain the integrity of its current appeal regulations it cannot permit the higher level official to review a decision before it is made. When a Forest Supervisor's decision is appealed, the Regional Forester is the reviewing officer. The language in the proposed policy on review of revocation actions will be maintained in the final policy. The agency believes that use of the word ``monies'' is appropriate and will retain the term in the final policy. The agency does not agree that payment for the improvements be based on the holders cost less depreciation and will retain the method set forth in the term permit. Readers are advised that the procedure for revoking a permit when in the public interest and when the holder is found to be in noncompliance with the permit terms is set forth in part VIII of the term permit.
