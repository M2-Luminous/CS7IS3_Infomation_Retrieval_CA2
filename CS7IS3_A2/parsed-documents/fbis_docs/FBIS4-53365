President Kang Yong-hun asked the North Korean authorities to return approximately 400 persons who had been detained in North Korea, including the crew of the Tongjin boat and those of civilian airplanes, to their families' embraces. He proposed this during a speech to today's meeting marking the Day of International Red Cross. He also said that reuniting members of separated families is a moral issue that transcends differences in ideology and systems and is a central point of humanitarianism. He also said that the North and South Red Cross Societies must start consultations on this matter as soon as possible. President Kang Yong-hun also said that Ham Se-hwan and Kim In-so, whom North Korea had asked the ROK to return, are not POW's but ROK citizens. He also said that demanding their repatriation is not in compliance with Red Cross humanitarianism.
