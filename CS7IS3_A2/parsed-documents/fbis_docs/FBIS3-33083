The U.S. Army has been participating in joint activities with Honduran Armed Forces on Honduran territory for a long time. These activities include specifically military civic action and the construction of roads and landing strips. Raul Enrique Funez Santos was killed by a grenade explosion because he took a grenade home after finding it on the road. According to Funez Santos' relatives, the victim took the fuse from the grenade, which, in addition to killing him, injured those who were around him at the time of the explosion. In the suit filed with the courts, the U.S. and the Honduran Armies are accused of homicide and injuries caused by explosive devices that were left behind in the area where they had conducted military operations in May 1993 in the village of Puntillas, in Olanchito, Yoro. The plaintiffs are Maria Josefa Antunez, Lucrecia Rosales on behalf of the minor Maribel Melendez, Edin Martinez, and Mario Denis Rosales, all residents of Puntillas. Another group of plaintiffs includes Santos Diaz on behalf of his youngest son Rigoberto Villafranca Diaz, Enit Yovani Garcia Zelaya, and Juan Francisco Tejeda on behalf of his youngest son Juan Francisco Tejeda, who live in El Carril, Olanchito. It was learned that the suit is basically against the Honduran Government because, according to the Executive Branch, National Congress authorities were the ones to approve operations of this type. The explosion that killed Funez Santos injured the following: Maribel Melendez (11), Edin Marina Martinez (31), Mario Denis Rosales (19), Maria Josefa Antunez (31), Rigoberto Villafranca (17), Enit Yovani Zelaya (23), and Francisco Tejeda (11). Villafranca lost his left eye and part of his left foot. According to witnesses, Funez Santos and his brothers Denis Yovani and Francisco Alexis found seven grenades that were used by the U.S. and Honduran Armies and took them home. It was reported that the suit was filed through the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras.
