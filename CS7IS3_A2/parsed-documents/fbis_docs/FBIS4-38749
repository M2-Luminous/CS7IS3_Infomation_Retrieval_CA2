In mid-May prices for fuel have been increased very steeply, and this step was explained by objective necessities. For instance, for oil products the price has doubled, for electricity it has increased by a factor of 2.8; for heating by 3.3 times; for gas by 3.6 times; and for rail haulage by 5 times. As a KAZTAG correspondent was told at the Ministry of Economy pricing committee, this has automatically affected costs and prices for other products. In late May, prices for dairy and meat products doubled, and as of 1 June prices increased for sugar, alcoholic drinks, and light industry goods. The city administration has confirmed that fares for public transportation in Almaty will double shortly. Prices for bread, rolls, and some varieties of pulses and combined fodder remain steady. One kilogram of beef in Almaty state shops costs about 45 tenge; pork 51 tenge; chicken 50 tenge; butter 69 tenge; and sugar 47 tenge, which is by 2.5 times more than three weeks ago; a half-liter bottle of Pshenichnaya vodka costs 73 tenge as of 1 June, which is also almost 2.5 times more expensive than it was yesterday; a bottle of three-star cognak is 83 tenge; of champagne 81 tenge. This is not the limit, of course. According to the specialists of the pricing committee, prices for food will again increase by 20-25 percent shortly. It means our living standard will fall again, and more people will find themselves below the poverty level. One question remained unanswered -- when will wages be increased again, and when will the national currency finally stop falling?
