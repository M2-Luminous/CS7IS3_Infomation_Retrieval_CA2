As a matter of fact, many people had already predicted before U.S. President Clinton's formal announcement that he would inevitably reverse what he said last year. Clinton had to "change his stand" because he did not have many options. In the face of political, economic, and even strategic realities, the United States simply cannot revoke China's MFN trading status at this moment and wage a trade war with China. But the U.S. political leadership refuses to acknowledge the improvements that China's socialist modernization program has brought to the people's livelihood and democratic rights. As a result, Clinton extended China's MFN for another year, even though he said that the situation of China's human rights had not met the requirement of "overall progress" that he set last year. Meanwhile, Clinton also stated that human rights will be delinked from MFN in future annual assessments. Clinton's policy readjustment has been welcomed by the Chinese and American people. The industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong and the surrounding areas can have a breathing spell. If Sino-U.S. mutual benefit and cooperation are harmed by problems other than trade, it will have a far-reaching influence. When the interference of the controversy over human rights is removed from Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations in the future, it will be conducive to the steady development and cooperation between the two countries as well as to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. In consideration of its own national interests, the U.S. Administration eventually gave up the mistaken policy of linking MFN with human rights. Figures from various quarters, including those from Hong Kong, convincingly lobbied the U.S. Administration, which helped effect the change in its stand. Fundamentally speaking, the "linkage policy" was doomed to failure. The United States had to squarely face China's economic strength and potential development. The Removal of Additional Conditions When reviewing this change in the future, historians may judge this to mark the end of an era. "MFN" was actually a historic term first raised by the Americans in dealing with China. It was Britain that first used cannons and vessels to break through China's gates in the 19th century, which was followed by the U.S. request for "MFN." In other words, the United States wanted to share the privileges enjoyed by the big powers through the unequal treaties. Naturally, this was a one-sided approach. China, which was subject to aggression and humiliation, could not enjoy any privileges in the United States. All the unequal treaties were abolished only after the success of the Chinese revolution. Today, MFN trading status is reciprocal and does not represent a special favor. It is granted by the two sides to enable them to normally conduct trade and avoid discriminatory tariffs. After the foundation of the PRC, the United States implemented the policy of encircling and embargoing China. Thanks to the later normalization of ties between the two countries, the United States granted MFN trading status to China, but with the condition of human rights attached, which continued to constitute pressure. It was China that persisted in economic construction, upheld the policy of reform and opening up, continuously enhanced its strength, and withstood U.S. pressure. From breaking through the blockade and encirclement in the past to the periodic victory won today, the United States had to admit that bilateral economic and trade cooperation can only be carried out on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Just imagine, if China had not maintained stability or had no ability to fight back economically, the United States could continue to regard trade as a favor with which it could menace and threaten China. Reduce Troubles and Promote Cooperation Over the years, the MFN issue had to be argued about every year in the United States, which drove Sino-U.S. trade ties to the edge and also upset the Hong Kong business circles. Although these misgivings have been dispelled, there are still problems in Sino-U.S. ties. Objectively speaking, the United States will not let Sino-U.S. ties deteriorate. Viewed from the current conditions, it is unlikely that the United States will rapidly improve its ties with China. First, the United States has continued to unreasonably criticize China's human rights record. It is quite natural for China and the United States, with different traditions of historical, cultural, and social development, to have different views on human rights, which can be exchanged on the basis of equality and mutual respect and can be improved with concerted efforts. China's human rights situation has continuously improved along with the country's economic development and political reform. There is also room for the United States to improve its human rights. However, the United States has stubbornly insisted on imposing its values on China and meddling in China's internal affairs under such an excuse. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese, who have national pride. Second, in bilateral economic and trade ties, the United States is used to blaming the other side rather than improving itself. Now that the MFN issue has been settled, there are some people in the United States who want to target China with the "Super 301" provisions. All these problems must be appropriately resolved. Moreover, the principles laid down in the three joint communiques between the two countries need to be strictly observed. There are some people in the United States who always try to make an issue of the Taiwan and Tibet problems to infringe upon China's sovereignty. The Chinese side is sincere in developing its cooperation with the United States. Both China and the United States are two major powers in the Asia-Pacific region which are economically complementary. Cooperation will benefit each side. Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed the following remarks on Sino-U.S. ties: Increase trust, reduce disagreements, develop cooperation, and keep from confronting one another. We have reason to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will continue to advance and improve as long as China can maintain its political situation and economic growth. As stated by Singapore's Lee Kuan-yew earlier this year, as MFN was renewed last year, it cannot be revoked this year, because the interests of the United States cannot be separated from China's cooperation year in and year out. This has become an irresistible trend.
