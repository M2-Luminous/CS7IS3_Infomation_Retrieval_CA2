Dr. Gamieldien, who was ordered by the Cape Town Supreme Court last week to repay election funds, said he had decided to hold onto the funds until the IP's leadership problems had been resolved. He told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news it was his intention to hand over the funds to a properly functioning body and not to a party that was in disarray. Dr. Gamieldien said he would not vote in the coming election and called on Muslims to think carefully before voting for a Muslim-oriented party.
