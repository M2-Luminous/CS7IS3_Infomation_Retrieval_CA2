Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Monday, Kravchuk said that the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers sought possible solutions at their meeting in Sevastopol, but the problem can be solved fully only by the presidents of the two countries. "I am against hasty assessments. I would not like the work of the two ministers to be viewed as a position of either side," he said. "Our position is clear. We want Russia to agree to divide the fleet 50-50 as stipulated by the Yalta agreements. Proceeding from present-day realities, Ukraine should take 15-20 per cent of ships. The rest 30-35 per cent will be either sold or used to compensate Russia for Ukrainian debts," he said. Speaking about the location of the fleet, Kravchuk pointed out that "a Navy base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is being set up in Sevastopol in accordance with generally-recognised international norms. This is not new. This has been done before in other countries. Balaklava will be the home base of the Ukrainian Navy. We do not say that everything must be changed in one day. But the Russian side should take into account our position -- we cannot take only ships and leave officers. It must be settled in a civilised manner." The president believes that the dispute can be solved by Russia and Ukraine without any outside interference or assistance. "The Black Sea Fleet is a local issue. It is not as global as the nuclear problem. We must solve it in a civilised manner, taking into account long-term interests of the two countries and counting on equal partnership. That's what should be used as the foundation for resolving the problem, not ambitions or wishes of some concrete people. The military think by military categories. We must think by national categories, the interests of the two great nations. We must not rush conclusions, statements and hints. We need to be patient," Kravchuk said. He believes that the present tensions over the Black Sea Fleet were also caused by the actions of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. "When the defence ministers were meeting, Yuriy Meshkov made a statement that Ukrainian troops must leave the peninsular. Such statements border on ignorance. One cannot be serious demanding that Ukraine must leave the Crimea, its territory which has been officially and constitutionally recognised by the world and Russia. The 1990 agreement says that we have no territorial claims. This is also written down in the three-party agreement, under which Ukraine, the United States and Russia support sovereignty, inviolability of borders and independence." During the meeting on 15 April President Boris Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed their respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty. This was said openly and straightforwardly, Kravchuk noted. "Relations with the Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, should be normal and business-like. We want to help the Crimea and we do help it," he added. Speaking about Ukraine's next move in settling the Black Sea Fleet dispute, Kravchuk said "we will get in touch with the president of Russia and agree our next meeting. I am convinced that we must solve this problem not to the detriment of Ukraine, the Crimea, Russia or the world community. We must solve it for the benefit of security, cooperation and friendly partnership relations."
