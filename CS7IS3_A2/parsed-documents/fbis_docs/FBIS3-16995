But all Moscow can do is observe events from the sidelines. International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts who have returned after verification work at suspect facilities in the DPRK were unable to confirm that this secretive country is not carrying out work to create its own nuclear weapons. They did not manage to get into the radiochemical laboratory, where it is suspected that plutonium is possibly being produced for military needs. The IAEA Board of Governors will give the final verdict and will possibly raise the question of economic sanctions against the DPRK for discussion by the UN Security Council. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, in this situation Moscow prefers to refrain from making any statements. At least until the IAEA's final position becomes clear. As IZVESTIYA was informed by the Russian Foreign Ministry, the situation is not as serious as reports might indicate. At any rate, our diplomats still hope that the matter will not get as far as a discussion of the sanctions question by the Security Council. So far Moscow has remained outside the circle of active participants in the conflict because it lacks any opportunities to influence the North Koreans' position. Despite the fact that the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between the USSR and the DPRK is still in force, just like the article providing for military aid in the case of aggression against the DPRK, the North Koreans regard this document merely as a scrap of paper. But if the matter does get as far as a discussion of sanctions by the Security Council, our experts believe that Russian diplomats' main task will be not to back the North Koreans into a corner.
