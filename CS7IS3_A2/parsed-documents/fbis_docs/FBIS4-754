In a statement read today, the group pointed out that this civil disobedience campaign will only apply to appointed representatives of state authority and will affect all sectors of state activity. It will, however, not harm the interests and activities of individuals and private firms. It may be recalled that for the past few days, human rights associations have been mediating in discussions between the government and the opposition. In a statement reported by this radio yesterday, the spokesman of these associations called on the two parties to refrain from engaging in any act or acts that could compromise national unity, social harmony, democracy, or the republic.
