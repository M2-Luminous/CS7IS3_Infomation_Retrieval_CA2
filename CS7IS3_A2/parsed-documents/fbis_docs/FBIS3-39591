This document sheds light on the two most serious aspects of Italian unemployment, and clearly indicates suitable policies for tackling this problem. In our country this problem is particularly serious because unemployment is concentrated in the south and among young people (thus, it strikes the youth of the south very hard). The document observes, "The rate of unemployment in central northern Italy is no greater than the level in the former West Germany (8 percent), and in the north it can be compared to the more modest unemployment level in the USA (6.7 percent). On the other hand, in the south, unemployment is now 18 percent. Apart from certain regional or short-lived situations, the problem of unemployment in Italy is, therefore, essentially a problem of the south and its unsuccessful development." Thus, "the work, which should be shared in order to redistribute jobs, is unfortunately concentrated in the north. In the south there is still a need to build factories (and not only this, of course)." As far as the structure of unemployment by age and family background is concerned, the document notes (even though data from 1991 are used) that only 12 percent of the unemployed are heads of families, versus an average of 37 percent in Europe. On the other hand, 63 percent of the unemployed are children versus an average of 38 percent in Europe. From the results of another recent study among industrialized countries, Italy (at almost 30 percent) is second only to Spain for the percentage of young people between 15 and 24 who are looking for work without results. The Informative Note of the CEI succinctly, but clearly, moves from the analysis of the data to a diagnosis: "These are specific characteristics that are linked to a labor market situation that is particularly closed and protected, with rules that primarily defend those who already have a job." The document then moves from diagnosis to therapy. To get out of the crisis, in the short term it is necessary "to implement measures meant to make labor market rules more open, coordinated and flexible." In the medium term it is also necessary to provide for "a better balance when locating industries by transferring some of them to the south" and through a "massive basic investment process." With regard to the situation pointed out in the Note, the unemployment problem in Italy is certainly destined to worsen in the future. There are three reasons for this. First of all, the recession. According to the CEI, this is a recession that, in terms of unemployment, is affecting the service sector more than the industrial sector to which observers have preferred to turn their attention. Secondly, privatization; it may be good for the country, but, unfortunately, may eliminate redundant jobs. Thirdly is the fact that economic growth and job creation are moving in any case from Europe to America and Asia, and this is also due to the greater flexibility of those labor markets. For the very reason that the problem is destined to get worse, the therapy suggested by the document is even more essential. The employment emergency is burdened by the suffering of individuals and society. But fighting to keep nonproductive jobs alive is an act that smacks of solidarity, and that morally gratifies those who take part in it because they do not realize that they are hurting those who are even weaker--the unemployed. These are individuals, and particularly young people, that will not be able to find work because the economy allocates resources to dead-end projects rather than the creation of productive jobs. Social welfare measures are possible and appropriate, but they should be well-defined, and not involve nonproductive work. The conclusion of the CEI Note should also be noted: "Going in all these directions means making a fundamental choice to favor future (and collective future) investments in the short term over immediate (and individual) consumption. When taking into consideration the current state of public finances, this also means that it will be essential for social consciousness to prevail over demagoguery in the lively debate regarding taxes which is currently taking place in our country among politicians." I have felt it necessary to go into detail on the CEI's "Informative Note" due to the importance of imposing (as a sensible economic and social policy program) a vision based on flexibility and development on a tradition of thought and teaching that frequently is inclined to favor collective solidarity over growth. One wonders if, in the very terms proposed in this document, it may not be possible to develop a program that is quite similar to the one that I tried to outline on several occasions in this column (in particular on September 3, 1993 and January 5th): - it should defer the reduction of the tax burden to a time when a substantial new equilibrium in public finances has occurred, and in particular, when the current deficit has been eliminated - it should also liberalize labor markets and, at the same time, better regulate them - there should be more public involvement to protect competition and openness, and less government interference in price and supply decisions - there should also be more flexibility (including regional) regarding wages and salaries, fewer restrictions on hirings and firings, and more room for decentralized and individual bargaining - unemployment offices should be eliminated and unemployment subsidies introduced - there should be fewer taxes on production, but fewer subsidies to businesses, less recourse to bailout measures, and more recourse to letting companies fail - furthermore there should be less protection for low productivity, and more care given to human and environmental "capital." An economic policy along these lines would have the disadvantage (or the advantage?) of being neither "progressive" nor "moderate." It would simply be radical.
