The occasion coincides with the current visit to China by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who signed the document in 1987. The commentary describes the joint declaration as a historical document of great significance. "It has set a good example for solutions to historical problems between countries," it explains. The signing of the pact boosted Sino-Portuguese relations to a new stage, it says. In March 1993 the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Zone of the People's Republic of China was passed at the first session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). As the fundamental law of Macao, the commentary continues, the Basic Law puts forward the basic principles of the Chinese Government in the joint declaration into a legal form with concrete regulations on the basic systems of society, politics, economy and culture in Macao. The law has won wide support from the Macao people, it says. In the seven years since the signing, the friendly relations and co-operation between China and Portugal have made smooth progress. Exchanges of visits between high-ranking leaders of the two countries have pushed forward the bilateral relations and promoted friendly cooperation on Macao issue between the two countries. It says the two countries have abided by and faithfully implemented the declaration and conducted effective co-operation on the issue. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group have held 19 plenary meetings and a number of experts' conferences on the issue. The two countries have achieved progress in solving problems in the transition period such as those concerning language, the civil service and Macao joining international organizations. They have succeeded in solving problems concerning funds and aviation in the construction of the Macao International Airport. The commentary says the completion of major construction projects in recent years has injected new energy into the economic development of Macao. It noted that the sincerity and friendly co-operation between the two countries in implementation of the joint declaration is the guarantee of Macao's stability and development. It is in the common interest of the two countries to implement the joint declaration and realize the stable transition and smooth return of Macao to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, the commentary notes. Experience has proved that co-operation is not only beneficial to both China and Portugal but also to Macao, the commentary says. It notes that as long as the two countries take the whole situation into account, persist in close consultation and strengthen co-operation, any problem arising during the transition can be solved, so as to create conducive conditions for the stable transition and smooth return of Macao's sovereignty to China.
