The upcoming 25 April [Liberation Day] must therefore become the "day of concord." Fifty years after the Resistance, it is high time to bring the second post-war period to a close because "what is heard from all the dead, from the dead on all sides, from the sufferings of the mothers on all sides, is not the voice of divisiveness, resentment, opposition, but the voice of unity, fraternity, and love of our fatherland." The appeal also seems to go half way toward meeting [National Alliance leader] Fini's requests for general pacification in the name of all victims, on all fronts, whether on the side of the victors or the vanquished. Scalfaro also made an appeal to judges: Avoid polemics and avoid being used instrumentally. On the other hand, Scalfaro forcefully confirmed the principle of the magistrature's autonomy and independence. [passage omitted]
