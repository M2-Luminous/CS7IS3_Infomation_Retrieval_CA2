FR941213-0-00033 FR941213-0-00008 Therefore, EPA is now approving the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as submitted in a letter dated August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted in letters dated June 4, 1992 and March 2, 1994_Subchapters 4 and 13, and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407_addressing emergency procedures, open burning, and wood-waste burners, respectively. EPA is also approving all portions of Subchapter 11_Permit, Construction, and Operation of Air Contaminant Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). The portions of Subchapter 11 that EPA is approving relate to construction permits. Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter 11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). EPA is declining to take action on these minor source operating permit regulations because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 Federal Register notice, which are required in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable (see 54 FR 27282). Also included in the March 2, 1994 submittal are minor amendments to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. These revisions involve a name change for the air advisory council listed in Chapter VII, and amendments to Chapter VIII, to provide for emergency episode inspections of operating point sources, which are capable of emitting 25 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant, to ensure compliance with abatement plan requirements. EPA approves these revisions. EPA's concerns regarding Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as included with the August 20, 1991 submittal, have not been addressed. In the December 4, 1991 letter to the Governor, EPA informed the State that section 110(i) of the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended, prohibits the suspension of any requirement of an applicable SIP from being taken with respect to a stationary source by a State or the Administrator of EPA, except by SIP revision under section 110(a) (and a few other exceptions). Neither the June 4, 1992 submittal, nor the March 2, 1994 submittal, corrected this problem. Therefore, EPA must disapprove Missoula's Chapter X, Variances, at this time. One of the November 30, 1992 Governor's commitments regarding Missoula is still outstanding. That commitment addresses Missoula NSPS and NESHAP regulations (see (F), above). EPA will take separate action on those regulations, as appropriate. F. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see Sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). State implementation plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control measures and other elements in the SIP [see section 110(a)(2)(C)]. The specific measures contained in the Missoula contingency plan are addressed above in Section II.B. The Missoula air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by MCCHD. There are civil penalties, which increase with each violation, for noncompliance with the solid fuel burning device regulation. Violation of any other provision, regulation or rule enforced under the program results in a criminal offense punishable by a fine. The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES, if the MCCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by an MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, Sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429, Montana Code Annotated. If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to Section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii) of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation if, for example, the State has the authority and resources to implement the provision when the local entity has failed to do so. The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A revised version of the air pollution control regulations was approved by the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board on April 24, 1991, and on June 28, 1991 the MBHES issued a board order approving these regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and the local authorities was signed April 29, 1991. On March 20, 1992, the MBHES issued a board order approving revisions to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The April 29, 1991 stipulation, the June 28, 1991 Board order, and the March 20, 1992 Board order were incorporated into the SIP on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2540).
