This figure has been reported in the Latvian media for the first time. Judging from officials' reports, the debt has built up steadily. Having turned into a chronic defaulter, the "Latviyas Gaze" ("Latvian Gas") state enterprise is also committed to pay considerable sums in fines to its Russian suppliers. Last year the money owing to Russia for its natural gas supplies was paid off with the help of international loans. Since then the situation has not changed for the better. The leaders of "Latviyas Gaze" reported that this year an agreement with Russia on gas deliveries had been concluded on "terms advantageous to the Latvian side." Nonetheless, it has not proved possible to pay the sum required. It is as if Latvia is receiving gas on credit. The DIENA newspaper has reported that Russia issued an official warning in mid-January to the "Latviyas Gaze" state enterprise, demanding that it change its payment policy for the gas it has used. It is proposed that this demand be met by 1 February, otherwise gas supplies will be cut by 50 percent. But Latvian consumers are not threatened with any particular unpleasantness as a result of this reduction in the supply of Russian natural gas. The fact is that Europe's largest underground gas storage facility, into which Russian gas has constantly been pumped, is located in the republic at Incukalns. Russia has agreed to forgive the debts in return for part of the Incukalns gas storage facility and the network of gas pipelines running across Latvian territory.
