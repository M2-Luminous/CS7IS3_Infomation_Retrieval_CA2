FBIS4-52545 "dreas091_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 North Korea Relatives Appeal for Repatriation Relatives Appeal for Repatriation SK1105113194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1048 GMT 11 May 94 SK1105113194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Kim In-so's eldest daughter Kim Hwa-sim and Ham Se-hwan's sister Ham Suk-nyo wrote to the International Committee of the Red Cross, calling for a vigorous campaign to save Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who are now detained in South Korea after a long prison life without ideological conversion. Kim Hwa-sim is a university teacher in Pyongyang. She was five years old when she saw her father last and is now near 50. Ham Suk- nyo, above 80, lives in Ongjin county, South Hwanghae Province. In her letter, Kim Hwa-sim said: "My father was arrested by the enemy while active as a guerrilla (militiaman) in South Korea during the last Korean war. He was kept in prison in South Korea for 33 years and seven months for the mere reason that he refused ideological conversion. Though released, he is not allowedi to return home where his flesh and blood are waiting. "The South Korean side's allegation that `Kim In-so is not a prisoner of war, so cannot be repatriated,' is sophism ignoring international law on prisoners of war and contradicting reason and principle. "The fact that my father was an unconverted long-term prisoner and he sent a letter to the international committee of the Red Cross last year, asking for help in his repatriation to the northern half of Korea, shows that he does not want to live in South Korea but earnestly hopes to return to the North where his children live. "I ask the international committee of the Red Cross which defends human rights and regards the humanitarianism of Red Cross as its life and soul to launch an active international campaign so that my father can be returned in a short time to the northern half of the country where his family lives." In her letter, Ham Suk-nyo said: "My brother Ham Se-hwan who had been arrested during the war was excluded from the exchange of prisoners of war after the ceasefire. He was kept in prison for 34 years for his refusal to be converted. After his release, he is eking out a bare existence as a sick man above 60 away from home with no one to take care of him. "Those in charge of the Red Cross in South Korea do not comply with the demand of the DPRK Red Cross society for his repatriation, alleging that he does not belong to the category of prisoners of war. I earnestly ask your committee to launch an active international campaign for his repatriation."
