The joint exercises of 120 members of the Chrudim rapid-deployment battalion of the Czech Republic Army and 32 Dutch marines are based on the closest possible contact and mutual exchange of information. In addition to shooting practice, a part of the exercises consists of tactical drills in the siege of areas occupied by terrorist units. Spikerman von Weezelenburg, commander of the Dutch marines, is currently on an inspection visit of the exercises. "It is the first specific action stemming from the Partnership for Peace plan," Major Ales Vodehnal, commander of the exercises, told CESKY DENIK. He added that, despite the Dutch being a professional unit with a high standard of training, they consider the Czech submachine guns, for instance, to be of better quality than their own.
