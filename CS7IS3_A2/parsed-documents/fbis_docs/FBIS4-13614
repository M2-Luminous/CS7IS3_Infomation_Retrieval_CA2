Had Iraqi President Saddam finally committed a fatal error, venting months of rage and powerlessness against "any old" enemy target? The leaders of the Council, which brings together the six groups opposing the Baghdad regime, were expecting something of key importance for the entire country to happen soon, and this "something" would open up a breach through which to start fighting the president once again. Exiled opposition leader al-Bayyati told me: "We were the first to hear about the choppers being shot down and the first to spread the news. We were certain that, sooner or later, Saddam would go for a surprise action, to break the blockade of silence and hunger into which he has been pushed by the UN embargo and international isolation. [Stefanelli] So you see the regime's hand behind the shooting down of the helicopters. [Al-Bayyati] We never received any information or signs indicating that. Whatever the reason, it is a sign that the tension has risen dramatically in Kurdistan: Even before the end of Ramadan two divisions of the Republican Guard, the military elite, were deployed and took up positions in the Kirkuk and Mosul areas. Some expected the customary brutal repression against the Kurds, as has happened at other times of crisis in the regime. But no, nothing. However, the danger has not gone away: Saddam has entered a terminal phase, increasingly alone, not even succeeding in "feeding" the traditional caste of privileged people -- in the Army, the services, the party -- which forms his power base. Do you understand? Trapped in this corner, he will choose to act, to strike in one way or another: in the North, the South, over the borders. He will not wait for his head to fall under the slow guillotine of sanctions. [Stefanelli] Let us just suppose showdown point is reached: Driven by desperation, Saddam launches a new attack and the international community responds; are you people in opposition ready? Are you united, and do you represent a concrete alternative? [Al-Bayyati] We are a coalition of groups, we have been working together since 1983 and -- more especially -- since the war between Saddam Husayn and the international forces. We have reached a common agreement, despite the differences remaining between the groups represented in our front, an agreement on two points: First, freeing ourselves from the current regime. Second, implementing democracy. It will be up to the Iraqi people to elect the president and parliament. The one who gets the majority will govern, the others will go into opposition. Classic rules, no problems. But that will come later: Today we are moving ahead united, and we will fight against a common enemy. [Stefanelli] But how do you intend to fight? Do you have weapons? Who is backing you? [Al-Bayyati] We have relations with all the countries in the region. Kuwait, for example, has helped us and is continuing to do so. Our guerrillas have infiltrated everywhere: in the marshes to the south of the country, in Kurdistan where we have our headquarters, and also in Baghdad where opposition is growing. We are receiving arms and money. Iraqi businessmen and companies outside the country are very generous. We are receiving political and logistic support from other countries. Right now we are strengthening our contacts within the Iraqi Army. Certain officers, increasingly higher in rank, have deserted to our side and are serving as bridges. We are certain that, when the spark is ignited, military and civilians will unite against the regime. [Stefanelli] Three years ago the people seemed to be almost all on Saddam's side, with the exception of the Kurds and a large part of the Shiite community. What consensus can the president count on today? [Al-Bayyati] I would say that consensus no longer exists. People are hungry and reduced to unbearable poverty. Saddam's three traditional circles of allies are shrinking: The Sunnite minority, which has so far controlled wealth and power, is no longer fully behind him, nor is the clan from Takrit [as published], the dictator's birthplace and the heart of the regime. But what speaks loudest is the fact that not even his family, the closest and most basic circle, is now 100-percent behind him. The plots and ensuing reprisals -- the purges which have followed one after the other in these three years of Iraqi decline -- have split the old power system right across the board and for good.
