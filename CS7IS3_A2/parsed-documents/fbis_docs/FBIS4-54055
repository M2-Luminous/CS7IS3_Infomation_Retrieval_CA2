He said in an address to a Japan-China forum that Japan needs to shift from the unstable minority administration of several coalition partners. But Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987, forecast that Japan will not return to the "pre-Hosokawa" era of government run solely by the Liberal Democratic Party, of which he is still a member. Last summer then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government ended the LDP's 38-year uninterrupted rule. Nakasone called on North Korea to help end a dispute over its suspected nuclear arms program, saying a peaceful settlement of the problem would facilitate the start of normalization talks and economic exchanges between Japan and North Korea.
