FBIS TRENDS-31 MAY94-DPRK-U.S.-IAEA DPRK Continues to Press for Nuclear Talks With Washington DPRK Continues to Press for Nuclear Talks With Washington SUMMARY In the face of a mounting crisis over North Korea's nuclear reactor refueling activities, Pyongyang is still pressing for bilateral talks with Washington and trying to create the impression that it wants to see a peaceful resolution to the crisis. END SUMMARY Byongyang media have not been observed so far to report or comment on a 30 May UN Security Council resolution that reportedly called on the DPRK to proceed with discharging spent fuel rods from its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor "in a manner which preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements" in the future (Yonhap, 30 May). However, Seoul radio on 31 May reported that Kim Su-man, North Korea's deputy UN ambassador, brushed aside the UN statement as "another attempt" by Washington and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to "crush" Pyongyang and contended that "all pending issues" concerning North Korea must be resolved through bilateral talks between Pyongyang and Washington and "not by the UN Security Council" (KBS-1, 31 May). Kim reportedly added that Pyongyang nonetheless is "willing" to hold "further negotiations with the IAEA, even though the agency had previously rejected a North Korean proposal made in an effort "to reasonably solve" the nuclear issue. Earlier Statement Kim's reported remarks are consistent with a claim made in a 28 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement that reiterated the importance Pyongyang attaches to a "package solution" with the United States on the nuclear issue (Pyongyang radio, 29 May). Relatively nonconfrontational in tone, the statement claimed that North Korea is "fully ensuring" the continuity of nuclear safeguards and is "even" discharging fuel rods "in such a way as to preserve technical feasibility" of selected measurement of the rods in the future. While admitting that there have been disputes with the IAEA on the methods of nuclear fuel withdrawal, the statement claimed that the agency came to "an understanding" that its method of selecting and segregating fuel rods is not acceptable to the DPRK because it is tantamount to an "ad hoc" inspection--something Pyongyang has been rejecting pending the outcome of future DPRK-U.S. talks. The statement went on to allege that the agency "took note" of the "theoretical feasibility" of the North Korean method of preserving fuel rods for future measurements. The statement also pledged North Korea's "active efforts" to ensure the "transparency" of its nuclear activities and its "utmost" effort to seek an "ultimate solution" to the nuclear i$sue through "DPRK-U. S. talks." Other Signs DPRK media in recent days have also sought to create the impression that Pyongyang is seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. As it has done in the past when tensions escalated on the peninsula, Pyongyang again used a foreign investment-related law to signal its purported hope for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue. The North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 May published the full text of a set of regulations governing the operation of foreign enterprises in North Korea's free trade zone--regulations adopted two months earlier. The timing of the publicity seems designed to convey the impression that at least part of the North Korean leadership is looking beyond the current nuclear crisis. Similarly, attesting to the eagerness with which Pyongyang is looking for any signs of softening in Washington's attitude toward North Korea, KCNA on 28 May publicized a letter attributed to "U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth Purse" to President Clinton and the chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, in which she reportedly counseled against "escalating tensions" in Korea and called for "pursuing a policy for normalizing relations" with Pyongyang.
