Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told ITAR-TASS by telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was a certain Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times. On February 4 he demanded that the republic's government deliver US$500,000 and 500 million rubles or else he would set off several explosions and commit several other acts of terror in Yakutsk. It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs. It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution) existed: it was an invention of the hardened criminal who wanted money to pay off major debts and "enjoy some good living," as he put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal proceedings had been instituted. Specialists of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs and Counter-Intelligence Service supposed from the very beginning that the criminal was bluffing, but a large-scale operation was launched to make sure that no danger threatens the city and its residents.
