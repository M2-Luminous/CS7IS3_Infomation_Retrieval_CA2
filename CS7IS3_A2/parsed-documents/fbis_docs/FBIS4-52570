FBIS4-52570 "dreas091_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 North Korea ROK `Internationalization' Policy Denounced ROK `Internationalization' Policy Denounced SK1105112694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1034 GMT 11 May 94 SK1105112694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["`Internationalization' To Sell Nation's Soul and Interests" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today brands the "internationalization" hastened by the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a treacherous act to sell the nation's interests to outside forces and further reduce South Korea to their colony and theater of rampage. The paper in a by-lined article says: The traitor Kim Yong-sam hurriedly announced a "strategy of internationalization" in November last year as soon as he opened the rice market. It was a crafty ruse to lull the people's protest and criticism against his treacherous rice market opening. He intends to curry favour with his U.S. master through his full compliance with the master's demand and prolong his power with the backing of the master in disregard of the dignity of the nation and the interests of the people. The "internationalization" is a product of his despicable flunkeyist and treacherous scheme to justify the U.S. domination and plunder and prolong his remaining days under the patronage of outside forces. The "internationalization" is aimed at bartering away the nation's soul and interests to outside forces and reducing South Korea to an "international prostitute." Under the veil of "internationalization," the traitor Kim Yong- sam has removed or eased the nominal restrictions on the infiltration of foreign capital into South Korea, leaving South Korea to the tender mercy of foreign monopolies and adapting everything in South Korea to foreign fashion. The "internationalization" scheme of the traitor is a treacherous act to induce bigger outside forces into South Korea, fatten comprador capital, extort the workers, farmers and other working people and reduce them to slaves to outside forces.
