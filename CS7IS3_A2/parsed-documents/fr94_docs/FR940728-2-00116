ACTION: Notice of hearing. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce a hearing, open to the public, on Submissions # 940001 and # 940002. These submissions, filed with the U.S. National Administrative Office, respectively, by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL&hyph;CIO, and the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, involve labor law matters in Mexico and were accepted for review by the Office on April 15, 1994. Notices of acceptance for review were published in the Federal Register on April 20, 1994. Article 16(3) of the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) provides for the review of labor law matters in Canada and Mexico by the U.S. National Administrative Office, in accordance with U.S. domestic procedures. Revised procedural guidelines pertaining to the submission, review, and reporting process utilized by the Office were published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994. The guidelines provide for a hearing as part of the review. DATES: The hearing will be held on August 31, 1994, commencing at 10:00 a.m. Persons wishing to provide information or present their views on matters related to the review of Submission # 940001 or # 940002 may do so by filing written statements or briefs with the U.S. National Administrative Office, which must be received by August 19, 1994. Persons desiring to present oral testimony at the hearing must submit a request in writing at the time the written statement or brief is filed. ADDRESSES: The hearing will be held at the Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N&hyph;3437 A & B, Washington, DC 20210. Written statements or briefs and requests to present oral testimony may be mailed or hand delivered to the U.S. National Administrative Office, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C&hyph;4322, Washington, DC 20210. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jorge Perez-Lopez, Acting Secretary, U.S. National Administrative Office, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room C&hyph;4322, Washington, DC 20210. Telephone: (202) 501&hyph;6653 (this is not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Nature and Conduct of Hearing As set out in the notices published in the Federal Register on April 20, 1994, the objective of the U.S. National Administrative Office's reviews of Submissions # 940001 and # 940002 is to gather information to assist it to better understand and publicly report on the Government of Mexico's promotion of compliance with, and effective enforcement of, its labor law through appropriate government action, as set out in Article 3 of the NAALC. The allegations of both submissions relate principally to the right to freedom of association and the right to organize. Accordingly, it is appropriate to consolidate the reviews for purposes of Section G, paragraph 3 of the procedural guidelines, which provides for a hearing on a submission accepted for review. The hearing will be conducted by the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office or the Secretary's designee. It will be open to the public. All proceedings will be conducted in English, with simultaneous translation provided as the Secretary deems necessary. The public file for each submission, including written statements, briefs, and requests to present oral testimony, will be made a part of the hearing record. The public file will also be available for inspection at the Office prior to the hearing. The hearing will be transcribed. A transcript of the proceedings will be made available for inspection, as provided for in Section E of the procedural guidelines, or may be purchased from the reporting company. No cameras or recording devices (other than any recording device used by the reporting company in connection with transcribing the hearing) will be allowed. Disabled persons should contact the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office no later than fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing if special accommodations are needed. II. Written Statements or Briefs and Requests To Present Oral Testimony Written statements or briefs shall provide a discussion of the information presented or position taken and shall be legibly typed or printed. Requests to present oral testimony shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the witness, the organization represented, if any, and any other information pertinent to the request. Five copies of a statement or brief and a single copy of a request to present oral testimony shall be submitted to the Office at the time of filing. No request to present oral testimony will be considered unless accompanied by a written statement or brief. A request to present oral testimony may be denied if the written statement or brief suggests that the information sought to be provided is unrelated to the review of Submission # 940001 or # 940002 or for other appropriate reasons. The Office will notify each requester of the disposition of the request to present oral testimony. In presenting testimony, the witness should summarize the written statement or brief, may supplement the written statement or brief with relevant information, and should be prepared to answer questions from the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office or the Secretary's designee. Oral testimony will ordinarily be limited to a ten minute presentation, not including the time for questions. Persons desiring more than ten minutes for their presentation should so state in the request, setting out reasons why additional time is necessary. The requirements relating to the submission of written statements or briefs and requests to present oral testimony may be waived by the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office for reasons of equity and the public interest. Signed at Washington, DC on July 25, 1994. Jorge Perez-Lopez, Acting Secretary, U.S. National Administrative Office.
