FR940324-1-00051 FR940324-1-00019 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 651 [Docket No. 940232&hyph;4032; I.D. 031594E] Northeast Multispecies Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of Flexible Area Action System. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this notification to inform the public and the fishing industry that the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) is considering Flexible Area Action System # 8 (FAAS) implementing regulations for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The purpose of the action would be to address the discard problems associated with a substantial concentration of spawning and sub-legal sized haddock. This action is initiated in part based on the data and information generated in support of FAAS # 7, which was not implemented by NMFS due, in part, to insufficient supporting data. The area affected is located offshore of Cape Cod, MA and is in and around the area known as Closed Area I. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received by April 7, 1994. The Council's Multispecies Committee (Committee) will hold a public hearing on April 7, 1994, at 1:30 p.m., at the King's Grant Inn, Danvers, MA. ADDRESSES: Copies of the NMFS Northeast Regional Director's fact-finding report and the Council's impact analysis will be available on April 1, 1994, upon request from Douglas G. Marshall, Executive Director, New England Fishery Management Council, 5 Broadway (Route 1), Saugus, MA 01960; telephone 617/231&hyph;0422. Send comments on the proposed action, the fact-finding report, and the Council's impact analysis to Richard B. Roe, Regional Director, NMFS, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930. The Committee will hold a public hearing on April 7, 1994, at 1:30 p.m. at the King's Grant Inn, Danvers, MA, in conjunction with a meeting of the Committee, to solicit comments on the proposed action. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: E. Martin Jaffe, NMFS, Fishery Policy Analyst, telephone 508&hyph;281&hyph;9272. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action is taken under 50 CFR 651.26 of the regulation implementing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. Section 651.26 specifies a FAAS whereby protection can be provided to concentrations of juvenile, sub-legal or spawning fish. As part of this process, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), will initiate a fact-finding investigation of the alleged problem. The Council will also provide an impact analysis of alternative measures that might be implemented under this action. The problem that may require measures to be taken under the FAAS is the possible discarding of large quantities of haddock, including spawning females. This situation may present an impediment to haddock spawning success, result in significant waste of haddock, and would be detrimental to the Council's haddock stock-rebuilding efforts. Fishermen are required to discard haddock due to either the implementation of emergency rules to protect haddock, which include a 500-pound (226.8 kg) haddock possession limit, or the setting of a 19-inch (14.26 cm) minimum legal size for haddock. The Council was alerted to this possible discard problem in early February, 1994 and initiated FAAS # 7. The Regional Director conducted a fact-finding mission. The Committee formulated a recommendation to close an area on the basis of the fact-finding report, an additional sea-sampling report, and information presented at a public hearing. The Regional Director did not implement the Committee's recommendation to close the area because the information available was inconclusive, particularly with respect to the large area under consideration.
