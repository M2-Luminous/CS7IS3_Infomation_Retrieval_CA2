Due to regrettable circumstances, this cabinet had no choice but to set sail as a minority coalition government. Though situations at home and abroad have been turbulent, we have put our energy into political reform and cooperation, and have challenged important tasks head-on. It has been of short duration. But we have acted on the 1994 budget -- in a record short time -- with the cooperation of both ruling and opposition parties. We have made preparations for implementation of the political reform-related laws; and we have tackled with sincerity such difficult issues as deregulation, economic reform, Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and suspected North Korean nuclear programs. With a society of aged soon to arrive, we have to make difficult decisions, and we have made appeals to the public in this regard. We have frankly explained the need for drastic tax reform in view of growing education costs and other living costs for the average population. I am sure that government efforts in these areas have earned the people's support. I would like to thank the people of the nation once again for the understanding and cooperation they have given. We are now at the crucial point of time in dealing with various reform programs, such as the implementation of the political reform-related laws that can begin with the legislation of a bill for electoral district zoning. To help the economy make a prompt and steady recovery, the 1994 budget, which was recently passed, needs to be implemented without loss of time. That action, along with the unemployment question, is considered important even by other nations. There are so many things going on at home and abroad. The Naples Summit is another important event. We have to see what the so- called Group of 7 industrialized nations and Russia will want to do at the summit. When we think about these matters, I realize we must not let another political vacuum occur. We remember that there was a blank of 20 days after the Hosokawa Cabinet resigned. It is now time when the government must do all it can to tackle and take care of all those issues. As such, I feel it very regrettable that a no- confidence motion against the cabinet was introduced at such a time. But we realize that the government is a minority government. With so many important issues to be tackled, we have come to see it is necessary to establish a new and stable government. That indeed is the most important task right now. From this perspective and from the viewpoint of enabling the reform to go on, I have decided to resign as prime minister. I think I should follow a Diet decision. Dissolving the lower house could be an alternative. However, that alternative will result in a vacuum that will last more than a month. I believe that situation should be avoided under the given conditions. There are so many things to be done at home and abroad. I strongly hope that a new government will be able to overcome all these difficulties, complete political reform efforts, and take constructive actions on other pending matters. In living as a politician so far, I have been a man who has tried to solve problems, thinking I should sacrifice myself if necessary. The targets or programs I am after now may be numerous, but I feel I again contribute to Japan in this regard, by sacrificing myself here. That is how I have come to this decision. I may be leaving the government. Mr. Shizuo Inaba, my mentor who so earnestly called for reform in this country, wrote me when I was named prime minister: Mind should be as firm as a rock. It is with this resolve that I and my colleagues will try to answer the call for political and other reforms. We will do everything possible and give up everything to do so. What I want to say in conclusion is that it is now time for us -- the existing group [kiseiso] of politicians -- to leave [the political scene]. If the present kind of condition continues in this nation, there is no doubt distrust in politics will only grow. We began our endeavors for the political reform to remove the people's distrust in politics, but to our regret, the people of this nation are further distancing themselves from politics. We should stop all the political fights, and stop fighting for power. We must really think about the nation and the Japanese people, the given national situation, and other countries' expectations of Japan. We must think about these points and respond to the expectations. I sincerely hope that all of you who will face the tasks will deal with and solve them from this perspective of what we should do about Japan and what Japan should do in this world. Once again, I would like to thank all the people of the nation and all of you [reporters] for support and cooperation given to me in the past.
