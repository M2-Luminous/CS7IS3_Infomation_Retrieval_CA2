A very positive Conservative Party leader is putting the finishing touches to the speech she will deliver to the conference in Bergen on Friday [8 April]. The Grieg Hall and the Hotell Norge will be the two arenas for the Conservatives' national conference at which Kaci Kullmann Five will hand over the chairman's gavel to her good friend, Storting deputy Jan Petersen -- he too comes from Akershus. The two know each other well from over 20 years of close political cooperation. And Kullmann Five is generous in her praise: "Jan is solid through and through and extremely capable. He is a politician with broad experience -- much broader than many people think." Kaci Kullmann Five stressed that she is not saying good-bye to Norwegian national politics. A Conservative Party with a thin 17 percent of support does not scare this lady away from new positions of responsibility. She will continue as the Conservative Party's EU [European Union] spokeswoman in the Storting and have a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee alongside Jan Petersen, among others. Will you be the Conservative Party's prime ministerial candidate in the 1997 Storting elections? "I have not come to any decision about what my life will be like in 1997, about whether I will continue in politics or not. It is the party and the Storting group which together will decide who they will ask to become the party's prime ministerial candidate." The current battle surrounding the EU will be the main theme of the party leader's speech to the national conference. She makes it very clear that in the ranks of the Conservative Party too there are many who have their doubts about the EU, even some opponents, who have to be won over. In the last election the Conservative Party lost 36,000 voters to the Center Party. "There will be no Norwegian EU membership if the Conservative Party does not do its part of the job. We have to get the doubters over onto the `yes' side. The Labor Party is important in this context, but they cannot do the job alone," she pointed out. In her EU arguments she attaches great importance to the overarching peace and security dimensions, and she made it clear that she has little time for "newly converted Socialist Left Party members who think that NATO is enough." "NATO is important, but the EU will play the totally dominant role in the peacekeeping work in Europe. This is work that goes much further than what is purely defense policy and which includes the environment, trade, and the economy," the former trade minister said. "A pan-European security solution is within reach. Even if Anne Enger Lahnstein refuses to realize it, it is nevertheless a fact that the countries of East Europe are moving toward the EU," Kullmann Five said. She sees the EU as an important tool for combatting negative nationalism -- and as a tool which could could make a contribution to the construction of democracy in the former East European states. Environmental policy is another area which figure frequently in the Conservative Party's arguments in favor of EU membership: "I am not satisfied with the EU's environmental policy, and it will be a great challenge to strengthen it. But it is worth noting statements from the well regarded World Watch Institute which writes that the EU has contributed to better environmental conditions across the whole continent," Kullmann Five said. She said that the Conservative Party will fight for its political values and its policies inside the European Union: "We will combat the bureaucracy, among other things. Here the EU has gone too far. And as far as supranationality and the environment are concerned, it has not gone far enough," she said. When the EU referendum is over, international environmental issues will be one of the fields in which she wants to work more from her place on the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee. What are the most important political results the Conservative Party has achieved under your leadership? "What I am most happy about is that we were able to defend the watercourses at Stryn and Gaular. This was all thanks to the Conservative Party and is of great importance for biodiversity, the experience of nature, and tourism. ``But the most important goal -- government power -- we did not achieve. Henry Valen is right when he says that the EU question has hit the Conservative Party hard.'' Is there any hope of a nonsocialist coalition after the EU referendum? "One can always hope, but it is the Center Party that is the main problem, not the Conservative Party. This is something that I would like AFTENPOSTEN's leader writers to realize soon. There is actually a party that has disappeared on the nonsocialist side and this is not the Conservative Party's fault."
