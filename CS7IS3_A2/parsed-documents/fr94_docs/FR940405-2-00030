FR940405-2-00030 FR940405-2-00017 Financial Assistance Award, Intent To Award a Noncompetitive Grant AGENCY: Savannah River Operations Office, DOE. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The DOE announces that it plans to award a renewal research grant to the South Carolina State University (SCSU), 300 University Avenue, NE, Orangeburg, South Carolina. The grant entitled, ``Comparative Effects of Carbon Dioxide Enrichment and pH Change on Phytoplankton Communities in Savannah River Site Carolina Bay Restoration Effects'', will be awarded for a two-year project period at a DOE funding level of $211,827. Funds of $105,342 will be awarded for the first budget period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder will be awarded for the second budget period. Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) of the DOE Assistance Regulations (10 CFR part 600), DOE has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE and eligibility for this renewal award shall be limited to SCSU. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beth O'Rear, Prime Contracts and Financial Assistance Branch, U.S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, P.O. Box A, Aiken, SC 29802, Telephone: (803) 725&hyph;1345. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Procurement Request Number: 09&hyph;94SR18049.001. Project Scope: During the past four years, SCSU has conducted phytoplankton research in Carolina Bay ecosystems on the Savannah River Site. The renewal will provide a better understanding of what effect nutrient enrichment (fertilizing during wetlands restoration) has on phytoplankton communities and the relative use of atmospheric CO 2 derived from in-situ decomposition by phytoplankton in Carolina bays. SCSU is a Historically Black University and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive Orders 12320, 12677, and 12876 pertaining to Federal assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The participation of HBCUs in federally supported research is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, Executive Orders directed Federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen their capabilities to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community. DOE has determined that this award to SCSU on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate. Issued in Aiken, South Carolina, on: March 14, 1994. Robert E. Lynch, DOE Savannah River Operations Office, Head of Contracting Activity Designee.
