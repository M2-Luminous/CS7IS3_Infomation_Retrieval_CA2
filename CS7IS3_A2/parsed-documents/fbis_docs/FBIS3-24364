After taking a first-hand look at the situation there, B.N. Yeltsin signed an edict "On the Procedure For Returning Refugees and Victims of Forced Resettlement Within the Territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic to Their Permanent Place of Residence." The edict evoked conflicting reactions in the two republics. In any case, one thing is clear: Until the causes of the confrontation between the two republics have been eliminated and public thinking has undergone radical changes, it will be difficult to expect these measures to have the desired impact. The tense atmosphere has to be defused, and all of the attempts to do this have been clearly inadequate. From Hatred to Tolerance In my opinion, there is a method of paving the way for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. The first condition would be the identification of the group of individuals who have committed serious crimes that are punishable by all standards of law and morality in any country. This could turn out to be impossible, but as long as murderers and warmongers are not governed by the criminal code of the Russian Federation, genuine reconciliation will be out of the question. The second condition is the use of the ethical factor. It consists in the wisdom of our people, who developed a procedure long ago for the reconciliation of conflicting parties. In essence, until the parties in a blood feud had reconciled, they would have to live according to the Islamic common law of the mountain people, with strict rules governing each step they took, even going so far as to tell them which streets they could use, which places they could visit, and which party would have to yield the road to the other. These strict rules of behavior in blood feuds attest to the use of separation as the main deterrent. This was done because feelings of rage and revenge were so strong that the feuding parties would kill each other when they met. It was not until after reconciliation that mediators and the close associates of the feuding parties would begin establishing favorable conditions (an art in itself) for communication, contacts, "chance meetings," and other exchanges between the reconciled parties. The process was accomplished one step at a time. Our leaders would be completely justified in making use of the priceless experience of past generations in big politics. For the sake of peace and accord, we need compromises and mutual concessions, and in this context it is extremely important for one nationality to put itself in the other's place, guided by the golden rule of morality: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." In this context, I am proposing a "program of emergence from crisis." The Reality Factor The stream of unsubstantiated mutual accusations and seething passions are keeping the two nationalities from taking a sober look at one another and realizing that they are both victims of the totalitarian regime. The Ingush people have to realize that the Ossetians did not seize a single inch of Ingush land themselves. As for the disputed rural communities in Prigorodnyy Rayon, they became part of North Ossetia in 1944 by a decision of the government officials of that time, who were demanding the settlement of these territories. The people there now are third-generation natives with no other homeland. Their forcible inclusion in the Ingush Republic is a new act of violence, which cannot contribute anything, to put it mildly, to the improvement of the situation. In short, it is impossible to ignore the historical realities that took shape in Prigorodnyy Rayon over the last 50 years, irrespective of our wishes and opinions. These realities have much more force than emotional outbursts and mercenary interests, and the main one is the fact that the inhabitants of Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of people of the Ingush nationality, categorically oppose their annexation by another republic. Their forced annexation would put us on the road to war, with all of its tragic consequences. Although I wish to retain an objective view of the actions of both sides, I would like to say that the Ossetians should sympathize more with the suffering of the Ingush people, the tragedy of their forcible eviction, and the difficulties of returning to their historical homeland and settling down there. This applies to the past and the present. Tens of thousands of innocent families lost their homes and livelihood. They are victims, not criminals: No one leaves his home, and everything he has ever worked for, by choice. We cannot call ourselves civilized if we are indifferent to the suffering of people to whom we are related by a common history. By the same token, it seems to me that the Ingush people also should be more careful in choosing their leaders. Ambitious extremists and mafia elements have driven their people to the verge of ruin. Their actions and appeals for the violent resolution of the territorial dispute have been ruinous for their innocent and unfortunate people. Renounce the Blood Feud The art of public diplomacy consists in promoting the kind of situation in which mutual forgiveness lies at the basis of reconciliation. The reconciliation of the parties in the blood feud could breach the thinking of most people and help them move from a state of mutual hatred to a recognition of the need to live in peace. Whether we like it or not, we were chosen by God and Destiny to live as neighbors. The sooner we realize this, the quicker the process of resolution will be. We have to finally admit that we have no other choice. The only alternative is brutal confrontation and war. There is still a good chance that reason will prevail and that our people will find the road to peace and accord. [Box] Program of Emergence From Crisis 1. A coordinating council, elected from among national and religious authorities with the participation of official government agencies, will set up reconciliation commissions in the republics of Ingushetia and North Ossetia on the republic, rayon, village, neighborhood, street, and building levels for the reconciliation of the feuding parties and the families of the deceased. 2. The reconciliation commissions in the republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, in contrast to conciliation commissions, must do the following: a) compile absolutely precise lists of the names of individuals who lost members of their families in the armed conflict in October-November 1992; b) conduct meetings with victims (those who lost family members) in North Ossetia and in Ingushetia and, after preliminary agreement on the terms of reconciliation, seek their approval of a declaration of reconciliation between the two nationalities and their refusal to persecute anyone for the bloodshed; c) elect authorized representatives of each side at meetings of the reconciliation commissions in the republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, with mediators from the Russian Federation and the republics, krays, and oblasts of the North Caucasus, and the possible participation of observers from the international community if necessary; d) conduct an official forum of authorized representatives, who will sign a memorandum based on the decisions of the reconciliation commissions at a joint meeting; e) complete the reconciliation by organizing a reconciliation table, where both sides will take a sacred vow--orally, in accordance with the customs of the Caucasus--to never resort to the use of arms again in the settlement of disagreements, reinforcing this commitment by shaking hands and calling upon Almighty God and all of the saints as witnesses. 3. The process of the reconciliation of feuding parties will not apply to those who treated their victims with brutality and savagery. 4. An essential condition for the reconciliation of the parties in a blood feud is the payment of blood money, taking the form of financial compensation and emotional satisfaction. 5. During the reconciliation process, conciliation commissions will also be working simultaneously on solutions to two major problems: a) the search for missing persons; b) the return (sequential) of innocent victims to their previous place of residence.
