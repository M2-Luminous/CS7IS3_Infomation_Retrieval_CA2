Such achievements scored the province have resulted from earnestly implementing the party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee; and from emancipating minds, changing the concept, and following a correct road. These achievements have also resulted from the arduous struggle launched by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province. He said: Firmly regarding agriculture as a foundation in conducting economic construction represents the fundamentally guiding ideology fostered by our party in a long time and also represents an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The prominent role played by agriculture in Liaoning Province that is with a large proportion of industrial production and a large number of urban population has become more obvious. He stressed: The party committee at city and county levels should give its working emphasis and major energy to the rural work. Following the rural work conference, various localities should go into action immediately to implement in a down- to-earth manner the spirit of the work conference and do a good job in conducting the work in various fields for the winter-spring period.
