In the view of this well-known political scientist, all sides must show restraint until a thorough and impartial investigation has been held of all circumstances under which 68 people were killed and nearly 200 injured in a recent blast in Sarajevo. Migranian believes that the debate of the possibility of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs has contributed to "a nervous atmosphere in which one of the warring parties is tempted into hurrying things up and the other is continuously on the verge of failing to restrain itself." He emphasized: "It is an abnormal situation in which the prey has been determined in advance, which is a source of tension in itself." "A strike against Serbians is indeed likely to prove to be a strike against Russia," Migranian said. He insisted that the Russian public should not be misled into believing that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader, was the sole force in the Russian political spectrum that was friendly towards Serbia. He recalled a State Duma resolution, adopted by a huge majority, that rejected placing all the blame for the conflict on one side and called for lifting the sanctions against Serbia. "Russian diplomacy's non-resistance in the face of NATO's improper intentions and of further dangerous escalation of the Yugoslav crisis can result in a dramatic escalation of the political strife in Russia and harm President Boris Yeltsin's image," Migranian emphasized.
