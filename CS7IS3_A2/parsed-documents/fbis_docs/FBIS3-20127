Balladur suspended the plan for a week at a meeting with youth leaders on Monday. Sarkozy said the government would organise a conference, which he called "a youth states-general," to restore dialogue. A ministerial committee consisting of Education Minister Francois Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon and Youth and Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, would organise the conference, Sarkozy said. He also said that Michel Bon, director-general of the national employment agency ANPE had been charged by Balladur to set up "a job-seeking system" for youths. A youth leader walked out of the meeting because Balladur did not withdraw the jobs plan completely. Cecile Amar, of the high school students' federation FIDL, said she also walked out because Balladur said he did not have the authority to grant two other demands. These were that court cases against student demonstrators be dropped and two Algerians who were deported last week for alleged theft and throwing stones at police during a rally in Lyon, eastern France, be brought back. Amar said a planned national demonstration next Thursday would still go ahead. Also in the youth delegation was Philippe Campinchi, president of the pro-socialist UNEF-ID students union, and Bob Injey, leader of the pro-communist UNEF. Ad hoc groups coordinating the protest campaign in technical universities and nationally were represented by Helene Joubert and Christophe Hode. Speaking on Sunday after claiming victory for his conservative coalition in local elections, Balladur had pledged to move "to re-establish dialogue" over his jobs plan, following a month of sometimes violent protests by students and trade unions. Balladur said that the plan had only been a government attempt to fight unemployment, but it had been "interpreted as showing a lack of attention" towards young people. "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the government," he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people." Balladur said said it was "the duty of society to offer young people a future. And for this we should start by re-establishing dialogue with them and examine the various possible solutions." With Balladur were Labour Minister Michel Giraud as well as Sarkozy. Under the jobs plan, aimed at reducing unemployment, young people under 25 with diplomas or university degrees were to have been paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, the remaining time being spent on training. Unqualified youths would be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. [passage omitted]
