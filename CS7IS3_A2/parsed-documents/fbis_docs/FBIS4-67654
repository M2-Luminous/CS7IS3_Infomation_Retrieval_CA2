Organized by the Ministries of Public Health and Public Security, the association draws in nearly 200 council members including six vice-ministerial officials and affiliated departmental- and bureau-level officers from the aforementioned ministries and the Ministries of Justice and Civil Affairs, the Army and Police Force, as well as several dozen leading public health officials from other provinces and cities. It also consists of numerous well-known experts and scholars from state research units such as the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and China Foundation for Global Venereal Disease and AIDS, plus research and prevention organizations in other provinces and cities. Following six years of efforts since the First World AIDS Day on December 1, 1988, a nationwide network to monitor and prevent sexually transmitted diseases has been formed. The government has successively established the China Consulting Committee of Experts on VD, the State Expert Committee on Control and Prevention of AIDS, and the China Research Center of VD Prevention. It has set up 26 monitoring sites and 1,535 VD prevention organizations across the country, HIV monitoring centers in 13 provinces and 161 HIV monitoring posts in further provinces and regions. Some 200 HIV initial detection labs have been created nationwide, and the number of AIDS identification labs has risen to 12. In 1993, with support from the Ministries of Public Health and Finance, Guangdong and Yunnan, the two provinces where the AIDS problem is the most serious, established their own AIDS prevention centers. [passage omitted] The task for the new association is to coordinate and integrate promotion and education, medical treatment and prevention, scientific research and legal supervision. It must form a strong behemoth of opinion and force of opposition across society to finally curb the continuous spread of AIDS.
