The penalty will be imposed on Chileans Jaime Francisco Sebastian Castillo Petruzzi, [see 29 October 1993 and 19 November 1993 Terrorism Reports for coverage of arrest] Lautaro Enrique Mellado Saavedra, and Maria Concepcion Pincheira Saenz, and on Peruvians Heber Celso Oliva Zelada and Segundo Nemesio Alva Marin, who were involved in the abduction of Peruvian entrepreneur Raul Hiraoka Torres and other crimes. The public relations office of the Supreme Council of the Military Courts explained that high treason is the legal name for aggravated terrorism, ``which because of its juridical nature and its dangerousness applies to both nationals and foreigners, because terrorism is a crime against mankind that is repressed ex officio in all countries of the world.''
