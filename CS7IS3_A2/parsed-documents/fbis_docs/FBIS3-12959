The reports say that demonstrators hoisted banners denouncing the regime and calling for its overthrow. The demonstrators also called for an improvement in living standards. Demonstrations are reported to have taken place in al-Qanah, Madinat al-Thawrah, Hayy Jamilah, and other Baghdad neighborhoods. Iraqis from all walks of life took part in the protests, openly declaring their discontent with the general situation and particularly with economic conditions. The dictatorial regime answered the masses with its customary iron fist. Its forces used all types of weapons against the demonstrators, killing, and wounding many. In its 4 March Issue, the AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper reports the eruption of widespread protests. It says that more than 1,600 Iraqi and Arab students took part in demonstrations in Baghdad, protesting the regime's closure of the Arab College for Science and Technology, a school founded by the Arab Food Industry Association. AL-MU'TAMAR [paper of the United National Iraqi Congress], in today's issue, Monday, cites the Iraqi Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in Baghdad as saying that a strong explosion occurred a few days ago in front of the main gate of al-Mustansiriyah University. The explosion rocked Baghdad and partially wrecked a large mural of Saddam Husayn. Security forces rushed to the scene. The main gate of al-Mustansiriyah University is now closed until the damage is repaired. This explosion follows a spate of attacks against patrols of security forces and police in all Baghdad areas during the past few weeks. Baghdad was also the scene of a wave of bombings. Gas stations in al-Thawrah and Abu Ghurayb were bombed in late February. The storage tanks of both stations caught fire, leading to explosions that were heard miles away. In another development, reports from Baghdad cite well-informed sources as saying that the dictator's son-in law [Industry and Minerals Minister] Husayn Kamil is currently undergoing treatment in an Amman hospital for a gunshot wound to the head, not a head illness as earlier reported. In Karkuk, the regime is reinforcing its forces in fear of a popular uprising that may jeopardize its hold on the city. Fear and panic are common among circles in the repressive regime. The local authorities are employing a variety of intimidation tactics to terrorize the population into submission. Karkuk military commanders have instructed army patrols to prevent young men from al-Sulaymaniyah from travelling to Karkuk and Baghdad. The regime has massed many troops in the Khalid barracks, as well as in Andik and (Naylan). On 5 March, 60 tanks arrived from Tikrit at the Khalid barraks near Karkuk. Infantry and a number of tanks have been dispatched to Jabal Bur in anticipation of a popular uprising in Karkuk. The regime has also begun dismantling the big prefab installations on the side of Karkuk-Irbil road and sending them to (Hamuwir) and other cities under its control. Reports from Karkuk also indicate that the regime arrested a number of retired Kurdish officers in the city. No information is yet available about their fate. A senior official in the ruling party, during a recent visit to (al-Hawijah), expressed concern that a popular uprising is brewing in Karkuk. The air is rife with tension and uncertainty in that city, and regime forces have assumed positions at key junctures as well as hilltops. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk has been evacuated and a curfew is in force in the areas of Azabi, al-Sharja, and al-Iskan. Many citizens have been arrested. In another development, many of the regime's servicemen in Mosul are reportedly afraid of the possibility of a popular uprising erupting in that city. To confront the situation, the regime sent troops armed with field artillery to al-Nu'maniyah and Ba'shiqah.
