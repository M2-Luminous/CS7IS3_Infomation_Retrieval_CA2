The leading composite stock price index was up 16.31 points, or 1.76 percent, over the weekend to finish at 942.50. Besides the summit issue, the stock authorities' decision to allow three Hyundai firms' issues to be transacted off-board contributed to the overall surge. Volume was large with 49 million shares changing hands at 900 billion won (1,116.62 million U.S. dollars). Advancing issues overwhelmed decliners 632 to 181 with 76 others remaining unchanged. Mining and insurance were only major issues that slid. The rise of construction, trade and banking issues was especially sharp.
