The first quarterly allowances are in effect on an interim basis. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, pollock is not divided into quarterly allowances, and one-fourth of the TAC is available on an interim basis. 3Pacific cod is allocated 90 percent to the inshore, and 10 percent to the offshore component. One-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations will be available on an interim basis. Component allowances are shown in Table 4. 4``Deep-water flatfish'' means Dover sole and Greenland turbot. Rex sole is a separate target species beginning with the 1994 fishing year. 5``Shallow-water flatfish'' means flatfish not including ``deep-water flatfish,'' flathead sole, rex sole, or arrowtooth flounder. 6Sablefish is allocated to trawl and hook-and-line gears (Table 2). 7``Pacific ocean perch'' means Sebastes alutus. 8``Shortraker/rougheye rockfish'' means Sebastes borealis (shortraker) and S. aleutianus (rougheye). 9``Other rockfish'' in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas and in the West Yakutat District means slope rockfish and demersal shelf rockfish. The category ``other rockfish'' in the Southeast Outside District means slope rockfish. 10``Slope rockfish'' means Sebastes aurora (aurora), S melanostomus (blackgill), S paucispinis (bocaccio), S goodei (chilipepper), S crameri (darkblotch), S elongatus (greenstriped), S variegateu (harlequin), S wilsoni (pygmy), S proriger (redstripe), S zacentrus (sharpchin), S jordani (shortbelly), S brevispinis (silvergrey), S diploproa (splitnose), S saxicola (stripetail), S miniatus (vermilion), S babcocki (redbanded), and S reedi (yellowmouth). 11``Demersal shelf rockfish'' means Sebastes pinniger (canary), S nebulosus (china), S caurinus (copper), S maliger (quillback), S helvomaculatus (rosethorn), S nigrocinctus (tiger), and S ruberrimus (yelloweye). 12``Northern rockfish'' means Sebastes polyspinis. 13``Pelagic shelf rockfish'' includes Sebastes melanops (black), S mystinus (blue), S ciliatus (dusky), S entomelas (widow), and S flavidus (yellowtail). 14Atka mackerel is a separate target species beginning in 1994. 15``Other species'' includes sculpins, sharks, skates, eulachon, smelts, capelin, squid, and octopus. The TAC for ``other species'' equals 5 percent of the TACs of target species. 16NA=not applicable. 17The total ABC reflects the sum of the ABCs for target species.
