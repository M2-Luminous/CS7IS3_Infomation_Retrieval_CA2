Many would necessarily prefer an alliance or simply close relations with Russia to the risk of independent navigation on the stormy waters of world politics and the world market. This is a distant prospect of the development of the Russian state. But it needs to be discussed even now, when the process of the recognition and determination of Russia's national interests is under way. There is no doubt that it should not be a question of a desire to revive the messianic role of the tsarist or communist empire but of a strong and stable democratic Russia becoming an equal and active participant in the world community capable of performing a positive role in it and helping other countries resolve problems of poverty, hunger, disease, and technological backwardness and, most important, strengthen international security. The interests of a strong and stable Russia thus do not contradict any legitimate interests of other countries of the world community but naturally complement them. Today, however, Russia is in a state of decline. This is seen overseas also. Against the background of a contradictory attitude toward the processes in Russia there was recently an event that evoked neither a polemic nor a serious response in the country. In a directive to the foreign policy and financial departments, U.S. President Clinton proposed that Russia be classed as a developing state. This was done, it was explained to us, for purely formal purposes: to simplify the bureaucratic procedures of the granting of aid to Russia. However the American side justifies its position, this is for us yet another reason for reflecting on the simplest matter: Where is our society headed? Do Russian politicians understand that the time allotted us for changes is not unlimited? That some of the results of the government's activity as of the present are, truly, putting Russia in the category of a poor developing country? Foreign Policy: From Illusions to Pragmatism The seriousness of the moment being experienced by Russia in its international position is connected largely with the unpropitious combination of its progress toward full-fledged sovereignty on the one hand and the incomplete nature of the structural reorganization of the global system on the other. Although there is talk everywhere about the disintegration of the old bipolar structure of the world and of a return of the era of multipolarity, virtually, a certain military-political "sesqui-polarity" continues in the world. At the same time the self-regulation of the global structure is in fact taking place, and its dramatic aspect is that not since the times of the establishment of the Versailles order of 1919, probably, has Russia's participation in it been as passive as it is today. The difference being merely that at that time Russia was kept apart from an active role, today it is itself, rather, on account of many factors, late in formulating its own legitimate interests and long-term goals. Meanwhile the situation in which Russian diplomacy is having to debut in many respects is distinguished by higher-than-usual complexity. The edifice of the "Yalta-Potsdam order" has collapsed, but international stability has not become more durable because of this. A practice whereby the Seven have in fact become the source of the controlling impulses in the international system has taken shape; decisions harmonized by it in advance are assuming the form of UN statutes; a key role in their realization is being performed by the efforts of individual countries semi-independently determining the composition and scale of their participation coalitions formed on an ad hoc basis. Diplomacy under the new conditions is performing an important role, but the military component would no longer seem to be relegated to the background, as was the case in the recent times of the Soviet and American accords of 1985-1991. Economics has become an effective instrument of systemic regulation. But as the old stabilizing structures have gone into decline, the natural boundaries of the efficiency of economic factors have been revealed also. Evidence of this have been the fruitless attempts to apply economic sanctions in the Iraq and Yugoslavia situations, as, equally, the forced use of force in Tajikistan, which had just about fallen apart under the pressure of intertribal discord, in the Kartveli-Megreli-Abkhaz conflict in the Transcaucasus, or, finally, in Somalia. A whole school of literature developing nonmilitary aspects of international and national security had appeared in the preceding five-seven years in Russia. The result of the new mood at the political level was the adoption of a number of important measures to limit the omnipotence of the military-industrial complex. Also oriented from the outset toward continuation of this policy, with its characteristic predominance of a negatively skeptical attitude toward armed force, was the leadership of the Russian Federation, which encountered here the full understanding of its main overseas partners and world public opinion. Events would have developed within the framework of this tendency, evidently, had it not been for two circumstances. The disintegration of the USSR brought about a rapid increase in inherent conflict in all spheres of interstate relations in the CIS. The question of armed force immediately came to be at the center of public attention--initially in the form of a bitter political struggle "to inherit the Union," subsequently in the form of a debate on the capacity of each state to defend its sovereignty and the interests of the citizens against threats of power encroachments, which had for the first time in many decades become real. Such was the internal, Russian, aspect of the problem. But there was, in addition, the international aspect also. Approximately on the frontier of 1991 and 1992 an understanding of the impossibility of regulating international relations as had been done under the conditions of classic bipolarity--by means of menacing actions and demonstrations--began to mature among Western specialists and politicians on the basis of an analysis of the Yugoslav tragedy and the war in the Gulf. A perception of the need for some quite serious and effective steps emerged. Decisions were adopted in this context on limiting military operations under the aegis of the United Nations in Bosnia and Somalia; on the "peace-making functions" of Russian forces in Tajikistan and Georgia; and discussion of the position of the great powers in respect to the civil war in Angola, which is once again threatening to affect the adjacent states. All these disquieting trends are prompting another reevaluation of the military factor in international relations on the frontier of the new century. The yearning for a still unattainable future of "general freedom, stability, and prosperity" must not screen the prosaic conclusion (or working hypothesis) that the world of the 1990's, which has ceased to be regulated in bipolar fashion, is evidently experiencing a need for strong management to a greater extent, virtually, than the "Yalta-Potsdam order" from 1962 through 1991 had need of it. Toward Recognition of the Russian `Self' Our country does not have manifest enemies, as the United States and NATO were for the Soviet Union. But it has simultaneously also been deprived of former allies, on whom the USSR could rely at least to some extent (India). Calls are being heard from Moscow insistently for partnership with the civilized part of the outside world. But this part itself has not determined either its tasks in a partnership with Russia or its optimum forms. The interest of the developed part of the international community in the Russian Federation is painted in negative colors, in the main: everyone knows more or less precisely what the new Russia should not be, but has very confused ideas about what it could and should be without losing national identity. This asseveration should be heard, of course, as a rebuke mainly to ourselves inasmuch as no one can explain to Russia its status in world politics from outside. There is no viable partnership based merely on a "pure idea" and declarations, and a legally formalized system of partner relations cannot emerge before Moscow clearly outlines the contours of its national interests. In order for a treaty to be durable it is essential to anticipate the emergence of nonconcurrent viewpoints. They should not be, of course, even potentially mutually exclusive, but they can and will differ. The task of Russian diplomacy is not propaganda of the dubious premise of the total coincidence of the foreign policy tasks of Russia and the progressive part of the world community but close cooperation on a reasonably wide range of fundamental world problems and assurance of the West's understanding of specific aspects of Russia's foreign policy tasks. This formulation of the issue also presupposes, of course, great clarity as regards the essence of the phenomenon of postimperial and noncommunist Russia. It is reasonable to approach its conceptualization by taking Russia's geopolitical parameters as the starting point. What follows from the nature of Russia's interest in foreign policy revealed following the disintegration of the USSR? It is understandable that Russia depends exclusively on the situation in the Northern Hemisphere, where Eurasia and North America are located, and the direct challenges to Russia's security lie in continental Eurasia. Europe outside of the former Soviet Empire would be in a state of stability had not the Yugoslav cauldron erupted in the Balkans. Germany and France (and also Italy, perhaps) could potentially embark on a gradual division of spheres of influence in the former Yugoslavia. This in itself would disturb stability in the European zone. But the affiliation to the Yugoslav conflict of the Islamic world, and that of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey in the future is not ruled out, could turn the Balkans into a permanent focal point of tension and a generator of the disintegration of a "united" Europe and NATO even. Contradictions between the United States and its European allies could reach a significant level. Russia is not entangled directly in the Yugoslav knot, whatever is being said in respect to Serbia. But two unpleasant consequences ensue from the Yugoslav crisis: Europe will be mainly preoccupied with the Balkans, paying increasingly less attention to the post-Soviet geopolitical field, and Turkey, penetrating it more and more, will raise its international price quotation. East Europe is an economic cordon filtering potential Western capital investments and also a political cordon for Russia's integration in the European structures: The opinion that East Europe is supposed to be there first has taken shape. It cannot be ruled out that the East European countries will arrive at the conclusion of a mini-bloc in this composition or the other. The Baltic cuts off Russia from Scandinavia and Poland (not to mention the absolute vulnerability of Kaliningrad Oblast) and is of an anti-Russian frame of mind, on the whole. Belarus, the country that is the most well-disposed toward Russia among the young states, has under these conditions acquired the role, entirely particular and clearly expressed, but not recognized in Moscow, of sole dependable link between Russia and Europe. Ukraine could be both a most important ally of Russia and a no less powerful enemy. Even if common sense in the sphere of the economic union prevails, a real political ally has not even emerged as yet. Ukraine has in fact fenced Russia off from Southeast Europe. In Moldova Russia's positions could be strong only in the event of reunification with Romania beginning to take shape. Thus a picture wherein Russia objectively cannot perform an appreciable geopolitical role in Europe emerges (Russia's submarines could potentially keep the whole world in their sights, but this in itself would not restore to Russia the position of globally significant power). That there is hardly anything that threatens Russia on the part of Europe is another matter. The loss of geopolitical function in Europe in itself reduces Russia's role also; but the geopolitical function is not an end in itself, it is vitally important whence the threat to the national interests of a country, particularly its security, emanates. With the new alignment of forces it would be appropriate to consider as Russia's base reference point in relation to the system of geopolitical coordinates the deterrence in world politics of extremism. To the extent that the main habitat of their [as published] concentration is the geopolitical south, the deterrence potential should be oriented in this direction (although not in this direction alone). Russia's geopolitical role consists mainly of deterring the Eurasian South in the broadest sense. The West, concerned with the defenses of the oceanic part of Eurasia, would not be in a position to render Russia the least effective support. But without a system of alliances Russia itself could do nothing either. The "doubled," Eurasian, essential content of Russia's national interest predetermines the need for a carefully adjusted balance of the western and eastern priorities of Russia's foreign policy. The currently predominant "Europe-bound" course is just as unacceptable as the primitive prescriptions of the search for national interest in the thickets of "Russian-Tatar" antiquity. The problem is that the possibilities of Europe are not unlimited even in the spheres in which it wants and is truly in a position to help us. European support in the surmounting of food difficulties and the modernization of the Russian fuel and raw material sectors is one thing. Actual support in the stabilization of the immediate surroundings and a strengthening of the regional security of Russia is quite another. In this sense Russian and "European" interests coincide in far from all things. A durable alliance with Ukraine and Belarus is essential to Russia, say. But Germany has an objective interest more in the "dilution" of the western flank of the political space of the CIS, which inevitably presupposes a more or less lengthy period of its destabilization. The FRG has already realized a model of this attitude in the Yugoslav conflict, having gambled on its escalation. Nor is there much in common as far as the European and Russian perceptions of the threat of Islamic extremism are concerned. As long as Russian forces remain outside of Russia, this danger will painfully affect Russian interests in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict, in Tajikistan, and in other former Union republics of Central Asia. Europe cannot give Russia practical assistance in deterring or, even less, removing these threats. Moscow's solidarity with Europe in the approach to regional conflicts is the equivalent of European solidarity with Moscow in far from all practical aspects. That is, there is evidence of support as such, but it does not go beyond diplomatic and moral support. Because for West Europe the Asiatic challenges are abstractions in everything that goes beyond the framework of Islamic-Arab terrorism. And for Russia, thousands of casualties in the manpower dragged into senseless regional conflicts and real threats to the territorial integrity of the state. Euro-Atlantic thinking is not ready for participation in deterring these threats, nor does it have the necessary experience. Yet the specifics of Russia's geopolitical location demand paramount attention in the sphere of inherent regional conflict. In failing to give them due attention now Moscow runs the risk of allowing situations which are no longer theoretical but which really threaten the European Russian "self" to arise. There are just two ways to defend it--via reinforcement by other Slav components (Ukrainian and Belarusian) or via the formulation of a correct balance of interaction with the East. The first path is easier and preferable. But politically it is problematical. In putting undue emphasis on it, Russia would make itself too dependent on Ukraine and would lose time for the necessary development of the rational conditions regulating the degree of its selective openness to the East. Being boundlessly open to it today would be an archaism preserved since the times of the "indestructible unity" of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. And to the extent that this unity is now being disputed it is necessary to formulate a strategy of a strengthening of the Russian state "self," proceeding from the worst-case scenario--were the country to find itself head to head with the post-Soviet East. Russia cannot simply fence itself off from Asia, as Poland, Estonia, or the EC countries can. Copies of the West European versions of the foreign policy line are no use. The most complex challenge is the need to formulate an active policy, preserve Russia's national identity, and strengthen stability throughout Western Eurasia. It is understandable that this task is barely feasible without the support of allies and partners. All the more important is it seeking them among the countries really capable of supporting Russia primarily on questions of the deterrence of inherent conflict. If there is, indeed, anyone who may be relied on in this sense, it is not the EC countries but, rather, the United States--to the extent, of course, that Russia is at all able to enlist foreign states in the solution of such a delicate question as a strengthening of national security. Lessons of the Conflicts in the Post-Soviet Space The problem of a reduction in Russia's presence in the regions directly adjoining the present national borders and the border of the former USSR may be considered the most complex and painful. It is obvious that Russia cannot carry the burden of the economic and military-political maintenance of stability in its outlying areas. Consequently, it is necessary to settle on the priorities and timeframe of long-term investments in Russia's national security. An estimation of such a modus operandi in accordance with the "cost-effectiveness" criterion is absolutely essential, what is more. These theoretically absolutely clear propositions have been observed in only a small number of instances throughout Russian history. Unfortunately, there are objective reasons for unavoidable involvement in the conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. We may put in this category: 1) the so-called Russian-speaking population, whose interests and security Russia has undertaken to defend; 2) the economic interdependence of Russia and the countries that are now its immediate neighbors. It is to the accomplishment of these tasks that we should pay attention primarily, evidently. Or sacrifice them in the future for the sake of as pragmatic an accomplishment as possible of the foreign policy tasks confronting Russia. Russia has found itself involved in this form or the other in a whole number of armed conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. In Tajikistan Russia is engaged in "peace-making" operations and ensuring the security of the state border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan in accordance with an interstate agreement and the mandate of the CIS obtained in accordance with the Treaty on Collective Security of the CIS. In Moldova Russia's 14th Combined-Arms Army is engaged in operations to disengage the parties in the area of Bendery and the Left Bank of the Dniester in accordance with agreements concluded among Moldova, the Dniester region, Ukraine, and Russia. In Georgia Russian subunits, in accordance with an interstate agreement, are exercising a peacekeeping function in the area of the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict. In addition, Russian forces have been enlisted in the guarding of the strategically important Transcaucasus Railroad. The experience of the Russian Army's participation in the limited military conflicts on the territory of the former USSR makes it possible to draw the following conclusions: (1) Russia is at the present time the sole state that has the military, political, and technical resources for undertaking military operations on the territory of the former USSR, peacekeeping operations included. In the foreseeable future only Ukraine and Uzbekistan can, in theory, create such potential. (2) In the majority of cases (Tajikistan, the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, the conflict in the Dniester region) Russian forces were pulled into the armed conflicts by way of escalation before the Russian leadership adopted the decision to use them. This testifies that the mere fact of the deployment of subunits of the Russian Army outside of its national territory (particularly in areas where armed conflicts are already under way or are potential) inevitably entails considerable military and political costs. (3) Russia's participation in the so-called peacekeeping operations could be associated with the active use of military force going beyond the limits of self-defense. From the viewpoint of legal regulation the approach to such operations should be the same as in the case of the use of force in interstate clashes. Unfortunately, the narrowness of the legislative base has been revealed in the course of Russia's participation in these conflicts. As a whole, the possibility of Russia's becoming pulled into military conflicts on the territory of the countries of the former USSR not as a result of an independent policy decision but by virtue of some international agreements and in accordance with a decision of supranational authorities, which at the present time is possible as a result of Russia's ratification of a package of military agreements within the framework of the CIS, should be completely excluded. (4) Russia should state openly that it is not nor can it be a guarantor of the security of all states of post-Soviet Eurasia. It is essential to enshrine in legislation the provision that the security guarantees granted states of the CIS by Russia extend only to the field of interstate relations, not affecting internal conflicts or conflicts between countries of the CIS. (5) Russia's participation in limited military conflicts on the territory of the former USSR will inevitably create two serious political problems, at least. First, a precedent for Russia's further enlistment as a "policeman" for the accomplishment of its local military-political tasks. Second, Russia's active participation in such conflicts could shape an extremely unprofitable image of our country--as the "gendarme of Eurasia." This danger is increased by the fact that in not one instance of the peacekeeping operations undertaken by Russia has it had a UN mandate. Public Opinion and Russia's Relations With the West The West's loyal attitude toward Russia will remain in the foreseeable future a principal condition of the success of the Russian reforms. At the same time there is no doubt that the methods by which Smolenskaya Ploshchad has endeavored to secure a mutual understanding with the democratic countries are largely played out. We are talking primarily about the endeavor to persuade the West of the constructive nature of Moscow's intentions by means of radical concessions in the fields in which the advantages of the USSR, and then of Russia, were considered, conditionally speaking, not entirely legitimate. Among these concessions were positions that Moscow had acquired, first, by virtue of power and para-power ambitions (strategic arms) and, second, as a result of imperial aspirations. It has to be acknowledged that this policy has, in a sense, been successful: The West has recognized in greater depth its dependence on the success of the Russian reforms. But simultaneously the line of the radicals in Yeltsin's team has had its drawbacks also. Raised on the idea of Russia's great-power status, the population of the country has perceived variously Moscow's new role as obliging partner of the West. The disenchantment with the government's foreign policy line increased markedly when questions of the defense of Russian interests in the new independent states of the former USSR, for which the foreign policy department proved to be wholly unprepared, "suddenly" came to be within the jurisdiction of the Russian Foreign Ministry. The pent-up dissatisfaction of part of society with the reforms in their radical version could easily assume and inevitably will assume, if this is not prevented, the form of anti-West protests and xenophobia. It is for this reason that the demonstrative emphasis of the unity and proximity of the Russian leadership and the leadership of Western countries, characteristic both of officials and the mass media, could at the level of the everyday consciousness, as before, be associated both with the West's incapacity for really improving the situation in Russia and with the reluctance of the president's team to probe the essence of the inherently Russian singularities of the difficulties which are being experienced on account of a desire "not to retreat one step" from Western standards. The anti-American, anti-West mood today, as distinct from the recent Soviet period of our history (1985-1991), is an entirely significant aspect of Russia's foreign policy life. Specific Features of Russia's National Interest in Relations With the Outside World A probable source of the indecisiveness of Russian diplomacy in 1991-1993 in the shaping of national tasks was the weakness of its scientific-analysis support. Another was the objective complexity of the process of recognition of the new position of the Federation in the international system. But the most essential reason in this respect in the recent period has been the instinctive fear of counterposing Russia to its Western partners, which could be explained also as an inability to explain to them the national specifics of Russia's foreign policy interests and to secure the West's understanding of these specifics and its fair attitude toward them. One has the impression that Russian diplomacy is abandoning at every step the formulation of its own vision of this international reality or the other even when its Western partners are expecting and revealing signs of a readiness to understand this particular vision. The shaping of Russia's approach to the new independent states of the former Yugoslavia is the most striking example. It is well known that at the end of 1991-start of 1992 there was no unity among the NATO countries on the question of recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, which had broken away from the Yugoslav Federation. Germany was emphatically demanding support for Croatia, while the United States was referring to the need to preliminarily secure from Croatia assurances of its observance of a whole number of conditions. France adopted a guarded attitude toward Germany's opinion also. The Russian Foreign Ministry was practically immediately oriented toward unconditional support for Germany's viewpoint, which was manifestly at odds with Russia's historical policy. Russia's diplomatic recognition of Croatia came two months before the United States arrived at this decision. Yet it is the unresolved nature of the questions about which America's diplomats had been speaking from the very outset that have led to the protracted and bloody war. And this despite the fact that for the United States or Germany the question of relations with the new states of Yugoslavia is predominantly of humanitarian and economic interest, while for Russia it could be a principal strategic direction of its entire European policy. The Yugoslavia situation afforded an exceptionally propitious opportunity for acquiring experience for the championing of our particular vision of the situation while remaining at the same time within the framework of "normal" differences with our partners. This opportunity was let slip. And Russian diplomacy has simply failed in relations with its Western partners to master the "ethics of refusal." The negative consequences of the policy of the passive "following of the West" are manifold. In first place is the disorientation of Russia's foreign partners in an understanding of the events and processes occurring in the country. Western politicians and experts on Russia could be forming an extremely approximate and superficial opinion of the extent to which Kozyrev's foreign policy line is contributing to the success of the reforms in Russia and how strongly it is provoking public disagreement with the president's policy as a whole. It is still hard for the West to appreciate the correlation between possible gains from support for the present "universalist" foreign policy of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the potential losses from it for Yeltsin's political base. A second negative result of the present policy could be the Western partners' crisis of confidence in what is being said about foreign policy in Russia. The West has become accustomed to building its relations and assessments of the Russian situation on the grounds of assurances of Moscow's like-mindedness and solidarity with the Seven. It if turns out that this policy is in fact undermining the prestige of the West in Russia and programming an inevitable anti-West political tilt, Russian foreign policy will find itself in an extremely difficult position. It would hardly make sense for Russia to attempt to appear to the West better than it objectively can be today. In general form the most urgent task for Russian diplomacy is to defend in relations with the world community its "right to specific features"--defend in such a way as not only to not intimidate the West but, on the contrary, to afford it an opportunity to put together, finally, a realistic idea of what the actual contours of Russia's national interests are. There undoubtedly are coincident and unifying aspirations of Russia and the West. The task is merely to conscientiously explain to ourselves and our partners their outlines. And simultaneously provide information on certain, most important, inherently Russian interests. These are: first, assurance of strategic stability in the post-Soviet political space with interaction with democratic countries and within the framework of internationally recognized standards of foreign policy behavior and possible future accords in this connection with the United States and other interested states; second, defense by nonmilitary methods of the personal rights of Russians and national communities oriented toward Russia, whose emergence in countries of the "new abroad" is historically connected with the existence of the Soviet Union and the share of moral responsibility for its policy which is inevitably left to the Russian Federation; third, the elaboration of a plan of interaction with individual components of the Federation, partnership with the new independent states in the post-Soviet space, and a general vision of world economic and political problems which is its own and historically distinct, but which remains within the limits of the democratic and liberal models of social relations.
