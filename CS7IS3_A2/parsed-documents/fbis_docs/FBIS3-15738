First of all I would like to single out the political treaty on friendship and cooperation between Lithuania and Romania. Romania was one of the first countries to recognize the newly restored independence of Lithuania. [Word indistinct] the second half of this century has been quite alike. Since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 we underwent similar fate -- Lithuania was occupied and Romania lost Bessarabia. We all entered the period of (?the fear of) Socialism or, shall I say, the fear of influence of Stalinist oppression. Now under the conditions of free development there are again similarities in our way: both of our countries have become members of the Council of Europe and both of our countries have already signed the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO. Further steps in our development are also quite similar -- Romania is already an associated member of the European Union while Lithuania is hoping to achieve this status perhaps this year. The possibilities for our cooperation in all spheres are huge too, because both of our countries are trying to consolidate the steps towards free market economy and towards the development of really democratic society. Extending my gratitude to His Excellency President Iliescu and his delegation for visiting Lithuania I would like to wish the Romanian President and all the Romanian people all the best success and to achieve all the goals that they had set for themselves. [Unidentified moderator] Now, His Excellency Ion Iliescu, the Romanian president. [Iliescu] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I should like to express our thanks for the climate of friendship and for very good conditions of our visit, of our talks. I should firstly underline the political significance of our visit. It is the first visit of a chief of state of Romania in the new, independent Lithuania. And therefore the signature of the political document, the treaty of [word indistinct] cooperation between our two states, and some economic agreements are an expression of our goodwill, of our political determination to strengthen and to develop our relations. (? At least could we see) even today, by visiting the [word indistinct], the history of our two countries has a lot of similarities. It is a history of the people which has fought during their history to preserve their independence, their sovereignty, their cultures, and now we are fighting to consolidate our new achievements on the way of democratization, of the strengthening of a state ruled by the law and to promote the very difficult process of transition from a state, a centralized system of economy to a market, efficient economy. We (?are considering in) this very concentrated program of our visit and of our discussions a lot of problems, preoccupations, difficulties which we are passing through and I think the exchange of experience, the better knowledge of each other will be a very good contribution to strengthen our ties and to develop our common experience in this very difficult way of contemporary history of our countries and [words indistinct]. We are both preoccupied to promote the integration of our countries in a new Europe, in a new, united Europe, to liquidate any remnants of the separation of our continent into (?walls) separated by the military means, by the political, ideological barriers and now by economic barriers which are much more visible. And we have to make a large effort to promote this new climate on the continent. As President Brazauskas underlined, we are going together on this way and I think we shall do it with success. We wanted to express our sympathy, our solidarity with the Lithuanian people and hope you the best in you efforts and in your national (?development). [Unidentified correspondent from Romanian Radio] As it is Women's Day, I would like to ask both His Excellency the President of Lithuania and his excellency the president of Romania to allow Romanian Radio to ask two questions. One of the topics of yesterday's talks was the question of minorities and relationships with neighboring countries. What is your specific point of view on this topic? [Brazauskas] Indeed, we did talk about the issues of national minorities and relations with neighboring countries with His Excellency President Iliescu and we found out that our opinions on these issues were similar and, I would say, even coincided, because the establishment of friendly relations with neighboring countries is one of the chief goals of our foreign relations policy. We hope to sign in the nearest future friendship and cooperation agreements with Belarus and Poland. As to ethnic minorities, I must say that ethnic minorities in Lithuania enjoy all the privileges and rights which are stipulated by our constitution and our laws and which are also stipulated by international documents on these matters. Lithuania is a member of the Council of Europe and it abides to all the stipulations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [Iliescu] First of all for the women, I should like to express our congratulations and best wishes to all the women present in this hall with the occasion of Women's Day. Secondly, in connection with the problem raised with (?satisfied discussion), as President Brazauskas said, I should underline two aspects of the problem because all our countries, and I think in all Europe, there does not exist any country which should not have national, ethnical minorities on their territory. Also, there is not any country which should not have their core nationals living on the territory of other states. In this connection there are also problems connected with the neighbor problems and historical problems which thus exist between neighbor countries in connection with this coexistence of the co-citizens or of the co-nationals living on the territory of the other country. Of course, the problem of the national minorities and national and ethnical minorities is a question of the internal development of each country and only on the democratic basis, with the creation of the general frame of the individual liberties and the right of every member of the society, only in this frame the problems of the citizens belonging to different national minorities can be solved. And I think that with the democratic development of our country, with the new constitution which has the most important chapter connected to the rights and the liberties of the citizens, we have created the juridicial base to solve any problems for any citizen of the country, including those belonging to national minorities. Of course, there are some general international, European [word indistinct] concerning the civil rights, which are including also the rights for the persons belonging to the national minorities. And we have such a provision in our constitution that any international juridicial provision is (?prevalent) to any of our national juridicial provision concerning the rights and liberties of the citizen. So we are ready always to align ourselves to any international regulations, provisions, agreements on the international level, including European level. But, of course, there is some conditions which is creating normal or un-normal relations between neighboring countries. When some state, or leader of one state, is proclaiming their right to intervene in the regulation of the activities of the representative organizations of some national minorities on the territory of other countries, it is already a source of tension between the states. Or some proclamation (?in the last period) for the so-called territorial, ethnical self-determination, it is also a principle which is not in accordance with the general international and European [word indistinct] of the development of the trust between nations and between states. It's a sort of theory of bantustanization of some such local community. I think not on this basis the rights and the liberties of the national minorities could be provided, but in accordance with legislation which does exist in every country and with a general democratic rule of the relations between the citizens of each country. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President Brazauskas, Mr. President Iliescu: Can you point out, please, the ways in which the two countries are planning to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of the stability, security and peace on our continent? Thank you. [Brazauskas] I would like to say that our active participation in the Partnership for Peace system shows that our countries are looking for strong and guaranteed security systems, such as we see in the activities of NATO, for example. I also hope that other countries will be signing the Partnership for Peace agreement and this will provide a very good security basis for Central and Eastern European countries. I would like to express a hope that Russia, too, signs this agreement, then the question itself of dividing Europe into military or some other kind of bloc will no longer be existing at all. [Iliescu] I think there are two elements for the (?general stability). There is from the one side the internal stability of every country, and we are making all the efforts to stabilize politically and economically our country to become a factor of stability in our geographical zone and on the continent. Secondly, there are the activities of external relations, firstly the good relations with our neighbors, our contribution by bilateral contacts and multilateral contacts to eliminate the sources of conflict and tension which exist in our zone. And Romania has (?this privilege) to live in such a zone with two big sources of tensions and open conflict -- Yugoslavia from one side and the former Soviet Union, with different sources of tension and conflict, from the other side. We are making all efforts, with our modest possibilities, to contribute to this activity, international activity, to eliminate these sources of the conflict. And also our participation in the international body, the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which can (?become) such a general frame for the stabilization and security on the continent. Our participation in the Partnership for Peace and our connection with NATO, with European Council, with European institutions -- all this frame of our external activities are interconnected with the preoccupation to secure more stability and security on the continent. [Moderator] The last question is from Baltic News Service Agency. [Unidentified correspondent] There were two questions, the first one to both of the presidents: can we draw from the meetings that you have had that there is a possibility of a Baltic and Black Sea union? And the second question was to Mr. Brazauskas, about the possibility of a new trend in Lithuanian foreign policy towards the Black Sea countries. [Brazauskas] Of course, Romania is on the Black Sea and Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea and we can and must use to the best advantage our geographical situation in order to promote economic and trade relations. As to the second question, I must say that Lithuania has been using every possibility to establish and to improve relations with all states, first of all with neighboring states and also with states that are further away. With Romania we have many similarities in our domestic life and in our outside activities and the signing of the important documents today expands the sphere of our relations and leads us to better links with countries of the Black Sea basin. [Iliescu] I think that any initiative, [words indistinct] to promote the cooperation between the two states and to promote such zones of stability and security on our continent. From this point of view, the development of initiatives of the Baltic Sea from one side and the Black Sea from the other side are such initiatives which have such an objective -- to promote stability in our region, to promote the cooperation between our states. Of course, I cannot speak about the union of two zones. We should develop firstly such cooperation in our zone, but such interconnections are of course beneficial and our presence here is an expression of our desire to develop such interconnections. More, I could say. We have visited in the morning the Trakai [town near Vilnius, ancient residence of Lithuanian rulers]. On our perception, "Trakai" is coming from the nomination of a great family of people of Asian civilization, the (?Thracians). Our ancestors, that was the Prince of (?Thrace). If the (?Thracians) could develop such a zone of interconnection and coexistence from Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea with the Baltic Sea, why could it not be able for our generation to develop such and interconnection and such a cooperation? I think it is quite realistic to speak about.
