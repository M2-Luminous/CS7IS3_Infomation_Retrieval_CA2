He accused the government of racial discrimination, genocide, and apartheid, adding that the Bulgarian media had been trying to incite acts of violence against the Macedonian population in Pirin Macedonia [part of Bulgaria]. The program of the Ilinden OMO that has been announced demands a status of political, cultural, and economic autonomy for Pirin Macedonia. The program envisages the introduction of the Macedonian language into school curriculums and local administration, an independent Macedonian church, a ban on foreign propaganda regarding assimilation and economic independence, and the withdrawal of the Bulgarian occupation troops. According to Ivanov, the Ilinden OMO, on whose membership composition he declined to comment, is financed independently from membership dues, but that it was considering appealing to the government and the mass media for aid in the future. At the same time, it was stated that the Ilinden OMO, although not legally registered at the court, will sue the media for their insults and offenses against the organization.
