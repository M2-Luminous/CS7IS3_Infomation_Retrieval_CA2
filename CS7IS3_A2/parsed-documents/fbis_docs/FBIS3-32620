I do not want to take up a lot of your time, but I want to summarize the positions I outlined, with the certainty that you will share your president's position on this issue, which has awakened the whole country's interest. Yesterday I learned, calmly but with some surprise, about the communique issued by the State Council, in which the Council members state they are not satisfied with the arguments that I outlined in connection with the legal basis which allows military personnel from other countries to conduct joint exercises with Colombian military forces, in compliance with old practices and based on international agreements. It is deplorable that the sound legal document I respectuflly forwarded to that judicial organization a few days ago resulted in the issuance of a press communique which lacks legal grounds, and about which I had to learn through the media instead of through the proper channels -- as if it were more important to create an atmosphere of public opinion than to stictly carry out a legal procedure. This attitude contrasts with the one I assumed toward the State Council, to which I submitted all explanations in a detailed and reserved manner, aware of the implications that this debate has for our country -- both at national and international levels. I received the news with the tranquility of knowing that this type of operation is necessary, useful, and timely for Colombia. I also felt confident that the juridical arguments, which the State Council rejected, are solid; that the decisions adopted do not violate the Constitution that now includes, through this government's leadership, the great changes that Colombian society demanded for many years for its political organization. I believed, and still believe, it was necessary to strengthen control mechanisms and give congress the tools to fulfill its function of supervising the executive branch's actions. Hence, we will be ready to provide the explanations that Congress, the organization to which the State Council decided to forward this issue, considers pertinent -- with the assurance they will not be disregarded with the stroke of a pen. Instead, they will be carefully and calmly analyzed. Judging from the laconic statement issued by the judicial organization, it seems the State Council has given this constitutional disposition a significance it evidently does not have. The idea is to claim that there is an obligation to request that the Senate or State Council authorize the transit of foreign troops in our country; this means that this authorization must be obtained to allow the arrival of any foreign military personnel in Colombia -- regardless of their purpose. An interpretation like this leads to the absurdity of demanding permission for the arrival of military attaches that dozens of other countries have in Colombia, just as we have attaches in dozens of other countries. Similarly, a joint intelligence operation for capturing a criminal would require a prior Senate meeting and statement. Also, old and existing international agreements, such as the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Agreement and the 1952 Military Assistance Agreement, would cease to exist as if by magic and Colombia would feel free to violate them. The State Council's statement is not judicial in nature. It simply reports a fact to Congress. It is worth mentioning that all documents have been provided by the government. The judicial body has said only that it finds them unconvincing. As a consequence of this decision, the State Council admits it lacks authority to assess the alleged violation of the Constitution and take the proper action, all of which is up to the Congress. The State Council's statement is not legal in nature. It is rather political. The baseness of the Council's assertions and the Council president's argument that a little school can be built by Colombian artisans do not deserve an answer. As long as an authoritative organization does not announce a ruling, we will continue to endorse international cooperation and the joint exercises that the government regards as essential to improve our military forces. In addition, this cooperation and exercises are based on international agreements that the Congress has ratified. These exercises are but part of these agreements. The State Council's opinion also casts doubts on the cooperation, intelligence, and advisors vital in the fight against criminal drug trafficking organizations. For this reason, the radical interpretation contained in the State Council's press communique only benefits drug traffickers and weakens our capability for confronting crime. Colombians: I admit other people's right to disagree with the joint exercises on Colombia's Pacific coast. Nevertheless, I cannot overlook a minor legal interpretation that would force us to cancel other operations indispensable to defending the country from crime and drug trafficking. The government has admitted that there are gaps in reports released to the public. This perhaps has led a number of people to criticize the military cooperation under way with the United States. In the specific instance of Juanchaco, I regard as necessary the emphasis that the foreigners therein are military engineers who, paid by the U.S. Government, are conducting a military engineering exercise in conjunction with the Colombian Armed Forces. It is just a matter of teaching and practicing, sharing technical construction techniques in tropical areas, and solving logistics and communications problems which our men would eventually have to cope with in various situations. But instead, if wasting that energy building things that are useful, they devote it to civic and solidarity objectives. The school, the health center, the road are only byproducts of that joint military engineering training, which will by the way benefit the region and community. U.S. military engineers are in an area totally controlled by the Colombian National Navy and are working under the supervision of military forces. We have conducted diverse joint actions with the U.S. Government to improve and make more efficient the operations of our public forces. We have obtained various technologies, embodied in the radar guided and operated by Colombians, and for which U.S. personnel offer advice and maintenance. We have carried out joint engineering exercises for the construction of different projects. Today in the United States there are close to 100 Colombian soldiers participating in operations similar to those now being questioned in Colombia, and no one even thinks that the presence of those personnel there endangers the sovereignty of that country. In all this debate there are at least two contradictions. The first is to think that the search for better training and greater efficiency of the Colombian public force violates our sovereignty, when in reality it is aimed at guaranteeing our sovereignty. Sovereignty would be in greater danger in a country in the hands of criminals and drug traffickers, in a state without the capacity to respond to criminal activity, or in a state confused by hundreds of clandestine flights of foreign and national aircraft involved in drug trafficking, than in a state that relies on international cooperation to guarantee law and the legitimate exercise of its citizens' rights. We have requested support from the international community in the courageous struggle that we Colombians have waged against the large drug trafficking organizations, and it is surprising that we now say that this jeopardizes our sovereignty. As someone once said, international cooperation is not represented by pats on the back but by training and logistical support, among other things. Sovereignty is not a rhetorical concept defended in speeches in public squares at a campaign rally or by making a small fuss over anti-U.S. chauvinism, opportunistic nationalism, or populism. Our independence in international relations is open to the scrutiny of all. It is measured by the way in which we have acted in different international forums, the way in which our representatives have voted at the UN, the OAS, and other multilateral organizations. It is measured by our active participation in groups such as the Nonaligned Movement or the Group of 77. It is measured by the establishment of relations with Cuba. In sum, it is measured by the real and permanent dynamics that have placed Colombia in a position of leadership in Latin America. Citizens: Sovereignty is defended by facing with courage the enemies of the fatherland, those who affect the security of citizens, those who abuse and violate our territory, our rivers, our sea, our airspace to further their criminal activities. Sovereignty is not an hypothetical concept. It is not a simple dead letter in our laws or the Constitution. We are more sovereign when we are able to exercise more control. We are more sovereign when we strengthen the capacity of the Armed Forces of Colombia to fulfill their duty to defend the security and safety of the country. We are more sovereign when we obtain the support of allies who support us in our struggle against those who do not have a fatherland, who kill our women and children, our decent people. That is defending sovereignty. Those who claim to be nationalistic and cry out loud about the alleged violation of our sovereignty by permitting the presence of technicians and military engineers from other countries are dead wrong. Our enemies are powerful. In order that we might defeat them, it is not enough to rely on our own technology, abilities, and calls for sacrifices. We need solidarity and support. What would have come of Europe if its leaders had not formed an alliance to fight the threat of Hitler? Also, what would have come of Colombia if we had rejected international aid in our struggle against the then-called Medellin Cartel? Would we be more free, more sovereign, more independent, living under the tyranny of Escobar's narcoterrorism? Would we be more free, more sovereign, more independent, allowing our airspace to be violated by criminals from all countries and all ilks? Would we be more independent, more free, more sovereign, allowing drug traffickers to have all the technological advances at their disposal while we seek refuge under our modest technical means and renounce international help? The president does not think so. Therefore, until 7 August, when my mandate ends, I will continue with my efforts to broaden our democracy, modernize our country, suppress poverty and injustice, and untiringly confront those who generate destabilization and fear until they are brought to their knees. I will not hesitate -- out of fear of a debate -- in making or supporting decisions, such as the one being debated, within the framework of the Constitution, which this government knows well, as long as I believe that it serves said purposes which are shared by the majority of Colombians who prefer to open up to the future rather than hold on to the past. Good night, and many thanks.
