It is currently in sixth place with just over 1 percent. It is unlikely to reach the 5 percent of the vote needed to secure an automatic cabinet post. On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked the PAC's chairman in the central Transvaal region, Moses Mavundla, if he was disappointed with their result: [Begin recording] [Mavundla] Yes, we are obviously shocked at the results. We did not expect them to be as they are. That's why we have had reservations about the entire process when it's being done without the direct involvement of the international community. [Ecott] But what do you feel specifically has been wrong with these elections from your point of view? [Mavundla] Well, to start with the leveling of the playing field. That was the major aspect. The monies were released rather too late and by the time we received the monies we were already disadvantaged, whereas if the monies had been released much earlier I am sure our campaign machinery would have been much more effective. [Ecott] Your critics, of course, will say that the poor turn out in the polls just proves that the PAC was always a very marginal political force in South Africa. [Mavundla] The question is if the regime had that belief that we were marginal, when we called them to meet PAC outside the country in Zimbabwe and in Botswana, why did they to start with bother to meet us? If they believed that we were that marginal, surely they would not have bothered to waste time with PAC. But we believe that we are not marginal. We represent a broad spectrum of the people in the country. [Ecott] But at the moment you are showing less support than people like the Democratic Party and even the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] [name as heard]. [Mavundla] Well, you have got to understand that people had to exercise their choice. Our supporters may have decided that the important thing is to oust the regime and by supporting, throwing some of their votes toward one of the liberation movements, particularly a single liberation as it has won now -- ANC -- they may have believed that by so doing they would enhance the oppressed masses in ousting the regime. The important thing is that PAC is not out. PAC is still in and we still believe that we still have a contribution to make toward the final liberation of our people, in particular with regard to the return of the land to the rightful owners. [Ecott] Mr. Mandela has already indicated that parties which have not done particularly well in the polls will probably still get a chance of serve in the cabinet. Are you still prepared to work with him? [Mavundla] As soon as Mr. Mandela has met with our president and that issue with regard to the concomitant terms or conditions, those that would be discussed by PAC and a decision will be taken whether or not to accept that.
