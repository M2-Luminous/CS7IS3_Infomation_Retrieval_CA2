He cites the conclusion of the prime minister's television appearance, in which Cavaco Silva stressed, in "words lacking sincerity," that he respects Soares, "who has served the country well in spite of some disagreements"...and has every right to end his term in dignity and respected by all. It is obvious from the prime minister's words that the tactics of his relationship with the president have changed, becoming "more sophisticated, more cynical, but politically more effective," Saraiva writes. Until recently, Cavaco Silva was suggesting that the president was not helping the government in its task or that he intervened in its action. By so doing, the prime minister was placing himself in an inferior position, for he acknowledged that Soares possesses the means to either facilitate or complicate the government's task and that indeed the government depends on Soares. Grasping the implications of Cavaco Silva's tactics, the president took full advantage of them, Saraiva continues, "subtly threatening to dissolve the Parliament for many months." However, the situation changed after the municipal elections, when the PSD "cleverly" presented the results as a "half-victory" for itself, defeating the specter of parliamentary dissolution. Cavaco Silva's television appearance put the final touch on the new situation, for it promoted the idea that the president's future depends on the prime minister's good will, Saraiva concludes.
