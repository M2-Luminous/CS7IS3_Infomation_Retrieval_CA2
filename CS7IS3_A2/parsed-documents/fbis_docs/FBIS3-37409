LDPR Leaders Claim the Renegades Have Discredited Themselves"] [Text] The languishing scandal that began as early as two days ago has finally burst from within the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction into the open. Despite contradictory statements of various liberal democrats, we managed to find out the essence: Two deputies -- Viktor Kobelev (No. 2 on the party's electoral list) and Aleksandr Pronin -- have left the LDPR faction. Kobelev himself says it was his voluntary decision. His opponent, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, claims that "we have expelled them for actions that discredit the title of deputy." According to Mr. Kobelev, his walkout, which was prompted by personal relations, is a harbinger of a serious split. In fact, another energetic LDPR deputy, Mr. Marychev, said that he supported Viktor Kobelev's actions. "We have the entire St. Petersburg LDPR organization on our side and many other deputies," Mr. Marychev insisted. In the rebels' view, however, they will be able to stay on in the party and even to counterpoise it to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. "I have headed the LDPR staff; I know the party from "A" to "Z," and I am a modest man in that regard," Mr. Kobelev said. In his opinion, the mutiny will be supported by a majority of Liberal Democrats, including by the deputies who "came to the Duma to work, not to boost their social status." As for the deputies, this threat does not appear to be ringing hollow. In fact there are a number of deputy groups within the LDPR that are made up of deputies who came to the State Duma in the hope of making their own political career. Naturally, they have been riled by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's contemptuous attitude to parliamentary activity and his bent for presidential elections. Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself does not make any bones about the fact that deputies are only his transient companions and that few of them will be trusted with accompanying him "along the path leading up to power." A group of deputies close to the communists under Mr. Kobelev was the first to have run out of patience. Viktor Kobelev hopes that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "take steps to meet them halfway," disavow his "personal statements and return to the LDPR rules and program." For dwarfish parties that are held together by one leader, splits are a common phenomenon. The LDPR is effectively also a dwarfish party, the only complication being the 59 deputy seats it holds. If Vladimir Zhirinovskiy manages to find legal grounds for replacing his ambitious colleagues in parliament with trustworthy and devoted people, the "cleanliness of party ranks" will be guaranteed. In principle, an electoral association, such as the LDPR, may recall its defiant deputies. The snag is, however, that the numbers of those disgruntled by Mr. Zhirinovskiy's escapades may grow at the expense of other internal "cliques." Then the LDPR leader will lose his faction's support. Which will not come as a surprise given the peculiarities of Russian electoral legislation, which puts on the verge of a split all parties hastily set up according to God knows what principles.
