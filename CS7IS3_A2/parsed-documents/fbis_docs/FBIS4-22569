Zina stands out in the bitter cold inspecting the vanload of furniture. Since 1985 Mrs. Antonina Kuznetsova and her husband, an officer, have lived on the Adazi Russian military base near Riga. She has worked here as a typist at a military office, but now she and her family must leave. Mrs. Kuznetsova looks sorrowful. She does not know what awaits her in Rostov, where her family is moving. Mrs. Kuznetsov's family is one of almost 3,000 officers' families that must eventually leave Latvia. But, for now, negotiations over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia have broken down. At present, however, individual families are moving. People still seem to be living in most apartment buildings on the Adazi base. Curtains hang in the windows, rugs and mattresses hang on frames for dusting, out in yards where children play in the snow. A gray striped cat slinks out into the cold and a half-completed apartment building stands empty up on the hill. Empty Barracks Area The barracks area itself is also empty, except for the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Anatoliy Kvartsov, and just under 100 officers and soldiers (of a force of 2,500 men) who still live in the housing area. But the barracks have been emptied of their soldiers. The cots stand in neat rows. Even the bed of the "unknown soldier" up on a platform has been made. As recently as December 1992 the base was teeming with life, the tramping of boots, and the sound of target practice. Then people started moving away. Adazi base, 18 kilometers north or Riga, was used as a training site for sergeants who, after a half year of training, went on to various posts in the Baltics. Lt. Col. Kvartsov believes that eventually he, too, will leave, but he does not yet know when. He received his military training at a military academy in the northern Caucasus. He will soon be homeless when he moves to Russia and his wife, who worked as a bookkeeper on the base, will be unemployed. The commander does not know what will happen to all the housing in the area. "Everything here is owned by the Russian Army, but the local authorities will probably take over the buildings." There are still a total of 10,000 active-duty soldiers in Latvia (of 120,000 during the Soviet period). If we add to this number an additional 200,000 (the figures vary depending on the source; the Army's press officer indicates 60,000) pensioned officers, disabled veterans of the Great Patriotic War, and those who spent time in concentration camps, we are talking about a significant military potential. Here they have the same problems as in Estonia. The various categories of pensioner's housing rights are in jeopardy, pensions paid from the Russian Defense Ministry's fund are nonexistent, social rights are limited (free health care has been abolished) and Russia is demanding that Latvia pay considerable sums to support the Russian military. Moreover, war veterans are paid their pensions in accordance with Latvian law, and the amount is not great--only 21 lati (approximately 210 markkas). And since the rent alone amounts to 20 lati, there is not much left over for food. The idea is for Latvia to contribute a housing subsidy of 50 percent. In addition, the press officer said that Russia could not pay war veterans of foreign powers. This is in conflict with the Latvian position, so the stage is set for conflict in this area. It is not surprising that a large portion of retired military personnel voted for Zhirinovskiy. Beggars in Riga Over half the Russian population of Latvia, which is half the population of the country (2.7 million inhabitants) also voted for Zhirinovskiy. Moreover, since the law on citizenship, in which conditions are far stricter than in Estonia, has not yet been approved, a large portion of the Latvian population is, in a sense, outside society. One-fourth of the Russian population has become Latvian citizens, however, as they have been living in the country since the 1940's. However, the lack of citizenship for the majority has led to increasing frustration, which can even be seen on the streets of Riga. Despite elegant new boutiques, despite stylish restaurants, the mood is dismal and gloomy. Armed civil guards are seen here and there. The banks are guarded. There are beggars and homeless people outside the railway station in Riga, where angry old Russian women stand and sell cigarettes. These old women, former factory workers and now poor pensioners, are angry at both the Kremlin and the leaders in Riga. "I worked and slaved for 40 years in a factory and this is the thanks I get," said Olga. "I get a pension of 25 lati and my rent is 18 lati. What am I supposed to live on? There are nothing but bandits in the government. They should be thrown out like the Russian pigs. The leaders live well, but no one thinks about us ordinary people. My daughter, who is a student, is unemployed, so I am just forced to stand here and sell things. The profits are nothing to write home about, about one lati (10 markkas) a day. Then the police show up and take our cigarettes." Another old woman said she supported her son by selling cigarettes. Her pension is also small. And it is difficult to sell the cigarettes. She believes that Moscow is solely responsible for her predicament. It is a shame that the Soviet Union broke up, according to the old woman, who previously made a living in fishing. Eight-year-old Jani sits by the stairs leading down to the subway. He is shaking with cold. He holds a piece of paper that says in Russian that his mother is his sole provider. She is unemployed and has four children. The family has nothing to eat. "Help Us" Zhirinovskiy supporters in Riga complain about worsening conditions in schools, a shortage of Russian books and Russian libraries, and an unwillingness on the part of Latvian authorities to provide courses in Latvian for those who want to apply for citizenship. They point out that the economic situation is strained for everyone in Latvia, but that it is extremely difficult for unemployed Russians to find work. They also point out that the lack of citizenship for the Russian populace and for other minorities makes it difficult to demonstrate that their human rights are being violated in this country. Many Russians would be willing to leave the country if only they had somewhere to go. They also point out that half the industry in Latvia has been shut down. Factories with Russian workers are generally closed. Zhirinovskiy supporters are also highly critical of Yeltsin, who has ignored the exiled Russians in Latvia. The level of education among Russians in Latvia is falling, since higher education is offered only in Latvian. These Zhirinovskiy supporters also believe that the Baltic nations will join the CIS countries, even if they support an independent Latvia. It is a fact that the standard of living has dropped, that unemployment has risen, and that dissatisfaction has spread. And the Latvians are becoming more and more concerned over a fifth column and a Russian attack of some kind, while the country's leadership is feverishly working for more economy and other contacts with the West. Concern Over Greater Russian Influence in the Baltics Guntis Ulmanis, the Latvian president, indicates that the demobilization of Russian troops has become a serious problem. "Since Russia does not seem to be willing to withdraw its troops from the Baltic, the Russian leaders clearly intend to maintain their influence here. Since it is also impossible to predict what will happen in Russian politics, the situation is troubling." The Russians who were involved in the coup attempt and were recently released in Moscow have the potential to develop a strong leadership, according to Ulmanis. The question is what they will decide to do. Nevertheless, Ulmanis looks to the future of Latvia with confidence. "Life has become better and quieter here. There is plenty of food and other necessities. Privatization is under way and industry is being activated. And we are continually developing our security structure." At the same time, Ulmanis is hoping for more moral support from Finland which, because of its experience with a complicated past, can understand Latvia's vulnerable situation. More business ties are also desired. Ulmanis does not see unemployment as a serious problem in Latvia. It is relatively low at present, he said. However, he wants to shut down the large factories previously run by Moscow. The citizenship law should be enacted later this spring, which should ease the situation for the Russian-speaking population. [14 Mar p 4] [Text] In Lithuania, 4 March is St. Kasimir's Day. St. Kasimir is the patron saint of Catholic Lithuania. In Vilnius, his day is celebrated with song and dance, a warming glass of punch in the snow slush, and brisk sales at the markets on the narrow streets of the old town. The most popular Kasimir item is made of dried grass with various types of flowers dipped in coloring and tied into a long, narrow, and brightly colored bouquet. The people look happy and open and the mood is relaxed. The cozy cafes are filled with parents and numerous small children who happily drink their juice. And people gather in the many old churches to hear organ music and choirs. More Contact With the West On the surface, at least, things seem to be going well in Lithuania, although the standard of living has dropped here as it has in the other Baltic states. This, by the way, is a trend in most of the postcommunist nations. But there are few unemployed, only one percent, even though some large plants do not operate every day, according to Justaf Paletskis, President Brazauskas' foreign policy advisor. And, of course, this leads to social and psychological problem for those who are affected by unemployment. Nor is the crime rate as high as it is in the other two Baltic states, Paletskis points out. Thus, under the leadership of former communist leader and current President Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania is stabilizing both economically and politically, it is establishing good relations with neighboring Poland, Russia, and Belorussia and, most important, it is increasing cooperation with the other Baltic nations and with the Nordic countries. A NATO membership is also on its wish list. The last Russian troops left Lithuania in August 1993. Since the democratic law on citizenship was approved, all minorities were able to seek citizenship immediately, which 85 percent of them did. As a result, minority conflicts in Lithuania (just over 9 percent Russians, 10 percent Poles, and various other minority groups out of a population of 3.7 million) are minimal compared with Estonia and Latvia. The majority of the Russian-speaking population are loyal Lithuanian citizens, Paletskis pointed out. New Rich Doing Well One person who is happy with her life in Lithuania is 31-year-old Daiva who is trained as a hairdresser. She was out on the town, shopping with her four-year-old son Martin. She is one of the country's new rich. She lives in her parents' private home and has a small vegetable garden. To be sure, she is unemployed at present, but she can afford to be a homemaker and take care of her child because her husband earns well. He purchases goods in Sweden and sells them at home in Lithuania. "Everything is fine. There are plenty of goods in the shops. Our standard of living has gone up despite everything, although rent is high and goods are expensive," Daiva said. Industrious Daiva also does some extra work at times. Her husband buys meat and other small items and Daiva sells them at the market place. There are no conflicts between Russians and Lithuanians according to Daiva, who has several Russian friends. Subversive Activities Despite everything, Zhirinovskiy supporters and other Russian groups are not particularly happy with their lives in Lithuania. But these dissidents, about 3,000 people, form a tiny minority. Among them is Valentin Mesheryakov, a member of the Russian Communist Party. He has lived in Lithuania since 1953, is married to a Lithuanian woman, speaks the country's language, supported Lithuanian independence, but has not received Lithuanian citizenship. Why? "I would have received citizenship if I had signed a paper that demands loyalty to the Lithuanian state. Since I have always considered myself a democratic person, I thought this requirement was undemocratic. There is a strange political game going on. The other day I was summoned by the public prosecutor and accused of subversive activity. That was because I am chairman of Rossiya. This organization of Russian citizens exists in all the Baltic states, along with other associations that safeguard the interests of the Slavic people. It is these organizations, with their ties to Moscow, that are building a fifth column in Lithuania. Mesheryakov continued: "My home and the homes of my friends have been ransacked, too. We try to obey the laws of Lithuania, but we do not let Lithuanians into our territory. It is the job of Russia's prosecutor to handle may case, not that of the Lithuanian prosecutor. I demand freedom for Rossiya to operate here in Lithuania. According to Lithuanian law, only Lithuanian citizens have the right to establish organizations. But I will cite paragraph 23, according to which foreigners have the same rights as Lithuanian citizens." "Our organization is apolitical, although I personally am a communist. But anyone from fascists to communists can join Rossiya. Russia is my country, and it is there I am asking for help." Several of Mesheryakov's communist friends are in jail, accused of weapons possession and active opposition to Sajudis, the Lithuanian popular front that paved the way for Lithuanian independence. Translator Tatyana Bogoshilskaya, born in Vilnius, was also interrogated after the coup leaders in Moscow were released, since she is in charge of a Russian cultural organization that is also considered to be disloyal toward Lithuania. Where Is Brotherhood? At a meeting in the Teachers' Building, where members of some 20 Russian organizations in Vilnius met, an elderly woman broke into tears. She had been without work for a long time and did not have Lithuanian citizenship. Her husband had left her and gone to Ukraine. "We are hungry. What kind of freedom is this? Where is the brotherhood and equality? The rich ones leave and we have to stay here. Whey doesn't Russia find my husband? Here most Russians are unemployed and accused of being "red-brown." The criminal government in Moscow owes us a lot." A younger woman who had worked for the Soviet Army has no citizenship at all and not even a valid passport. Now it seems she will have to wait 10 years to become a Lithuanian citizen. Another woman, who worked for the KGB in Vilnius, also complained because she had not received Lithuanian citizenship, but she is prepared to leave for Moscow at any time. Nina Ivanova also cried bitterly. Her son, Valeriy Ivanov has been in prison in Vilnius for the past two years. He stands accused of helping start the blood bath in Vilnius in January 1991 in which 14 innocent people were killed. Every day she visits her son in prison, where he awaits his trial. She is also concerned for her grandson who was left on his own in Moscow where his mother died. "My son is innocent. He will be acquitted. It was Antonas Terliatskas of Free Lithuania who started the violence here in Vilnius. Who will take care of my grandson? I have worked here for 45 years. Now I am old. Who will bury me when my time comes? I am all alone. A Victim of the Empire Has His Chance To Help Jack of all trades Vytautas Cinauskas, geologist, historian, poet, was among the Baltic people who were oppressed by Soviet power. He was deported for 15 years. Even as a young man in 1941 he was sent with his mother and his 11-year-old brother to a prison camp far away in deepest Siberia on the River Lena, the coldest part of Russia, and he was not allowed to return until 1956. Toward the end, he was ordered to work on a geological research project. His mother died of hunger almost immediately in the prison camp. The years passed and Cinauskas mannaged to flee, but was soon caught again in 1948. After his release, it took more years before Cinauskas was rehabilitated and allowed to begin studying and get a job. In the prison camp, Cinauskas met Finns and Karelians from the Russian side. He was also sent down into the mines, where he had to work for eight years. "Only a sense of humor could get you through prison camp and forced labor. It was also difficult to live here in Vilnius after I returned home. People did not want to accept me. I could not find work, since I had no official place of domicile." Now Cinauskas has full-time employment as the head of a foundation for deportees who want to return home. There are still thousands of Lithuanians who were deported by the former Soviet empire during the forties. They and their children need help to return to their homeland. The foundation was established in 1992 and it has received donations from exiled Lithuanians as far away as Brazil. The telephone rings in one of Cinauskas' offices at the headquarters of the Cultural Foundation in downtown Vilnius. One wall is covered with pictures of partisans and other deportees. A map shows the areas to which Lithuanians were forcibly moved. Cinauskas is also gathering material for a book on genocide in Lithuania, including the deportation of Lithuanians and life in the prison camps. As early as 1940, during the Sovietization of Lithuania, 21,000 Lithuanians who were undesirable to the regime were deported to Siberia. The next wave of deportations came after the war, when several hundred thousand Balts were forcibly moved.
