In this sense, from any change in the definitions of religious words one may be able to detect a corresponding change in North Korea's religious policy. In fact, Chosonmal Taesajon [The Korean Language Dictionary] published in April 1992 shows a striking difference from its older 1981 version published 10 years earlier, particularly in handling the religious vocabulary. The new version is a very comprehensive dictionary which took North Korea 7 years to compile and it has 330,000 entries in total. North Korea claims that the new Chosonmal Taesajon, compiled by the Linguistics Research Institute under the North Korean Academy of Social Sciences and published by Sahoegwahak Chulpansa [Social Science Publishing House], covers an extensive vocabulary used for nearly 100 years since the 19th century, which has been researched comprehensively while using the original version published after liberation as a basis. North Korea has been stressing that the publication of the new dictionary marks a turning point as it spurs the chuche-based development of the Korean language; improvements in the people's speech; the education of party members and workers in the Korean- people-come-first principle; and an epochal development of science, education, and culture. Accordingly, the fact that the definitions of religious expressions in the new language dictionary, which is of such great importance, show a marked departure from the old definitions is amazing in itself and indicates that North Korea's religious policy is undergoing a realistic change. First, the most characteristic of all is that the previous negative or critical view of religion appearing in Hyondae Chosonmal Sajon [Modern Korean Language Dictionary] (published in 1981) and Cholhak Sajon [A Dictionary of Philosophy] (published in 1985) is eliminated by and large in the new Korean dictionary, which describes the development process of religion and religious thoughts in a more comprehensive and factual way. North Korea's religious policy stems from the point of view of regarding religion as a form of superstition and a kind of opium that numbs the revolutionary spirit of the people. This attitude was fully reflected in the older Korean dictionary published in the 1980's. On the contrary, the newly published Chosonmal Taesajon does not equate religion with superstition but distinguishes between them. It distinguishes between religion and superstition by trying to describe religious phenomena in an objective manner while maintaining the old negative attitude toward superstition. This drastic change deserves attention, for it indicates that North Korea's view of religion has widened and become more objective since the late 1980's. Discriminating Between Religion, Superstition In Hyondae Chosonmal Sajon published in 1981 defines religion as "a reactionary outlook on the world or the belief that preaches how to dream of a happy life in the other world." On the contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon defines religion as "the outlook on the world based on a doctrine that preaches an absolute faith or belief in the super natural and superhuman being." In addition, the new dictionary strikes out the traditional critical descriptions invariably found in the older versions, such as: "a tool of oppression and exploitation"; "the imperialists' ideological tool for invading backward countries"; "the opium used in dulling the revolutionary awareness of the masses and inspiring in them the principle of nonresistance so that they may unconditionally subject themselves to exploitation and oppression." Instead the new dictionary explains religion in more concrete terms, using expressions such as: "believing the holy being such as God or the Lord"; and "there are numerous religions and religious sects, large and small, beginning with the primitive religions and including Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam." This change in the attitude of North Korea was reflected in the booklet titled "Ruminating About the History of the Great Love" published in 1989. The piece, authored by Ho Chong-suk, chairwoman of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, contains an article titled "Let Us Treasure the Patriotism of a Female Teacher." In this article Ho Chong-suk tells an anecdote about An Sin-ho, An Chang-ho's younger sister, who was so moved by Kim Il-song's warmheartedness that she came to devote herself to the task of nation building and worked hard for Kim Il-song. The article quotes Kim Il- song as saying: "Without regard to what religion she believes in, we should first try to see the depth of her patriotism and the intensity of her efforts for nation building. We should not take a jaundiced view of, or discriminate against her by keeping her at an arm's length simply because she is a religious woman." "Negative Explanations" of Doctrines Omitted Chosonmal Taesajon also makes a lot of changes in its explanations of religious doctrines as is the case with religious phenomena. The older version explains theology as an unscientific branch of learning that tries to rationalize religious doctrines on the basis of an idealist outlook on the world. But the new version simply explains that theology is "a branch of learning for studying the religious doctrines on God," and in the definition of theological terminology, it omits the old negative and biased explanations. For instance, in the entry under "religious education" the older version defines it as "a reactionary and unscientific education designed to inspire religious doctrines in the heart of the people," but the new version corrects that definition by simply saying that it is "an education for teaching religious doctrines and precepts." On Buddhism the older version of the Korean language dictionary presents a negative view that Buddhism preaches a reactionary thought of slavish submission and the principle of nonresistance. It criticizes Buddhism for trying to dull the class consciousness and fighting spirit of the masses and having a dire deleterious effect on the development of culture and science. But the newly published Chosonmal Taesajon omits all such negative explanations and criticisms and describes Buddhism as one of the three major religions widespread in the East while giving a detailed explanation of the origin, development, and central thought of Buddhism. Christianity has been seen in the most unfavorable light in North Korean philosophy and history textbooks in the past. In the older dictionaries it is pointed out that Christianity was being used as a tool of imperialist aggression and was perusing the U.S. policy of aggression in South Korea. But in Chosonmal Taesajon such criticisms are omitted and instead it presents a richer substance and more factual explanations about Christianity than Korean dictionaries in South Korea. Abundant Religious Vocabulary On Confucianism North Korea used to take a critical view of it by lumping the feudal Confucian thinking and Confucianism together as a thought or doctrine that was used as a tool for maintaining the conservative and reactionary feudal ruling structures, without distinguishing between the two. On the contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon, omitting all negative expressions regarding Confucianism, presents a conceptual definition of Confucianism in these words: "Confucianism is a political and ethical doctrine that has been maintained in China for many many years." It also presents a detailed account of the development process of Confucianism. The dictionary simply says that Confucianism has had an immense influence upon our country in various aspects of our social life since it was brought in, without passing any judgment on this influence. Chosonmal Taesajon has an additional vocabulary of 200,000 words in excess of the 130,000 words entered in Hyondae Chosonmal Sajon. Its religious vocabulary is correspondingly larger and richer. [passage omitted] Religion Used as Window for Opening Chosonmal Taesajon has new entries for the Tenriism of Japan, the Hinduism and Brahmanism of India, and the Taoism of China, and presents factual descriptions of them. It also describes Allah, the Korean, and Islam accurately and in detail in a factual way. All this is clear proof that unlike its older version, Chosonmal Taesajon tries to explain all religions, religious doctrines, and scriptures without omitting any and that its compilers tried hard to faithfully present an objective description of religious phenomena by doing away with the previous negative attitude toward religion itself. [passage omitted] On the occasion of publishing Chosonmal Taesajon, North Korea showed an epoch-making change by presenting a more positive definition of the religious vocabulary and at the same time amended its constitution clearly stipulating that it is permissible to hold religious rituals and set up facilities of worship. These changes happened in April 1992. However, since then no signs have been found yet which show that North Korea's religious policy has undergone a corresponding revision to back up these changes. The reason is that in North Korea religion is not reviving in the form of reinstatement of the self-generating religious substructures, but still remains at the level of being used by North Korea as a window through which it may try to give glimpses of its attempt at opening its economy to the outside world after the Chinese model. Moreover, beginning in the 1980's North Korea tried at a policy level to train the priesthood that would revive the desiccated religions. Even if religion is to revive in North Korea, this process will hardly elevate religion beyond the limit of being a state religion that depends on the priesthood trained under a state policy. That is why North Korea may well be concentrating more on sprucing up its religious appearances by retouching the religious vocabulary and enacting laws and regulations related to religion with a view to shutting off outside influence as much as possible and thereby demonstrating its independent capabilities.
