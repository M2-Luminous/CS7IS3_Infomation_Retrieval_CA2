FR940224-0-00002 FR940224-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Office of the Secretary 7 CFR Parts 1 and 2 Forest Service 36 CFR Part 223 Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 AGENCY: Office of the Secretary; Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends 7 CFR parts 1 and 2 and 36 CFR part 223 by adding a new subpart M to 7 CFR part 1 establishing rules of practice governing the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990; by deleting, in 7 CFR part 2, the reference to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act and adding, in its place, a reference to the rules of practice established by this rule; and by making technical amendments to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice established by this rule. The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Act) prohibits the export of unprocessed Federal timber west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous states and the substitution of such unprocessed Federal timber for unprocessed private timber from the west that is exported. The Act allows a person with an approved sourcing area to export unprocessed private timber originating from outside of the sourcing area while purchasing Federal timber within the sourcing area. The Act states that the Secretary shall approve or disapprove sourcing areas on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, formal adjudication is required under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Act also requires that reviews of sourcing areas be conducted at least every 5 years in accordance with the procedures of the Act. Pursuant to section 556 of the Administrative Procedure Act, adjudications of sourcing area applications and formal reviews of sourcing areas will be subject to the rules of practice adopted by this rulemaking. Informal reviews of sourcing areas will be conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 223.191(e). EFFECTIVE DATE: February 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth Becker, Natural Resources Division, Office of the General Counsel, United States Department of Agriculture, room 4622 South Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1400. Telephone: (202) 720&hyph;9076. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act (Act), enacted August 20, 1990, prohibits both the export of unprocessed Federal logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 states and the substitution of such unprocessed Federal logs for unprocessed private logs originating west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 states that are exported. The Act exempts persons with approved ``sourcing areas'' from the prohibition against substitution in certain circumstances. A sourcing area is the area from which an owner/manufacturer of logs obtains logs for his or her mill. To be approved, a sourcing area must be geographically and economically separate from any geographic area where the person harvests private timber for export. A person with an approved ``sourcing area'' may export unprocessed private logs whose origin is outside of the sourcing area, while continuing to purchase Federal logs within the sourcing area. Private logs originating from within the sourcing area may not be exported. Section 490(c) of the Act states that the Secretary is to approve or disapprove the application, ``on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing'' 4 months after submission of a sourcing area application. Section 554 of Title 5, United States Code requires a formal adjudicatory process when a statute requires a determination to be made ``on the record and after opportunity for an agency hearing.'' This rule amends 7 CFR part 1 by adding rules of practice governing sourcing area applications, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556. Specific rules governing sourcing area adjudications are necessary because of the short time in which the statute requires decisions to be made (4 months), and the unique procedural posture of sourcing area applications; i.e., sourcing area applications are submitted by a party other than the agency, expect in certain cases, pursuant to a review of a sourcing area. This rule also amends 7 CFR 2.35 by deleting the words ``in sourcing area adjudications under the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et seq .)'', and adding, in their place, the words ``in adjudication proceedings subject to the `Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et seq .)' set forth in 7 CFR part 1, subpart M;''.
