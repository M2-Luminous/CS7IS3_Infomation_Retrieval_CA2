What was the content of the statement? ['Asfur] The statement refers to the nature of the atmosphere prevailing at the negotiations. The atmosphere was constructive, positive, and practical. The negotiations were fruitful, and we achieved progress on three issues; namely, civilian issues, security issues, and confidence building measures. In fact, we have achieved progress, and both sides are satisfied with it and hope it will open the way for major progress next week. [Mu'addi] Mr. Hasan, what are the outstanding issues of disagreement? ['Asfur] There are several issues over which we have not yet reached any agreement, including some security and civilian issues and confidence-building measures. We hope that next week's negotiations will achieve more progress on these issues. [Mu'addi] What about the Palestinian police? Have you reached any agreement on it? ['Asfur] No, we have not yet reached any agreement. The size of this police force and the type of weapons it will use are still under discussion. [Mu'addi] What about efforts to release Palestinian prisoners? ['Asfur] There is serious and continuing discussion of this issue, and I believe that matters are moving in the right direction. [Mu'addi] Have there been contacts since the press statement about holding a summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next week? ['Asfur] Negotiations will resume in Cairo next week on Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we hope a meeting will take place between President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin when both deem it necessary. [Mu'addi] Do you believe that all issues will be discussed next week? ['Asfur] It is difficult to fix such a date, but we believe that matters are moving in the right direction. We hope we will reach an agreement within a short time, before the blessed 'Id al-Fitr, that will please our people and both sides.
