The document was signed at the Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] headquarters, and President Alfredo Cristiani was the "honorary witness." The declaration says: "Convinced of the historical importance" of Sunday's elections, "we ratify our firm determination to cooperate and guarantee that these elections are held in an atmosphere of tranquillity, safety, and complete freedom." The political leaders, who included members of the most conservative right-wing group of the old FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] guerrilla groups, pledged to urge their party members and sympathizers to abstain from all acts of intimidation, coercion, pressure, or fraud, and from provoking the contenders. In addition, they pledged to punctually open the polling places, scheduled for 0700 (1300 GMT), and guarantee that functions at the polling places be carried out only by duly accredited members of the Voting Table Boards. The Salvadoran party leaders pledged to abide by the legal provisions for the elections, to guarantee that the polling places will close at 1700 (2300 GMT), and to maintain "order" during the vote-counting process. Likewise, they asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to enforce the Electoral Code provision concerning the ban on military in active service and the police, as well as pastors and religious leaders, engaging in partisan publicity. "Our large-scale and peaceful participation in the elections will be the best example of the Salvadoran people's civic mindedness and their determination to build the democratic, modern, just, and participatory nation we all hope for," the document states. Between 2.3 million and 2.4 million Salvadorans will elect the president and vice president of the Republic, 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 20 Central American Parliament deputies, and 262 mayors throughout the country. The declaration was signed by Armando Calderon Sol, of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena); Shafik Handal, of the FMLN; Victor Valle, of the National Revolutionary Movement; and Ciro Cruz Zepeda, of the National Conciliation Party (PCN). The document was also signed by Aronette Diaz, of Democratic Convergence; Guillermo Guevara, of the Authentic Christian Party (MAC); Edgardo Rodriguez, of the National Solidarity Movement (MSN); Jorge Martinez, of the Unity Movement (MU); and Antonio Morales, of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). Armando Calderon Sol, Edgardo Rodriguez, and Jorge Martinez are also candidates for the Presidency of the Republic.
