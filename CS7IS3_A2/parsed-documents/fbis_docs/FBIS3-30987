[Granic] We will discuss three groups of questions. First, the functioning of the Bureau of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade, that is to say, of the FRY Bureau in Zagreb, and all the details connected to it. According to the information from both sides so far, they will be opened on time. The other group of questions will comprise of humanitarian issues. The search for missing persons, the problem of refugees, and such like. I believe that the interest here is almost identical, completely identical on several of these issues, and that both sides must invest all efforts to [words indistinct] be resolved as soon as possible. We will also discuss these questions at the meeting of the two delegations. At the same time, as you know, we have formed a joint commission in the presence of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and the International Red Cross Committee. The third group of questions are political, interstate issues. Some important technical questions regarding the opening of communications will definitely be included in these political issues, but also fundamental questions of the normalization of Serbian-Croatian relations. [Kosaric] Dr. Zvonimir Markovic, chief of the future Croatian Bureau in Belgrade, recently spoke of five phases of the implementation of the Geneva declaration. How do you see the declaration within the context of Belgrade-Zagreb relations? [Granic] It is perfectly obvious that not everything can be resolved with one or two meetings. The problems are too profound, and precisely for this reason it pays to be highly rational and serious in our approach to the resolution of problems. I believe that the opinion to resolve problems in phases is absolutely correct. For this reason, we have initiated the idea about certain degrees of priority and possibilities for resolution today. However, we will definitely raise all the essential political questions tomorrow. [Kosaric] The Serbian side has insisted on direct Zagreb-Knin talks regarding the problem of the territories controlled by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] from the very beginning. What is your view, that is, the view of the Republic of Croatia, toward this issue within the framework of the general normalization of relations? [Granic] Well, Croatia accepts direct negotiations. We are compelled to this by UN Security Council Resolution 871. However, it is equally perfectly obvious that we must first accomplish a total cease-fire, the end of all hostilities, then restore communications, and afterward directly resolve all political issues. I would like to reiterate that it is beyond any doubt that the stance that FRY will assume toward these regions will be very important. This is the key issue. The UN Security Council resolution also speaks of this. What is more important, the progress in our talks is possible only if we define these matters well, too. [Kosaric] Tell me, what essential issues for Croatia should be examined as soon as possible? [Granic] Regarding Croatia, as I have emphasized, it is important, first of all, that Belgrade's influence on the UN Protected Areas [UNPAs] be constructive. We understand that the resolution of the entire issue of UNPA zones is a process. I believe that we have reached a consensus on an all-encompassing cease-fire and the establishment of communications. However, afterward, Croatia will propose a concrete plan. What we expect from Belgrade is to find the final political solution for the UNPA zones as a part of the Republic of Croatia, according to all UN Security Council resolutions passed so far and, naturally, with all international guarantees. However, Belgrade's stance at any moment is the most important. If Belgrade's stance regarding this is clear, then it is perfectly clear that Belgrade can expect similarly important political moves from us. We are ready for them. [Kosaric] Will this year be crucial for overall Serbian-Croatian relations, in your view? [Granic] I believe that this year will be very significant. We have stated very openly that for us it is imperative to resolve the fundamental question -- an end to clashes with the Muslims and the permanent regulation of relations. However, [word indistinct] of the relations in this part of Europe are the Serbian-Croatian relations. For the stability of the entire region, Serbian-Croatian relations are of the greatest importance. The permanent normalization of the Croatian-Serbian relations is practically a precondition for peace and stability in this part of Europe. This was also included in the CSCE documents and we firmly stand on this position. Naturally, we would like to see the permanent normalization of relations and, of course, permanent stability, and both counties will profit greatly in the long run. [Kosaric] The restoration of telephone and transport communications is scheduled for the first phase. For the time being, neither the first nor the latter has been accomplished. When will the telephone communications be restored and is there another condition for their restoration? [Granic] We will discuss this concretely tomorrow. I have previously told you what are the fundamental problems for the Republic of Croatia. If we resolve some basic political issues, then the restoration of telecommunications and, naturally, all other communications will develop very quickly, in which Croatia has a great interest. We do not expect everything to be resolved instantaneously. We do not expect this. However, we will raise all these issues tomorrow and we expect that they will be resolved in progress and to the mutual interest of both countries. [Kosaric] Finally, on 15 March, you are supposed to travel to Belgrade to continue the talks. Does your departure depend on the success of the Zagreb round? [Granic] I believe that my visit to Belgrade will take place some time around 15 March. Regarding the success of the Zagreb round, it is definite that progress will be reached regarding the opening of the Croatian and FRY bureaus. It is definite that we will make progress in the search for missing persons. However, what progress we will make on the political issues remains to be seen tomorrow. In any case, we would like to accomplish major moves. [Kosaric] Dr. Granic, can we then realistically expect the opening of the FRY and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade on 15 March in accordance with the Geneva declaration? [Granic] We can, and I believe that Croatia will open its bureau on 15 February. Just after our interview, we are having a meeting to pass the final decision, however, I can say that our side has completed all the preparations. On the other hand, both sides have, so far, fulfilled all their obligations and we expect that the opening will truly take place, perhaps even on 15 February. I would like to say another thing. You see, no question will be bypassed tomorrow. Naturally, we know very well that the major FRY problems are, for example, sanctions, succession, and other issues. We will definitely also touched upon the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and search for the final cease-fire, an end to the war, and a lasting peace. Therefore, it does not mean that we will find solutions to everything tomorrow. However, it is certain that we must discuss all problems openly, regardless of how much we differ on them, and try to draw closer. Of course, tomorrow will be the time and the day when we will put forward the proposals for final solutions to everything to one another. [Kosaric] In the name of Radio Belgrade, Dr. Granic, thank you for the interview. [Granic] My pleasure.
