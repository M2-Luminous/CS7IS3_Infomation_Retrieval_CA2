Does affluent Germany not have our level of economic and cultural prowess? [Schenk] There are various beliefs prevailing in Germany. One school of thought is that we should forge ahead as a multicultural society, and that is why we should accept those who are in Germany into our society. We can give them German or dual nationality; and steps have been taken in this regard. There are others who believe that we have a long way to go to a multicultural or multinational society. However our policy is to seek a middle course. We have accepted the foreigners who have resided in Germany for many years and we have bestowed legal rights on them. [passage omitted] [HAMSHAHRI] Has Germany made any effort--as it should--to boost cooperation with Iran? [Schenk] Under its First 5-Year Plan, Iran cooperated extensively with Germany. I should state that the credit envisaged for Iran, and the insurance that had been approved by the Hermes Insurance Company is the third highest after Russia and Brazil. Iran, where Germany has accepted a guarantee of 14 billion German marks, is in third place. I believe we do have quite extensive mutual cooperation. At present, talks are under way regarding repayments and extending the reimbursement period. The main issue in these talks is to extend the period for repayment of short-term loans. There are no particular problems with regard to the repayment of long-term loans. Cultural exchanges are also in progress. For example, the third Iran-Germany session on human rights under Islam and the West will be held in Iran next spring. Larijani's visit to Germany was very successful. He has much credibility as far as we are concerned and is an articulate person. He met some old acquaintances in the course of his visit, such as Hans Dietrich-Genscher, whom he knows very well. Talks were held with Larijani on all bilateral issues. In addition, regional issues, and matters pertaining to Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the Arab-Israeli issue were discussed, in addition to an extensive range of other issues. [HAMSHAHRI] Regarding the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, some people believe that Germany's swift recognition of Croatia and Slovenia aggravated civil strife in Yugoslavia. In addition, what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not concealed from the eyes of the Germans. Has Germany, with its 80 million people and such a high level of economic potential [preceding word in English] performed its human obligations to the optimum? [Schenk] The present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a source of shame for Germany but the whole world. Germany has extended humanitarian assistance so far; we are among the biggest helpers of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the legal point of view, it is not possible for us to intervene militarily in accordance with our Constitution. As far as intervening under the NATO aegis is concerned, that depends on the Security Council. However, terminating the conflict by military means seems almost impossible. That is why we and other Europeans are seeking to end the conflict by political means. Some useful measures have been taken in this regard. [HAMSHAHRI] Do you have any particular opinion you wish to express? [Schenk] I think it is possible to live a comfortable life in Iran. Tehran is a progressive city and one can live here safely. Foreigners are residing here happily. Tehran is a very clean city with far more security than many capitals of the world and is teeming with life.
