A total of 7.1 percent of respondents identified themselves clearly as being on the left, 14.9 percent as leaning toward the left, 44.1 percent as leaning toward the center, 13.1 percent as leaning toward the right, and 6.7 percent as being clearly on the right. What is evident, apart from the numerical equality between "right-wingers" and "left-wingers," is the clear dominance of those who profess allegiance to the political center. However, this position in the center does not have the character of consistent and unambiguous centrist positions but, rather, is a combination of right-wing and left-wing attitudes. In relation to the general economic transformation, proreform attitudes and approaches that can be considered right-wing have a surprisingly strong representation. As many as 45.9 percent of respondents are of the opinion that the pace of the economic reform should be faster, and 25.3 percent consider its pace adequate. On the other hand, 13.7 percent advocate the slowing down of the reform, and only 2.3 percent want the reform to be halted. More than one-half of respondents (52.8 percent) agree with the privatization of the largest possible number of companies, while 35.3 percent are of the opposite opinion. Those polled in the FOCUS survey expressed a relatively favorable attitude toward private entrepreneurs--41.3 percent advocate a reduction of the entrepreneurs' tax burden, compared with 17.7 percent who would like to see their tax burden rise. The opinion that companies and firms should be given the opportunity to give a part of their taxes directly in support of health care, education, culture, sports, and the like is supported by 60.6 percent of those polled, while only 21.1 percent want taxes to be surrendered exclusively directly into the state budget. Views on the terms of the payment of unemployment benefits reveal a similar pattern--59.9 percent want them to be tightened, while 14.8 percent want them to be less stringent. On some other questions (and it needs to be said that these questions have a more immediate impact on the respondents' lives), views gravitate more toward the center. For example, 41.2 percent advocate the existence of a single type of health and social insurance for everyone, while approximately the same number (41.4 percent) prefer the possibility to choose from various types of health and social insurance according to one's own choice and level of income. The view that the state should provide child allowances regardless of the level of parents' income is supported by 40.3 percent; 26.7 percent believe that they should be paid only to families living at the subsistence level, while 30.5 percent are somewhere in between these two options. However, all of the previous seemingly protransformation figures are called in question somewhat by the fact that as many as 47.2 percent disagree with the view that the changes in the economy must be made as quickly as possible, even at the cost of temporarily lowering living standards. On the other hand, 45 percent agree with this view. Given the erstwhile massive shock over "belt-tightening," this division into two almost equally strong halves is not all that tragic, however. The most extreme antireform attitudes appear at the most general level. As many as 67.8 percent believe that income differentials should be reduced, with which only 27.9 percent disagree. As many as 82.8 percent agree with the view that people in our country are growing rich predominantly by dishonest means, as against 14.6 percent who disagree with this view. On the other hand, also positive tendencies are to be observed at the rather general plane, which cannot be quite unequivocally assessed in terms of right-wing or left-wing attitudes. The view that Slovakia should follow as much as possible the example of the advanced countries of the West is supported by 66.6 percent, while only 25.9 percent voiced disagreement with this view. On the whole, the sheet is thus well-balanced.
