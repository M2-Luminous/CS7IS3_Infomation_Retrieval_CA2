Reporter Roberto Cavada obtained further details via telephone: [Cavada -- live or recorded] I think it is important to comment, for Cubans, on the expectations and the work plan of the Cuban delegation in Myanmar. [Unidentified reporter] The foreign minister has just arrived in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from Laos. He is practically at the midpoint of his tour, which began this week in Indonesia and which includes Thailand. In Thailand, although it was a short visit, a technical stopover, Foreign Minister Robaina took the opportunity to talk with the Thai foreign minister in Bangkok. His tour also included Laos, and now Myanmar. I would dare say that, in fact, the tour has turned out to be a big success. At all his stops, the Cuban foreign minister has been received by heads of government, foreign ministers, and the business circles of those countries. In the case of Myanmar, I can tell you that its foreign minister, Ohn Gyaw, visited the island last year; one of his objectives was to explore possible channels for collaboration between the two nations. The visit by Robaina that begins today is considered a reaffirmation of the relations of friendship maintained by the two nations despite the distance that separates us. Even though it is a weekend, the foreign minister has a very tight schedule, with several meetings scheduled with high-ranking figures here. On Monday he will leave for Cambodia. This is what I can tell you about this tour of the Cuban foreign minister through several Asian nations. Thank you, Cavada, and greetings to Radio Rebelde listeners. [Cavada] They have, indeed, just arrived in Myanmar, and a great many things are to happen during the rest of the visit. We will be alert to the latest events in connection with the visit of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Myanmar.
