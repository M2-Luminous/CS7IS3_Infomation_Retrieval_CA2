In statements to the BBC correspondent in New York, Mr. 'Aziz added that without those pressures, the Special Committee and the IAEA would have a long time before conveyed this view to the Security Council. Mr. 'Aziz added that the political attitudes of France, Russia and China toward Iraq are clear and had acknowledged the realities concerning Iraq's application of the Security Council resolution. Mr. 'Aziz pointed out that the United States and Britain maintain anti-Iraq political stances contributing not to acknowledge these realities. Mr. 'Aziz said text of Resolution 687 is an important issue and is considered essential by the West and that is why the West made row when it thought that Iraq does not comply to the resolution articles but when it has become clear that Iraq is fully complying with the resolution, the West started to say that that is not important and such affair reflects a clear contradiction. Mr. 'Aziz said we still say to the Security Council that it should respect its resolution otherwise this would harm the legal and moral credibility of its resolutions.
