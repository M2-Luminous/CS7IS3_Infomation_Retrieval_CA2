This is the first session to be held since Algeria took over the chairmanship of the union for the current year. The participants discussed a number of issues relating to the progress achieved in the building of the Maghreb edifice. The heads of the delegations representing the five Maghreban states also discussed the union's relations with the other regional blocs and with regional and international financial institutions. In his closing speech, Ahmed Attaf, the chairman of the session and secretary of state in charge of cooperation and Maghreban affairs in Algeria -- given that Algeria has been chairing the AMU since March -- expressed his satisfaction with the results achieved by the session which, he said, would undoubtedly contribute to strengthening the Maghreban process and increase its dynamism and activity. He added that the committee would follow-up the realization of the programs drawn up by the session, particularly the sectors that require serious attention. AMU Secretary-General Mohamed Amamou, for his part, read out a thank-you message addressed to President Liamine Zeroual in which he wished him total success in carrying out his mission as current president of the Arab Maghreb Union.
