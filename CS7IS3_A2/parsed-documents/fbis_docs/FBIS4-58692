Prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the true and honest one, and on his family and companions until the day of judgment. O sons of the unified and great Yemeni people: The House of Representatives, while following the successive and serious events the country has been passing through since the crisis began, emphasizes it has provided repeated opportunities for genuine and true dialogue designed to extricate the country from what it is passing through, in the hope that everyone will return to his senses and place both unity and democracy above narrow-minded party considerations and calculations. For this purpose, the House has made great efforts to prevent matters from going as far as they have today. The House has temporarily frozen some of its constitutional powers, out of its concern about unity, about its continuity, and about the unity of the House as a Constitutional establishment representing a united Yemen, in order to foil the goals of the adventurers who want nothing good for this homeland. Now that matters have reached the point of involving the Armed Forces in the furnace of a destructive war, of bloodshed, killing, and the squandering of both the property and the capabilities of the Armed Forces -- the shield of the people -- as well as the sabotaging of peaceful cities, led by the capital of the state of unity, the capital of historic Yemen, the House of Representatives is now duty-bound to carry out its responsibility and fully pursue its Constitutional powers -- powers the House was reluctant to use in the past. Given all this, the House holds the secessionist clique in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who rebelled against Constitutional legitimacy and who created the crisis, fully responsible for what has happened and what is now taking place. The House has decided to remove the legitimacy of al-Bid and his secessionist colleagues. The House regards the activities they are carrying out and the decisions they are making as illegal and says they do not represent the Republic of Yemen. The House regards the reckless actions the secessionist elements in the YSP are carrying out as a reflection of the ailing psyche of those who do not follow the Constitution or law and who do not adhere to the results of the democracy that they used to boast about. Having studied the measures the legitimate leadership has taken in terms of declaring a state of emergency, the House of Representatives appeals to citizens to keep calm, restrain themselves, and cooperate with legitimate authorities to confront the enemies of unity and the advocates of secession among the YSP leaders and elements. The House appeals to all sons of the Armed Forces to rally around the legitimate leadership, implement its instructions, and stand in the trench of the forces defending unity and democracy. This is because they are duty-bound to protect funds and property and to safeguard the honor of people and the blood of the innocent. Moreover, the House appeals to the forces of good in the YSP, who reject both war and secession, to stand with legitimacy, unity, and democracy. God is the one who grants guidance and success. The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the House will hold a session tomorrow morning [7 May].
