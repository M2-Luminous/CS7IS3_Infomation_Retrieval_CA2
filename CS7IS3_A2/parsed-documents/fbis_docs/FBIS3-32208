Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena scheduled another session of the constitutional reform for today, when the government will have a new chance to see the FSE approved. The Congress again met without voting on a measure linked to the economic stabilization program because of a lack of quorum. They should have voted on the government request that voting on the FSE be considered a priority. Only 279 congressmen were on the floor, while the presence of at least 293 congressmen is required for the vote. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who spent almost 10 hours in Congress holding separate meetings with the PPR and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party to discuss approval of the measure, said that the government has nothing more to negotiate: [Begin recording] The only thing that I want to make very clear is that there is nothing more to negotiate, because every minute something new is invented. Everyone is currently defending his or her own interests. It is natural for one to defend one's own interests. The problem is that no one is thinking about the country's interests; no one is worrying about society's interests. By saying no one, I am exaggerating. The truth is that a large number of people are not thinking about the country's interests. I believe we are having a very serious crisis. The Congress overcame the crisis resulting from the corruption CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] and began the inactivity crisis. [end recording] Despite all, the finance minister hopes that in the session scheduled for 1100 this morning Congress can make a decision regarding the amendment that creates the FSE. The minister said that he will talk to President Itamar Franco, who has supported all negotiations between government and Congress. He added that the Congress' failure to adopt a clear position has created a governability crisis in the country.
