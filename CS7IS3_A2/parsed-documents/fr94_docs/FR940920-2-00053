FR940920-2-00053 FR940920-2-00027 FACT SHEET I. General Permits and Requests for Individual NPDES Permits Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (the Act) provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with the terms of an NPDES permit. Under EPA's regulations [40 CFR 122.28(a)(2)], EPA may issue a single general permit to a category of point sources located within the same geographic area if the regulated point sources: _Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; _Discharge the same types of wastes; _Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions; _Require similar monitoring requirements; and _In the opinion of the Regional Administrator, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual permits. In addition, under EPA regulations [40 CFR 122.28(c)(1)], the Regional Administrator shall issue general permits covering discharges from offshore oil and gas facilities within the Region's jurisdiction. Where the offshore area includes areas for which separate permit conditions are required, such as areas of environmental concern, a separate individual or general permit may be required by the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator has determined that exploratory oil and gas facilities operating in the area described in this general NPDES permit are more appropriately controlled by a general permit than by individual permits. Any owner and/or operator authorized to discharge under a general permit may request to be excluded from coverage under the general permit by applying for an individual permit as provided by 40 CFR 122.28(b). The operator shall submit an application together with the reasons supporting the request to the Director, Water Division, EPA, Region 10 (``Director''). A source located within a general permit area, excluded from coverage under the general permit solely because it already has an individual permit (i.e., a permit that has not been continued under the Administrative Procedure Act), may request that its individual permit be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the individual permit, the general permit shall apply. Procedures for modification, revocation, termination, and processing of NPDES permits are provided by 40 CFR 122.62&hyph;122.64. As in the case of individual permits, violation of any condition of a general permit constitutes a violation of the Act that is enforceable under Section 309 of the Act.
