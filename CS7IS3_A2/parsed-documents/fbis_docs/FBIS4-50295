This discussion was presided over by Sun Ying, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. (Song Zhaolong), member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee, was present at the discussion as well. Sun Ying said: The provincial party committee has attached great importance to the work of our press units, and has pinned great hopes on them. We are satisfied with the correct guidance for public opinion which is provided by our news reporting and propaganda work, and by work done by everyone present over the past four months. There have been some marked features in our news reporting and propaganda work over the past four months: 1) We have implemented the spirit of the national and provincial propaganda and ideological work meetings. 2) We have persisted in correct guidance for public opinion. 3) We have grasped typical reporting in a vivid and dramatic manner, and have propagated the main theme of the era. Sun Ying also set several specific demands for doing news reporting work well. Responsible comrades from the Gausu Provincial Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, provincial radio and television department, GANSU RIBAO, and other units spoke without any inhibition. They talked about their tentative working plan for both the present and the near future. While listening to their speeches, Yan Haiwang also exchanged views with them. When they raised the issue that the masses in the Gannan area and the southern part of Gansu have difficulties in listening to radio broadcasts owing to poor signal strength, he said: This is because of the weak transmitting capacity of our broadcasting equipment. The provincial authorities will coordinate with the central authorities to solve this problem well. Yan Haiwang briefed all the participants on economic construction and social development in Gansu Province since the beginning of this year. He stressed: The guideline of the provincial authorities is that we must further emancipate our minds and change our concepts. In the meantime, we must strongly advocate self-reliance and hard work. Our province had a poor foundation to start with. Our news reporting and propaganda work must rouse the drive of the masses and inspire their enthusiasm. In our future news reporting and propaganda work, we must pay attention to exploring certain questions, devote our main efforts to positive reporting and providing active guidance, and grasp typical reporting well. We must encourage the masses, and arouse their enthusiasm so as to give play to the guiding role of news reporting in organizing, encouraging, promoting, and inspiring our people.
