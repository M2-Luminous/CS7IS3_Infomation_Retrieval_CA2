FBIS3-12803 "drnes043_d_94003" FBIS-NES-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 Libya JANA Official on UN `Failure' To Act on Massacre LD0303231494 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 2000 GMT 3 Mar 94 LD0303231494 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] News reports coming from New York indicate that the Security Council has failed to reach an agreement on issuing a resolution condemning the massacre committed by the Israeli terrorists against those who were praying at the honorable al-Haram al-Ibrahimi [mosque] that led to the fall of scores of victims among the praying Arab Palestinians. The Council had resorted to the adjournment of its session during the past days, at the request of the U.S. representative to the Council. JANA Arab affairs editor has commented on this saying: The failure of the so-called Security Council to condemn this savage massacre -- which constitutes one of the ugliest and dirtiest crimes of official terrorism -- exposes before the entire world the truth of this Council, which is controlled by the Christians and used by the crusader West as a tool to serve its interests and is a sword hanging over the necks of those who reject its blackmailing policies and refuse to give in to its will. Although a week has elapsed since the savage massacre of al-Haram al-Ibrahimi -- and despite the clear evidence of official Israeli responsibility before the world for this terrorist crime that claimed as victims scores of Arab Muslim Palestinians while they prayed inside the Ibrahimi mosque -- the so-called Security Council is still postponing its session and is evading anything that will implicate the criminal Israelis, who are still shedding Arab Palestinian blood while the Council is claiming to be discussing the massacre. The editor added that this exposed attitude by the so-called Security Council is the attitude of the West, which does not want to declare the truth and admit that what the Israelis have done was premeditated, official terrorism and a link within a long chain of Israeli acts of terrorism and thus to convict the Israelis of terrorism. The editor stressed that this is another scandal of the so-called Security Council -- which holds immediate sessions and enthusiastically issues resolutions on sanctions and embargoes when the question is concerning the Arabs, applying the seventh chapter against them even when those resolutions are based on mere suspicion -- while witnessing with its own eyes one of the ugliest crimes of terrorism committed by the Israelis, openly and officially and before the entire world. Yet the Council refuses to issue even a denunciation of the criminals. It is a stand that cannot be explained except by the crusader West's indifference towards Arab lives and their blood, as if they were a race other than mankind. It is also an encouragement to the Israeli terrorists to commit more massacres against the Palestinian people. It is another indication regarding the extermination scheme being implemented against the Arabs and the Muslims by the Jewish-Christian alliance.
