Yi is to seek Beijing's continuous efforts to stop the North Korean nuclear program and its support in realizing a reunion of separated families in each side of Korea. He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Li Peng afterward. Earlier in the morning, Deng Pufang, eldest son of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, visited Yi in the Diaoyutai guest house. Deng, chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, told Yi he sincerely welcomed him to China on behalf of his family and hoped his visit would help to develop bilateral ties. Yi, in return, bade Deng Xiaoping good health and asked his son to deliver his greetings. "I'm confident that my visit will be epoch-making in bilateral ties. South Korea and China should join forces to open up the bright future of the 21st century," Yi said. The aged Deng is said to be resting in southern China with his family. His third daughter, Rong, who visited Seoul last November to promote a best-selling biography of her father, sent a gift to Yi through the foreign committee of the National People's Congress. Yi arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a seven-day visit at the invitation of his counterpart, Qiao Shi, for the first legislative contact between South Korea and China. The countries normalized diplomatic ties in August 1992.
