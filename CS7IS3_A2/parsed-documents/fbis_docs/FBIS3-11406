According to the text of a presidential decree issued today and given to DPA, Gaviria entrusted the ministry to Deputy Minister Gerardo Hernandez. A labor minister is expected to be appointed next week. He will regulate decrees for the social security reform approved by Congress late last year. The reform was sponsored by Ramirez, who registered today as presidential candidate Andres Pastrana's ticket partner, and he immediately announced an ambitious and quick tour of Colombia. Ramirez was appointed labor minister in July 1992 on behalf of the New Democratic Force (FND), a conservative group founded by Pastrana, who announced a campaign and promised a government with supraparty leanings.
