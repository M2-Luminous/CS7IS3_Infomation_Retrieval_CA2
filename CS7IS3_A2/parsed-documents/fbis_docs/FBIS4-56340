FBIS4-56340 "drlat085_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Peru Five Peasants Reportedly Murdered by Soldiers Five Peasants Reportedly Murdered by Soldiers PY0205224294 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1606 GMT 2 May 94 PY0205224294 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 2 May (EFE) -- LA REPUBLICA reported today that several Peruvian Army members cut the throats of five people, one of them a 13-year-old girl, in the northern jungle region, according to an accusation made by the wife of one of the victims, who witnessed the murder. According to the witness, Amalia Tolentino, whose whereabouts are being kept secret, the bodies of five people found near Moyuna are peasants whose throats had been cut by Army soldiers who arrested them on 8 April. One of the dead is Jesus Vera Virgilio, Tolentino's husband, who was murdered despite having identified himself as an Army informer. Tolentino said that an Army patrol commanded by a captain murdered the five people after accusing them of being terrorists. She said she was pardoned because she was carrying a baby girl. The daily reported that she found her husband's body with a slit throat. This case was reported by Tolentino to the special prosecutor for human rights in Huanuco, capital of Huanuco Department in the northern jungle region, where since 5 April a military antiterrorist operation has been under way in Leoncio Prado Province. A prosecutor and several doctors examined on 29 April the remains of the five people, of whom only the bones were left. According to the doctors, the skulls and long bones showed no signs of gunshot wounds, and therefore the cause of death was not established. They added, however, that they were probably killed before 5 April, when the military operations began. The bodies were buried at the same site, and no autopsy was carried out. Francisco Diez Canseco, president of the National Peace Council, said that "it is obvious" that "isolated cases" of human right violations were made during the military operation. Despite this, Diez Canseco believes that accusations by the Human Rights National Coordinating Board of the bombing of civilians and the deaths of dozens of people are exaggerated. Diez Canseco admitted, however, the case involving two women who said they were raped by soldiers. He said: "The women said they were able to escape, but others were not so lucky and were murdered." He admitted: "It is a fact that abuses were committed." The U.S. State Department demanded of the Peruvian Government an investigation into the charges, and the Peruvian Foreign Ministry answered with a harsh communique claiming an "unfriendly" U.S. attitude. Carlos Blanco, president of the Human Rights Committee in Congress, said he will visit the U.S. Embassy in Lima today to protest the "interference in the country's internal affairs."
