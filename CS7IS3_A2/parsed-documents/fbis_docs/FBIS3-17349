The Abkhazian Defense Ministry told Interfax that the Abkhazian army had taken the initiative and forced the Georgian formations to retreat to the canyon. According to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry, the Georgian side suffered casualties. The Georgian troops also lost two tanks, a Shilka anti-aircraft mounting and several artillery weapons. Non-official sources maintain that there are up to 1,500 people in the Georgian formations and a large amount of military equipment. Abkhazian military experts believe that if the Georgian formations break the blockade they will secure an advantageous position for sabotage and other military operations, including in Sukhumi (the Abkhazian capital). The Abkhazian Defense Ministry told Interfax that a significant number of Georgian servicemen and military armored equipment had been gathered on the Georgian-Abkhazian border lying on the Inguri River. Most Georgian servicemen were gathered near the populated center of Jvari which is quite close to the Inguri Hydro Electric Power Station, Abkhazian intelligence reported.
