Branding this as an outburst of the "civilian"-veiled fascist revealing his sinister intention to tighten the repressive rule, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: Dictatorship is incompatible with democracy. It is shameful of the puppets to talk about "civilian government" and "democracy" while wielding the sword of dictatorship. The ever more outrageous and vicious suppression by the puppets is hysterics of those who are floundering in the crisis of a fish out of water, rejected and denounced by the people. Sword-brandishing, however, can never be a means of prolonging life. The struggle of the South Korean people for independence, democracy, reunification and the vital rights is justifiable. It cannot be criminalized under any circumstances. To suppress this struggle by branding it as "illegal" is a lawless violence and an unpardonable fascist outrage. The harsher the fascist suppression by the puppets, the stronger the resistance of the people. The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique had better act with discretion.
