Asked whether at the meeting in Prague he would be demanding from Clinton guarantees for Poland, the president replied: "Generally speaking, there is no threat here. A threat may appear and today such guarantees are not necessary, but tomorrow, unless we take steps which I have proposed, such guarantees will be ineffective." The president emphasized that, unless some things happen "guarantees, even if granted to us, will not be possible to implement." When asked whether he thought that exerting pressure on the West with regard to NATO membership by the entire Visegrad Group, rather than doing this as separate members, would not be more effective, the president replied: "We are saying more or less the same thing. The problem is that for the time being we cannot say this with one voice. It is a bit odd, but perhaps it is a postcommunist illness...."
