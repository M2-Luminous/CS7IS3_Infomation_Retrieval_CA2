The refugees came to Azerbaijan in earlier times and are still coming. They did not always expect that a good destiny awaited them in Azerbaijan...But, about this a bit later. The majority of people coming to Azerbaijan have been "southerners" -- Iranian Azeris. Iranian refugees came to Azerbaijan even during the time of Tsarist Russia. They were basically dissatisfied with the political situation in Iran, they were participants in the national liberation struggle and the unemployed who wished to earn money to buy a piece of bread. These emigrants functioned freely on the territory of Tsarist Russia and did what they wished. No matter that the interests of Tsarist Russia in Azerbaijan coincided with the interests of neighboring Iran, the Tsarist government was unable to send the refugees back, or return them to their own homeland. Even then domestic opinion was taken into consideration. Later, during the period of Soviet Russia, even newer armies of refugees began to come to Azerbaijan from Iran. These, basically, did not accept the rule of Reza Shah and were national freedom fighters, headed by Heydar Emioghlu. At first, the Soviet state met them with great sympathy. But a few years later, Mirjefer Baghyrov, at Stalin's order, imprisoned these refugees as "doubtful persons," and returned them to Iran where some were hanged and some exiled to Iran's southern provinces. After the S. Pishevari movement a number of members of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party tried to emigrate from Iran to Azerbaijan. At the last moment, the emigres met with automobile accidents, were shot, or exiled. All of this happened on the territory of the USSR. The number of refugees did not diminish even after the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. On the contrary, they significantly increased. In the period after the revolution, the fate of the refugees coming to Azerbaijan was somewhat different. Only a few of these refugees, those who were dissatisfied with the political situation in the USSR, went back to Iran. (Employees of the KGB put them back over the border to Iran.) The Soviet state gave some of them visas and they set forth for the West. As for most of the refugees, normal conditions were established for them. In some places of residence, additional amenities were given to these refugees. The last emigre wave from Iran took place during the Elchibey presidency. At this time some of the refugees came with the desire to live in democratic, independent Azerbaijan, and others, simply, because their security was not guaranteed in Iran. And in high circles in Azerbaijan granting them citizenship was even discussed...[passage illegible] In our opinion, if such a step were taken, it could create very unpleasant consequences for us. There is a notion in the West that the Azerbaijan Republic has little concern for the Helsinki Convention and UN resolutions. According to UN resolutions every individual has the right to live in the country of his choice and the ruling powers of each country are obligated to create normal conditions for the refugees. But, at the same time, peoples of our neighbor country have negative feelings toward Azerbaijan, and the faith of the democratic forces and the national liberation movement of Iran in independent Azerbaijan is being shaken. And finally, ties between Northern and Southern Azerbaijan could weaken.
