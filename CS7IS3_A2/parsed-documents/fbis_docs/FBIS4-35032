He said: "I would say there is some preference, based on public opinion and comments made by President Eduardo Frei, for studying Chile's incorporation into NAFTA in greater detail but we are not excluding a free trade agreement with the United States." He explained, however, that the government has not made any decision and hopes to make it in the next few days. He added: "For the time being our main decision is to be flexible, but we are willing to study other alternatives to choose what is best for the country." Insulza admitted there is a majority opinion favorable to NAFTA because it is a known agreement, its benefits can be immediate for Chile, and it is made up of three countries (the United States, Mexico, and Canada) and not just one. He said: "The way labor and environmental issues are dealt with in NAFTA seem satisfactory to us. In other words, there are favorable good reasons. But we cannot fail to recognize that a free trade agreement with the United States has some advantages because it is more direct, immediate, and adjusted to our own situation." He pointed out that the main disadvantage of a bilateral trade agreement is that a new agreement must be negotiated subject to conditions and reasons that are not well-defined. He added: "The government has not made a decision but from the opinions given by the majority of government officials one can deduce that there is a preference for NAFTA." Insulza gave a lecture to Eighth Region exporters that was organized by the Regional Institute of Business Administration, IRADE, and Prochile entitled: "Strategy for Internationalizing Chile and Diplomacy for Development." He said Chile will try to form a trade association or free trade with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], "to put it in simple terms," because it will open the markets of four countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) for us to increase our exports. He added: "Argentina and Brazil currently are our third- and fourth-largest trade partners, respectively, and there is no reason why they could not be the first and second due to the size of their markets and their closeness to us." Insulza noted that for Chile, a country with an open economy and clear foreign trade rules, the ideal would be to have a multilateral system with clear rules. He indicated that although that system has not been achieved despite the progress made in the Uruguay Round, preferential agreements with different countries, regions, or groups of countries should be created. He said Latin America and especially South America have received large quantities of Chilean exports in the last few years. He said Chile has balanced trade with Argentina of about $1 billion with a surplus of $7 million favorable to Chile. He added: "There is a relative balance with Uruguay, a slight deficit with Paraguay, and a big deficit of about $600 million with Brazil." Insulza said this situation changes if one studies the balance of services, which generally is not included in the statistics; "if it were, Chile would have a surplus with those countries."
