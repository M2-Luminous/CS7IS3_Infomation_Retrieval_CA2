FBIS3-33783 "drnes021_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 SYRIA Press Reaffirms Commitment to Middle East Peace JN3001082394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 30 Jan 94 JN3001082394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [From the press review] [Text] The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the Middle East peace talks, noting that Syria has always taken the lead in efforts to promote peace in the region. It has done its utmost to nurture the peace process and ensure the implementation of the relevant international legitimacy resolutions in a manner that would guarantee the restoration of all Arab territories and rights to their rightful owners. The paper adds: The ball is now in the Israeli court. For the future of the peace process, as well as the future of security and stability in the region hinge upon the moves the Rabin government might make. Hence, this government must declare its clear and open commitment to the bases and terms of reference enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions to help achieve a true and durable peace. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: But, if Israel resorts to its old well-known tactics, then the international community must shoulder its responsibilities and perform its role of curbing Israeli belligerence and removing all the difficulties obstructing the peace talks. This is essential if this community really wants this region to enjoy security and peace. The newspaper TISHRIN affirms Syria's commitment to the requirements of achieving just and comprehensive peace, arguing that partial settlements and separate deals will neither achieve peace, nor ensure security, as the course of events has shown, particularly in the aftermath of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. As a matter of fact, they have only exacerbated the regional situation and derailed the peace process, the paper notes. TISHRIN adds: Syria has explained its positions, which advocate the attainment of just and comprehensive peace, with all clarity during the Geneva summit. Consequently, it has affirmed that the party that is promoting comprehensive peace is the very party that is eager to see the region enjoy stability, the party that is committed to the components of comprehensive peace. As for the U.S. peace initiative, which is grounded in the principle of trading land for peace; the relevant UN Security Council resolutions; and the concept of comprehensive, just, durable, and true peace, they should not be looked at as useless instruments. As a matter of fact, these instruments reflect concrete positions that should shape the peace to be achieved. Syria has underscored all this when it upheld the concept of full withdrawal in return for full peace, and spelled out its objectives, as explained in the document it submitted to the Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington bilateral talks. This document has continued until this moment to constitute a true and objective basis for just and comprehensive peace. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: Syria, which is eager to achieve peace and working to attain it, has reiterated that just and comprehensive peace is its strategic option. Hence, it has become extremely necessary and important for the peace process to achieve its objectives. It has become extremely necessary for it to make positive and constructive progress, which is contingent, first and foremost, upon Israeli acceptance of complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, Israeli commitment to the implementation of the relevant international legitimacy resolutions, and Israeli subscription to the principle of trading land for peace.
