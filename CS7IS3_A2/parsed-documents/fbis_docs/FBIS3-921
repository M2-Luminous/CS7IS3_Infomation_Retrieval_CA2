President Mugabe could hold it any time between March and May, and the opposition parties, who only hold a handful of seats in parliament, are hoping to make a better show against the ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front]. Today, Zimbabwe's home affairs minister gave a press conference and announced that the voters' register is going to be completely overhauled before the election. Rachel Rawlins was there and she sent us this report: [Begin recording] [Rawlins] Starting next Monday [21 March] thousands of civil servants will be distributed to registration points throughout the country in an effort to register every eligible voter in Zimbabwe. That means not just new voters but also those who have registered in the past will have to fill in new forms to appear on the computerized roll. Young people who reach the voting age of 18 by May next year will also qualify for inclusion, but that doesn't mean the election will definitely be held in May. Announcing the measure this afternoon, Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said it wasn't possible to extend the registration process outside Zimbabwe apart from South Africa, where, because of the large number of resident Zimbabweans -- about 300,000, according to government -- arrangements have been made for registration at Zimbabwe's Trade Mission in South Africa. Minister Dabengwa said opposition complaints that the election was being run by members of the ruling ZANU Party were unfounded. [Dabengwa] We cannot allow parties to be involved in the conduct of elections. We will have chaos and we will have accusations and counteraccusations. This is why we leave it to the civil servants to be responsible for the conduct of the elections. [Rawlins] But despite this assurance, opposition politicians complain of bias in government-appointed commission members, and are worried about President Mugabe's sweeping personal powers during elections. There are some fears of a repeat of the violence of the 1990 elections, particularly the incident where a ZANU Party member and a member of the Central Intelligence Organization were found guilty of shooting and wounding opposition political candidate Patrick Kombai. They were given presidential pardons before starting their sentences. Mr. Dabengwa gave the assurance that everything will be done to avoid violence this time around. [end recording]
