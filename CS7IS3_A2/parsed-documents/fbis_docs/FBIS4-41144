In his report, Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Security Committee, said that the most resolute struggle against crime should be mounted. He believes, however, "illegality cannot be used to fight illegality." In his address to State Duma deputies, First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov noted that the painful process of forming new economic structures is under way in the country. "The law enforcement bodies know very well who the leaders of the criminal world are," the general said. "And, in this respect, the presidential decree makes it possible to deal with them. We are not going to detain anybody for 30 days. Give us at least a month. I assume the entire responsibility for implementing the decree." Finally, the State Duma adopted a decision to: 1. Draw the Russian Supreme Court's attention to the need to observe the Russian Constitution and relevant legislation when examining specific criminal cases; 2. Confirm the fact that norms of the Code of Criminal Procedure are fully in force in the Russian Federation; 3. Have the State Duma Committees for Security, Legislation, and Legal and Judicial Reform submit to the State Duma for examination within two weeks the following draft federal laws: "On Combating Organized Crime"; "On the Fight Against Corruption"; "On State Protection for Victims of Crime, Witnesses, and Other Persons Assisting Legal Proceedings"; "On State Protection for Judges, Officials and Law Enforcement Bodies"; "On Russian Federation Counterintelligence Bodies"; "On the State of Emergency"; "On Keeping in Custody People Suspected and Accused of Crimes"; "On the Russian Federation Constitutional Court"; and "On State Service"; 4. Invite the Federal Assembly's Federation Council, the president, and the Russian Government to participate in debating and improving the above laws in order to speed their passage through the Russian Federal Assembly and their signing by the Russian president. 5. Recommend to the Russian president to refrain from bringing into force Decree No. 1226 of 14 June 1994 "On Urgent Measures for Protecting the Population From Gangsterism and Organized Crime" in order to bring it in line with the Russian Constitution and to submit a draft criminal code, draft code of criminal procedure, and draft code of criminal execution of the Russian Federation to the State Duma as soon as possible.
