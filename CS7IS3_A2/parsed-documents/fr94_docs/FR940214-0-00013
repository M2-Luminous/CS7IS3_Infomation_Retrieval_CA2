FR940214-0-00013 FR940214-0-00004 FmHA response: It was the intent of this proposal that the borrower's CPA be responsible for verifying that the borrower's accounting system meets the requirements of the regulation so that this responsibility can be removed from FmHA field personnel. Since the Agency does not have accountants on staff, we do not feel we have the expertise to adequately check the borrower's accounting system. We agree with the suggestion that the borrower be allowed to provide a written assertion on the accounting system and that the cost certification CPA report on its validity. This section has been rewritten to incorporate that suggestion. 7. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(B), 1924.13(e)(2)(iv), and 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(B) Comment: There was a question as to whether FmHA intends to reduce builder's profit when costs of line item are increased. Another respondent wondered if it is the intent of FmHA to restrict the amount of each line item to the estimated amount. Several persons objected to the restriction of general requirements to the estimated amount. One respondent recommended that any cost savings from project construction be returned on the loan and that the loan be reamortized to reflect a decrease in tenant rent. FmHA response: FmHA intends that builder's profit be reduced when the total costs of the line item costs exceed their estimates and would result in an increase in the contract amount. The amounts for general overhead, profit, and general requirements will be restricted to their estimated amounts, not the line items to their estimated amounts. FmHA believes that the estimates for general requirements can be accurately determined prior to the start of construction and not deviate significantly thereafter. We do not feel this would result in an undue burden on the borrower. A refund of loan funds can be used to reamortize the loan if it can be shown that the amount refunded will reduce the rents and an exception to the 10 percent requirement has been granted by the National Office. 8. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(C) and 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(A) Comment: There was some objection to requiring the borrower to agree that the tests conducted will include FmHA audit requirements. One respondent has recommended that the language be changed to refer to FmHA 1924&hyph;A instead of ``FmHA regulations'' and has provided FmHA with suggested language for this section. FmHA response: Because of the problems with how cost certifications are conducted, as revealed by OIG, FmHA felt it necessary to institute additional instructions to the CPA/LPA's which are intended to provide uniformity in the examination of construction costs. FmHA sought advice and assistance from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in developing the additional instructions referred to as the Audit Program. The Audit Program will be available in FmHA offices. It is FmHA's intent that the borrower recognize the Audit Program and to ensure that the auditor include its requirements in the cost certification process. The language of this section has been reworded as recommended by AICPA. FmHA has changed the reference from FmHA regulations to FmHA Instruction 1924&hyph;A. 9. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(D) Comment: One respondent objects to the auditor having to certify that he/she has no financial interest in or with the applicant/owner-builder, architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., since Government Auditing Standards prohibit such an identity of interest. Two respondents pointed out an inconsistency in the suggested CPA opinion letter since one paragraph refers to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and another refers to General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). FmHA response: Even though the Government Auditing Standards prohibits identities of interest between CPA's and the applicant, architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., OIG audits have revealed apparent close relationships exist between some CPA's and borrowers. Certain CPA's have not maintained an independence from the borrower as required by Government Auditing Standards. There is no inconsistency in the suggested opinion letter since GAGAS pertains to the audit of the construction costs and GAAP pertains to the accounting system which the borrower uses in recording construction costs. OIG has submitted a sample auditor's report which is incorporated in the Audit Program and available in any FmHA office. 10. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(F) Comment: The opinion was expressed that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system be allowed to cost certify. Also, costs will be duplicated if the borrower has to hire a CPA in addition to FmHA contracting for CPA services. There was objection to denying the right of a CPA to cost certify when that CPA is currently handling the contractor's accounting. FmHA response: It was originally FmHA's intent that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system not cost certify the project after construction. This was primarily due to the fact that OIG audit findings revealed a lack of independence between CPA's and borrowers. We have reconsidered this prohibition and will allow the same CPA who sets up or examines the borrowers accounting system to certify construction costs. However, the CPA who provides any accounting services to the borrower during construction will not be allowed to cost certify the project. To do so would be a violation of rules of independence set forth in Government Auditing Standards.
