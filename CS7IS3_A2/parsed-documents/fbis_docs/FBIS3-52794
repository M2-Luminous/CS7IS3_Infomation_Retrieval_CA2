Today it addresses the sons of our Palestinian people everywhere and in all places of residence on the beloved homeland or in the areas of gathering outside it, and all its political and social forces, and all its patriotic activities and jamahiri organizations, and all our brothers in the Palestinian detachments and the nationalist personalities, in order to reaffirm anew the importance of consolidating our national unity -- especially in these fateful and decisive times we are all passing through. It calls for more cohesion and unity at this great battleground and in the labor pains in which we are living and working, in order to realize the establishment of a patriotic Palestinian authority to complete the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza sector and the Jericho area as a first step along the path of retrieving the inalienable national rights of our Palestinian people and the establishment of our independent Palestinian state whose capital is Holy Jerusalem. Now that we are about to enter, with God's permission and His assistance, a new major, important, and historic period to be characterized by the creation of the first Palestinian authority in contemporary history on the land of our beloved homeland, this requires us all to work together in order to reconstruct and rebuild the national infrastructures, institutions, and bodies at all the political, economic, social, and institutional levels. Therefore at these crucial and historic moments, we are inviting all the national forces, factions, unions, institutions, and figures to meet and stress what brings us together and not what separates us and let those assembled adhere to the former. This should be entrenched in the minds and souls of everyone, in order to build our free and proud homeland for a people of freemen, militants, fighters, and believers. This will be a homeland of unity, light, hope, and faith which will be able to gain the trust of the people of the world who following this unique Palestinian experiment. The PLO Executive Committee welcomes the efforts made by some brethren with a view to strengthening national unity and reinforcing the bases of the democratic process and regards these efforts as a blessed action which proves the health and vitality of the Palestinian arena and our people's determination to rally around the Palestine Liberation Organization which leads its national struggle. Therefore, the PLO Executive Committee calls on all the Palestinian brethren and factions to contribute to the enrichment of the national dialogue and its deepening in order to strengthen our capacity to complete the recovery of our inalienable national rights, including our people's right to return, self-determination, and the establishment of their independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. This is the time for unity and not for disunion. This is the time for solidarity which is based on common denominators and not on elements of division. This is the time for joint action, and let amity govern our practices and our relations and what we agree on and what we disagree on. Let us come together, hand-in hand, to wage our sacred battle to build the Palestinian national entity; and let us direct our attention to the national interest of our people, our homeland, and nation within the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of our people, the protector of its interests and the leader of its struggle. The revolution will continue until victory.
