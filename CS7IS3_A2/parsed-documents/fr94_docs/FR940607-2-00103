FR940607-2-00103 FR940607-2-00066 Applicants' Analysis 1. Section 2(a)(3) defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person as, among other persons: (a) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with the power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person; (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person; (d) any officer,director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person; and (e) if such other person is an investment company, any investment adviser thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof. 2. By virtue of section 2(a)(3), if a bank owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a Fund, that bank is an affiliated person of the Fund. Any person who is an affiliated person of a registered investment company also may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person of each other registered investment company which has a common investment adviser, or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other, or common directors or common officers, or a combination of the foregoing because such investment companies may be deemed to be under common control. Accordingly, a bank, bank holding company, or affiliated person thereof that is deemed to be an affiliated person of one Fund may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person of all the other Funds. 3. Section 17(a) provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered investment company or to purchase from such registered investment company any security or other property. The operation of these provisions could prohibit all of the Funds from engaging in a variety of transactions with a wide range of banks, bank holding companies, and affiliated persons thereof. 4. Applicants believe that a bank, bank holding company, or affiliated person thereof that is affiliated with a Fund solely because it owns, holds, or controls 5% or more of the Fund's outstanding voting securities and/or acts as investment adviser to a different Fund, although an ``affiliated person'' of the Fund, or an ``affiliated person of an affiliated person'' of the Fund, within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act, is unlikely to possess the power to influence improperly the Fund with respect to purchases or sales by the Fund of securities from or to an Affiliated Bank. As a condition to the order, no Fund will engage in transactions with any Affiliated Bank which serves as investment adviser or sponsor to that Fund, controls or is under common control with the investment adviser or sponsor, or otherwise controls such Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9). Applicants believe that permitting transactions only with remote affiliates precludes the possibility of any overreaching by an Affiliated Bank and thus eliminates the concerns that section 17(a) was designed to address. 5. Section 17(e)(1) prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person thereof, from accepting any compensation for acting as an agent for the investment company unless it is in the course of such person's business as an underwriter or broker. Section 17(e)(2) provides that an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person thereof, acting as a broker or underwriter for the registered investment company may accept a limited commission or fee for conducting such transactions. Because banks are specifically excluded from the definition of broker in section 2(a)(6), however, they are unable to accept compensation under section 17(e) for acting as an agent for an affiliated investment company. 6. Applicants believe that the execution of transactions through Affiliated Banks as agents is appropriate for a number of reasons. First, any such transactions will comply with section 17(e)(2), assuring that the compensation received is fair and reasonable. Second, granting the relief merely would put an Affiliated Bank in the same position as any other affiliated person of a Fund that happened to meet the definition of broker. Finally, the use of Affiliated Banks promotes investment flexibility by expanding the range of entities available for execution of securities transactions. Applicants' Conditions 1. The Funds will engage in transactions with Affiliated Banks only in U.S. government securities or Qualified Securities, For purposes hereof, the term Qualified Securities is defined to mean: (a) For obligations which are ``short-term'' securities within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, each such security shall constitute an ``Eligible Security'' within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7; provided, that in the case of Unrated Securities (as defined in rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(20)), in addition to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7 applicable to such Unrated Securities, all determinations with respect to comparability of such securities to rated securities are also reviewed and approved at least quarterly by a majority of a Fund's board of directors/ trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund. (b) For obligations which are ``long-term'' securities within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7, each such security (or another long-term security of the same issuer having comparable priority and security to such obligation) shall have been rated by a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') in one of the four highest rating categories for long-term obligations; or, if the security and issuer have not been rated by any NRSRO, are determined by a Fund's investment adviser to be comparable in credit quality to a security carrying a long-term rating in one of such four highest rating categories of a NRSRO, and such determination is reviewed and approved at least quarterly by a majority of such Fund's board of directors/ trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund. In addition, if a Fund proposes to invest in a security that at the time of issuance was a long-term security but that has a remaining maturity of 397 calendar days or less, then the issuer of such security shall have received a rating from a NRSRO, with respect to a class of short-term securities that is comparable in priority and security to the long-term security, in one of the two highest rating categories. If the issuer has not received such a rating with regard to comparable short-term securities, then a long-term security with a remaining maturity of less than 397 calendar days is not eligible unless it has a long-term rating from a NRSRO within the two highest rating categories. (c) Any repurchase agreements will be ``collateralized fully'' within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7.
