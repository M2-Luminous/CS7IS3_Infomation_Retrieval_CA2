The statement says that recent articles have been putting a wrong and incompetent interpretation on the retirement of some air-capable cruisers from the Russian Navy. The point is that early in the 90s these ships have served their time and required repairs. But repair facilities being the property of Ukraine, placement of orders became impossible. Creation of specialised facilities by Russia would have taken much time and money. In view of these factors it was decided to retire the first- generation cruisers Minsk and Novorossiisk in the Pacific Fleet and the Kiev in the Northern Fleet. At the same time, the press service indicates, an air-capable cruiser of the next generation, Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as its aircraft, is being put through its paces.
