ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management proposes to withdraw 2,335.21 acres of public land to protect the unique habitat of the federally-listed endangered Nichol's Turk's Head Cactus. This notice closes the land for up to 2 years from settlement, sale, entry or location under the general land laws and the mining laws. The land will remain open to mineral leasing and discretionary uses as approved by the authorized officer. The withdrawal will be made subject to valid existing rights. DATES: Comments and requests for a meeting must be received on or before September 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and meeting requests should be sent to the Arizona State Director, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), 3707 North 7th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85014, or P.O. Box 16563, Phoenix, Arizona 85011&hyph;6563. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Mezes, BLM, Arizona State Office, 602&hyph;650&hyph;0509. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 4, 1994, a petition was approved allowing BLM to file the subject withdrawal proposal. This action will withdraw land within the Waterman Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The withdrawal will protect 1 of only 2 known locations in the United States of the Nichol's Turk's Head Cactus. It will protect the species from surface disturbing activities and potential destruction. This proposal is in compliance with existing plans for protection of the species. In 1979, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the cactus as endangered and completed the Recovery Plan for the species in 1986. The BLM has since completed the Phoenix Resource Management Plan in which the recommendation is to pursue withdrawal of the ACEC resulting in protection of this critical habitat. Lands proposed for withdrawal are located in Pima County and are legally described as follows: Gila and Salt River Meridian T. 12 S., R. 9 E., sec. 29, lots 3 and 4, S1/2NW1/4, N1/2SW1/4, N1/2SW1/4SW1/4, SE1/4SW1/4, SE1/4; sec. 30, lots 1&hyph;5 incl., lot 9, that portion of lot 10 lying outside of mineral entry patents, lot 11, S1/2NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, E1/2NE1/4SW1/4, N1/2N1/2SE1/4, SE1/4NE1/4SE1/4, SW1/4NW1/4SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4SE1/4; sec. 31, lots 3 and 4, those portions of lots 4 and 8 lying outside of mineral entry patents, NW1/4NE1/4NE1/4, SE1/4NE1/4NE1/4, N1/2NW1/4NE1/4, SW1/4NW1/4NE1/4, NW1/4SW1/4NE1/4, S1/2S1/2NE1/4, NE1/4SE1/4NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, E1/2SW1/4, SE1/4; sec. 32, MS 3885; sec. 33, N1/2NW1/4, N1/2SW1/4NW1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, N1/2NE1/4SW1/4, S1/2S1/2SW1/4, W1/2W1/2SE1/4.
