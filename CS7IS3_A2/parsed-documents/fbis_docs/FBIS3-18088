European Affairs ministers of the 12 EU [European Union] member countries and representatives of the four candidates have been engaged in talks on the countries' applications since Friday. The negotiators are facing a March 1 deadline to conclude the talks so that the European Parliament can approve the result and the applicants can hold referendums in time to enter the EU formally next January 1. "We are making very good progress with Sweden, the situation is good with Finland, but its a little more complicated with Norway and Austria," a Commission source said. French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure late Saturday warned that brinkmanship would not help the applicants wrest concessions ahead of Monday night's deadline. Representatives from the four candidate countries had separate meetings with the EU negotiators early Sunday, with EU ministers meeting later for lunch to discuss the state of the talks. Sources close to the negotiations said that Norway was still refusing to allow EU countries greater access to its fish-rich waters, or to accept limitations on its fish exports to the Union if it became a member. Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen said Saturday that Norway could not give up "responsible management" of its fish resources by allowing EU fishing fleets increased access to its waters as the price of EU membership. Norway has ruled out demands by Spain, Portugal and Ireland for new catch quotas in Norwegian waters. Austria also had refused to cut short a 12-year accord to limit polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, which the EU maintains would contravene its basic principal of free movement. Viennese officials, facing a vocal environmentalist lobby in regional elections next month, refused an EU compromise offer to let the trans-Alpine transport agreement run to end-1999. Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said it was "inconceivable" that the accord could be cut short before its scheduled end date of end-2004. Finland was less hardline in its opposition to the membership terms offered by the EU, but expressed concern that farmers in the southern part of the country would not qualify for special subsidies. EU officials were confident meanwhile that Sweden would sign up to EU rules although Brussels has rejected Sweden's plea for more time to pay its high membership dues. The talks with Sweden centred Sunday on technical matters including the country's strict anti-salmonella regulations and EU regulations over banana imports, EU sources said. The EU was unable meanwhile to overcome an internal squabble over the balance of power between its richer and poorer countries. Spain was pushing, against the combined weight of its EU partners and the four applicants, for rules to ensure that enlargement would not reinforce the influence of the richer northern countries at the expense of the poorer south.
