"We have laws which allow us to take action," [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi asserted. "In the first place we must evaluate the phenomenon. If we consider it an attempt to reconstitute the Fascist Party, or even as a dangerous subversive faction, there are ad hoc norms regulating this kind of activity. If, however, we regard the phenomenon as an episode indicating the attitude of a minority group, however raving the latter may be, one has to accept it, because freedom of speech is sacred, even when it manifests itself somewhere between folklore and cretinism." [Nese] But can we agree to skinheads marching in the streets? [Biondi] In civilized countries people who are considered a bit freakish also have the right to express their views. In front of the White House, for example, you always find the strangest kinds of people, who protest for ideological, political, or even personal reasons. Nobody would dream of silencing them. [Nese] A law has been passed in Germany condemning anyone who denies that the Holocaust took place. [Biondi] This means hindering freedom of speech. We have no reason to pass repressive laws. There is no need for them. Rather, inside our country there ought to be a moral and civil rejection of the skinhead phenomenon. What they do, and what they believe in, must make us reflect and lead our consciences to reject them. [Nese] Are you not concerned that a neofascist movement may cluster around these subversive groups? [Biondi] I believe Italy is mature enough to rule out any fascist danger. A movement of this kind would have no following, people are not nurturing any revanchist furor. [Nese] How can these groups be stopped, then? How can they be prevented from causing any harm? [Biondi] I believe that if the late Bassaglia were still alive, he would gladly reopen the lunatic asylums so as to lock up these weird characters in them. From a legal point of view, I think that we ought to be strong enough to allow them to have their say too. If there is the right to freedom of speech, then it must apply to everybody. The right to freedom of speech involves a risk. If we grant this right, then we cannot discriminate against anyone in particular. We are used to considering the things we like good, and the things we dislike unfair. This is making things too easy for us. [Nese] What if the skinheads carry out acts of violence? [Biondi] Then it is a different story. If their actions constitute an offense, then of course we must intervene. But what I would like to stress is that, as long as they limit themselves to folklore, this cannot lead to a reaction. An offense must first have been committed. Once I defended a judge according to whom Jews could not be convicted because they had committed deicide. I took up his defense because, although his views were aberrant, he had the right to express them. He deserved to be rebuked, not convicted. And the charges against him were dropped.
