They never expected to receive such a lousy "New Years gift." Scores of vehicles illegitimately using military license plates fell into the dragnet set jointly by the garrison forces and military transportation department in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Although the flow of military vehicles accounts for less than 5 percent of the total traffic in the crowded Zhujiang delta, one can see all kinds of military license plates. In Guangdong, an official responsible for the transportation section of the Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region said military license plates from all parts of the country except Tibet can been seen here. Experienced officers and men of the garrison force who are responsible for exercising supervision over military vehicles can easily spot the counterfeit military vehicles. In the military vehicle inspection jointly organized by the garrison forces and military transportation department of the Guangzhou Military Region and investigated by relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarters and General Logistics Department and the Legal System Bureau of the Central Military Commission, they examined more than 600 vehicles which had been using military license plates and found that 31 were using counterfeit military plates or licenses. Making Use of Military Vehicles To Smuggle and To Evade Taxes It is difficult to discover where the fake military license plates are forged, but Guangdong is surely one of the regions where the practice is running wild. Because of the special military mission of military vehicles and the preferential treatment they enjoy in the Zhujiang delta, they are exempted from highway and bridge tolls. As a result, a handful of people blinded by greed take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and use counterfeit military license plates to gain advantages at the expense of the state and collective. An individual engaged in the transportation business said that he would save annual highway and bridge tolls of over 10,000 yuan with a military license plate. As Guangdong is a coastal province, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, a tiny handful of lawless elements make use of the military plates to cover their crime of smuggling, evade supervision by government departments, and engage in all kinds of illegal activities. There is great demand for these license plates. Lawless elements seeking military plates and licenses stimulate almost wild black market transactions. When a "Dongfeng" truck, with a fake military license plate but without any license, was intercepted in Shenzhen, a reporter asked the driver about the source of the fake plate. The driver replied: I bought it for 600 yuan. When asked where he bought the plate, he said: I do not know. The Guangzhou Military Region tracked down a truck which was using fake military license plates by following clues, and discovered an illegal ring involved in selling temporary plates. The ring sold a total of 39 temporary military vehicle plates at 10,000 yuan each. As of the time of the investigation, the ring had illegally made a profit of 390,000 yuan. The black market price of a military license plate could reach as high as several hundred thousand yuan. In spite of the high prices, the forging of military vehicle license plates and illegal transactions are spreading. Regarding the lawless elements, the illegal gains made from using fake military vehicles is several to many times higher than the cost paid for getting a genuine military plate. Bizarre Dress Used To Pass Oneself Off As a Military Official To pass oneself off as an owner or driver of a military vehicle, one must pretend to be a serviceman or staff member of a military unit. Most of these people appear in the capacity as a staff member of a military enterprise. When a military vehicle inspection group was examining a "Lingzhi" car with military license plates at the Shaba toll collection station on the Guangzhou-Foshan expressway, a long-haired female lieutenant stepped out. The lady, who claimed to be the deputy director of a unit of the Logistics Department stationed in Guangzhou, wore a uniform with unmatched buttons and which was attractive, with material which was apparently different from the standard. She explained that the uniform was the latest issue. The servicemen in the inspection group looked at each other in dismay. When the inspector examined her "officer identity" card, which had the chop of the management bureau of an ordnance factory, she begged the female officer: "Please let me go, I am real." At the military vehicle inspection post near the Zhuhai Banzhangshan tunnel, the driver of a Toyota van, which had a military plate, presented his "People's Liberation Army Identity Card," which looked similar to the "officer identity" and "serviceman identity" cards. "XX Real Estate Development Company of XX Unit in Zhuhai" was printed on the cover of the identity card. When the inspector asked the driver some questions about the identity card, he just smiled and refused to answer. Huge Profits Result From Mass Production In an office of the Highway Inspection Section of the Guangzhou Military Region, this reporter witnessed hundreds of various kinds of confiscated fake military license plates. Some of the military plates and documents were of poor quality, and could be identified at first glance. But the quality of most of them was good enough to mistake them for real. According to officials of the Transportation Bureau of the Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, the workmanship and materials used in making most of the counterfeit military license plates were far better than the ones used in making genuine military vehicle plates. The forging of driving passes, driving licenses, officer identity cards, serviceman identity cards, and staff identity cards corresponded with the forging of military vehicle license plates. To forge documents, it is necessary to forge the chops of military units and the officials responsible for the work. One can easily see the mistakes in the forged military documents and chops, such as "Logistics Department of XX Unit Under General Staff Headquarters" and "XX Unit Stationed in XX Office." A forged military vehicle license even made the mistake of printing "Zhongguo Renmin Jiefang Jun" [Chinese People's Liberation Army] as "Zhongguo Renmin Fangjie Jun." An officer in charge of producing military vehicle license plates said that he had already found more than a dozen forged chops which used his name. Looking at the military cars and trucks which sweep past and gazing at the luxurious military cars parked in front of hotels, this reporter is at a loss: How many of them are genuine? Undoubtedly there are "underground factories" which forge military vehicle plates and licenses in large numbers. But when can these dens be smashed?
