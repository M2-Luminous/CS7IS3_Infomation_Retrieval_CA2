Our correspondent Marina Chernukha asked Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council what consequences this program would have for Russia. [Begin Manilov recording] Russia's attitude to this program is positive. I have in mind the fact that at no stage whatsoever of the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program will any steps be taken that will represent a threat to Russian security. The NATO bloc will not be expanded to the detriment of the interests and security of Russia. In other words, states will not be accepted into this organization -- at least not in haste. By no means all these states have assessed the idea of partnership and by no means all of them have approached the idea of partnership from the point of view of establishing European security as a whole. The threat arose of the creation of a kind of cordon sanitaire close to the borders of Russia. We categorically, very toughly and firmly opposed such a turn of events and the United States and the NATO leadership have heeded our stance and taken account of it. And now, what is at issue -- at the level of political cooperation, at the level of expanding economic ties, at the level of developing military technical cooperation -- is the possibility of various states joining this program over a very prolonged period, as they become ready to do so. The specific mechanisms for the implementation of this program still have to be devised in detail -- and this is being done both in NATO and the United States and in our country. It is premature to talk of any state implementing it. Russia is ready, in principle, for cooperation and partnership, even more so for the sake of peace. We are working to strengthen security and peace. On what principles? If we are talking of partnership, then on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, respect for one another and on no other principles. [end recording]
