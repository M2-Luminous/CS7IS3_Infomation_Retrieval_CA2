FR941227-2-00125 FR941227-2-00087 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;35121; File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;29, SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;45, SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;20] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc., National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Rule Changes Relating to the Exchanges' and Association's Rules Regarding Shareholder Voting Rights December 19, 1994. I. Introduction On June 2, August 5 and 10, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), respectively, 1 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 2 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 3 proposed rule changes that would amend their rules governing the voting rights of shareholders of common stock listed on the NYSE or Amex, or in the case of the NASD, included in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (``Nasdaq'') System, in order to establish a minimum voting rights policy (``Policy''). 1 The NYSE and Amex are collectively referred to herein as the ``Exchanges.'' 2 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1994). 3 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). In addition, on July 11, 1994, and August 8, 1994, the NYSE filed with the Commission Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, to its proposed rule change. Amendment No. 1 modifies the NYSE provision regarding the issuance of non-voting stock and is discussed in more detail below. 4 Amendment No. 2 is largely technical, and resulted in minor changes in the text of its new rule. 5 4 See Amendment No. 1 to SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;20. 5 See letter from Micheal Simon, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, Counsel to the NYSE, to Amy Bilbija, Attorney, SEC, dated August 5, 1994. The proposed rule changes were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34518 (August 11, 1994), 59 FR 42614 (August 18, 1994) (``Proposing Release''). II. Background In 1988, the Commission adopted Rule 19c&hyph;4, the Shareholder Disenfranchisement Rule, in response to concerns that had been raised regarding the practice by some companies of restricting the voting rights of existing shareholders through the issuance of shares with multiple, low or no voting rights. 6 Generally, Rule 19c&hyph;4 prohibited self regulatory organizations (``SROs'') from listing on an exchange or quoting on an interdealer quotation system an issuer's securities if the issuer had issued securities or taken other corporate action that had the effect of nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the voting rights of existing common shareholders. Rule 19c&hyph;4 also specified certain transactions that were deemed non-disenfranchising to existing shareholders. In 1990, in Business Roundtable v. SEC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the Commission's rule on grounds that the basis on which the Commission had adopted the rule was beyond the scope of the Commission's regulatory authority. 7 The court, however, did not address other statutory provisions on which the Commission had not relied, but that might provide a basis for promulgating similar regulation. 6 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25891 (July 7, 1988), 53 FR 26376. 7 The Business Roundtable v. SEC, 905 F.2d 406 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Since Business Roundtable, market participants, the Commission, and Congress have encouraged the exchanges and the NASD to formulate their own listing standards regarding shareholder voting rights. Most recently, Commission Chairman Levitt encouraged establishment of a minimum voting rights policy. The NYSE, NASD, and Amex have developed such a Policy and now seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Although based upon the similar in many respects to former SEC Rule 19c&hyph;4, the Policy is more flexible and seeks to accommodate shareholder protection concerns with the needs and changing circumstances of capital markets and issuers. 8 8 In addition, each SRO has proposed to supplement its rule with interpretations, commentaries, or policy statements in its respective proposals.
