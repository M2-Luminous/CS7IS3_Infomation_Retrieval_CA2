They studied ways and means of restoring security especially in Bujumbura in order to stop massacres, balkanization of suburbs, looting, and arson. They decided on a number of measures. First, the entire population is asked to keep peace throughout the country and not to allow themselves to be influenced by the situation in the various zones of the Bujumbura mayorship in order to prevent trouble erupting upcountry. Second, from now on the Gendarmerie in cooperation with the (?administration) must ensure the security in the suburbs, markets, on the roads, and in other important public places. Third, the officials of the gendarmerie and the army must provide the men and necessary means to apprehend whoever perturbs the security and who is in illegal possession of arms. Fourth, the security forces must avail themselves rapidly anywhere they hear gunfire and must proceed immediately with the arrest of the culprits and the search of houses in the area of the disturbance. Finally, any person arrested, no matter what his function may be, will have to be brought before the judicial organs.
