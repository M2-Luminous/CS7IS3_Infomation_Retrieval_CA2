Recalling that the United States has turned South Korea into a nuclear depot filled with mass destruction weapons including more than 1,000 nuclear weapons, grossly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, the appeal said: "The DPRK's proposal for negotiation to replace the nominal Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement and establish a new peace- keeping arrangement is a most fair measure for removing the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States and realising negotiation." Expressing the hope that DPRK-USA negotiation would be realized in a short time and measures be taken for bringing a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula where the situation has reached the brink of war, the appeal urged the U.S. Government to substantially contribute to world peace.
