However, as the U.S. forces have asserted, the plan is being considered on the condition that Japan bear the cost for transferring troops from Okinawa to Shizuoka. Under the current Japanese-U.S. status of forces agreement, it is impossible for Japan to give direct support to the U.S. forces in transferring combat troops. The United States, however, is calling for the conclusion of a new, special agreement, thus indicating its strong desire to remove the functions of the training area to another site. Lieutenant General Henry C. Stackpole, who commands all U.S. Marine deployed in the Pacific, recently met with Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota, who is currently on a visit to the United States. He clearly said to the governor: "Although it is difficult to abolish everything, military exercises on Okinawa will be reduced in number as early as next year." Stackpole made the remark prior to the start of negotiations between Tokyo and Washington on the costs for transferring troops. However, he was not clear about whether what he said implied his expectation that Japan and the United States would reach an agreement next year on the removal of the firing range area to another site or that he just meant a decrease in the number of live shell-firing exercises. It was Lt. Gen. Stackpole who first proposed the plan to transfer the functions of the training area on Okinawa to Higashifuji. He disclosed this as his private plan at a news conference held after his speech in Naha in March of last year. At a later date (in July of last year), he granted an interview to the OKINAWA TIMES at Camp Smith in Hawaii, which is the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command. During the interview, he said: "We plan to transfer troops by air and to transport weapons by sea for live shell-firing exercises to be conducted at Higashifuji for two weeks to six months. We intend to ask the Japanese Government to bear the expenses." The U.S. Marine Corps calculates that the cost of one transfer is approximately $1 million (about 100 million yen). There are U.S.-owned barracks in the Higashifuji Training Area, so technically speaking, it is not difficult to carry out exercises there. Thus, compliance by the Japanese Government with the U.S. call to bear the costs holds the key to removing the functions of the firing range area on Okinawa to another site. It is predicted that citizens living near the Higashifuji Training Area will oppose firing practices there. The government is being urged to decide on whether it should agree to bear the costs, and on how it should deal with the citizens near Higashifuji. U.S. military bases on Okinawa have become larger in size through the U.S. occupation of the island and forcible land expropriation. There is an opinion in Okinawa that the government's active participation is imperative to resolving the bases issue, which has remained unsolved for half a century since the end of the Pacific war. Meanwhile, a difficult task remains undone -- coordinating the opinions of Okinawans to make progress on the bases issue.
