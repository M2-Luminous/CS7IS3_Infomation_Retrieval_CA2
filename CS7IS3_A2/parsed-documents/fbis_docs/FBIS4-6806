According to MEDIA INDONESIA, we have just implemented rules on minimum wages, but our view of welfare remains very unclear and confusing because the minimum wages are considered a maximum return. The daily PELITA noted that some disturbing rumors were circulating in Jakarta simultaneously. In this connection, PELITA says the rumors about rioting in Jakarta should make us realize the sensitivity of the matter, because it has exposed other basic problems that should be resolved. Meanwhile, the daily REPUBLIKA says the Jakarta rumors pertained not only to rioting but also to a dollar rush. According to REPUBLIKA, it would be disturbing if citizens were provoked by various monetary rumors. Experience shows that a public panic would lead to a negative monetary situation. Such an unwarranted panic should be prevented. Of course, it will be insufficent for the government to simply give a vague clarification because this will again provoke citizens to be speculative.
