Published today following extensive consultation, the Programme is intended to meet the UK's commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Rio in 1992. More than 160 countries have signed the Convention; over 50 have now ratified it, and it will come into force on 21 March. Britain is one of the first to publish a detailed programme of measures to show how it will implement the Convention's requirements. Since signing the Convention at the Earth Summit in Rio, the Prime Minister has taken a lead in seeking to persuade other leading countries to implement it as speedily as possible. In his foreword to the Programme, the Prime Minister says: "In order to help encourage a prompt start to action, I pledged at the time that the UK would produce a programme of measures to implement the Convention's commitments as quickly as possible. This programme fulfils that pledge." Mr. Major stresses: "The threat of climate change cannot be tackled by any one country or group of countries in isolation; it requires a global response. The Convention we signed at Rio represents an important first step towards providing the framework for such a response.'' "At the same time, the measures required to tackle the problem cannot simply be decreed by governments; they depend on decisions and actions taken by all individual citizens in their daily lives. For this reason, this Programme was drawn up after widespread consultation within the United Kingdom. It seeks to harness the efforts of all sectors of our society and the participation of all our people in meeting the challenge for the sake of future generations." The Convention places a number of obligations on countries. Chief among these for developed countries is a commitment to take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000. Britain is the first country in the world to demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this for each of the three main greenhouse gases. For carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, the Programme is designed to achieve savings equivalent to 10 million tonnes of carbon (6 percent) against projected emissions in 2000. This should ensure a return to 1990 levels. It encompasses a wide variety of measures, (detailed in the attached table). For the other main greenhouse gases, the programme in fact envisages reducing emissions by 2000: by 10 percent for methane, by 75 percent for nitrous oxide, as well as substantial reductions for other, less significant greenhouse gases. Overall, taking account of the relative importance of each gas, the Programme should achieve a reduction equivalent to some 5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the UK by the year 2000. The Programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out some of the longer term options for action that may need to be considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and the further development of the Convention. It emphasises that: "As we enter the next Century, new and difficult choices may have to be made if we are to achieve a sustainable future. We will need to find ways of breaking the link between economic development and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases." In the transport sector in particular, "to have any major impact on projected trends, measures would be required that would change current patterns of transport use. People may not always be able to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as before .. Individuals will have to reconcile their desire for travel with their desire to protect the environment for future generations." A copy of the Programme's summary is attached. Note to Editors The Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by over 150 countries at the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. It will come into force on 21 March, 3 months after 50 countries have ratified (that is, agreed to be bound by its obligations). The UK ratified on 8 December 1993 (DOE Press Release 832 of 3 December). The Convention sets out a framework for an international approach to tackling the problem of global warming. It requires developed country Parties to: -- take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 -- provide assistance to developing countries. All Parties are bound by other obligations on compiling inventories of emissions, on producing and publishing national programmes of measures to limit emissions, on promoting research and public education about climate change. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. On current projections, the Convention commitment means finding savings in UK CO2 emissions equivalent to some 10 million tonnes of carbon. The Government conducted a major consultation exercise earlier this year on the options for achieving this reduction. In July, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the Government's proposals, subject to finalisation of some aspects of the package (DOE press release 507 of 26 July 1992). The package was completed with the announcement in the Budget on 30 November that petrol and other road fuel duties were to be increased by a further 3 pence per litre (8-10 percent) immediately, and with increases in future years averaging at least 5 percent above the rate of inflation.
