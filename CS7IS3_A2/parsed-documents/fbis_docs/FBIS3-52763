Gunmen believed to be from the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) dragged out Kanagaratnam Jeevaratnam from his home in eastern Sittandy late Tuesday, shot him dead and dumped his body in the town, officials said. "There was also a note by the side (of the body) warning that others who try to contest will also get the same treatment," a local official in the east said, adding it was "definitely" the work of the LTTE. Jeevaratnam was planning to stand as an independent candidate in the local government elections due to be held shortly. However, exact dates of balloting have not yet been announced. Nominations for the local government polls were being received from Wednesday in the eastern districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara and northern Vavuniya. Nominations close on January 12. The LTTE has called on Tamil parties to boycott the polls and had put up posters in the east, threatening those who participated in the polls with death. Since the parliamentary elections of February 1989, there has been no balloting in the northeast due to the ongoing war between government troops and LTTE guerrillas. The LTTE is fighting for a separate state in the northeast for Sri Lanka's two million minority Tamils who are concentrated in the region. Thousands have died in the LTTE-led independence campaign.
