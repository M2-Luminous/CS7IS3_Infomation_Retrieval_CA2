Dr. al-Hadi explained in a press statement to SUNA that ownership of all the said establishments went to Sudan Government when the country became independent from the condominium rule. He underlined that some houses had been rented to Egyptians in accordance with lease contracts which had nothing to do with any other agreement, adding that terms of these contracts expired, therefore the owner of these houses and buildings -- state of Khartoum -- noticed the tenants to evacuate them in compliance with the legal procedure. Dr. al-Hadi said it is sorrowful that the Egyptian authorities escalated the issue of evacuating the rented establishments to the standard of affecting the bilateral relations between Sudan and Egypt. [passage omitted] He also said that failure of the Egyptian minister to fulfil his promise of visiting Sudan on the dates he fixed proved lack of the Egyptian Government's credibility toward purification of climate. He pointed out that contrary to their pretentions, the Egyptian authorities proved to be not serious for the unity of the Sudanese territories when they continued allowing the outlaws movement to operate from Cairo and providing it with moral support. [passage omitted] Dr. al-Hadi added that the spirit of the Egyptian authorities in dealing with Sudan was reflecting its internal crisis.
