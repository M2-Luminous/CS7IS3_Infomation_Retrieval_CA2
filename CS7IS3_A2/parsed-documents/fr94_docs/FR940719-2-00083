FR940719-2-00083 FR940719-2-00052 A. Definitions and Measurement There is no consensus on how disability among children should be defined and measured for purposes of determining prevalence in the population or for establishing eligibility for disability-related benefits and services. For example, studies might address these questions: What are the research and programmatic implications of alternative disability definitions and measures (including functional definitions, such as those used for adults) for different policy purposes? How should such measures treat the different developmental stages of children from infancy through adolescence? What is the estimated impact of using alternative definitions of eligibility on program participation under cash assistance programs (e.g., SSI), health-related programs (e.g., Medicaid), education programs (e.g. Parts B and H), or other Federal disability programs? B. Demographic and Socio-Economic Characteristics National survey data have yielded little information on the prevalence of disability among children, particularly as it may signal a need for benefits or services. Within this issue area, the following types of questions are pertinent: What trends characterize disability in children at various developmental stages? Is disability in children likely to increase or decrease over the next 10 years, 20 years and beyond? To what extent are socio-economic, racial, or ethnic factors predictors of disability and or the impact of disability on the child and his or her family? How does disability status change during the course of childhood? What are the rates of such change? Does disability status change when children become adults? What are potential implications for program eligibility and service use? C. Service Use, Expenditures, and Effectiveness A principal policy concern of government at all levels is the effective and efficient allocation of resources to maximize the quality of life and potential of children with disabilities. Little information is available however on what services children with disabilities need or use, how much they cost, and on their effectiveness. For example: What patterns of acute care; transitional, rehabilitative, and supportive service use and expenditures characterize children with disabilities at different stages of their development? How do service use and expenditure patterns vary by condition and type of disability, level of functioning, socio-economic status, family structure, insurance coverage, service availability, and program participation? What outcome measures are useful for evaluating short- or long-term cost-effectiveness of health, education, and supportive services for children with disabilities? What is the evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of service interventions (health related, educational, and supportive services) on outcomes for children with disabilities? How does this vary according to the stages of a child's development, by condition, level of functioning, socio-economic status, by disability? D. Private Costs of Care A major policy concern is the level of out-of-pocket costs incurred by families to raise children with disabilities as compared to children without disabilities. Some evidence suggests that costs can vary greatly for children with identical diagnoses depending on families' living situations, the severity of the disability, and whether a child is institutionalized or receiving care at home. The following types of questions are illustrative: What are the extra out-of-pocket costs associated with raising children with disabilities relative to the costs of care for children without disabilities, i.e., child care, respite care, transportation, supplementary educational services, physical accommodations and assistive technology, specialized equipment, home care, therapeutic services, general supplementary services, medical and pharmaceutical expenses, and the opportunity costs of reduced parental labor force participation? Are there other private costs? How do estimated costs vary by the following classifications: Type of disability; severity of disability; family income; age, gender, race; institutionalization vs. non-institutionalization; SSI/non-SSI participation; coverage by Medicaid, private health insurance, or no insurance. What are the cost differences for children with disabilities on SSI, children with disabilities not on SSI, and children without disabilities? What are estimated total per capita costs including both private and public expenditures?
