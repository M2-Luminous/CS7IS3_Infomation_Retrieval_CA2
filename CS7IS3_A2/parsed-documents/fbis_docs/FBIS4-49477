We can all live with public relations disasters, but it is more difficult to live with the underlying cause of the problem. There are no prizes for identifying the source of this problem. It lies in the paralysis of leadership which afflicts China as the leaders of the Communist Party mount their morbid deathbed watch over paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In these circumstances no one aspiring to high office in China dares put a toe out of place. They are all waiting and watching to see what will happen in the post-Deng era. Not surprisingly, Lu Ping is also affected by this climate of uncertainty and probably assumes that a low profile is the only profile worth adopting. Chinese bureaucrats are rarely punished for doing nothing, but any positive action carries the risk of retribution. Were Lu to take the relatively bold step of publicly restoring relations with Governor Chris Patten, he may well expose himself to all manner of criticism. Far safer is the option of never venturing beyond the walls of Chinese-owned premises and never meeting anyone likely to say anything critical about Chinese government policy. We have a sneaking suspicion this must be extremely frustrating for an intelligent man like Lu Ping, who is well aware of the limitations of his current position but is seemingly incapable of doing anything about it. It is too much to expect Lu to suddenly perform an about-face and trot along to Government House for tea, biscuits and a chat with the Governor. Even less likely is the prospect of a quick yum cha [tea and dim sum] with Martin Lee and his fellow democrats. Yet there is an opportunity to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Lu can use his presence in Hong Kong to work behind the scenes and give a much-needed kick up the backside to the many matters stuck in the logjam of stalled Sino-British negotiations. Where to start? There is so much to be done. Maybe it would be best to focus on the obvious. Shrieking out loud is the need for an agreement on financing for the new airport. This could literally be settled in a day of talks, given goodwill on both sides and bearing in mind the issue has been so comprehensively discussed. Neither side has an excuse for holding out for more information. Then there is the equally pressing matter of the ninth container terminal which appears to have retreated entirely from the public view. Also on the wish list of things which need to be done urgently are arrangements for the future of the civil service. There is nothing so demoralising as uncertainty. So, if the Special Administrative Region wishes to inherit a demoralised civil service, they are doing everything in their power to guarantee such an eventuality. Uncertainty also hangs heavily over the future of the legal system, given the lack of agreement on the formation of the Court of Final Appeal. Everyone says Hong Kong's legal system underpins the stability of our society. This, then, is clearly a matter of some importance and should not be allowed to fester. Aside from specific things which need to be done, the very least Lu can do is ensure the orderly resumption of regular meetings between representatives of the Chinese and British governments. The brutal fact of the matter is that for the past five years these meetings have been erratic and largely unproductive. In the unlikely event that Lu could secure progress on all these fronts, he would be doing no more than ensuring the progress of business as usual. In other words, these are modest aspirations, delivered in circumstances where even modest expectations remain unfulfilled. Patten, for his part, has something important to contribute to the process of removing the logjam. He should immediately lift the ban on civil servants having dealings with China's Preliminary Working Committee. This may well be emerging as a pale imitation of a shadow government and may also be designed to undermine the authority of the current administration, but it is a reality in Hong Kong's emerging power structure. No harm can be done by recognising this and providing its members with full access to the civil service. Once the ban is removed China will be deprived of yet another excuse for not re-establishing normal relations with the Hong Kong government. Waiting two years before returning to Hong Kong, Lu Ping has only himself to blame for creating exaggerated expectations of what his visit can achieve. Were he to be a regular visitor to the territory, his presence would cause less of a stir. It would be so easy to throw away every opportunity to make progress on the arrangements for Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese sovereignty. It would come as more than just a pleasant surprise if the temptation to throw away yet another opportunity was resisted.
