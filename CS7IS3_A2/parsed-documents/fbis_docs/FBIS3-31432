It is not tolerable, the communique stresses, that industrial or public units should be attacked by gangs of so-called miners who are led by Miron Cosma, while those units are left unprotected by personnel belonging to the Ministry of the Interior. In that sense we are addressing an appeal to the ministry in question calling for it to carry out its duty with respect to those who are violating the laws of the country. If no such steps are taken within the next 10 hours, the miners belonging to the Salvamin Union will take over the task of restore order to Targu Jiu, regardless of the labor conflict currently taking place there, concludes the communique signed by the chairman of the Salvamin Union, Viorel Teleleteu.
