FR940705-0-00033 FR940705-0-00002 (iv) Measurement of the attenuation must be conducted at the wavelength specified for application and must be expressed in decibels per kilometer. (v) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for single mode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. If the ship length of cable is less than one kilometer, the attenuation values measured on longer lengths of cable (characterization length of cable) before cutting to the ship lengths of cable may be applied to the ship lengths. (vi) For dispersion-unshifted fiber the zero dispersion wavelength must be between 1300 and 1322 nanometers, and the value of the dispersion slope at the zero-dispersion wavelength must not be greater than 0.092 picosecond per nanometer squared times kilometer (ps/(nm 2 km) when measured in accordance with either: (A) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;168A; (B) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;169A; or (C) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;175A. (vii) For dispersion-shifted fiber, the dispersion over the wavelength range between 1525 and 1575 nanometers must not exceed 3.5 picosecond per nanometer times kilometer (ps/(nm 2 km)) and must have a maximum dispersion slope of 0.095 ps/(nm 2 km) at the zero dispersion wavelength when measured in accordance with any one of the test procedures specified in paragraph (p)(1)(vi) of this section. (viii) The cut off wavelength of the dispersion-unshifted and the dispersion-shifted fibers in a cable must be less than 1260 nanometers when measured in accordance with EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;170. (2) The optical performance of the multimode fibers must be in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (p)(2)(i) through (p)(2)(vi) of this section. (i) The attenuation values of the 50/125 and 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fibers within the cable must not exceed 1.5 dB/km at 1300 nanometers when measured in accordance with either: (A) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;46A; (B) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;53A; or (C) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;61. (ii) Attenuation discontinuities in the fiber's length must not exceed 0.2 dB for both multimode fiber types at 1300 # 20 nanometers when measured in accordance with EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;59. (iii) Measurement of the attenuation must be conducted at the wavelength specified for application and must be expressed in decibels per kilometer. (iv) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for multimode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. If the ship length of cable is less than one kilometer, the attenuation values measured on longer lengths of cable (characterization length of cable) before cutting to the ship lengths of cable may be applied to the ship lengths. (v) The bandwidth of the multimode fibers at the ^3 dB optical power of the optical fibers within the cable must be within the limits prescribed in the purchase order.

(q) Mechanical requirements_ (1) Cable bend test. (i) All cables manufactured in accordance with the requirements of this section must be capable of meeting the following bend test without exhibiting an increase in fiber attenuation greater than 0.10 dB for single mode fibers and 0.40 dB for multimode fibers. (ii) Measure the attenuation of dispersion-unshifted single mode fibers at 1310 # 20 and 1550 # 20 nanometers, dispersion-shifted single mode fibers at 1550 # 20 nanometers and multimode fibers at 1300 20 nanometers.
