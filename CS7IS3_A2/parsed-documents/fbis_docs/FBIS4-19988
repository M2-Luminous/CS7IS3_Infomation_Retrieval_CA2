Their enemy is the Europe of Maastricht, and their cause is the Europe of Nations, a political movement formed to fight in June's European elections. They are a surprising mixture of bedfellows. Sir James Goldsmith -- Jimmy to his French friends -- is at the heart of the struggle. Having discarded dawn raids for environmental concerns, the former international financier is to stand as a candidate on the list put forward by L'Autre Europe, a French party formed to campaign in the European Parliament elections. Sir James is second on the Other Europe's list for France's European polls. Above him is the founder of the party, Mr Philippe de Villiers -- a viscount, a member of parliament and the suave French champion of the anti-Maastricht cause. Number three is Mr Charles de Gaulle, grandson of the general, and an existing member of the European Parliament. "My grandfather would never have stood for Maastricht," he says. "He would have fought to prevent the disappearance of France." Seated around them yesterday were Eurosceptics from 10 European countries; Mr Bill Cash, the Tory MP, and Lord Stoddart the Labour peer rubbed shoulders with Maastricht dissidents of the left and right of the political spectrum from Scandinavia, Austria, Germany and Spain. To launch their movement the representatives put their name to the Declaration of Paris -- a tract condemning what the signatories see as a dangerous trend to centralisation. Their aim is to infiltrate the European Parliament in Strasbourg, undermine the Maastricht Treaty, and prevent the "asphyxiation of Europe." "This debate transcends left and right," declares Sir James. "It is about the fight against a federal Europe and building a proper, democratic Europe. History shows that excesses of the centralisation of power unleash a reaction of centrifugal forces." But are Sir James and his allies not tilting at windmills? Has the principle of subsidiarity not pulled the rug from beneath their nationalist feet? "Subsidiarity has been so abused that it has become deeply polluted as an ideal. It should not be about determining the size and shape of cucumbers," he replies. As for the windmills: "Whether it is quixotic or not, I won't change one word of what I believe." Despite being dismissed in France by the ruling RPR-UDF coalition and the opposition Socialist party, Sir James and Mr de Villiers are confident of support. Sir James says an audience of 1,200 showed up at Angers to hear the views of L'Autre Europe; 2,000 came to Nantes. "We will win a substantial vote," says Mr de Villiers. How substantial, he is reluctant to predict. "It is at the end of the fair that one counts the cowpats," he says, citing a rural French proverb.
