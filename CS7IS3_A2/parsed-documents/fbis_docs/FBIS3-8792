Our Bratislava correspondent, Renata Havranova, reports in detail: [Havranova] Listeners who wanted to listen to a Radio Free Europe [RFE] newscast this morning could not find it on the airwaves. Former Minister Hofbauer has implemented his threat, made after the editors of this radio station were savagely attacked outside the president's office, and withdrew the frequency of Radio Free Europe. This was confirmed to me this morning in a telephone conversation with (Otto Machac), administrator of the Bratislava Office of RFE. He said he had been warned of disconnection as early as Monday, but no one had officially informed him until now. Otto Machac added that the United States, as well as the Munich leadership of RFE, will protest against this step. The behavior of the outgoing government is very strange. Roman Kovac confirmed to journalists last night that personnel purges are continuing at the ministries, privatization is under way, and certain property is being written off. According to Roman Kovac, the first step of the new government, which has been complete since last night, will be to open investigations into these unlawful steps on the part of former Prime Minister Meciar and the other members of the former government.
