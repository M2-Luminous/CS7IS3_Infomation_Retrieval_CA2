He called on fellow European leaders to approve a five-point plan to combat crime within the EC and foreshadowed plans for a new drive against drugs in British schools this autumn. It would be aimed at changing youth culture and reducing the availability and acceptability of drugs. Mr Major said tackling rising crime would be one way in which the EC could demonstrate that it was addressing the issues which affected its citizens. He said the low turn-out in the elections to the European Parliament earlier this month had shown there was widespread apathy towards the EC. "People aren't at the roadside cheering it on. Many don't see it as being relevant in their lives. We must bring European policies closer to the people." Quoting what he described as "sobering statistIcs," Mr Major said that enough cocaine had been seized in the EC so far this year to provide 24 million individual doses. The drugs were worth an estimated 840 billion pounds. He said the British Government would be publishing a new national drugs strategy in the autumn. One of its main objectives would be to counter drug abuse in schools and look at the link between drug use and crime. Europe needed a clear action plan across the Community to tackle drug trafficking and protect young people. It must also combat fraud against the EC, which amounted to robbing the taxpayers of huge sums. A recent investigation had uncovered fraudulent claims of more than 65 million pounds for nonexistent stocks of wheat. All 12 EC countries needed effective national laws against fraud, which should be made "criminal, imprisonable and extraditable." Mr Major said the summit should agree to: All EC countries ratifying by October a convention setting up Europol, the basis of a Europe-wide police force dealing with drugs, organised crime and fraud. It would be based in The Hague. Europol's powers should be wide, to include an attack on organised crime. The countries of central and eastern Europe should be involved in joint measures against crime. The German government, which takes over the EC presidency on July 1, should call a conference on drugs and organised crime. The EC should reach agreement on national criminal laws against fraud by the end of this year. Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured Mr Major that one of the priorities of the German presidency would be combating drugs. Earlier, the EC leaders and Mr Boris Yeltsin signed a partnership and co-operation agreement paving the way for closer trading links between Russia and the Community. This, the first such deal Russia has signed with any of its trading partners, came two days after it agreed to a Partnership for Peace deal with NATO. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Trade Commissioner, described the latest agreement as a "quantum leap" in Russia's relationship with Europe. Leaders of the four countries which have agreed to join the EC next year -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway -- signed the formal Instrument of Accession, which admits them to the Community. Austria has endorsed that decision in a referendum, but the other three still have to win the backing of their people.
