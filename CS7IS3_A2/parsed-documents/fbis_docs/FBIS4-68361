Typical temporary trailers made of planks, void of conveniences--God knows how many people stuck inside... It seemed to me then that unless the refugee problem were resolved in the immediate future, a quick explosion would be unavoidable--you cannot live that way. Now that a year has passed, the number of temporary trailers has multiplied. There are 11 refugee settlements in Nazran alone, with 100 families in each. You can live months with the most loving relatives, the most cordial and hospitable hosts, but not for a year and a half--with a mob of kids (the way the Ingush see it, a four-child family is a small family) and other people hanging on. And all those who have not yet moved into a temporary trailer look into your eyes ingratiatingly when they run into you: "Will you be meeting with our leadership? Could you not help me out--to speed up the time I have to wait in line for a trailer?" While the settlements grow one by one--enclosed areas densely covered with trailers and two or three wooden outhouses. Crowded and Pinched Gas and electricity lines have been laid to the settlements. Now and then the light goes out due to overloads--heating devices are hooked up everywhere and some people have obtained old television sets from relatives, though the power supply is intended only to energize room light bulbs... There is yet another stinging refugee problem--sickness. Due to the terrible population density, lack of normal hygiene conditions, and simply the moral and physical shock of a year and a half ago, epidemics flare up and spread rapidly in the refugee camps. The shortage of medicines is felt more acutely in this republic than on the whole across Russia. Medical institutions designed to treat a certain number of patients are located in areas where the population has almost doubled since November 1992. The settlements are attached to nourishment facilities which provide food free of charge once per day. The rest comes from what relatives dish out--one is not going to live it up on the Russian allowance of R1,800 per month. There are also "children's" allowances and unemployment compensation. Without any doubt, there is not enough money to live on. And only a certain few specialists manage to find work in Ingushetia. It is not only the residents of Prigorodnyy Rayon that the war has doomed to unemployment. From a time long ago, ever since they returned from Kazakhstan, it was so ordered that the residents of Nazran and the large and small villages would travel to work every day in Vladikavkaz, the capital of Northern Ossetia (the Ingush prefer to use the Soviet name Ordzhonikidze, but most often simply call it the city), or--which was considered less prestigious--to the Chechen city of Groznyy. Today there is no work in Groznyy even for its own residents, and the Ingush are prohibited from going to Vladikavkaz. It turns out that the newly formed republic has collected tens of thousands of active, able-bodied people without normal living quarters, without the means of existence, without prospects to quickly find work. The bulk of the refugees are rural people who have become accustomed to their own gardens and orchards, their own livestock, their own housekeeping. Tens of thousands of people who day after day without exception fed livestock, milked, plowed, sowed, fished, and gathered the harvest--for a year and a half now have been lying about with nothing to do, half starving for days on end. Just a Stone's Throw From Home Human beings become accustomed to everything. No matter how many refugees there are in this unfortunate country, adaptations and accommodations are made. For these people deported from Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon, however, their own homes are just a few dozen kilometers from their present location. You could get into the car of any relative. No need to load any things--you left with just what you had on you, and you would be home in half an hour. There, at home, war has not been seen for a year and a half. Your garden sits there unsown. Your neighbors have your cow, if it is still alive, and they would probably return it to you. How do you resign yourself to the fact that situated between you and your own home is the Russian Army? How do you tell yourself that you will go home no more and might as well get settled in your new location, where no one needs you? The Ingush is accustomed to putting everything into his home. About 30 percent of the adult male Ingush population have engaged in so-called "moonlighting." In Vladikavkaz, in Groznyy, and in Russia, the Ingush have been hired to perform the most menial daytime labor. But at least they received decent pay for it, at least they had the opportunity to build themselves a house. Without his own home, a man is not a man. It is not befitting for him to marry, let alone start a family. The most important thing sustaining the Ingush Republic today, the thing that is on everyone's lips--from politicians to kolkhoz workers, from refugees to inhabitants as local as can be--is the return of those deported. A change has taken place in the overall national concept. Whereas before, the main idea uniting the Ingush was the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon, today the main thing is the return of the refugees. It is not that the Ingush are prepared to reconcile themselves to the fact that Prigorodnyy will remain within Northern Ossetia. It is simply that this question has been shifted to the background for the time being as compared with that of the deportees. This is without any doubt due to the personal efforts of President Ruslan Aushev, who declared that over the period of moratorium with respect to territorial redistribution declared by Russia (until the end of 1995), Ingushetia would not raise the issue of Prigorodnyy Rayon. The Other Side of the Terek Any modern political figure would envy Aushev's prestige in the republic. In the year of his presidency he has been able to accomplish what until quite recently was considered impossible--to announce the rejection of any claim to the right bank of Vladikavkaz and demonstrably lay the foundation of a new future for the capital of Ingushetia. The history of the right bank issue is as follows. In 1924, when the Ingush Autonomous Oblast emerged, Vladikavkaz became the dual capital of Ossetia and Ingushetia. In 1934, the Ingush Autonomous Oblast was merged with the Chechen Autonomous Oblast, Groznyy was declared the capital of Checheno-Ingushetia, and Vladikavkaz (then Ordzhonikidze) was given to Ossetia. When in 1991 the Law on Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples was issued with its famous Article 6 providing for territorial recovery, the Ingush declared that the repression of their people began not in 1944, the year of deportation, but in 1934. The inference drawn here was that the Ingush Republic should be restored to its 1924-1934 borders, i.e., that half of Vladikavkaz be ceded to the Ingush. This concept was very quickly assimilated by the Ingush masses--the point being that the Ingush did not simply lack their own capital, they virtually lacked a city of their own. Nazran is essentially a city-type settlement. It has no institutions of higher education, no scientific research institutes, no major enterprises. A tremendous part of the Ingush people was associated with Vladikavkaz, where they went to earn a living and to market far more frequently than to Groznyy. It would be difficult to imagine the future republic without this city. It is precisely for this reason that people stubbornly refused to hear the voice of a few Ingush politicians with common sense who tried to warn that an undertaking with Vladikavkaz was pure adventurism which could only impede efforts to get back Prigorodnyy Rayon. And so it came about that Ingush representatives failed to approve, and thereby prevented, signing of the edict already drawn up on the reassignment of jurisdiction of Prigorodnyy Rayon only because this left the whole of Vladikavkaz within Northern Ossetia. In addition, they did not build a capital of their own out of useless expectations of getting Vladikavkaz. They did not work to create republic industry, a system of education, public health care, or an infrastructure. Ruslan and His Team In addition to everything else, Aushev's decision marked a transition to real state structuring. Aushev knew what he was doing when he moved toward the universal presidential elections. One year ago his only capital in Ingushetia was popular recognition and trust. His main ties and contacts remained in Russia. Relying on this trust, he has today been able to create a political structure comprised of people loyal to him, a structure fairly strong on the local scale. The key positions in Ingushetia are occupied by pro-Aushev Afghanistan war veterans--people whose reliability the president need not doubt and with whom he can truly effect teamwork. The clearest example of this--though far from the only one--is that of Vice President Boris Agapov, not even Ingush in nationality but Aushev's fellow comrade in the military. The rapid movement along the path of turning the Ingush Republic from myth into reality led to an almost equally rapid movement of previous national leaders now living and working in Groznyy to the periphery of political life. Groznyy is today an ever more alien center, the capital of a different republic, and the Ingush intelligentsia of Groznyy have correspondingly less and less influence on the public opinion of the Nazran Ingush. According to the Ingush Constitution, all heads of administration, from top to bottom, rayon to village, are appointed by the president. Here too Aushev has been actively replacing leaders, preferring to appoint people who are at least "his own"--tested and reliable, if not from among local residents. It cannot be said that replacement of the entire political and economic elite has been effected without any pain. Protests, complaints, and petitions requesting that the former leader be restored have assumed such a large scale that Aushev was forced to respond to them with the military straightforwardness that is characteristic of him. He issued a special edict warning of accountability for attempts to intercede on behalf of "notorious criminals." The Hotel and OMON All the same, neither the decision on Vladikavkaz nor the landslide flow of resignations has managed yet to temper the people's love for the president. He and his team remain completely effective. Changes made over the past year are even evident to the eye. Eternally dirty, ragged Nazran has quietly become cleaner and tidier, especially in its center. For the first time in the entire history of the Ingush, a hotel has appeared. This is no trifling matter, but rather a significant political act. Up until now, officials visiting the Ingush Republic were forced to stay over in Vladikavkaz. It is even more significant that state structures have begun buying up weapons from the populace. It is in fact a buy-up that is taking place and not a confiscation--which would be entirely unrealistic. In other words, actual efforts as stipulated by agreement with Northern Ossetia with respect to disarmament and disbandment of unlawful armed formations are underway. In addition, Aushev has managed to reduce criminal tension in the republic. It is being done with difficulty, in a far from faultless process at present, but the activity of OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment], the police, and the courts is being set on track. In this sense, the absence of roots in local tradition by the Aushev team works for the good. A state of emergency was maintained in the village of Troitskaya and OMON detachments stationed here by presidential edict for half a year. The OMON people are now gone, and the order which was restored is still generally present. Troitskaya is that very village from which the mass exodus of Russians began following the sadly well known pogrom of the spring of 1991. At the outset of 1991, 90 percent of the village population was Russian (mainly the descendants of Terek Cossacks). Today 11 percent of the populace is Russian. I travelled to Troitskaya immediately following the pogrom and again last year, and I can attest that local authorities not only did not force the Russians out--they tried in every way possible to halt their departure. But people continued to leave, frightened by the growth of banditry and crime against which they found themselves defenseless. (The Ingush also suffered from the ineffectiveness of law enforcement organs, but they very quickly engaged a system of familial and clan self-defense, while the Russians simply found themselves victimized by the hooligan lawlessness.) Now that protection is at least in some way restored, it would seem that there is no longer any reason to leave. However, the change in demographic interrelationship has already been so strong that in itself it seems to provoke resettlement. People accustomed all their lives to living in one cultural milieu found themselves in an entirely different world literally in the space of two years. Although relations with neighbors are good, as a rule, many of those who remain talk about the fact that they would like to move to where their relatives are. To the credit of the Aushev team on the highest and on local levels, leaderships understand full well that any and all measures must be taken to preserve the Russian community. First of all, all political speculation regarding oppression by Russians is undesirable for Ingushetia in its present state--after all, it is to the Russian authorities that the Aushev leadership is looking to obtain measures on refugee resettlement, and in the long term--measures to effect the rejurisdiction of Prigorodnyy Rayon. Secondly, there is simply the existence of national specialization. Who is going to work on a pig farm without Russians? Indeed, like doctors and teachers, Russian agricultural specialists are presently irreplaceable. In order to sustain the Russian community, it is necessary to augment it. Serious negotiations are underway and a delegation is being sent to Krasnodar Kray, to those who recently resettled. Aushev is proposing certain benefits for "returnees." At present just a few people have returned to Troitskaya--13 families in all. But the process is in fact underway. Of course, the refugee problem remains one of the main obstacles on this path. Conversation arises now and again: "Why must we go around persuading departed Russians to return when we have 60,000 people we do not know what to do with?" But official ideology and the mood of society are oriented on the idea that the refugees must be settled back to their origins immediately. Attacks Coming Not From Neighbors, but From Bandits To what degree are these hopes realistic? The Ossetian leadership is trying in every possible way to impede the return of Ingush refugees. However, some have returned in defiance of threats and prohibitions. Those with whom we managed to speak explain that their arrival has not elicited any "spontaneous protest" on the part of neighboring Ossetians. The danger confronting the Ingush comes from quite a different direction--at night, at any moment, armed people in speckled uniforms may appear (who knows whether they are OMON or Ossetian, the Guard--now renamed the Directorate for Defense of Economic Facilities, or simply bandits?) and begin firing at windows, setting fires, and raiding. Russian forces, of which there are 30,000 in the state of emergency zone, are in no position to protect residents from the bandits. In the view of the Ingush, they appear to manifest a rare helplessness. According to prescribed procedures, Ingush refugees who want to take a look at their home or take something from among their things which has miraculously remained intact must provide a statement of their intent beforehand, wait in line, and then move to the village in question in organized column formation, accompanied by Russian military personnel. But often the column is attacked and forced to return, sometimes assaulted and pelted with rocks. Under these conditions, soldiers not only fail to fire warning shots into the air--they also do not use gas, water, or whatever is available to put a halt to the hooliganism. So what are the Ingush counting on, since the Russian protective force is not working, or at least is not working in their favor? From all appearances they are counting on a change in the aims and sentiment of Russian leaders--from "pro-Ossetian" to "pro-Ingush." Judging from the recent session of the Federation Council, certain shifts are taking place in this direction, although not as rapidly as Aushev would like. The drama lies in the fact that the refugees must at least begin to resettle immediately.
