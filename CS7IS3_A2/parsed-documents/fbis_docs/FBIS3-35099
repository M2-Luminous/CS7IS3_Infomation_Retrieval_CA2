The move was prompted by a shift in the American policy towards South Asia and as a gesture to Benazir Bhutto's fledgling government. But what did Washington expect in return? Did it have any reason to think, for instance, that by resuming economic and military assistance barred by Pressler, the US would succeed in persuading Pakistan either to desist from fuelling terrorism in Kashmir or to roll back its nuclear-weapons programme? It is, in the final analysis, the administration's failure to give a reassuring reply to this crucial question at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South Asia that has led to the retention of the Pressler Amendment. Senator after Senator assailed the move to delete the Amendment from the Foreign Assistance Act as an instance of the Clinton administration's inept policy towards South Asia. None was taken in by State Department officials' apparently innocent plea that the idea was simply to remove a provision which was country-specific -- that is in relation to assistance to Pakistan. The proffered official explanation was that deletion of such a provision would make for greater flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy. This did not wash because the Senators maintained that removal of Pressler would be a contradiction of the government's professed non-proliferation goal in South Asia. While New Delhi is naturally relieved to find that the Congressional vigilance has helped scuttle a mischievous anti-Indian twist to US policy, there is no room for complacency. The heavily-funded Pakistani lobbies in Washington must be expected to continue their efforts with redoubled vigour to play mischief. It is still a long way to go and complex procedures to be completed before a final foreign assistance act emerges: These lobbies are unlikely to be disheartened by the outcome of the deliberations in the Senate Sub- committee because key aides in the White House have been found to be vulnerable to their machinations. The more important reason for India to be ever watchful is the new evidence that the so-called even-handed approach of the US in South Asia remains in fact heavily tilted in favour of Pakistan. In the past the US gave overriding importance to effective conduct of an anti-Soviet strategy in which Pakistan was a key element. It is no secret that Washington in return turned a Nelson's eye to Islamabad's nuclear weapons programme. But even in the absence of cold war compulsions, the US has not ceased going out of its way to placate Pakistan on one specious plea or the other, especially on the Kashmir issue. Whether the policy is marked by doublethink or confusion, the resulting threat to India's interests is obvious.
