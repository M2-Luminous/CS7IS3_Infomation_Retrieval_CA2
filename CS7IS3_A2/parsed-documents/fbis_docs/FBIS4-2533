Deputy Director [of the State General Administration of Taxation's Department of Indirect Taxes] Chen [Jie], in our previous talks, we have discussed issues relevant to value-added taxes, consumption taxes, and income taxes. Today we would like you to answer some questions relevant to special trades. [passage omitted] [Gao Feng, deputy director of the Policies and Regulations Department under the Ministry of Coal] In the past, enterprises paid a 3-percent product tax, which was the previous tax rate. Now that the product tax rate has been raised to 17 percent, the additional tax must be reflected in prices. Should we assume that this problem can only be solved by setting new prices? [Chen] This problem should be observed through the central authorities' price policy. First of all, we must understand that prices must not be changed. But how can problems caused by additional taxes be solved if prices cannot be changed? In most cases, the problems can be solved in two ways. First, while introducing the value-added taxes, the state has also adopted tax- cutting measures, such as exempting enterprises from paying the two funds [fund for major energy and communications development products and fund for budget regulation] and reducing enterprises' income taxes. The second solution rests with enterprises themselves. Enterprises should have more efficient management and they should tap their potential. While the majority of enterprises can cope, some enterprises have problems dealing with the higher taxes. The state has been studying ways to help these enterprises. [passage omitted] [Zheng Guangzhao, chief accountant of the Beijing Papermaking and Packaging Industrial Company] I remember that in 1987, the State Council encouraged enterprises to recycle renewable resources. The Ministry of Finance, the State Economic Commission, and the General Administration of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in those days also supported the policy by deducting or exempting these enterprises' tax payments. Because this preferential policy has not been specified in the new tax policy, these enterprises face the problem of having to pay higher taxes during the transitional period. Can you comment on this issue? [Chen] [word indistinct] invoice and [word indistinct] constitute the foundation of the new value-added taxes. If the paper you produce by recycling waste paper is tax-exempted when it is being marketed, then you are neither entitled to tax deductions nor to the use of a special invoice. And if your buyers cannot enjoy the deductions, then they may not want to buy paper from you and your sales will be affected. In the past, nobody was sure what new problems might be caused by the policy of giving preferential treatment to the comprehensive use of material resources. However, we have decided to carry out a serious follow-up study of this issue following the introduction of the new tax system. We believe that there will be a proper solution. [passage omitted] [Wei] Deputy Director Chen, some enterprises recently asked us some tax-related questions. I would like to mention two of the questions here. The first one is how are retail sales of paging equipment and cellular phones taxed? The other one is how are products made of grain -- like steamed stuffed buns and pastries -- taxed? [Chen] The way that retail sales of pagers and cellular phones are taxed is different from how retail food products are taxed. According to what we know, some pagers are now sold by the telecommunications bureau, and some are sold by stores on its behalf. Generally speaking, the prices of papers and cellular phones are made up of two parts: the prices of the pagers themselves and the prices charged by the telecommunications bureau. After a customer has purchased a pager, the telecommunications bureau has to provide the buyer the needed services, including labor services. As for cellular phones, some are also sold by the telecommunications bureau, and some are sold by retail stores. The prices of cellular phones, however, are different from pagers. Some prices are the prices of the phones themselves, and some prices also include telecommunications services to be provided in the future. This being the case, we have decided to impose business taxes on the prices of pagers or cellular phones sold by all units providing telecommunications services -- including the telecommunications bureau and other units engaging in the telecommunications business -- as well as service charges. The tax rate is 3 percent. The sales of pagers and cellular phones alone are subject to value-added taxes. When a retail store sells pagers or cellular phones on behalf of telecommunications units, the prices it charges are subject to value-added taxes, no matter whether or not labor services will be provided in the future. Of course, after this store has sold the equipment for the telecommunications units and delivered the money to them, we will not tax the telecommunications units for the money in question. As for the sales of commodities such as cakes, pastries, and candies, they are taxed like other commodities. When they are sold, their pretax prices should be multiplied by 17 percent, and then the taxes stated in the special invoices issued when they were purchased should be subtracted from the total.
