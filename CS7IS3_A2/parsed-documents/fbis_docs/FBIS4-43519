It is to be signed here next September, on the sidelines of the annual general conference of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The agreement is based on the principle that safety of nuclear plants is within the sole jurisdiction of the countries maintaining them, and it does not provide for any inspection mechanism to ensure required safety standards are met. The standards laid down by the conference relate to sites, construction plans, installation maintenance, control systems and measures to be taken in case of emergency.
