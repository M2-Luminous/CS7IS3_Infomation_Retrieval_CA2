Without satisfactory support for Norrland there will be no agreement and no referendum. "Without a satisfactory solution involving a recognition of the special problems of Norrland and special support for Norrland, there will be no agreement. We would then not have anything to vote on." So said Ulf Dinkelspiel yesterday in Brussels after a negotiating round in which the EU's ministers had given the thumbs-down to Norrbotten. Norrbotten is too rich to qualify for the Objective 1 support for the EU's poorest regions, the EU ministers declared. "I think that the situation is serious. But it is too early to talk about an out-and-out crisis, because we have agreed to continue the negotiations," said Ulf Dinkelspiel, who by his own admission "thumped the table pretty thoroughly" on the subject of regional policy. "They cannot have failed to see that I was in deadly earnest," he said. The EU side's message is that Norrbotten has so large a gross national product, GNP, per inhabitant that Objective 1 support is out of the question. Instead it takes the view that Sweden could aim for a solution that is based on two other regional objective classifications in the EU, the so-called Objective 2 and Objective 5b classifications. But Sweden's negotiators say no to this. "Objective 2 and Objective 5b are defined as support for regions in industrial decline and support for agricultural development and this does not properly cover the situation in northern Sweden," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. "For example, they do not cover the need for infrastructure investments in northern Sweden." At the meeting, the Swedish negotiators argued that northern Sweden has special problems that are overlooked by the GNP criteria the EU uses in its calculations. It is a question of a severe climate, sparse population, and great distances. They pointed out, for example, that the region, which receives Swedish support, covers an area that is 10 times the size of Belgium, but that has a population no bigger than that of the Belgian city of Liege. In a diplomatic offensive over the last few weeks, the Swedish negotiators have tried to hammer this message home to the EU side's negotiators. But if their message has -- in Ulf Dinkelspiel's words -- "not fallen wholly on stony ground," it has clearly not hit fully home. What Sweden wants is an "Objective 1-like solution" where the actual label used is not so important. One proposal for such a solution, a special Arctic regional fund, has been put forward by Germany and Greece, but so far it has been shot down by the other EU countries. But the tough stances voiced yesterday are merely the initial bids in the negotiations on regional policy. What will happen in the future remains to be seen. Yesterday's negotiations also touched on agriculture. Sweden's negotiators tabled demands that Sweden be allowed to continue to give special support to Norrland's farmers and that the EU should contribute to this over and above the agricultural support to disadvantaged regions already contained in the EU's rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel also voiced Sweden's dissatisfaction with the proposed milk and sugar quotas which have not yet been officially presented to Sweden.
