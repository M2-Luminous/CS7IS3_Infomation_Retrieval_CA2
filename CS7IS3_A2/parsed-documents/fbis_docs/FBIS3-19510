In Kohl's view, the economic situation is gradually improving. The "light at the end of the tunnel" will "have to be made bigger." Kohl pointed out that he regards more flexible working hours a key factor in increasing industry's competitiveness. In the talks the economy was represented by members of the Confederation of German Employer Associations (BDA), the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT), and the Federal Association of German Trade (ZDH). ZDH President Heribert Spaeth sees signs for the "coalition of reason" that has been demanded by the trade association becoming possible. It is beginning to form under the pressure of the present conditions. As examples for this development he mentioned that several tariff agreements contained the possibility of extending working hours or reducing them with a proportionate wage reduction, or of concluding zero wage rounds. Only a year ago this would have been unthinkable. BDA President Klaus Murmann expressed "respect" for the trade unions for achieving this. While Spaeth considered the government's action program to promote growth and employment as a "step in the right direction," Murmann once again made it clear that industry does not agree with the compromise achieved over nursing insurance. Yet, he agreed with the chancellor on the necessity of finding more flexible economic structures. The chancellor pointed out that the current crisis is not "a normal recession, but a deep structural crisis." He does not "see any reason to be pessimistic" and is confident that the existing problems can be solved. All efforts must be concentrated on creating new jobs by stimulating the economy. In this context, he spoke out clearly against further subsidies. The chancellor aims at lowering the public share from the existing 54 percent to 45 percent by the end of this decade. Above all, structures must be made more flexible. As an example he mentioned part-time jobs. While 34 percent of the working population in the Netherlands work part-time, in Germany the figure is only 15 percent. On Tuesday [15 March], the cabinet discussed ways of "drastically increasing" the number of such jobs in the public services. Kohl considers the tariff agreements in the chemical and metal industries to be examples for rethinking. Flexible working hours have much more weight in these agreements, which is decisive for the future competitiveness of German industry. Kohl said he wants to stick to the corporation tax reform. Referring to his position as Christian Democratic Union chairman, he added: "In our election campaign we will make very specific proposals for the next legislative period." Furthermore, the chancellor demanded "that the stupid animosities toward research be overcome" as well as "a climate that is friendly toward science and technology." Whether the recent increase in patent fees is sensible, needs to be discussed. Asked whether an increase in fuel tax, which was suggested by Finance Minister Theo Waigel recently, will actually take place, he said: "This is not my idea. You know who the head of government is." In Kohl's view, the stimulus for creating jobs in German industry must come from medium-sized companies. This motivation must be supported. It is not his aim to increase the number of employees in the public services any further, Kohl said.
