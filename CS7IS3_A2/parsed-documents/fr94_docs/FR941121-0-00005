FR941121-0-00005 FR941121-0-00001 Fifteen commenters, including two national trade associations, requested guidance regarding permissible synonyms for various types of accounts. For instance, whether credit unions could interchangeably use the term ``checking'' for ``share draft''; or the term ``certificate of deposit'' for ``term share.'' It is the opinion of the Board that the chief overriding factor to the use of synonyms is whether it is accurate and not misleading. The key consideration is whether a ``share account'' could be confused with being a ``deposit account,'' or vice versa. Generally, if a disclosure uses the correct legal term of the account once, and the synonym is accurate, the use of the synonym is permissible. For example, a disclosure stating that an account is a ``share draft'' account, that equates ``share draft'' with ``checking,'' which has a neutral (neither share not deposit) connotation will be permissible. However, it is never permissible to equate a share account with a deposit account. For example, it is impermissible to call a ``share certificate'' a ``certificate of deposit,'' though both legally are ``term share'' accounts for TISA and Part 707 purposes. Similarly, it is impermissible to refer to term share accounts as either ``time deposits'' or ``time accounts,'' which are terms with inaccurate and misleading meanings in the term share context of part 707. The correct use of synonyms is provided in comment 2(a)&hyph;5. (b) Advertisement Comment 2(b)&hyph;1 illustrates the scope of commercial messages considered to be advertisements. The FRB, as did NCUA, proposed that advertisements would not include direct oral discussions conducted in person regarding a specific account. Many FRB commenters urged the FRB to expand the interpretation to include telephone conversations, but the FRB declined. The FRB believes face-to-face discussions allow prospective customers to learn easily and quickly about basic terms of the account (thus, fulfilling the purpose of the advertising disclosures). Also, the FRB stated that at any time during a face-to-face conversation, consumers may request and receive written disclosures at that time. Thus, the FRB commentary clarifies that except for information about an existing account, commercial messages delivered via telephone or voice response machines are advertisements. NCUA proposed that telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential member about an account would not be considered an advertisement. Proposed comment 2(b)&hyph;1. Two commenters, including a national trade association comments, requested that NCUA maintain this comment in its final commentary. NCUA has kept this provision in the final commentary, though it seems at variance with the FRB. The Board is mindful that NCUA's rule must be ``substantially similar'' to the FRB, except where modifications are supported by credit union uniqueness reasons or the limitations upon which dividends are paid. Unlike other financial institutions, many credit unions rely upon volunteer staffs who have careers outisde of the financial institutions area. To expect volunteers to follow the technical, complex advertising requirements while on the telephone to their colleagues, friends and neighbors, constituting their fellow members, is unreasonable. Furthermore, it places an additional burden upon the volunteers for oral disclosures, which generally will already have been made, or will be made, in written disclosures. Therefore, after careful review and application of NCUA's TISA authority, and finding that sufficient uniqueness grounds exist for the NCUA Board to grant a variance from the FRB's position, the NCUA Board adopts the position taken in the proposed commentary as comment 2(b)&hyph;2(ii). Of course, telephone conversations remain subject to the requirements for oral responses to inquiries. 12 CFR 707.3(e). One commenter inquired as to what requirements telephone response machines must follow. Telephone response machines are subject to the electronic media exemption of ยง707.8(e)(1), and NCUA's treatment of such machines is identical to that of the FRB in Regulation DD. See comment 8(e)(1)(iii)&hyph;1. Another commenter requested guidance regarding whether messages on ATM or other computer screens were subject to the electronic media exemption. They are. The coverage of the electronic media exemption is discussed at comment 8(e)(2)(i)&hyph;1. (f) Bonus Five commenters criticized the example of $25 being offered to a parent or custodian to open an account for a minor in proposed comment 2(f)&hyph;2. The commenters stated that under state laws the parent or custodian will often be a joint accountholder on the minor's account. The Board, wishing to accurately reflect state laws, has deleted this example from the commentary. Two commenters requested a clarification regarding whether payment of an annual membership fee or dues (e.g., such as payment of a membership fee to the National Association of Retired Credit Union Persons (NARCUP) for senior credit union members) would be considered a bonus. A sufficient showing was made that such membership dues payments are not made to open, renew, or maintain an account in the credit union, but instead are payments made to a third party (e.g., NARCUP) as a benevolent gesture to a certain group of credit union members (e.g., seniors, with regard to NARCUP). For these reasons, the NCUA Board finds that such payments of an annual membership fee are not bonuses; and a clarification has been made to comment 2(f)&hyph;3(v). Like the FRB, the NCUA has clarified comment 2(f)&hyph;4 discussing the exclusion from bonuses of items of de minimis value ($10 or less). (See 26 CFR 1.6049&hyph;5(a)(2) published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which discusses the fair market value of property received.) One law firm commenter noted that the IRS citation provided by the FRB may not provide a complete picture of the tax consequences of bonuses. The NCUA Board agrees and has deleted the IRS citation from the final comment. Credit unions are strongly advised to consult their own tax attorneys, accountants, or consultants regarding the tax consequences of the accounts they offer, as such matters are outside of the jurisdiction of NCUA.
