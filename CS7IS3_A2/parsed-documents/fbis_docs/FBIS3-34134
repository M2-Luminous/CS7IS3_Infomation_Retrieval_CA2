Now too they are capable of resolving their problems. BAKHTAR's political commentator writes: The experience of the past 19 months in Afghanistan reveals that the mediation efforts of Afghanistan's neighbor extinguished the fire of war for a limited period. A few days later the fire of war has been rekindled and is destroying the people. To cut the roots of fighting for good and to create a reliable calm in the country, it is necessary for the mojahedin to come together and resolve their problems. Despite the fact that the Islamic State of Afghanistan respects the efforts of all peace seekers and well-wishers and follows their proposals to the best of its abilities, this time it wants a cease-fire to take effect with the party of Golboddin Hekmatyar through an understanding inside the country. But the jihadi parties should not support the atheist and infamous militia, nor should they provide grounds for their further existance. The Jalalabad agreement and the Mecca Convention resolved the problem of Afghanistan in a shallow and temporary way -- the roots of fighting and the problems stayed and so we saw a resumption of the fighting. The important point is that the other side accepts negotiations only after suffering defeat militarily. Now the putschist coup d'etat has failed and Dostam's militia have lost their positions and fortifications. The supremacy of the state has been established following the downing of eight aircraft by the air force of the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the destruction of six aircraft on the ground. Outside the country, too, the Babrak-Dostam-Golboddin triangle's political effforts have failed. This anomalous and unnatural coalition created such an atmosphere for themselves, both militarily and internationally, that they should be considered as having no specific identity or policy. Even international observers have been faced with uncertainty about the real identity of this triangle -- the public alliance of the Muslim extremist Golboddin with very infamous communists. From the outset the Islamic State of Afghanistan has stated its policy in this battle: a cease-fire with the mojahedin of Hezb-e Eslami and continuation of the jihad until the elimination of Dostam's militia. And no one is as well qualified as the Afghans themselves to draft the details of a cease-fire and its implementation.
