We could not fail to respond to this topic, especially since there are Russian servicemen in the former Yugoslavia, and if, after all, the decision is made that the Bosnian conflict will be tackled by military means, by means of bombardments, then it will be very difficult to predict both what Russia's position will be in the end and what in the end the position of our soldiers in former Yugoslavia. Today we present for your attention a commentary by our journalist Aleksandr Znamenskiy, who will tell you about the stance on this matter of the Foreign Ministry, specifically of Minister Andrey Kozyrev and of Russia's Defense Ministry, of Russian Military Department Head Army General Pavel Grachev. Aleksandr Znamenskiy is at the microphone: [Znamenskiy] Bombing the positions of the warring sides in Bosnia is the least effective decision which could be made to wind up the crisis in the region, Andrey Kozyrev noted. He stressed that the UN resolutions theoretically provide for the possibility of military support of UN forces if they are subjected to direct attack. In this case the UN secretary general is to hold consultations with the permanent members of the Security Council, including Russia. Then we willl make a decision, the minister said. In particular, he said that in Russia such a decision will be taken by the president. Kozyrev said that in the specific situation in Bosnia, it should not be a matter of launching strikes against the Serbs alone. One should be speaking of providing protection against attack from any side. As far as any other strikes are concerned which go outside the context of protecting UN forces, say, as punishment, we are categorically against strikes, even theoretically, Andrey Kozyrev stated. In this connection the minister expressed regret that the Russian initiative to convene the Security Council has not received proper support among the Western partners. In particular, this initiative provided for strengthening security zones, including round Sarajevo. It is possible that if it had been implemented earlier it would have been possible to avoid the tragedy. The time has come for our Western partners in the Security Council to take a closer look at our proposals, Kozyrev stressed. The Russian minister said that it is necessary to take urgent measures, but not to fall into a trap. A provocation is possible from any side, the Russian minister stated. Once before, in 1914, a provocation was perpetrated in Sarajevo, when just such a territorial act caused a global tragedy. It is Andrey Kozyrev's view that now, too, an escalation of violence could lead to a repetition of this tragic scenario. The minister expressed the hope that the international community will be guided in this matter by cool political thinking and not by emotions. This was the point of view of the head of Russia's political department. Regarding the Russian military, they virtually fully support it. However, taking into account the importance of the topic, we nevertheless asked Russia's Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev to say a few words in connection with this problem: [Begin Grachev recording] The basic aim of the Russian leadership is that a unilateral approach toward determining the responsibility of the Bosnian communities for the continuation of the armed conflict is impermissible. In the interests of putting an end to it as soon as possible, Russia is trying to get and will try to ensure that sufficient influence is brought to bear not only on the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs but also on the leaders of the Croat and Muslim communities. Now, as to the possibility of using military force: We believe that the use of the NATO countries' combat aviation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is capable of provoking a new escalation of combat actions and is permissible only in the event of a direct attack by Bosnian armed formations on the peacekeeping forces. Taking into account the complexity of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the dispatch of additional contingents from NATO countries into the conflict zone prior to the cessation of the combat operations could be used by the command of the Muslim community for building up their combat effort, which will inevitably provoke a further escalation of the Bosnian armed conflict.
