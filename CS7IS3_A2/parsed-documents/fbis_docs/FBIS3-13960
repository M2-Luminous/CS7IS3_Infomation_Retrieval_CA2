The package offered once again reflects India's desire to resolve all bilateral issues with Pakistan amicably. Outstanding issues have evaded a solution mainly because of the rigid postures adopted by Islamabad. U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent pronouncements have encouraged such an inflexible posture taken by the government of Ms. Benazir Bhutto. Pakistan, it would appear, has embarked on a revanchist policy. Whether it is army rule or an elected regime, India-baiting is the favoured game of politicians and generals. They have used it to ascend to power. The U.S., seeking a sway over South Asia, is another factor that continues to bedevil relationships in this subcontinent. The present unipolar regime has created serious difficulties for countries like India which believe in peaceful and harmonious co-existence. But Pakistan is a country of this region: It cannot change the geography of its location. India rightly expects Pakistan to appreciate and reciprocate the sincerity with which the six proposals have been offered to defuse tensions. Broadly, the proposals relate to disengagement of the embattled forces in the Siachen area; demarcation of the boundary in the Sir Creek area in the Runn of Kutch; the marine boundary in the same area; talks on Tulbul navigation project; additional confidence building measures relating to nuclear energy installations; restructuring the working of the sub-commissions under the Indo-Pak Joint Commission; and ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. These proposals were handed over to Pakistan's High Commissioner Riaz Khokhar by foreign secretary J.N. Dixit as promised by him at the last round of talks with Pakistan foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan. Most of these have been discussed with Pakistan and as a result these have undergone some refinements. Though India controls the entire Siachen glacier, with Pakistani positions to the west of the Saltora range from point 9842, this country has proposed disengagement -- India willing to pull out from Zingrulme and Pakistan withdrawing from the Saltora ridge. Significantly, Delhi has said that any disengagement or redeployment of forces would be without prejudice to each other's positions. The proposals stipulates that neither country shall re-occupy the vacated areas or undertake any military mountaineering or other activity in the area. On the nuclear issue, the two countries agreed not to attack each other's installations. India has now proposed no-first use of each other's nuclear capability; non-attack on population centres and economic targets. This is regarded as a step towards eventual non-use and eradication of nuclear weapons. To ensure peace and tranquility along the LoC [Line of Control] in J and K [Jammu and Kashmir], India has proposed several measures to prevent violation of tranquility. Mechanism should be devised to monitor violations by infiltrators and checking cross-border movement of arms. Pakistan has been urged to fix a date for another round of talks. Delhi expects a positive response and would like Islamabad to see the package as a sign of resilence to restore normalcy instead of viewing it as a sign of weakness. Pakistan, with an eye on Washington's moves, has predictably responded by taking a negative stand, repeating the propaganda line on Kashmir and human rights. *
