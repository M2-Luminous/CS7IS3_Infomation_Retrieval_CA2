He pointed out that such low efficiency in particular enterprises could be termed micro-economics -- but this had great macro-economic effects. To solve some of these problems, the reform of enterprises will be top of the agenda in China next year. He said that his commission is in charge of the macro economy, but it also pays attention to the study of micro-economic activities. The minister said that the government's structural reforms this year had far-reaching effects on large and medium-sized enterprises. But it was not enough to carry out the reform measures -- the reform of the enterprises should also be promoted. He said that now many of the enterprises have no access to the market, which has affected their viability. They needed to push for access to the market and become a major part of the market. This was the fundamental way out for enterprises to reduce losses and increase profits, he said. The minister said that some noted foreign specialists had said that the development of enterprises depended on two wheels, technological progress and scientific management. But in China, the two wheels can operate only through reform of enterprises.
