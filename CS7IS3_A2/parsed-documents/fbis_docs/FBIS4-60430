To do this, they have two options: Either to accept the authority of the military establishment backed by the gangs, or resist in order to impose democracy, political pluralism, and human rights. We have chosen the latter path and have paid a heavy price out of the conviction that our Yemeni masses understand the situation and realize that our struggle is for the sake of Yemen -- not just for the sake of the six southern governorates. We are paying dearly, with our lives and blood, on behalf of those who have not joined us in the battle for the national cause. Replying to a question on the military situation, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We are currently arranging our affairs within the framework of our state and its institutions. We are currently working with the institutions of the Democratic Republic of Yemen as opposed to those of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 'Ali Salim al-Bid noted that the political Army and the military Army are coordinating on a large scale. He referred to the confusion that existed in the initial days of the war, saying it was only natural because we had not conditioned our masses to be warlike and destructive, but that when our units started being attacked in the northern governorates, the logic of reality and struggle took over and gave rise to a different orientation. The people began adapting themselves to the new circumstances. Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We have begun in practical terms what we have been talking about and what we have been demanding in part of Yemen for the sake of the whole of Yemen. It is up to us to compete on a basis of peace and democracy in order to provide an example acceptable to the Yemeni people, a model for the future of the modern civil state based on pluralism, democracy, and human rights. He noted that if there exists a state in the northern governorates proceeding along these same lines, there will be no difficulty in reuniting in the future on the same basis as that on which we agreed in the pledge and accord document. Referring to the issue of the recognition of the new Republic, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the coincidence of the declaration of the new Republic with the 'Id al-Adha festival has positive implications that will soon become apparent, God willing. He said contacts made before and during the war with the presidents and kings of the Arab states arose from our eagerness to prevent the disaster of war. The presidents and kings were sympathetic toward our complicated situation which [words indistinct] force. On the military situation in al-Anad, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the enemy forces there will be unable to accomplish anything, that good progress is being made there, and that the enemy forces will never be permitted to take al-Anad. He invited reporters to go to the base and the area as a whole to see that for themselves. On the military situation in Shabwah Governorate, the Presidential Council chairman confirmed that there is indeed a current breakthrough in the direction of the Ma'rib because we did not think they were bent on occupation. He added that the Sanaa forces have been unable to achieve their desire, which is to gain control of the oil wells, because the sons of the Shabwah Governorate have rejected anything like occupation. The Presidential Council Chairman stressed that our [word indistinct] alliance with the various parties toward building the Yemeni state is an ongoing target and all obstacles in the way of achieving it in the future will be overcome. Everyone is bound to consider the views of others so that we can build an institutional state. We are eager to offer our hands to others and to promote joint action. Replying to a question on the provision of guarantees for the security of oil companies working in our country, the Presidential Council chairman stressed that the new state will guarantee the interests of all oil companies in our country and will provide them with security and stability regardless of cost inasmuch as there exist joint interests between the new state and these companies. He said there are good contacts with the international oil companies which have responded positively.
