Supreme Court Judge President Desalegn Alemu Kibret said in a press statement that the two defendants the court knows to be in custody have been ordered to appear before court on 10th January. Mr. Kibret said that although the prosecutor has the right to revoke the charges he had levelled at the accused, but this should be made clear to the court which handled the case, and added that, if not, neither the prosecutor nor any other authority has the right to release the individuals who have been jailed under a court order. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has ordered the central investigation to bring the two defendants before court on 10th January and summoned Justice Minister Mehitema Soloman and deputy prosecutor, Zeru Meles, Prison Police Chief Yemane Fisea, and Central Investigation head Zeray Yihdego to give explanations on the same day how the two were released without the court's order.
