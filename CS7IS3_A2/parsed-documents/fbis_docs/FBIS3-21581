The friend and comrade-in-arms of Vil Mirzayanov, he has traveled this fighter's entire journey -- from social persecution to KGB interrogations. Whereas we might stretch things to believe that the persecution of political dissidents is over, attempts continue to be made, as before, to nail "industrial" dissidents to the wall. In mid-October, at their first assembly in Nizhniy Novgorod, a small group of activists of the antichemical movement founded the Alliance for Chemical Safety. Our organization is not very large at present, and certainly not widespread. However, we would like to make a beginning. We cannot allow the military-chemical complex, whose inclinations for poaching have long been well known, to make decisions regarding Russia's withdrawal from chemical warfare without consulting us -- the inhabitants of Russia. I would like to invite into discussion (and into action!) the populace of those regions in which the chemical weapons of the land of the soviets have been stored in recent years at seven bases, and from which their continued journey can lead to just one destination -- nonexistence. We are addressing first and foremost those people who reside near three air bases and two artillery bases that store chemical munitions with the most toxic organophosphoric nerve-paralysis agents -- zarin, zoman, and V-gas. The air bases housing chemicals were situated at three quite tranquil localities in Russia -- the city of Pochel (Bryansk Oblast), and the settlements of Leonidovka (Penza Oblast) and Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast). Protected here from impudent "hostile" eyes are various types of air-dropped bombs, molded aviation devices, components for all-purpose containers, and other "riches" we have no need for. The chemical arsenals at rocket artillery bases were comfortably positioned in the settlement of Kizner (Udmurtia) and in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast). At one time chemical projectiles for tube and rocket artillery and warheads for missiles of various ranges were transported here. None of us is guilty of what is the reality today. Those who dragged Russia into chemical warfare and accumulated stockpiles of chemical weapons preferred to remain in obscurity and can hardly be expected now to come out into the spotlight. No more deserving of trust, however, is the current wave of military-chemical establishment people, who are again attempting to take charge of something, this time -- the destruction of chemical weapons. And once again -- without us, although at the expense of our health and our interests. It seems these people are about to drag us out of chemical warfare and into ecological warfare without proper supervision on the part of society. The sad story is that our chemical weapons stockpiles will have to be eliminated "in their storage locations" (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 22 October 1993). This was acknowledged by General A.D. Kuntsevich, head of the "eliminators," and a zealous and not unselfish creator of our military-chemical offensive "achievements" (we are not talking about defensive arms here) in the past. And it is even more important that we not give sloppy people from the military-chemical complex complete freedom of discretion in managing this matter of greatest danger. Their thoughtlessness and lack of professionalism could well deliver us many new calamities. In order to provide a convincing basis for the fears I am expressing here, I cite the interview, just published, with Colonel A.D. Gorbovskiy (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 27 January 1994). It is out of pure necessity that I provide the name of this gentleman -- he deserves no publicity. As the head of some military-chemical inspection team, the colonel recently made a calculation of the amount of toxic substances Russia has on hand. It is suspicious that this amount coincided exactly with the figure officially declared previously -- 40,000 tonnes, and not a tonne more. Of course, the gentleman simply forgot to inform us as to what happened to the remaining tonnes which used to exist and were a topic of discussion. Which, by the way, are not a bit less toxic in the buried or submerged state than they are in the combat configuration -- when stored in the form of chemical munitions. We go on; there is more. In his capacity as head of this inspection team, the colonel assured his fellow citizens, first and foremost the residents of the above-mentioned population centers, that the chemical munitions in their locality were being stored safely, and that "no instances of leakage of toxic substances have been recorded" at any of the arsenals. Well, suppose there is no automatic alarm system whatsoever at the bases in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast) and settlement of Kizner (Udmurtia) to signal the presence of toxic vapors in the atmosphere. And there never was! So it would seem that nothing exists to do the recording, especially when the soldier is sleeping and a "leak" is occurring. Things are not much better at the other bases. Thus, it is hardly worth talking so categorically about leaks. Especially since the environmental protection organs and sanitation and epidemiologic services of these localities are not allowed to get involved here -- "ecologists" in uniform are in charge. No less interesting is the geographic aspect of the colonel's revelations. Once again, in his capacity as head of the inspection team, he "shut down" altogether the rocket artillery arsenal in the city of Shchuchye, announcing that all of our storage facilities "are located in the European part of Russia" and that "the most eastern" facility was situated in Chelyabinsk Oblast. I do not know whether or not there are in fact chemical weapons in the city of Shchuchye, but such an announcement was officially made (IZVESTIYA, 3 November 1992), and it was released following General Kuntsevich's optimistic speech delivered to committees of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet before it was burned down. Finally, they are again trying to drag us into "speeding things up." The colonel acknowledges that the buildings housing our chemical munitions ensure reliable storage over an extended period of time. At the same time, his energetic complaints about the intractability of his fellow citizens arouse suspicion. It turns out that, because of a predilection for adequate resolution of ecological problems, Russia "will be unable to effect timely implementation of the program" for chemical weapons destruction. But why should Russia do anything at all that is to the detriment of its citizens? In this regard, we must pause and raise a question to be dealt with before we can proceed further. We know that the American program of chemical weapons destruction emerged following, and as a result of, a 20-year debate between the military and people residing in the vicinity of the bases for the storage (and destruction) of chemical weapons. Residents met the military halfway only after being convinced of the absolute safety of the technology of destruction, not to mention everyday, purely economic interests. It was only after attaining a consensus with its populace that the United States embarked upon the official signing of the international Convention on Chemical Disarmament. Why has not a similar debate begun here? I am thinking not only about the citizens of Russia who reside in the vicinity of the five above-mentioned bases where the most dangerous toxic substances are stored. This problem is a matter of importance to all the rest of the population as well. It is all as simple as pie. They continue to consider us bystanders. Even those who have lived so close to chemical death for decades. Returning to the beginning of this article, I would like to emphasize that we can hardly permit ourselves to continue such a negligent attitude toward our lives and our environment. Truly, these are far more important than the selfish interests of the colonels and generals who, originally out of a love for foreign travel, were excessively hasty in signing the Convention, and who now hasten to implement it with the same fervor. Let us begin to do everything in sequence. Clearly, the process of ecologically safe destruction of chemical weapons cannot begin without serious -- and critical -- debate. But the proper level of debate can be ensured only if the residents of regions where the most toxic chemical weapons are stored unite in protest groups and define their positions and interests. We will not be able to run away from chemical weapons, of course. We have been chained to them. We can safeguard our interests, however, in the process of preparations for their destruction. It is unimportant whether or not the groups under discussion join our alliance or fight independently for their interests. What is important is that the interests of people who reside in Russia be observed first and foremost when we part from the chemical weapons. Incidentally, this position in no way contradicts the Convention which was concluded.
