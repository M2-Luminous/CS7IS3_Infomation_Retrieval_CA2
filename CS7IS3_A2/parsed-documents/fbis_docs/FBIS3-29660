On return home from his trip to Washington and Ottawa, Minister Han said delay in visa issuance seems to be part of Pyongyang's effort to obtain clearer steps regarding their agreement with the United States over the nuclear issue. Han said in an airport press conference that if North Korea refuses to issue visa to IAEA inspectors to the end, there would be due actions from IAEA and the United Nations. Minister Han said the upcoming IAEA inspection would definitely include taking sample materials, but there would be no exchange of fuel bars. "If and when any fuel bars are exchanged in North Korean nuclear facilities in the days to come, IAEA should always take part," he said. Even if North Korea were found to already possess nuclear materials, what is more important is to obtain Pyongyang's nuclear transparency and keep them from using such materials in producing nuclear weapons than to take sanction, he said. Han observed the third-round high-level U.S.-North Korea talks could be held around the end of March at the earliest because he said it would take about four weeks to analyze the outcome of the planned IAEA look into North Korean facilities. The foreign minister was optimistic about North Korea's return to the stalled inter-Korean dialogue. "Since the resumption of dialogue is linked to the third-round Washington-Pyongyang talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, I believe North Korea would agree to resumed dialogue," he said. Regarding the controversial Patriots missile issue, he said South Korea and the United States will discuss the matter upon the end of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting opening on Feb. 21. "The discussion will cover detailed issues including the question of whether to deploy the anti-missile missiles in Korea," Minister Han said.
