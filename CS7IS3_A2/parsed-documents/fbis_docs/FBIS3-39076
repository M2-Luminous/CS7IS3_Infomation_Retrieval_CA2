They said the IAEA's Swedish general-director Hans Blix had stressed repeatedly that it was "not necessary" for the organization's board of governors to adopt a resolution sending the issue to the Security Council when the governors next meet on February 21. However, the board's 35 members are to hold consultations next week on what position to take over North Korea's persistant refusal to have its nuclear facilities inspected, diplomats said. And certain delegations appeared to favour taking a "firm" stance. The IAEA is not empowered itself to slap sanctions on the country. "No one really knows if North Korea has an atomic bomb, but because of its refusal (to allow inspections), suspicion, concern and doubt are growing and the North Koreans are doing nothing to allay these doubts," the diplomats added. There has been no official contact between the agency and North Korea since January 25, when the IAEA provided further details on what kind of inspection measures it deemed necessary. North Korea subsequently rejected some of these measures. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu was due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington on Friday to discuss North Korea's persistant refusal to have its nuclear facilities inspected. Han's visit comes as the IAEA awaits a response from Pyongyang in the next two weeks on outside inspection of its suspect nuclear sites. If no progress is made, the Vienna-based IAEA will meet February 21 to announce it can no longer certify that North Korea has no nuclear-weapons program, possibly leading to a US request for UN Security Council sanctions. Such a move, however, could be stopped by China, one of the council's five permanent, veto-wielding members. The WASHINGTON POST said Thursday that China recently rejected a proposal to have the council issue Pyongyang a warning.
