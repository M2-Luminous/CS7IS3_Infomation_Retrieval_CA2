A time of political disputes, internecine warfare, economic discord, a time in which practically every republic has shut itself off into its own compartment, introduced its own currency, and is experiencing mountains of unaddressed economic and social problems. When will we learn to understand and be sensitive to one another? But the main question troubling me as a scientist and a person in this whirlpool of contradictions is this: What is going to happen to our life-giving land? To be honest, even when we were still living as "one family" we didn't tend it very zealously. But now the situation has worsened, and all science, and especially agrarian science, has been given a very low priority. This can be said not only of the republics of Central Asia but also of Russia and Ukraine. Let me dwell on a particular comparison confirmed by data of our institute covering many years. By scientifically improving the land, eliminating many of the extremes of land reclamation, and introducing more productive varieties we could increase the productivity of cotton by 600,000-700,000 tonnes. That's how much two oblasts produce today. But cotton isn't the only concern, after all. Imagine this: As many as 22 million persons already live in Uzbekistan, on a territory of a little more than 450 square kilometers, a sizable part of which is occupied by deserts and semideserts. The population is growing, its annual increment has averaged half a million, and the fields that are supposed to give us grain, vegetables, fruits, milk and meat are the same size as before, while in many places their area has decreased dramatically due to growth of cities. If we use these fields more intensively, which means applying more mineral fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, we would be ruinously contaminating and destroying the soil. There's something to think about here. The main problems of the land today can be determined by looking at it in three dimensions. The first--its fertility, the ability to provide the greatest return per irrigated hectare. The second--ecology, the ability not only to feed man but also preserve the surrounding beauty, and civilization's natural lungs--the forests and the rivers. Third--the social side, uniform distribution of productive forces, reasonable construction of cities and towns on the land, so that all interests of the people would be accounted for. To be honest, this is not a simple task. But it is something we need to do. As far back as in the 1960s scientists of our institute developed the concept of the fertility of irrigated soil, and carried out major soil improvement operations in regions of future development. These were mainly the Karshinskaya, Dzhizakskaya and Sherabadksaya steppes, the Fergana Valley, and the lower reaches of the Amu-Darya. It was then that a means was found for growing high cotton yields in the conditions of a desert zone: Scientists proposed creating an optimum soil density by sowing plants on previously prepared ridges and seedbeds, which increased the yield by 4-6 centners per hectare. Much was done to study and regulate the hydrologic and thermal cycles of different soils. And in recent years research was started on thermophysical characteristics of soil. More-sensible means of improving desert soil were found, and plants promoting swift recultivation of land were tested. However, soil erosion, to which over 700,000 hectares of land fit for use are subjected in Uzbekistan, remains a serious problem to farmers. Imagine how much food could be obtained from this land in the presence of an acute shortage of plowland! Taking on this problem, scientists developed and introduced agrotechnical systems into production for controlling gully erosion on irrigated land and the means of laying out and cultivating gullied and unproductive land. But while developing even a good recommendation is one thing, getting to the fields is another. This is the task of the business executives, but sometimes they are simply powerless in the acute contradictions of a market economy. There are not enough resources, equipment or materials. But even under these conditions I feel that we need to do everything we can to improve the land. Because without it, it would be impossible to raise agricultural potential or solve ecological and social problems. It would be worthwhile here to consider one other important point. When we lived in the Union, summary soil maps of river basins and certain large regions--the upper and lower reaches of the Amu-Darya, the Zeravshan and the Syr-Darya--were prepared. That is, the area of not only Uzbekistan but also Tajikistan, Turkmenia and Kyrgyzstan was covered. With our division into national compartments it has become very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to concentrate energy on carrying out common tasks and monitoring their fulfillment. All that remains here is to wish that in pursuing important political and economic objectives the leaders of neighboring states would remember that they are living together on the same land, and they need to take care of it together. Talking about the present day, here's something else that needs to be said. While in the 1920s-1930s land development proceeded slowly because of the limited availability of technical resources and the needs of those times, in recent decades the scale of development increased by several times. Intensive development and introduction of irrigated farming were carried on, however, without regard for soil conditions in each particular locale. As they say, we worked under the same yardstick--getting as much from every hectare, whatever the cost. Incompetent handling of the land led to degradation of the soil, growth of the area of salinized land, exhaustion of the total reserves of organic matter, worsening of the physical properties of plowland, and its contamination by heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides. As a result the productivity of the land fell, and its ecology found itself at a critical point. Today, dependable means of improving the land are being sought. The "Soil" republic scientific-technical program has been developed. Considering that the ecologically most serious situation has evolved here in the lower reaches of the Amu-Darya, we started implementation of this program with Karakalpakstan. Here of course the problem has to do not only with soil but also with water, and with social reconstruction, brought on by the sharp drop in the level of the Aral Sea. That has meant thousands of tons of extra salt chased by the winds, and even change in climate. But we have selected a specific task for ourselves. Specialists of different profiles working in the institute have begun integrated study of the soil surface of Karakalpakia and detailed mapping of its soil. After the scientific work is finished, recommendations will be provided on what specific crops would best be cultivated on different types of land, with regard for its ecological and ameliorative condition. In the future such work is planned for all of Uzbekistan. You will have to agree this is an enormous amount of scientific work, which will require many years. But people of the rural areas can't wait--they need serious scientifically substantiated farming procedures today, tomorrow. They have to feed and clothe the people. Many have become accustomed to thinking that nature reproduces or restores itself. But that's not so. Today even short-term action by man upon the environment is such that it is comparable to the consequences of geological, geochemical and other global processes spanning many millions of years. A graphical example of this is the hundreds of ruined settlements in Central Asia. Today they have become historical monuments, museums beneath the open sky. You can be sure that not only the hordes of Genghis Khan and other conquerors are to blame for the disappearance of oases. Nature has not forgiven man his mistakes, and his indifferent attitude. Springs feeding the rivers have dried up, and the land has lost its former fertility. When we ponder our history, we recall that there was a time when the Sahara was a rich land, and Hannibal caught elephants for his army in the forests of North Africa. According to statistics each year around 50 million hectares of fertile land in the world are transformed into desert. That's a fact that catches your attention. While we grieve for the land that is abandoning man, he is doing little to bring its goodness and generosity back.
