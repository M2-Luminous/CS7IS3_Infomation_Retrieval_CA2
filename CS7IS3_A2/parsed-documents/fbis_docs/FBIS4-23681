Speaking at a news conference in Maputo this afternoon, Afonso Dhlakama said the Clinton administration supports his desire for the formation of a government of national unity, regardless of the results of the first multiparty elections in October this year. Dhlakama said that to guarantee national unity, the party that wins the coming elections should form a government where the winner and the losers would be represented. He said the United States promised him to intercede so that the president of the republic will accept the proposal. Asked by journalists what would happen if the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] won the elections and refused to form the so-called government of national unity, which he advocates, Afonso Dhlakama said: [Dhlakama] There will be no problem. There will be no problem. If Frelimo wins the elections and it does not accept a government of national unity, there will be no problem. You should realize that when Renamo advocates a government of national unity, it is not doing it from a position of weakness. On the contrary, our position is good compared to any other party, including Frelimo. However, we think that as these are the first elections after the war, there is a need for the winner and the losers to come together. This is very important. It is very important, particularly considering that these are the first elections and they are being held after the war. There is a need to know the future of the winner and losers. There is a need to know how the winner will treat the loser. We are not insisting on a government of national unity because we are worried that we are going to lose the elections, and we want to rule. Americans told me that it was a good idea. Thus, I requested them to assist Mozambicans to work in this direction because this is part of the spirit of national reconciliation, to calm down other political forces, and to jointly study our country's future and development. They told me that they would convey the message to President Chissano. The Renamo leader said at the news conference this afternoon that the voter registration process preparing to hold the first multiparty elections is facing many problems caused by what he described as cadres of the ruling Frelimo Party. [Dhlakama] This has already taken place in Gaza, Manica. Even today I received information that two Tanzanians who registered as voters were detected in Cabo Delgado Province. The two are already under police detention. There are many Tanzanians who are registering as voters in northern provinces. All this is a violation of the electoral law. We shall discuss the issue with our brothers. I do not know why the government is doing this. Asked why he is always affable shortly after his regular meetings with the president of the republic, Dhlakama said: [Dhlakama] I have always been a good person. My brother, I am a good person. There are times when even God becomes angry. There is time for jokes and time for seriousness. What I am saying here should be taken seriously. If there is another war you, as a Mozambican, will be the first to suffer. This is what I am saying. I have experience of war. I was in the bush for 16 years. I volunteered. If we are able to speak here today in freedom -- you call this freedom of the press -- it is because of the struggle led by Dhlakama. I am not an aggressive man. I am very calm, but when Frelimo plays around, I must show that I cannot accept jokes. The Renamo leader said that his visit to the United States was a success and that he was able to convey a different image of his movement in that country. As a result of the visit, Americans changed their attitude toward Renamo, he said. He also said that beginning tomorrow, he will hold meetings in Inhambane and Xai-Xai to discuss with his cadres the civic education of the electorate. On 20 June, the Renamo leader will carry out a working visit to the provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Tete.
