He said the main reason for the fighting between the two parts is that Yemeni unity was not established on a sound basis, the armed forces continued to be split into two, and there were two different currencies. In a statement to the Kuwaiti newspaper AL-WATAN today he regretted the failure of the UN secretary general's envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's mission and appealed to leaders of the two sides to end the fighting and immediately start negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations or any other party they agree upon to stem the bloodshed in the country. 'Abd-al-Majid emphasized that the Arab League's primary goal is to stop the bloody fighting between the two sides. He noted that the issue of recognizing south Yemen is left for the future, that the League's documents indicate that the Yemeni Arab Republic is a unified state, and that any change in status should be decided at the League Council in light of the northern and southern parties' views. Concluding his statement, 'Abd-al-Majid said unity can never be imposed by force.
