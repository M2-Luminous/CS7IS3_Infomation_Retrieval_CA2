FR940921-0-00144 FR940921-0-00016 104. A new section 86.1321&hyph;94 is added to subpart N to read as follows: §86.1321&hyph;94 Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the following initial and periodic calibration. The HFID used with petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines shall be operated to a set point # 10 ○F ( # 5.5 ○C) between 365 and 385 ○F (185 and 197 ○C). The HFID used with methanol-fueled engines shall be operated at 235 # 15 ○F (113 # 8 ○C). (a) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon response. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator. (1) Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start-up and basic operating adjustment using the appropriate fuel (see §86.1314) and zero-grade air. (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the analyzer a propane-in-air mixture with a propane concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most common operating range. (3) One of the following procedures is required for FID or HFID optimization: (i) The procedures outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) paper number 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust''; author, Glenn D. Reschke. Available from Society of Automotive Engineers International, 400 Commonwealth Dr., Warrendale, PA 15096&hyph;0001. (ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in subpart D of this part. (iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. (4) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, they are recorded for future reference. (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when analyzing samples. Calibration gases shall be introduced directly at the analyzer, unless the ``overflow'' calibration option of §86.1310(b)(3)(i) for the HFID is taken. (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance. (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air. (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with propane-in-air calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent of each test point shall be used to determine concentration. (c) FID response factor to methanol. When the FID analyzer is to be used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the methanol response factor of the analyzer shall be established. The methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample. (1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure N90&hyph;10. A known volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the heated mixing zone (250 ○F (121 ○C)) of the apparatus. The methanol is vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume of zero-grade air measured by a dry gas meter. (2) The bag sample is analyzed using the FID. (3) The FID response factor, r, is calculated as follows: r=FIDppm/SAMppm Where: (i) r=FID response factor. (ii) FIDppm=FID reading in ppmC. (iii) SAMppm=methanol concentration in the sample bag in ppmC. 0.02406×fuel injected×fuel density=Air volume × mol. wt. CH 3 OH Where: (iv) 0.02406=volume of one mole at 29.92 in Hg and 68 ○F, m3.
