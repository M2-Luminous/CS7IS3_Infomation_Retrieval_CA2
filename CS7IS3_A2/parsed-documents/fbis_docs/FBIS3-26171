Asked to comment, at the ministry's weekly news conference, on the human rights report issued by the U.S. State Department which criticized the human rights situation in China, Wu said: "It is utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible for the so-called human rights report to distort, criticize and attack the domestic situation in China." The U.S. State Department released the report on February 1. "The issue of human rights falls in essence within the sovereignty of each country, which is embodied in its domestic legislations," Wu said. "China's constitution and relevant laws have fully guaranteed the Chinese people of all nationalities of every democratic right," said the spokesman, adding that the report had turned a blind eye to this fact. "We are resolutely opposed to interference in our internal affairs under the excuse of human rights," Wu said.
