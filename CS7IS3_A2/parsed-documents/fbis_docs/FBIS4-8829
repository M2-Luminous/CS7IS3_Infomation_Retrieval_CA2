For all more or less informed observers it was clear that U.S. Ambassador William Montgomery did not waste his time during the days preceding the decision, and that the decision to allow the armored carriers to cross Bulgaria has practically been made. Certain sums of U.S. dollars, no more than pennies compared with what we lose from the Yugoslav embargo, entered the safes of the Bulgarian National Bank in the last two days. Apparently, this golden dew was a weighty argument for some people, even though very soon this miserable pittance will be returned to its original owners, without leaving a trace in the Bulgarian economy and finances. Our multicolored parliament made an effort to utilize the case that it was served by the UN general secretary and his tacit representative in Bulgaria, Mr. Montgomery, to stage a new exercise in political demagogy. All the tales were told on the morning of 16 April. Even Mr. Savov [chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces parliamentary faction] was defending from the rostrum of parliament an employee of the U.S. Embassy. Only one thing remained unsaid: From where and through what channels did Butrus-Ghali's request for the transportation corridor come to Bulgaria? Through our representative at the United Nations? Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Was the request sent straight to the government, or was it really conveyed only through the U.S. ambassador? This directly returns us to a statement that a Russian politician made some 10 days ago that the international organization has become a branch of the U.S. State Department. Indeed, Montgomery came to our country with a clearly announced agenda. Usually the heads of sovereign states refuse to accept the credentials of diplomats who come with such an agenda. When this did not happen to the gentleman in question, he obviously began to expand the range of his activity. He is no longer working to found ethnic parties and to pass the relevant constitutional amendments, (such parties exist despite what our Constitution says about it), but rather directly to turn Bulgaria into a side to the existing conflict and budding conflicts. This is actually what Montgomery is being paid for. However, it is not clear what the Bulgarian National Assembly are being paid for by the taxpayers. They are so carried away in their efforts to turn our country's face toward Europe, which they have actually replaced with the United States, that they forgot our country's other end. Of course, there always is the possibility that they could not care less. In this case we recommend that they read "The Life and Suffering of Sinner Sofroniy" by Sofroniy Vrachanski [describing the plight of the Bulgarian people under Turkish rule in the second half of the 18th century]. To return to the UN request. The basic argument is that Bulgaria is the only state that has a border with Macedonia that is convenient for the transportation of military equipment for the U.S. "Blue Helmets" in Macedonia. A brief glance at the map shows that the Greek-Macedonian border is no less convenient, and that the military equipment could be transported to Greece by sea. However, even though the Greeks are NATO members, they refuse to do this. They suspect that behind the armored carriers of the UN convoy there is Antalya smoke and also that particular article of the Macedonian Constitution that claims territories now outside Macedonia's borders. Perhaps the Greeks crossed the borders of prudence with their rallies and economic blockades, but the Bulgarian politicians must be aware of our history and remember how in 1912-13 (after the victory over Turkey) that particular territory [Macedonia], created by the Berlin Congress, was divided among Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. Whether it was just or not is another question, but even if we start singing again "Allies-Robbers" [patriotic song of the Balkan wars], the banal fact remains that this particular article of the Macedonian Constitution also applies to the Pirin region. Let us remember that Ambassador Montgomery specifically promised the Senate commission to work for the establishment of a Macedonian party in Bulgaria. All the rest -- for example, the international commitments officially assumed by our country -- is empty talk. Nowhere in those commitments is it said that we should allow any troops, arms, or military equipment through Bulgarian territory. The truth is that the UN could transport those wretched 20 or so vehicles with a few short flights of Hercules aircraft. This would be hardly more expensive than, for example, that senseless military action in Somalia. And let us not forget that Bulgaria also participates in the financing of the United Nations, in accordance with its modest means. The truth is that the establishment of a precedent was sought. Now it exists. After the armored carriers of the U.S. "Blue Helmets" there will come the tanks of the Turkish "Blue Helmets." And afterward why not Turkish battalions? Such things have happened in history, but apparently it does not exist for politicians. Thus the corridor of war already exists. May God and Montgomery save us!
