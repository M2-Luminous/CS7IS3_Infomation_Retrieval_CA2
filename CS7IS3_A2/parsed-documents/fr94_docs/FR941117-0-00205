FR941117-0-00205 FR941117-0-00013 To address the first of these concerns, the amendments have been revised to clarify that the availability of the exemption turns on the amount of outstanding municipal securities for which an issuer or obligated person also is an obligated person. An issuer of municipal securities would need to satisfy the threshold only if it were an obligated person with respect to the security being offered. Under this approach, if a financing agency that is offering obligations that have some recourse to the agency, only those outstanding securities of the agency that likewise are recourse would count toward the threshold. If the financing agency does not issue recourse securities, the exemption will be unavailable only if a conduit borrower obligated on the municipal securities being offered is an obligated person with respect to more than $10,000,000 in outstanding municipal securities. If any one obligated person in an Offering exceeds the threshold, then the entire Offering, including all obligated persons, will be subject to the rule. Subsequent non-recourse offerings by the financing agency would not be affected, but would be subject to a similar test. With respect to the second concern, however, the amendments require that an obligated person aggregate all its outstanding obligations, even if some are payable from separate dedicated revenue sources. For example, a city or county that issues securities for a number of different purposes could not qualify as a small and infrequent issuer merely because its outstanding securities are payable from separate revenue streams. Thus, while a governmental issuer's outstanding obligations need not be aggregated with that of non-governmental obligated persons, a governmental issuer could not avoid aggregation of its securities by restricting repayment to separate revenue streams. 192 192 Significant indicia of whether an issuer in a revenue-type financing is in fact a part of a larger municipality would be whether the issuer's accounts are reflected in the municipality's financial statements and whether the municipality's officials or personnel manage the separate financing programs. Commenters also discussed a related issue of what securities would be included in the calculation. Commenters contended that only publicly offered securities should be included in the calculation. Other commenters questioned how short term obligations such as bond anticipation notes, refunded bonds and installment/lease purchase agreements would be treated. Several commenters suggested that the threshold should be measured only against publicly offered, long-term bonds. 193 193 See, e.g., Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of Day Berry & Howard; Joint Response; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina. The amendments have been clarified in this respect to exclude from the threshold calculation securities that were offered in transactions exempt from Rule 15c2&hyph;12 because they were otherwise exempt as private placements and short term financings. In addition, to the extent that an issuer or obligated person is no longer liable for repayment on bonds, as with certain defeased bonds, then such bonds would not be included in the calculation of the threshold for such issuer or obligated person. A number of commenters indicated that an exemption should be available based on the number of holders of the municipal securities. 194 However, in accordance with concerns voiced by other commenters regarding the difficulty in ascertaining the number of holders due to the fact that most municipal securities are held in street name through a very limited number of depositories, 195 the amendments do not adopt any exemption based on the number of holders of the municipal securities. 194 See, e.g., Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of Mudge Rose; Letter of National League of Cities. 195 See, e.g., Letter of Bank One Corporation; Letter of Reliance Trust Company. A variety of other comments were raised relating to exemptions, and a number of alternative exemptions were proposed, including exemptions based on the type of issuer or the existence of an investment grade rating. 196 Commenters also believed that an exemption should be available for securities covered by bond insurance or other credit enhancement, such as bank letters of credit. 197 Except as described above, the exemptions have not been revised to adopt these suggestions. Commenters, including some bond insurance providers, 198 expressed the view that the existence of credit enhancement does not necessarily eliminate the need for information regarding the underlying credit. 196 See, e.g., Letter of ICI; Letter of McDonald & Company Securities; Letter of NABL; Letter of National League of Cities; Letter of NFMA; Letter of New York Dormitory Authority; Letter of Putnam Investment Management; Letter of State of Utah, Office of the State Treasurer; Letter of State of Washington, Office of the State Treasurer. 197 See, e.g., Letter of Delaware County Industrial Development Authority; Letter of Financial Security Assurance; Letter of McNair & Sanford; Letter of Smith, Gambrell & Russell. 198 As some commenters indicated, the existence of credit enhancement or other programmatic enhancement features does not eliminate the need for information on underlying obligated persons, particularly where there is a long term guarantee, because of the potential impact of a default on the pricing of the securities.

A number of commenters also argued that new exemptions should be added that would mirror exemptions under the Securities Act. 199 Some commenters argued that exemptions should be included for non-profit entities that would have their own exemption from registration under the Securities Act. 200 The Commission is not including any exclusion in the amendments for any such issuers. Issuers accessing the tax-exempt public securities markets have obligations to promote the integrity and efficiency of those markets. As the Commission noted in the Interpretive Release, the high level of defaults in sectors such as healthcare, lifecare, retirement homes and multifamily housing, relative to other market sectors, 201 and the past problems with the sufficiency of information in many of these sectors, weighs heavily against adopting such exclusions. 199 See, e.g., Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of Goldman Sachs; Letter of Morgan Stanley; Letter of Mudge Rose; Letter of Thacher Proffitt & Wood. 200 See, e.g., Letter of Morgan Stanley; Letter of Mudge Rose; Letter of New York Dormitory Authority. 201 Interpretive Release at Section III.D.
