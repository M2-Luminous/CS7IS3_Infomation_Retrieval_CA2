Having persuaded the hostile parties to start up a dialogue, Russia is seeking to reconcile the implacable adversaries' positions and secure specific moves from them to break the deadlock. However, the hopes were not fulfilled. By all accounts there will be no talks between the Tajik authorities and the opposition in the foreseeable future. Kozyrev indirectly acknowledged this when conversing with journalists at the end of the meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian CIS states: "Intensive work with the Tajik opposition is under way. We are entering into contact with everyone who agrees to dialogue. But it is too early to say at the moment when these efforts will yield results and it will be possible to hold talks." Comparing this cautious evaluation with recent optimistic statements by Russian diplomats, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the results of the Dushanbe meetings were not at all what Kozyrev hoped for. It is not clear as yet who was to blame for the postponement of the talks due to start on 16 March. The Tajik leadership blames the opposition for digging its heels in. According to other information Uzbekistan, which has enormous influence on the Tajik regime, opposed the talks. There are serious grounds for thinking that Tajikistan leader Emomali Rakhmonov felt no great desire to start a dialogue with the opposition. Having given in to Moscow's pressure and agreed to talks against his own will, he was merely waiting for an excuse to reconsider his decision. That excuse so desired by the hard-liners in both camps was provided on the night of 10-11 March when Tajik Vice Premier Mazabsho Nazarshoyev was shot. A native of the Pamirs, which are regarded as the opposition's main stronghold, Nazarshoyev represented the interests of the people of his region in the government. According to one version that I got to hear in Dushanbe, the vice premier's removal was a carefully planned provocation by Rakhmonov supporters. The organizers of the murder achieved their end. Dialogue between the authorities and the opposition is on the verge of breakdown. It can be predicted with certainty that all Russian diplomacy's efforts will be aimed at ensuring that talks do nevertheless take place. From Moscow's standpoint it it is essential above all to agree a cease-fire. The political settlement mechanism has not yet been defined. Russia is urging that elections involving the opposition be held as soon as possible; however, there are grounds for thinking that Rakhmonov and his team are not very keen on this. According to the experts, if elections are held Rakhmonov and the Kulyab grouping, which supports him, are almost certain to lose. An opposition victory is also unlikely. The influential and numerous Leninabad clan has the greatest chance of success. Its representatives in the Tajik leadership are ready for elections. The next few weeks will show whether these people are able to influence Rakhmonov and prompt him to make a compromise. In the opinion of an informed Russian Foreign Ministry staffer who asked to remain anonymous, time is working in favor of those who support elections and mutual concessions: "The military confrontation cannot go on for ever. People's patience is running out. The collapse of the Tajik economy has reached dire proportions. Only the end of fighting and political stabilization can create the conditions necessary to normalize the situation. Otherwise, Tajikistan will break up. And that is understood by the leaders of both the belligerent sides." As far as Moscow is concerned, the last thing it wants is to be dragged into a long-drawn-out, Afghanistan-type conflict. Neither the diplomats nor the military cherish any illusions: It is impossible to destroy the Tajik opposition detachments operating from Afghan territory. The confrontation between them and Russian border guards threatens to bring new Russian casualties and cause a welling-up of discontent in the country and huge material losses. "The Tajik problems cannot be resolved militarily. All hope is pinned on dialogue between the authorities and the opposition. I hope it will prove fruitful," Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces in Tajikistan, told journalists. Neither Russia nor the other Commonwealth members committed to protecting the Tajik-Afghan border are hurrying to send the promised reinforcements. According to Pyankov, only Kazakhstan has brought its border contingent up to full strength. Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kirgiziya [Kyrgyzstan] have yet to do this. The Russian border detachments are made up of 70 percent Tajiks right now. That figure will become even larger in the immediate future. Rakhmonov has promised Kozyrev that another 5,000 Tajik draftees will be sent to the border. Moscow is gradually transferring the protection of the border with Afghanistan to the Tajiks themselves. However, it is most likely that this process will drag on and that the white, blue, and red flag will fly over the border posts on the southern marches of Tajikistan for a long while yet. "Russia's special role in Tajikistan is not a whim on our part but an inescapable fact. I told this to Secretary of State Christopher in Vladivostok. If we leave Tajikistan, chaos will ensure here. Look what happened in neighboring Afghanistan. We cannot allow that. All attempts to violate the border will be stopped in the most resolute fashion. There is no point in the opposition's trying to put our endurance to the test; it is better to rely on peace talks," Kozyrev told the journalists accompanying him on his visit.
