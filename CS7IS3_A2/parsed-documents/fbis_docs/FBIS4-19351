For good reason. When drafting strategies for the election campaign, the candidate for chancellor arrived at the conclusion months ago that he must "deprive the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] of the illusion" that it can brand him as a foreign-policy amateur and thus as a risk for German security. In fact, foreign policy will not play a major role in the election campaign, but Scharping knows that in a neck-and-neck race foreign skepticism concerning his policies might supply the CDU with ammunition. Trying to prevent this on the basis of the slogan that good and well-informed friends do not say bad things about oneself, Scharping decided to visit the Commission of the European Union in Brussels, Paris, Prague, Washington, New York, Warsaw, and the NATO headquarters. He introduces himself and promises continuity in German foreign policy. He spent five full days in the United States to convince political and economic figures there. He did not go there without any fears. A cool reception and a critical press would have been a pleasure for his rival Helmut Kohl. Anticipating such a turn of events, Juergen Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group, maliciously predicted a great humiliation for Scharping because the Social Democratic Party [SPD] is "unable to pursue a responsible policy within the alliance," and because it would "completely abandon the Western community" together with the Greens. This only makes the Atlantic-minded Scharping laugh. Yet he was nervous about how things would go. Only when he had returned from his meeting with President Bill Clinton, did he look relaxed. "All went off really well," he stated repeatedly and ordered a cold beer in the press room of the Watergate Hotel. "This will support the current strong process of relaxation," he stated. Contented, he stretched on a sofa and admitted: "I feel much better now than on Sunday evening." However, it became clear after his arrival on Sunday [10 April] that both Social Democratic fears and Christian Democrat hopes were unjustified. Scharping's reception was open and friendly -- the American way. Yet there was a little more to it that was not noticeable when former SPD chancellor candidates like Johannes Rau, Hans Jochen Vogel, and Oskar Lafontaine visited the United States: Curiosity combined with attention that, between the White House and Capitol, is only devoted to those who have political weight or who are expected to assume a high office soon. The candidate found open doors everywhere. With Clinton, he had a "surprisingly friendly and informal conversation," Scharping stated. The same is true of the meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and Defense Secretary William Perry. Senior Senate officials and congressmen took their time, and when Scharping gave a speech at an event jointly organized by the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation and the U.S. Institute for Contemporary German Studies, the room was packed. In New York, the Social Democrats met with important bankers, industrialists, and top journalists. As a senior official put it, they all wanted to "get to know the man who leads Kohl in the polls," and whom prior to his visit the major papers NEW YORK TIMES and WASHINGTON POST had benevolently described as Kohl's possible successor and the German Clinton. That certainly impressed the White House. Scharping is pleased about the comparison with Clinton. "In fact, we are examining what Clinton has initiated in the United States." He sees common interests, a common "way of thinking" in environmental and tax policies, and, above all, there is the joint conviction that a country can only be stable and act in a responsible way in foreign policy if it is internally stable -- which is not possible if unemployment is high. This is a language that builds bridges and is understood by the Americans. It has become known as "new thinking," and a new generation of politicians is emerging. Scharping and Clinton are about the same age, both protested against the war in Vietnam -- the SPD chairman was even temporarily excluded from his party because of that in 1968 -- and both were influenced by the policies of the 1960's and 1970's. Bob Bradley, a Democratic Senator from New Jersey, has described his friend Scharping as the "most prominent politician of the German postwar generation." Yet, despite the things that Clinton and Scharping have in common, Washington does not hide the fact that it is interested in a stable and predictable German Government -- no matter who leads it. Kohl's advantage over Scharping is that he is well-known at the White House, and that the U.S. Administration believes that it is able to judge him correctly. During a dinner hosted in honor of the candidate, appreciation was expressed, but also fears concerning Germany's future: It might not master unification, it might try to pursue its own paths, and it might lose its stability. Moreover, a Chancellor Scharping might be forced by his party to adopt a foreign-policy course that he does not like. There are people like Lafontaine and some others who are not so dedicated to the West and NATO, it was pointed out. It is these fears, which were only voiced very cautiously and in a friendly way in the United Sates, but which the CDU might turn into heavy weapons in the election campaign, that prompt Scharping to tour the world. He is hammering his foreign policy credo into the heads of politicians and journalists as though he wanted to cut it into granite: Friendship with the United States, Germany's integration in the European Union, NATO's continued and "indispensable" existence, and aid for the development of stable democracies in Russia and the Central and East European countries. To convince even the last doubters, Scharping simply invented a new law -- that of the continuity of German foreign policy. Thus, Social Democratic Chancellors Brandt and Schmidt continued Adenauer's world policy and developed their ostpolitik on this basis. The current chancellor then continued the ostpolitik "in a completely correct manner." The next chancellor will keep this good tradition. Scharping prepared his trip to the United States systematically. Largely unnoticed by the government and the public, he started establishing personal contacts and using the existing ones after his election as SPD chairman. Only when the French expressed appreciation of this with the statement by the French ambassador to Bonn that President Francois Mitterrand considers Scharping an "excellent man," did the government wake up painfully. At the security meeting in Munich on 5 February, Scharping clearly supported the Atlantic orientation in his speech, which was carefully read in Washington -- and approved of, as the meeting with Clinton and Christopher showed. What occasionally seems to be a solo effort by the party leader is supported by the SPD leadership. Scharping skillfully combined the different foreign policy schools in a group that advises him and must therefore be loyal. The group includes figures like Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Hans Ulrich Klose, Norbert Gansel, and Karsten Voigt. For many years, the SPD presented a picture of a party quarreling over foreign-policy issues, but now it shows discipline. Nobody "has had to give up his contours," Scharping claims. However, the picture "again has a frame and a center." He leaves no doubt as to who the center is. For simple minds, he quotes a soccer rule: "No discussions are allowed on the ground." So far, his coplayers have observed the rule. Scharping fears only one thing: That one of them might get "dragged into a discussion" by the CDU whether a government consisting of Greens and Social Democrats might adopt a different foreign policy. Those who enter into such a debate "weaken the SPD's opportunities," he stated with a threatening undertone. Yet this is exactly what the CDU intends to do, now that the Free Democratic Party has said it wants to continue the current coalition, depriving the SPD of one possible constellation for a coalition. Scharping is aware of the danger that the SPD might sink together with the Greens in a boat during the election campaign. Therefore, he announced in the United States that the Greens' resolutions on NATO and the Bundeswehr are "nonsense" to which he will never agree. After his five-day visit to the United States, Scharping radiates the security of a candidate who feels confident about his complicated foreign-policy flank. The only time he still reacts brusquely is when asked about Bundeswehr participation in international missions. First, the SPD supports all UN operations that can realistically be expected in the next 10 years, he usually replies. Second, he and the SPD will not back missions like the Gulf War, and third, he is tired of the typical German debates about hypothetical reactions to hypothetical situations. As though trying to dispel all doubts about his rejection of war missions, Scharping visited the Vietnam Memorial -- as he always does when he is in Washington. The names of the over 50,000 soldiers who fell in Vietnam are engraved in black stone. The polished stone reflects the images of the visitors. "In this way, one can see one's own picture when reading the names of the dead," Scharping stated, shaking his head about those who advocate the participation of the Bundeswehr in wars.
