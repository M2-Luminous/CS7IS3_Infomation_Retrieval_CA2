The cabinet has thus cleared the way for a complete privatization of Lufthansa, Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian Democratic Union) told the Bundestag. The privatization is a milestone on the path toward securing the company's competitiveness. Agreement on the pension claims came about in early May. Finance Minister Waigel said he is prepared to provide 1.5 billion marks for Lufthansa employees. As the Federal Government does not wish to participate in the impending increase in share capital, its proportion of Lufthansa shares will fall to under 50 percent. The agreement on a new company pension arrangement for the 48,000 or so Lufthansa employees was concluded on 10 May.
