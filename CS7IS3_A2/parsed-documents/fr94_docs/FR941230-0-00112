By amending §232.311 by revising paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) and in paragraphs (e), (f) and (g), by replacing the references to ``Form S&hyph;E'' with references to ``Form SE'', and in paragraph (h)(2), by revising the reference ``paragraphs (a) through (c)'' to read ``paragraphs (a) through (g)'' to read as follows: §232.311 Documents submitted in paper under cover of Form SE. * * * * * (b) Exhibits to a Commission schedule filed pursuant to Section 13 or 14(d) of the Exchange Act may be filed in paper under cover of Form SE where such exhibits previously were filed in paper (prior to a registrant's becoming subject to mandated electronic filing or pursuant to a hardship exemption) and are required to be refiled pursuant to the schedule's general instructions. (c) Exhibits consisting of all or portions of an annual statement provided to state insurance regulators ( e.g., Schedules O and P), required to be filed pursuant to Item 601(b)(28) of Regulation S&hyph;B or Regulation S&hyph;K (§228.601(b)(28) or §229.601(b)(28) of this chapter, respectively), may be filed in paper under cover of Form SE.

By amending §232.901 by adding a note to paragraph (a), by adding a note to paragraph (c)(4), by revising the heading and introductory text of paragraph (d), and by revising paragraph (d)(2), to read as follows: §232.901 Division of Corporation Finance EDGAR Transition. (a) *␣*␣* Note to paragraph (a): Registrants become subject to mandated electronic filing on their phase-in date. Consequently, all documents required to be filed in electronic format pursuant to Rule 101 of Regulation S&hyph;T (§232.101) filed on or after a registrant's phase-in date must be filed electronically, absent a hardship exemption, even if the transaction to which a filing relates was commenced in paper before the phase-in date and is still in process on the registrant's phase-in date. See Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S&hyph;T, that provides for optional paper filing of a Form 10&hyph;K or 10&hyph;KSB if it is the first document filed after a registrant's phase-in date. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* Note to paragraph (c)(4): While companies subject to mandated electronic filing generally may choose to electronically file Schedules 13D and 13G with respect to a paper filer, domestic electronic filers are restricted from doing so with respect to foreign private issuers because EDGAR currently requires an IRS tax identification number to be inserted for the subject company as a prerequisite to acceptance of the filing. Such filings should be made in paper until the EDGAR system is modified to process them electronically. * * * * *
