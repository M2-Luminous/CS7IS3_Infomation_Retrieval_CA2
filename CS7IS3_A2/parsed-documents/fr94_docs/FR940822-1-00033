FR940822-1-00033 FR940822-1-00006 (2) Recommended that the NRC give examples of acceptable institutional controls for providing reasonable assurance that specified dose limits are not exceeded; and (3) Requested that the NRC publish guidance on determination of necessary financial assurance for proper control and maintenance of a site. Some commenters recommended that the NRC adopt a dose level below 100 mrem per year as the upper dose limit in the event of failure of the applied institutional controls. Still other commenters stated that the 100 mrem per year restriction could foreclose onsite disposal of wastes as presently permitted at uranium mill tailings sites and that this restriction should be deleted. Several commenters requested that the NRC better address the issue of consolidation and long-term care of wastes at sites not suitable for restricted release. One commenter said that engineered disposal cells might be the best solution for sites with large quantities of slightly contaminated soils, while another said that large volumes of slightly contaminated soil with a few ``hot spots'' should be regarded as homogeneously contaminated. Response. The NRC believes that the rule should provide for both unrestricted release and for restricted release of sites. Additionally, there may be sites that will have to continue under license. The NRC is issuing guidance, first in draft form for comment, on how it expects to implement the provision for restricted release. The 100 ␣mrem/y restriction is designed to establish an upper bound on the risk in the unlikely event of failure of institutional controls or restrictions at the site. This restriction is also designed to ensure that license termination under restricted conditions does not result in a proliferation of de facto disposal sites. The Commission believes that 100 mrem/y is an adequately conservative upper bound. This dose corresponds to the maximum annual dose during the first 1000 years following decommissioning. In many cases, the peak dose occurs during the first year following decommissioning. For these cases, the predicted dose levels will be reduced by radioactive decay so that if institutional controls or restrictions at the site were to fail some time in the future the actual public dose would be substantially below 100 mrem/y in most cases. In cases where buildup of radioactive daughter products or other conditions cause the peak dose to fall other than in the first year after decommissioning, the predicted dose levels are significantly below 100 mrem/y for the large majority of the first 1000 years after decommissioning. The issue of an appropriate value for the dose in the unlikely event of failure of institutional controls has been a key point of the ongoing discussions between the EPA and the NRC. As noted in section entitled ``Rationale for the Proposed Rule'' of this Statement of Considerations, the Commission is specifically soliciting comment on the appropriateness of this value, and the impacts associated with the selection of other values such as 75 mrem/yr. Disposal of tailings and soil cleanup at milling sites is regulated under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). The impact of the dose limit on unique practices at uranium mill tailings sites may require case-by-case consideration in the interest of consistency with current regulation of tailings under UMTRCA. 11. Waste Disposal Comment. A commenter stated that waste disposal issues must be discussed in the EIS. Some commenters stated that the criteria do not seem to recognize and should more adequately consider the non-linear increase in waste volumes at low concentrations of radioactive materials. Several commenters stated that the NRC should consider allowing for some decommissioning under restricted conditions with on-site emplacement, storage, and monitoring of radioactive wastes. Several commenters stated that previously-buried wastes should be cleaned up at the time of decommissioning consistent with the generic cleanup standard. Several others disagreed, saying that it is ``unfair'' or unnecessary to include these previously-buried wastes. Agreement State commenters were concerned over the adequacy of the space at regional disposal facilities for the large amount of material to be generated from the decommissioned sites. The concern was enforced by the lack of a GEIS to review and assertion that data used in the EIS for 10 CFR Part 61 is over 10 years old. Response. Waste disposal issues, including matters of the relationships between waste volumes and cleanup levels, are discussed in the GEIS. The Commission maintains its position that public and environmental risk is an overriding factor that requires the consideration of the removal of previously-buried wastes as a part of decommissioning. Even though a previous burial was carried out within the regulatory requirements at an operating site, the potential differences in conditions between the site as operated and as decommissioned require such consideration. The requirements for previously-buried wastes are consistent with the Commission's established regulatory practice for decommissioning under the Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP). The proposed rule requires an analysis of site-specific overall risks, costs, and benefits in deciding, for individual sites, whether or not the exhumation and removal of previously-buried wastes is required. 12. Minimizing Generation of Waste Comment. The NRC staff draft contained a section on minimization of contamination. Most commenters supported the concept of minimization of contamination, but several industry commenters preferred not to include the proposed provisions in the rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning. Industry commenters stated that these concepts do not need to be put in regulations because waste minimization and hence, minimization of contamination, is commonplace in the nuclear industry and is driven by such economic incentives as reduction of disposal costs. Some commenters recommended that the NRC publish guidelines for public comment on the actions that licensees are expected to take in minimizing the production or release of contamination, and that the NRC should similarly publish for public comment the criteria it will use to determine if licensee proposals are acceptable. Response. The Commission agrees that existing ALARA programs and the cost of radioactive waste disposal provide sufficient incentive to minimize radioactive waste. Therefore, requiring licensees to redesign existing facilities or amend already approved radiation protection procedures is unnecessary and would not result in any substantial improvement in public safety. Therefore, §20.1408 (b) and (c) have been deleted from the proposed rule. However, the Commission believes that there may be substantial potential to reduce contamination, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize generation of radioactive waste if special consideration is given to these issues when designing new facilities. Therefore, §20.1408(a) has been retained. 13. Radon Comment. Those submitting written comments mostly agreed with not establishing a separate standard for radon. Commenters noted, however, that sites contaminated with radon-bearing-or-producing materials may have great difficulty meeting the proposed dose goal and limit in the staff's draft. Response. The Commission believes that a separate standard for radon is not needed and that NRC guidance being issued in support of the rulemaking will provide licensees with sufficient information concerning measurement problems that are associated with background radon. Additional comments are invited with respect to the problem of determining compliance with the NRC's radiological criteria at sites contaminated with processed radon-bearing-or-producing materials. 14. Recycle Comment. One commenter said that all ``radioactivity'' from licensed use should be contained and not recycled. Another said that recycling should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Response. The Commission believes the radiological criteria for recycling is outside the intended scope of this rule but will be addressed in a future rule. In the interim, the Commission will continue to review this action on a case-by-case basis. 15. Comments Related to Definitions Comment. There were a number of questions concerning definition of terms used in the draft rule. There were also several suggestions for additions, deletions, or revisions to existing definitions in the draft rule, and there were some suggested new definitions. Questions were raised concerning the use of terms such as, ``affected parties,'' ``significant,'' ``average member,'' ``cumulative TEDE,'' ``decommissioning goal,'' ``unrestricted use,'' and ``net public or environmental harm.'' Some commenters objected to including fallout in the definition of background radiation. Others agreed with the proposed definition or proposed various additions, revisions, or deletions to the definition, e.g., to change the wording starting with the current words ``global fallout'' to ``global fallout from the testing of nuclear explosive devices or from past nuclear accidents.'' Several commenters said that the term ``residual radioactivity'' needs clarification with respect to materials discharged from the site in accordance with other provisions of the regulations in 10 CFR Part 20. Response. The practical implication of these terms and others in the proposed rule have been clarified in the guidance which accompanies the proposed rule. With regard to ``background radiation,'' the new definition is the same as the existing definition except for the addition of the words ``or from past nuclear accidents like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and are not under the control of the licensee'' after ``explosive devices'' in order to explicitly recognize that radioactivity from past nuclear accidents contributes to background radiation. Because the remaining wording has been adequate in the past, the Commission sees no reason to further revise the definition at this time. The Commission agrees that the proposed definition of ``residual radioactivity'' in §20.1003 was not clear with respect to materials discharged at the site in accordance with other provisions of 10 CFR Part 20. The definition has been revised to clarify the Commission's intent.
