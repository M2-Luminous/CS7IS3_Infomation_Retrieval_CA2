The Hata government, which is charged with the important task of patching up the sour Japan-U.S. relations, is expected to be able to avoid facing a crisis situation for the time being. The Clinton administration has dropped part of its trade demands on Japan largely because of the U.S. domestic situation, giving the impression that Japan has benefited from a faulty policy on the part of the United States. It is indispensable for the Hata government to frame a new macroeconomic policy, including reforming the current tax system, to make the July round of Japan-U.S. summit talks a success, but the Hata government will run into the difficult task of coordinating domestic views. Doubts have been raised about Prime Minister Hata's ability to handle Japan-U.S. relations because his government is a fragile minority government, and his ability will be tested from now on. The prime minister intends to come to grips with reforming the current tax system with the aim of dealing with tax cuts and tax increases as a package on the political front, while watching progress in Japan-U.S. working-level trade talks on individual sectors for the time being. The February Japan-U.S. summit talks were broken off in the wake of former Prime Minister Hosokawa's failure to push for the "national welfare tax," causing the Clinton administration to distrust the Hosokawa government. The prime minister, therefore, has seen the macroeconomic policy as a trump card to break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. relations. Opposition parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, however, will undoubtedly resist raising the rate of consumption tax as a means of securing financial resources to make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting from continued tax cuts. If legislators move against raising the rate of consumption tax for fear of a backlash from voters at a time when the political situation is moving toward dissolving the House of Representative and holding general elections, this would make it even harder for the prime minister to decide on "raising the rate of consumption tax." Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry is vehemently opposed to cutting the income tax prior to raising the rate of consumption tax. If the prime minister intends to stimulate the economy by adding the planned amount for the public investment prior to the Naples Summit, he would face even more difficulty. The prime minister has repeatedly expressed his intention of working out plans for revamping the current tax system and relaxing bureaucratic regulations by the end of June, but the current Diet ordinary session will end in late June. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party and other parties are taking the offensive against the Hata government by suggesting that they will submit a nonconfidence motion against the Hata government to the Diet, and there is a possibility that their offensive against the Hata government can heighten tensions in the political situation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai once stated, "With regard to the macroeconomic policy, it is possible to break a deadlock over the policy only by making a decision affecting the entire political situation." How far will the prime minister be able to exercise his leadership in coordinating domestic views on the policy amid the political turmoil? The prime minister has no reason to feel at ease although the United States has softened its trade stance on Japan.
