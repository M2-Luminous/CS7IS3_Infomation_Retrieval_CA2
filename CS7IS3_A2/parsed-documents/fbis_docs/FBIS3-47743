The US admiral informed the Vietnamese leader of the results of his exchanges of views and working sessions with the Vietnamese side on the solving of the MIA issue. He expressed his sincere thanks to the government and people of Vietnam for their effective cooperation with the US armymen and officials who were engaged in searching for US servicemen missing in action during the Vietnam War. He also expressed his wish that in the coming time, with the efforts and cooperation of both sides, further progress would be made in that field, so that the two countries could soon open a new chapter in their relations. Speaking to his guest, President Le Duc Anh appreciated Admiral Larson's goodwill, and he said he believed that being responsible for the MIA issue to the president and the defence minister of the US, Mr Larson would have first hand information on the solving of the MIA issue in Vietnam and country's efforts in this field while it still met with many difficulties due to the heavy aftermaths of the war. President Le Duc Anh affirmed that starting from the humanitarian tradition, the state and people of Vietnam were cooperating with the US side in the settlement of the MIA issue, and were ready to close the past and look to the future in their relations with the US for the benefits of the two countries and for peace, stability, and development in the region and on the world over as a whole. Earlier, Admiral Larson was received by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Thoi Bung. He had talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai on matters of common concern. The US admiral left Hanoi this afternoon to visit an excavation site in central Vietnam before concluding his Vietnam visit.
