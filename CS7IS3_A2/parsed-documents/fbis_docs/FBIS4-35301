He said that the stand adopted by Jordan --king, government and people -- is a principled stand based on the nation's interest in unity. [passage omitted] On future prospects, the possibility of internationalizing the crisis, and on Arab countries' recognition of the secession, Dr. al-Lawzi said: I do not believe any Arab country will dare to publicly recognize the secession. [passage omitted] Al-Lawzi said: If some try to create problems abroad for Yemeni unity and legitimacy then the situation will have to be expeditiously settled in a military manner no matter the cost. However, I have to say that there are signs of a political solution through reaching an understanding with the unionist elements within the Yemeni Socialist Party. This factor, in addition to the Yemeni command's desire to avoid large numbers of civilian casualties, postpones the military option. [passage omitted]
