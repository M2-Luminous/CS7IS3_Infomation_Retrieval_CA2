One time it says it is going to give precedence to the Syrian track over the other tracks, and other times it says it is going to focus on making the self-rule negotiations in Taba a success because it cannot divide its interests and make concessions on two tracks all at once. While Rabin announced Israel's agreement to the "principle" of withdrawing from the Arab Syrian Golan Heights, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres warned the Palestinians that Israel may give precedence to its negotiations with Syria over the negotiations with the PLO. He said: "We have several options, and we can change direction by moving from the Palestinian track to the Syrian track, whereas the Palestinians have no other option." These Israeli threats would not have been made had it not been for the present regrettable estrangement between the Syrian and Palestinian sides since the announcement of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Just as the Israeli Government is trying to exploit the Palestinian side's weakness, it is also using the same maneuvers with the Syrian side and trying to undermine the successful summit meeting held in Geneva last Sunday between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Israeli response to the Syrian commitment to peace and to all its results--like exchanging ambassadors and trade relations and opening borders in return for Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories--was suspicious and cautious. It is represented in the prime minister's statement about conducting a referendum before agreeing to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Proposing the referendum idea is part of the old Israeli tactic designed to thwart any Arab peace plan. Rabin's government knows well that the Syrian president has put the ball in its court, as attested by the leader of the sole superpower in the world, the United States. It is trying to get out of this dilemma by looking for ways out that enable it to play for time and to obstruct the driving force resulting from the Geneva meeting, hence it has come out with the referendum idea. Thus all that is being said in Israeli circles about disagreements over this question is merely a kind of throwing dust in the eyes. So all these Israeli maneuvers should not fool the Arabs, especially the Palestinians and the Syrians. Because it is untrue that they have no other options as Rabin and Peres say. On the contrary, the Arabs of the occupied territories and the men of the Islamic national resistance in southern Lebanon are daily carrying out the most important option through their daring operations against the occupation. What is required is to restore organized coordination among the Arab parties participating in the peace process as soon as possible in order to close any gap through which the Israeli may infiltrate to sabotage the peace process and exploit Arab contradictions and differences.
