Why did the negotiations take so long? They started almost immediately after Lithuania regained independence in 1991. [Brazauskas] Everyone both in Poland and in Lithuania knows the historical contacts between our states and nations. For ages everything has happened between us--both good and bad things. Therefore, the discussion was difficult and protracted. The treaty negotiations were held in special circumstances. There is a certain category of people who think--I would say--that they love their homeland more than others. These people react in a very special way to anything that occurs in interstate relations. Not only with Poland, even though this problem really causes the greatest emotions. I also mean the relations with Russia. [Narbutt] However, was it really not possible to complete the work on the treaty earlier? Was it not possible to abandon the demand of condemning "the Polish occupation of the Vilnius area" earlier? Everyone expected the new Lithuanian authorities to be more pragmatic than the nationalistic Sajudis; everyone expected that the negotiations would be accelerated. [Brazauskas] When the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party came to power after last year's presidential elections, relat point. [incomplete word, sentence as published]. Both parties had to take certain steps to find a solution that would be acceptable. This is when I realized that one cannot look into the past and that Poland did not want that. Let us look into the future, let us think about the future. If everyone in Europe thought about the past--and in the past terrible things happened, such as World War I, World War II, the revolution, and civil wars--it would not be possible to live a normal life. [Narbutt] You said much earlier that as far as Polish- Lithuanian relations are concerned, one should look into the future. You said this after the parliamentary elections, which your party won, in the fall of 1992. [Brazauskas] A treaty is not agreed upon overnight, or within a month. When I became president, lying on my desk was a Lithuanian draft of the treaty which differed a lot from the one that will actually be signed. There were fundamental differences. Step by step we were removing the controversies that existed between Poland and Lithuania. The treaty that President Walesa and I will sign will be assessed by historians, and future generations as well. They will evaluate the importance of the treaty, its significance for both our states and for Europe. [Narbutt] The treaty with Poland was a subject of an internal political game in Lithuania. The government found itself under strong pressure from the rightist opposition, which demanded that the treaty include formulations which Poland could not accept. Do you not fear difficulties that may arise when it comes to the ratification in the Lithuanian parliament, as well as a wave of protests against the treaty, in which the past was referred to in one general statement about both countries' sorrow because of the use of force. [Brazauskas] There are certain people, certain organizations that do not like the treaty. We have already started to explain to them why the treaty must be signed. There was no other solution--we had to regulate the relations with Poland. If need be, we will explain this over and over again, until this gets across to them. I do not think there will be any serious problems related to the treaty, any major protests. I would also like to stress that the treaty guarantees the interests of all the citizens of our states, irrespective of their nationality. [Narbutt] Some of the Lithuanian politicians say out loud that "those who oppose the treaty with Poland push Lithuania into the arms of Russia." What do you think of such a statement? [Brazauskas] Yes, I do agree with it in a way. In general, all disputes, all the misunderstandings between Poland and Lithuania clearly serve someone. Now, Lithuania wants to go, and is going, in the direction of the West, toward the European structures: NATO, European Union, Council of Europe. I want to reiterate this: establishing relations with Poland is of great importance to us. [Narbutt] The initialing of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has been received with satisfaction in the declaration that ended the recent summit meeting of the presidents of the Baltic Republics in Palanga. It was also stated there that the treaty should be the first step to shorten the distance between the Baltic states and the Visegrad Group. [Brazauskas] The four states of the Visegrad Group have developed more than we have. This results from the most recent history. The states united in the Warsaw Pact had more possibilities at their disposal than those states that were incorporated in the USSR. We want to be similar to you. Not only Lithuania, but also all the other Baltic Republics are interested in cooperation with the Visegrad Group--both political and economic cooperation. [Narbutt] It seems that since the last elections the situation in Russia has been heading in a dangerous direction. What is your attitude toward the Russian foreign policy, toward the statements by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the Baltic states and toward the theory of "close foreign states," as well as the "special interests" of Russia in the Baltic states? [Brazauskas] What right does Russia have to make any claims to other states? Russia is a member of almost all the international organizations. It wants to be admitted to the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe demands high democratic standards. Such a test must be passed. We have already passed it--we have been admitted. Such statements are unacceptable, absolutely inadmissible in today's world. And they cannot be put into effect as well. If they cannot be implemented, why say such things? In order to frighten someone? Who needs this? Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have never volunteered to join the USSR. They were invaded. This is how it should be understood; any claims, speaking about zones of interest are out of place. Russia has taken such a strange approach not only toward the Baltic states, but also toward other countries. [Narbutt] The concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad Oblast must be cause for European concern, Lech Walesa stated during his recent visit to Latvia. This brought about an angry reaction from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Soon afterward General Grachev, Russian minister of defense, stated that the Kalinigrad Oblast is "a special defense zone" of Russia. Does Lithuania have similar concerns as Poland does? [Brazauskas] The Kaliningrad Oblast should be demilitarized. I agree with President Walesa. The concentration of troops always causes misgivings--I discussed this at the forum of the UN General Assembly. The special location of the Kalinigrad Oblast should be used economically, not militarily. Maintaining its military outpost by Russia in the west is not understandable, all the more so because Russia wants to join the "Partnership for Peace." [Narbutt] As the second post-communist state, after Albania, Lithuania officially applied for NATO membership. As it is known, none of the states of our region have a chance to be admitted to NATO very soon. [Brazauskas] We are not so naive as to believe that once we submit our motion, we will be admitted right away. We like the idea of the "Partnership for Peace" as an intermediate stage on the road to NATO. If the "Partnership" is joined by various states, it will not be indispensable for us to join NATO immediately. The dangers, which might exist in the international relations are automatically smaller. The "Partnership" will create a new security system. I am definitely in favor of Russia's signing the "Partnership." Then it would be possible to look differently at many issues that we have mentioned. [Narbutt] Before the presidential elections, you told RZECZPOSPOLITA that the president should be a man who restores agreement, reconciles those who are at odds. You have not managed to do that, have you? In the speech that summed up the previous year you said many bitter words about the opposition. [Brazauskas] Representatives of the opposition have only just left my office. They often come to me and we talk. As far as the moods among the Lithuanian opposition are concerned, it must be remembered that they are quite peculiar. These are people who have done an awful lot for Lithuania; they helped Lithuania regain independence. They were supported by masses; they were not only in power, but on a pedestal as well. And then they lost. However, it is not all that bad. There is social peace--even though we have many difficulties, such as low wages and low living standards. There is no hatred, no open conflicts. The opposition in Lithuania has every possibility of presenting its views. Have you noticed how extraordinarily democratic Lithuania is? The opposition is shown on television probably more frequently than those who are in power. [Narbutt] Yes, indeed. And it often attacks you. Despite the attacks of the opposition, you are invariably the most popular politician of Lithuania. In all the opinion polls you occupy the first position, then for a long time there is no one. [Brazauskas] For the time being. [Narbutt] It is definitely difficult for you to talk about this, but how could you define the reasons for such popularity? [Brazauskas] Popularity. I am wondering about it myself. Sociologists should answer this question; however, they only conduct polls. Now, why is it that one politician is backed by 52-54 percent of the people, and another is supported by 6 percent? I do not know. I am not concealing my biography--everyone knows it. I was a member of the party. Just like many others. I was elected the first secretary of the party when the movement of national rebirth started in Lithuania. Sajudis supported me. They saw something in me, they believed in me. At the first congress of Sajudis I was received as a kind of a hero. [Narbutt] Does your political past never disturb you? [Brazauskas] Membership in the party is a real burden for me. I knew that it would be so as soon as I was elected president. [Narbutt] However, most Lithuanians do not evaluate you that harshly. I am again coming back to your popularity. [Brazauskas] I am over 60 and I sometimes look back. A few years ago no one knew me, that is, the people did not know me, except the people that I worked with--those linked to the industry. Then it simply happened. Perhaps I said certain things louder and more boldly than others. Yes, certainly louder and more boldly. I was attacked for not saying right at the beginning that Lithuania should be fully independent. Well, I wanted each step to be fully considered. It had to be fully considered and it was. [Narbutt] Your greatest success and your greatest failure. [Brazauskas] Someone might say that my greatest success is that I am the president. I do not agree with that. It is not a success; it is responsibility. The most recent period in the history of Lithuania began in 1988--it was the beginning of the fight to regain independence. There were various moments. Also a moment when we--I mean, my party--were down at the very bottom. The greatest success was that when we came to power over a year ago, we managed to continue the reforms--but not at the cost of the man in the street. This is very important. Nothing can happen at the cost of the people; the entire burden of the reforms should not rest on their shoulders. So far we have not spoiled anything; at any rate, the situation is certainly not worse. What will happen next--we will see. Life does not end with one party. Anything may happen. Maybe new forces will emerge...
