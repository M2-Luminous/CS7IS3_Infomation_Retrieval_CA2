Ulmanis pledged to make up his mind in few days and inform the parliament presidium about his decision. Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs claims that the plenary session would be "useless." In his opinion, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's April 5 decree on the setup of military bases was "a deliberate action" that excludes the option of immediate signature of the initialed agreement. As reported, the extraordinary plenary session was proposed by Ulmanis and Birkavs. Ulmanis also told BNS he was not satisfied with the apologies by Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh who called the incident as "a technical mistake." In Ulmanis' words, rush decisions should be avoided because the situation in Latvia is highly complicated. "I need at least 24 hours to reason it all," he said.
