"We would very much welcome the opportunity to continue discussion at an appropriate time," Robert Rubin, director of the White House National Economic Council, said. Rubin made the remarks following reports from Tokyo that Japan's ruling coalition parties have decided to back Tsutomu Hata, currently the foreign minister, as their candidate to replace outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. A vote by Japan's parliament is scheduled for Monday. Rubin told reporters he is aware that Hata has been chosen as the prime ministerial candidate, but declined to comment whether Hata's elevation to the prime ministership would bring changes to the troubled U.S.-Japan economic relations. "We have enormous respect for Japan... Our relations with Japan are extremely important to us in all respects, including economics," Rubin said. In an address he made earlier in the day to a group of American business executives, Rubin reiterated that the U.S. is not seeking "quotas" or "market shares" for U.S. products in Japan. "We are dedicated to try to gain fair access to sell in Japan," he said.
