Information released by the Beijing Bureau of Statistics showed that prices rose by over 23 percent on average in the first quarter and the rising trend was continuing, resulting in heavy inflationary pressures being felt by residents. Delivering report on government work to the Congress, Mayor Li Qiyan said that prices for daily necessities had climbed too quickly in recent times. Representatives attending the meeting were convinced that the current rising prices were mainly seen in milk with a 33 percent hike last February and in fresh vegetables which registered a price increase of 37 percent. Prices rises in these two daily items triggered off price increases for other items. General workers and those working with enterprises cannot afford such prices and persons going into retirement or on leave received the greatest impact. Deputies to the municipal People's Congress strongly appealed to the municipal government for measures to bring the runaway prices under control. They asked for a clear picture on how much prices in Beijing would climb this year. Mr. Li and the executive vice mayor Mr. Wang Baosen told the deputies that the municipal government would take steps to curb prices from rising further. The measures include the powers of responsibility held by the mayor and heads of counties and districts. Great efforts in the food production programme will be made including the main agricultural by-products such as grains, oil, meat, eggs and milk to stabilize prices. The municipality will further open itself to the outside world to draw on more sources of goods. With the measures for price adjustment in place, the municipal authorities will strictly control the number of items for price reform this year. Prices inspection on two occasions will be carried out in the first half and second half of this year. The raising of prices by capitalizing on the price rise trend, the increasing of prices by individuals, price hikes under the pretext of increasing taxation and profiteering by raising prices have to be harshly punished. The enactment of laws and regulations countering the practice of making staggering profits is in full swing and will come into effect this year.
