Faction head Alexander Kirsteins, however, questioned the option as legally and technically impossible. The parliament may be dissolved exclusively by the president, according to the country's Constitution, said the faction's deputy head Andrejs Krastins. If one of the factions withdrew from the parliament, the president may be forced to consider the parliament's dissolution, said Krastins. LNNK has not discussed the resignation issue with other factions in the parliament's National Bloc yet but Lembergs predicted they could approve of the motion. The National Bloc dislikes the Latvian-Russian agreement for concession to Russia's demands of the Skrunda radar operation and the social guarantees to war pensioners in return for Aug. 31 as the withdrawal deadline. The National Bloc includes parliament factions of LNNK, Homeland and Freedom, Christian Democrats Union. They have been pressuring President Guntis Ulmanis and the parliament not to sign and ratify the agreement since it was initialed on March 15.
