De Leon, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new Honduran president, regretted that the bombings, blackouts, and some shootings, which took place in the capital last night, are creating tension in his country two days before the referendum. In Sunday's referendum, the people will decide whether to approve a series of constitutional reforms, the most important of which will allow new officials to be appointed to the Congress and to the Supreme Court this year. De Leon said he and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina share the goals of fighting corruption, drug trafficking, and poverty, as well as the search for peace and economic growth with social justice for everyone. The Guatemalan president noted that guerrillas have been active in his country over the past 30 years. He said his government will resume talks with the rebels in mid-February in a search for peace in the only Central American country where an armed conflict persists. De Leon Carpio said he hopes a peace agreement will be signed this year because a commitment has been made to the United Nations to achieve this goal. He also said that if the parties fail to reach an agreement, they would be showing a lack of commitment.
