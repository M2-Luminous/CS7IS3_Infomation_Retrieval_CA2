I must elaborate on this -- you call without looking at either the clock or the sheet on the calendar. He is practically always at his job, but if he is away on business, you can get information from his closest assistants. I did call: on Saturday and on Sunday, early in the morning and late at night, called without any special need for it. At first this "ordnung," so highly valued by Germans, delighted me, but later on (a shovel full!) I felt vaguely irritated. What is this, I thought, selfless devotion, sacrifice? Or a game? After all, it is not a fire brigade, nor a street stall -- it is a party, the Russian Free Labor Party (RPST), where Aleksandr Orlov is the secretary of the Organization Bureau. He immediately dispelled my doubts: "This staff of ours really does do a lot of work -- but not under duress, and not because of high wages. We all hold the same views, for us the work office is a political club. Who watches the clock in a club? I leave work, let's say, at one in the morning, and they ask me, with irony: is this free labor? Of course, I answer sincerely and very much in earnest: this is the freest labor." At this point it was hard for me to keep a straight face. The point is that Orlov's doctoral dissertation also touched on and included the problem of leisure. This was natural, though, and offered me grounds for my smile at the RPST. Everything else here is serious: the clear vision of goals and tasks, the clear-cut work of the staff.... We will go back to this, but for now, a little about the party. The RPST is one of the "oldest" in Russia -- it was created as far back as 1990. At that time it was a party of newly sprung-up entrepreneurs, cooperative workers and farmers. Hence its small size, and indeed, small fame. Last June, a "changing of the guard" took place at the congress -- Ivan Kivelidi was elected chairman, and Aleksandr Orlov headed the organizational bureau. Orlov: "several approaches to the party's future activity were proposed at the congress. The ones that won -- won".... The RPST changed not only its leaders, but also its orientation. Now it expresses interest in private ownership. I ask Orlov: [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, tell us precisely, how does the RPST differ from other entrepreneurial parties? From the Borovoy Party, let's suppose.... [Orlov] Roughly speaking, the Borovoy Party is a party of large capital, which we concede to it without a fight. In the sphere of our work, we have problems of ownership, problems of the middle class -- the very class which supports any state -- and which is destroyed in our country by the power of property owners who do not want to see that this is also destroying the country. [Nazarov] A "property owner" is a painfully eroded concept. What is the necessary property qualification for entrance into the party? [Orlov] Nothing like that. We regard as one of us everyone who is aware of the primary human need -- to freely acquire, possess and have at one's disposal one's own property. The value of the private property or business is of absolutely no importance to us: let it be an entire plant or a single share bought for a voucher, or intellectual property.... The main thing is the psychology of the owner. After all, you can be a very rich person and at the same time be a contemptible person.... [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, the RPST consists of 50 regional organizations. This looks like quite a wide-scale operation. But there are only 7,500 members.... [Orlov] This is not many? But why is this not many? Indeed, there are clearly not enough of these forces for public meetings, picketing and street fighting organizations, but revolutionary shocks are not incorporated in our strategy or our tactics. The party has grown recently, new people have come, and more will come -- without a doubt. We are interested not simply in the "growth of the ranks," but in qualitative growth. Let us say, the Vorkut miners persistently proposed Kivelidi as a candidate from their group for the former Supreme Soviet and the State Duma. The Cossack oblasts -- on the Don, the Kuban --give us good support. This does not at all mean that there are larger organizations there. For example, there is only one RPST member -- the director -- in the huge Uralmash Plant. Is this a lot or a few? Do we need another party committee at the plant? The RPST has true friends, and some of them are sometimes still allergic to the word "party." They do not want to legalize the membership (and they are acting correctly), but they are ours.... Of the well-known people I will name Oleg Tabakov, Vladimir Etush, Gennadiy Khazanov.... [Nazarov] You were not noticeable in the past pre-election campaign.... [Orlov] We took virtually no part in it. Why should we? Nevertheless, we have representatives in both houses of parliament, in the government, in the state duma. Indeed, at the present regional elections, the local organizations themselves decide: whether or not to put forward a candidate from the RPST. If yes -- we can finance the pre-election campaign, if not -- we do not insist. There are only 28 of our candidates standing for election throughout Russia. [Nazarov] If you don't mind, I would like to talk a bit about the party staff. I heard: The Volskiy Party almost copies the work of the CPSU staff. Even the furniture resembles it.... [Orlov] You see, after all, I too went through a period of work on the CPSU staff. This is a serious school, it helps me a great deal even now. In any case, I know how to organize staff work. I know to whom to offer a job and to whom not. For example, we don't need specialists in "pumping up" or "organizational work," we don't need fiery orators --none of these talents are called for in our work.... Our man should work with a computer, and not with a megaphone. [Nazarov] Whose talents can be called for in this case? How many are on the party staff? [Orlov] We have about 30 people working on the staff. Many are scholars: sociologists, economists, political scientists, philosophers. The task of today's staff member is expert service.... [Nazarov] Boast about your achievements. [Orlov] We have no special achievements yet, perhaps, but.... Long before 12 December, our sociologists predicted Zhirinovskiy's victory at the elections. They also predicted sufficient passivity from the electors. We are doing a great deal of interesting work now, as well. For example, we are following and analyzing the activity of almost 40 parties in Russia.... [Nazarov] Which of them have serious chances for success? [Orlov] This includes Zyurganov's party. After all, in our country they either reject it in a narrow-minded way, or extol it, without noticing that the party has serious and, in my opinion, progressive movements. They have not yet finished with extremism, but the directors are seriously looking at the social-democrat rails.... [Nazarov] This is noticeable from speaker Ivan Petrovich Rybkin. Can you really compare the Rybkin of today with what he was a year ago? [Orlov] Rybkin's past, I think, was superficial. The status of the man is changing, and his social role is changing. I say this to you as a specialist. [Nazarov] Aleksandr Sergeyevich, it is possible that in time the situation will change, but for the time being you belong to the category of small parties. You have no global tasks on your shoulders.... [Orlov] This is the purest delusion. We set ourselves only global tasks, and our staff works only on achieving them. [Nazarov] What are they, if it is no secret? [Orlov] It is no secret. We do not absolutely need to have our "own" president, a majority in the government or in parliament. We are striving for and will continue to strive for a change in the political system, since we consider the present one to be transitional. We want people not to afraid of the state, not to tremble for their property, for their business. We want the state to serve the interests of the property owner in good faith and truth -- with no dependence on which party gains the victory at the next elections. [Nazarov] This will happen? [Orlov] Absolutely. [Nazarov] I read your party documents carefully, and I did not find any RPST program in them. [Orlov] We simply don't have one. There cannot be one in the current changing situation. We have basic program units by which we are guided in our work. [Nazarov] All the same: how does the RPST differ from other parties --related and rival? [Orlov] To put it briefly, everyone knows what has to be done. But they do not know how! We do know ....
