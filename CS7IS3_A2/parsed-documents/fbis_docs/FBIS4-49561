The guideline for banking work this year remains: "Continuing to rectify the banking order, steadily advancing banking reform, strictly controlling the gross amount of credit, and effectively strengthening banking supervision and management." The regulations laid down last year have achieved great results, but should be further implemented this year, because many things have not been completed and have not been thoroughly solved. In addition, three requirements have been set for work this year. First, control the scale of investment in fixed assets by all possible means. In order to control the overall scale of investment, we must control the amount of bank credit offered to fixed-assets investment projects. Solid results must be achieved in this regard. The State Planning Commission will lay down an overall quota, and bank branches in every province must be subject to such quantitative limitations. The overall quantitative limit must not be exceeded by even one yuan, because this has a bearing on the national economy and the destiny of the nation. The scale of investment is already very large, and has gone beyond the capacity of our national strength. Therefore, the task for the banks this year is to tightly control the scale of fixed-assets investment. If they fail to do this, there will be big trouble in the overall situation of the national economy. Second, our specialized banks should be turned into commercial banks, and the first step will be taken this year. This will just be one step in the long process and is not a step which will complete the whole process. If no further loans are given to enterprises which operate in the red and fail to repay their debts, there could be unrest in society. There are still many such problems. Therefore, banking reform this year will only take a first step. We can consider how to run commercial banks in such circumstances. In general, however, the supply of working capital may be loosened, but lending for fixed assets must be strictly controlled. Loans for working capital may be arranged more flexibly and financial support should still be given to enterprises which can achieve satisfactory economic results. Some enterprises that cannot achieve good economic results still cannot be allowed to go bankrupt immediately, and appropriate financial support should still be given to them according to the opinions of local governments. However, products cannot be just stockpiled in warehouses. This year, pilot schemes should be carried out in a number of provinces, and bankruptcy experiments can be carried out first in a number of enterprises in every province. Bankruptcy should be arranged for enterprises that have been operating in the red for a long time and cannot stop incurring losses after full preparations have been made, because if more loans are given to them, this will just increase their unpaid debts. After bankruptcy, their assets can be auctioned and the enterprises reorganized. Third, the People's Bank of China should actually transform its functions and should really exercise banking supervision. The functions of the bank must be changed, and this was the aim of the reform we carried out last year. In the past, the People's Bank was keen to directly arrange loans. Loans throughout whole provinces were distributed by the People's Bank. This confused the functions of the central bank and those of the commercial banks. At present, the People's Bank no longer performs such a function, because it has to perform a more important function. It is not responsible for arranging even a small percentage of credit and does not involve itself in the distribution of credit-making quotas. It just plays its role as the central bank in exercising overall banking supervision and in keeping overall monetary order in every locality. At present, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing some people's irregular fund-raising activities after credit has been brought under strict control. Irregular fund-raising activities and the irregular setting up of financial institutions cause high interest rates and disruption to the monetary order. Thus, the People's Bank is responsible for carrying out inspections. Problems discovered should be checked immediately and made known to all banks in the country. No loopholes can be left in this field; otherwise, things could go out of control. At present, some people just think that a modern enterprise system can only be the joint-stock system established through internal fund-raising means, with bank loans withdrawn. Then, what should the banks do? If all enterprises distributed large amounts of dividends to their workers or keep the profits in their hands own rather than depositing them with the banks, the banks will have no deposits and the state will have no money to arrange necessary capital construction. Therefore, it is necessary to organize and increase deposits. The People's Bank must change its functions and must impartially fulfill its supervisory task by checking interest-rate battles, savings battles, and irregular fund-raising activities based on high interest rates as soon as these things are discovered.
