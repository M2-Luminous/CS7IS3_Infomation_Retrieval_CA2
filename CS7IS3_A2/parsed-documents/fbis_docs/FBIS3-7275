Ngoun Non, who was charged with libel after publishing several articles alleging official corruption, was a senior official in the cabinet of co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh until he founded his newspaper at the beginning of this month. He was the first journalist to be arrested since last year's departure of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. He had been arrested while at the offices of his newspaper, one of the most widely read in Cambodia with a circulation of 30,000, for failing to respond to two separate court summons. The arrest came shortly after an assurance by King Norodom Sihanouk that freedom of the press should be guaranteed in Cambodia. A new press law is being prepared by the government.
