The new record of 104.56 billion dollars in the month-end balance endorsed the continued active intervention by the Bank of Japan to stem the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar. The April rise also represented the sixth consecutive month-to- month increase, the ministry said. The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. A ministry official, as usual, declined to comment on details and reasons for the change in the foreign reserves while briefing reporters. Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan and dealers said the central bank continued to buy billions of dollars in April to stop the yen's rise. The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 102.72 yen and ended at 102.38 yen in Tokyo dealings, ranging from 102.30 posted April 28 to 105.85 yen marked April 8. He said the range of 3.55 yen was small compared with that in the past three months this year but noted that the dollar-yen rate fluctuated more in overseas markets. The dealers said the central bank was also seen buying dollars overseas in the reporting month. Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves for the sixth month in a row, amassing 98.4 billion dollars as of February, the most recent comparable figures with other nations, except Taiwan for January reserves, the official said. Taiwan came in second with reserves of 84.8 billion dollars, followed by Germany with 83.5 billion dollars. The United States posted 77.5 billion dollars and Spain 42.4 billion dollars.
