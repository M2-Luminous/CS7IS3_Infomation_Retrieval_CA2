Box 758, Middlesboro, Kentucky 40965 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.360(b)(6) (preshift examination) to its Stone Mine No. 2 (I.D. No. 15&hyph;09568) located in Bell County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points to monitor the air in areas that were mined prior to the date new ventilation regulations went into effect.

Tilden Magnetite Partnership [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;29&hyph;M] Tilden Magnetite Partnership, P.O. Box 2000, Ishpeming, Michigan 49849 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56/57.18010 (first aid training) to its Tilden Mine (I.D. No. 20&hyph;00422) located in Marquette County, Michigan. The petitioner requests that the standard be modified to include Michigan State Certified Emergency Medical Technicians and First Responders as equivalent to ``selected supervisors'' for the purpose of determining adequate coverage of trained first aid personnel. The petitioner states that modification of the standard would allow for the inclusion of those employees that have had advanced training and are currently licensed as Emergency Medical Technicians or First Responders to be considered as part of the total number of trained first aid personnel and is not meant to preclude the necessity of training additional members of the work force in standard first aid methods to assure adequate coverage on all shifts. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 7. General Chemical Corporation [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;30&hyph;M] General Chemical Corporation, Green River Soda Ash Operations, P.O. Box 551, Green River, Wyoming 82935&hyph;0551 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.22305 (approved equipment III Mines) to its General Chemical Mine (I.D.

The petitioner proposes to use Motorola Radio's P200, Model # H43RFU7160BN, 2.5&hyph;5 watts for communication purposes while riding the # 5 shaft emergency escape hoist for inspection purposes or when necessary to utilize this hoist in an emergency. The petitioner states that the use of radios would allow personnel in the five-man bullet type hoist to have direct communication with the hoistman or a shaft hand that will bell signals to the hoistman; and that when using the radios in the shaft, methane would be continuously monitored and when 0.5 percent or more of methane is found, use of the radios would be suspended until the methane level was below 0.5 percent. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 8.

The petitioner proposes to establish blow-off stations at various places in the plant where employees can clean their clothes with compressed air. This compressed air would have an OSHA-approved nozzle with pressure no greater than 2&hyph;6 psi at normal average line pressure. The petitioner proposes to install tamper-proof airline regulators at each station to ensure that primary operating air pressure is consistent; and to post rules for employees to follow when using compressed air to clean their clothes. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 9.
