But the successive salvos of stinging attacks by Cambodian co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut last week hardly served to address the crux of the problems. By airing their grievances to the mass media, both Ranariddh and Sirivut must have hoped to drum up international pressures to force Thailand to terminate what they believe is continuous, clandestine Thai support for the outlawed guerrilla faction. But although they might have succeeded in re-focusing media attention on the subject, the crude tactics they adopted also achieved the counter-productive effect of souring the atmosphere of bilateral relations with Thailand. Ranariddh kicked off the latest anti-Thailand barrage by claiming he possessed photographic evidence that showed Thai troops helped Pol Pot escape the recent Cambodian government attack on Pailin. But he clarified his accusation a day later by explaining that he actually meant the Pol Potists--a reference to the Khmer Rouge--but not the guerrilla leader himself. Since the said evidence was not made public, it wasn't clear whether Ranariddh was just bluffing. Indeed Ranariddh could contribute to improving relations by producing the evidence if it was really in his possession, so that this bilateral sore-point could be seriously addressed. There are enough Thais in this country who do not condone clandestine support for the Khmer Rouge and would certainly question any such shady military practice. Given the persistent denials by the Army leadership of any such assistance, it would be bound to weed out undesirable elements stationed in the border areas which violate the policy that is, on the face of concrete evidence. But the breach of diplomatic protocol committed by Sirivut was more disturbing. What on earth was he trying to achieve by publicizing this contentious issue in Kuala Lumpur aside from further aggravating an already strained atmosphere of bilateral ties with Thailand? Surely he could have been more discreet, especially since this is very much a Thai-Cambodian problem which can be resolved only by the two countries. As a result of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's recent visit to Cambodia, Bangkok and Phnom Penh were supposed to put into place a hotline to coordinate various bilateral problems of a serious and urgent nature. But judging from the surprised reactions by senior Thai officials, who claimed they have to verify wire-service reports to ascertain that both Ranariddh and Sirivut were not misquoted, it was apparent there was a breakdown of communications both through the normal diplomatic channels as well as the special hotline contact. Notwithstanding the Cambodian leaders' undiplomatic outbursts, the deep-seeded resentment inherent in their latest accusations nonetheless call for serious attention and investigation by the Thai side. In essence, it would require a combination of policy adjustments and changes in attitude by both sides for relations to improve. Thailand and Cambodia are neighboring countries that have no other choice but forging at least a proper relationship of peaceful coexistence if not substantive political and economic ties. With the embarrassing police discovery of a huge secret arsenal near the Thai-Cambodian border last December still fresh in our memory, the Thai Army cannot simply dismiss the latest Cambodian accusations outright. Army Commander Gen. Wimon Wongwanit should be believed and trusted when he says the Thai military does not support the Khmer Rouge. Indeed there is probably no such policy. But the conduct of certain military officers stationed at the border who enjoy longstanding connections and share certain vested interests with the Khmer Rouge is a different matter. One alleged piece of `evidence' warranting investigation is an undated photograph found in Pailin and released by AFP which purportedly shows senior Khmer Rouge commanders and Pailin chief Kim Chean toasting out-of-uniform Thai soldiers at an undisclosed Khmer Rouge headquarters in western Cambodia. Are those identified as Thai soldiers really Thai soldiers? That should be easy enough for the army to find out. The Thai civilian and military leaderships have the collective task to weed out whatever wayward elements stationed on the border areas which collude with the Khmer Rouge. It is the conduct of these elements that presents the bone of contention with Cambodia and casts Thailand in a poor light internationally. Persistent accusations of complicity by some officers in the gems and timber trade with the Khmer Rouge must be investigated and those found to do so eliminated. Otherwise, the mistrust of the Thai military will not be mollified.
