Purpose Section 831(b) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide financial assistance to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions. Statutory Funding Preference Section 860(e) of the PHS Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, enacted on October 13, 1992, provides for the following statutory preference for this program of Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships, as well as for certain other programs under titles VII and VIII of the PHS Act. Statutory preference will be given to qualified applicants that: (1) Have a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (2) have achieved, during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval. Final Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference A notice was published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 25463 on May 16, 1994 to announce the FY 1994 grant cycle for this program and to propose the criteria for meeting the general statutory funding preference.
