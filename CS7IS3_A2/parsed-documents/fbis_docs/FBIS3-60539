Of these, seven will function as minihospitals. The doctors are worried that specialties will be split up. And that everything is happening too quickly. The National Hospital is standing before its greatest change ever. Today the hospital administration is calling all section heads together to orient them on the thorough structural change that will be carried out during 1994. The main elements of the plan will be made public next week. The National Hospital's 40 divisions will be put together in nine centers. Of these, seven will function as minihospitals, some with over 500 employees. The last two centers will, among other things, contain laboratories, pathology, and X ray. The new plan is based on an analysis done in close cooperation with the consultant firm of McKinsey & Co. The National Hospital's director, Christian Nissen, counts on having centers with new structures and new leadership established during 1994. One of the nine centers is already under way. This is the Heart Center, which was opened on a trial basis a year ago, and which will run completely according to the new method of operation by 1 January. ``The patients will have a shorter waiting time, and the hospitalization procedure will go more smoothly,'' Nissen said. ``They will meet fewer doctors and nurses, and the atmosphere will become that of a smaller hospital.'' Divided Specialties Among the doctors there is worry that the thorough change will destroy the specialties. And that everything is being done too quickly. In the Specialist Division, where the doctors' further training is supervised, the developments are being watched closely. ``We are not negative about the new organizational forms,'' the division chairman, senior Dr. Hans Karle of Herlev Hospital said. ``On the other hand we think that it would be wisest to analyze things thoroughly before entering into big changes. ``The process that has been set in motion is motivated by desires for efficiency in administrative, operational, and service tasks. It is for research, development, and training. Here there are goals and intentions, but nothing concrete to hang them on yet.'' In doctors' circles there is also doubt about how logical it is to redo the whole National Hospital according to the new model and whether in the end some segments will not benefit from the changes. ``It is not wrong to start with the Heart Center, ''Hans Karle said.`` But I would have been hesitant to carry out the change completely before getting a lot of experience and having thoroughly analyzed whether one can both rationalize and at the same time assure the quality of training and research.''
