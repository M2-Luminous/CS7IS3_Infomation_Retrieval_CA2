Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of Russia's Federation Council, told this a news conference here. He stressed that the events had "manifested the will of some politicians to capitalise on some differencies between the two states in the interests of their own career." The events in Odessa have been above all a manifestation of Ukraine's political problems and should not be classed with interstate relations, Shumeyko said. He believes that they are connected with political manoeuvres of one of Ukrainian groups that are ready to go any lengths to prevent a rapprochement between Ukraine and Russia. "In any case the incident should be approached with calm. There is no need to aggravate the situation. The way out will be found," said the speaker of the upper house of the Russian Parliament. Shumeyko is staying in Strasbourg at the invitation of the Council of Europe at the head of a Russian parliamentary delegation that participates in a regular session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.
