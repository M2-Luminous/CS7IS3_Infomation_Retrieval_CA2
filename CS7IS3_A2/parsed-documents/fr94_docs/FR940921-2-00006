FR940921-2-00006 FR940921-2-00005 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with 15 CFR 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 93&hyph;141R. Applicant: University of California, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 990, Los Alamos, NM 87545. Instrument: Current Limiting Interrupting Device. Manufacturer: Calor-Emag AG, Germany. Intended Use: Original notice of this resubmitted application was published in the Federal Register of December 13, 1993. Docket Number: 94&hyph;095. Applicant: Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964. Instrument: High Temperature Resistivity Logging Tool. Manufacturer: CSM Associates Limited, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used on board a U.S. drill ship to study sedimentary formations in the sediments below the ocean floor in areas of extremely high crustal temperatures. The tool will be lowered into the borehole to make a series of measurements and the data will be transmitted up a conducting cable to surface computers. The data will then be analyzed and used to produce scientific papers on the sedimentary and rock formations. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 21, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;096. Applicant: Southern Methodist University, 3225 Daniel Avenue, Dallas, TX 75275-0395. Instrument: IR Mass Spectrometer System, Model MAT 252. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in the analysis of whole rocks, minerals, and fluids in order to determine their isotope ratios for oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen (and to a lessor extent nitrogen) with specific interest in the stable (non-radioactive) isotopes of these elements. The major objectives of the research are to understand the evolution of the Earth's lithosphere and its fluid envelope. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in various geology courses. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: July 22, 1994.
