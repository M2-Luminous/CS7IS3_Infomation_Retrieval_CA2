The 30,000 tons, equivalent to two days' national consumption, are part of the agency's prefectural branch stocks, agency officials said. However, it is up to prefectural governments to determine when to put the extra rice on the market, the officials said. The shortage is caused partly by delayed imports of foreign rice, they said.
