According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the plan included the hiring of two noncommissioned officers to accuse Navy Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez and other officers of the murder of more than 100 leftist leaders and labor union leaders from the Barrancabermeja area. The Colombian Navy's intelligence network was established in August 1991 to fight gunrunning and drug trafficking activities on the Colombian Pacific coast. Drug traffickers later determined that Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez was responsible for establishing the network. Alvarez was then transferred to Barrancabermeja, where he organized the Navy's intelligence network along the Magdalena River. His mission was to uncover possible guerrilla attack plans. In January 1993 Capt. Alvarez was transferred to Cartagena, where he was murdered on 6 August of that same year. According to the Prosecutor General's Office investigation, the captain was murdered by drug traffickers from Valle del Cauca. Jorge Hernan Gil has been identified as one of the hired assassins who murdered Alvarez. The Prosecutor General's Office also determined that a great deal of information had reached the drug traffickers in Valle del Cauca Department by way of Saulo Segura, an NCO who had worked on the Pacific network and who, along with Juan Carlos Lopez Maquilon, accused Col. Rodrigo Quinonez and other Navy officers of murdering more than 100 leftist leaders and labor union leaders in Barrancabermeja. The connection of both NCO's with the Cali Cartel is mentioned in statements made by several witnesses to the Prosecutor General's Office. Once the officers' connections were discovered, the drug traffickers hired four lawyers and sent the two NCO's to testify against the Navy intelligence chief and against several Pacific network officers. According to documents in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office, the cartel intended to undermine the work done by the Navy intelligence network and prevent the arrival of the gringos in Juanchaco. The Prosecutor General's Office uncovered this plan after three months of investigation, but the Cali Cartel was able to achieve one of its objective: to dismantle the Navy's intelligence network on the Pacific coast. This week the Prosecutor General's Office issued arrest warrants against the two NCO's, but they have disappeared. One of them was taken out of the country.
