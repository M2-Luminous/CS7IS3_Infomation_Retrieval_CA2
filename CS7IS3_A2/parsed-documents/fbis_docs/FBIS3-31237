He spoke about the current political circumstances surrounding the resolving -- that is, the complicating -- of the situation in and around Bosnia. Coming up now, at the beginning of our bulletin, are several highlights from the address the president of our republic delivered to a large number of reporters. [Begin Karadzic recording] The truth of the terrorist event in Merkale [Sarajevo's marketplace] has further crystallized. There is an increasing amount of evidence that this was a terrorist act. There are clear testimonies that no one heard any whistling sound from the shell and that, evidently, this was not a shell. The crater is too small. The number of dead and wounded is out of all proportion for a 120-mm shell. Turkish doctor (Senegal Karlovac) told CNN, in its diplomatic licence program, that he had seen the wounded and that all their wounds were inflicted below the waist level, that some of the wounds were burns, that there were no traces of alien material -- that is, no shrapnel in the bodies and that most deaths had been caused by internal damage to organs due to the explosion. It is evident that the wounds and burns are most likely to have been inflicted by phosphorus. We have been in contact with a group of Israeli experts on terrorism. They told us this morning that, on the basis of all the data they had, they were able to draw a conclusion that this was a cone-shaped explosive whose flat side was aimed at the victims, that this explosive was either triggered on the spot or dropped from a neighbouring building, and that this was the form of terrorism practised by Hezbollah and Afghans. I also want to tell you that we have obtained reliable reports that the Muslim side is planning to stage further incidents, probably once the ultimatum deadline has expired. There is also a plan for an attack by Muslim forces disguised in Serbian uniforms on a small UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] squad, most probably a French squad. According to this plan there would be no survivors, all the soldiers would be killed, and even several dead Serbs, wearing uniforms of the Serb army, would remain on the spot, having been killed earlier. This is a very hellish plan which is supposed to fuel the tension in the world which is at the moment by and large on the wane. [end recording]
