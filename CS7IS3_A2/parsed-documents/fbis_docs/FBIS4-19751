Asked about the strong social and political impact caused by the cases uncovered by the press concerning former Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan and former Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio, Serra was direct and emphatic: "I am absolutely weary of the topic, and I have been devoting hours to it for days, because we cannot carry on like this," he said. The deputy prime minister said that he feels deeply "disturbed" and "doubly cheated" in this connection, and reiterated several times the need "for it to be made clear to the country once and for all that impunity is over," in order to be able fully to restore confidence in the institutions. Referring to the case of former Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan, Serra stated, without concealing his indignation: "It seems inconceivable to me that when you have rendered the country services or attended dramatic occasions such as I have experienced at funerals and so forth, you can reconcile that work for the community with certain personal actions, and since it seems inconceivable to me, I say so." Narcis Serra went so far as to say that "if somebody has to go to prison, then he has to go to prison," and came out in favor of amending procedural law in order to shorten legal proceedings and rapidly clear up this kind of case which creates social alarm. In Serra's opinion, it is a matter not so much of damage to the credibility and image of the government or the ruling party as of grave harm to Spanish society's collective morale, about which he expressed open concern. Emphasizing that it is "an injury to the institutions, and hence to the country, which could be very difficult to cure," the deputy prime minister asked: "If neither our Civil Guard nor our Bank of Spain is immune to that kind of conduct, who is going to believe in the country?" Serra emphasized that "this country needs more self-confidence because it is emerging from the crisis, albeit slowly, and the greatest factor which could help us is the country's self-confidence, and this is a torpedo at the waterline in this respect." The deputy prime minister, who said that he was speaking in complete harmony -- "beyond all doubt" -- with Felipe Gonzalez' thinking and stance, concluded by asserting that the government is gathering all the information needed to clarify these two matters as soon as possible. Serra referred to the setting in motion of all the tax inspectorate's machinery and to the government attorney's office's activity initiated by the government for the complete clarification of the facts.
