Qiao Shi delivered a speech following the voting. In his speech, Qiao Shi pointed out: During the session, the deputies took account of the overall national interests as well as the people's fundamental interests; conscientiously performed their constitutionally vested functions; emancipated their minds; sought truth from facts; spoke out freely; and discussed state affairs, thus ensuring all resolutions and decisions adopted by the session would fully reflect and convey the will and wishes of people of all nationalities across the country. The session fully demonstrated the great unity of the people of all nationalities across the country, as well as their confidence in certain victory in advancing reform and development. The session was democratic, united, realistic, pioneering, and progressive. It is bound to have a significant impact on comprehensively advancing the socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization, all the while taking economic construction as the central task. Qiao Shi stated emphatically: We must carry out all fields of work, while bearing the people's interests in mind, making sure they will help liberate and develop the productive forces, increase the country's overall strength, and improve the standard of living. State organs and functionaries at all levels should earnestly change their work styles, go into the thick of life, conduct investigations and studies, listen to people's views, and show concern for people's well-being. They should never treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people, and should solve each and every one of those matters. We should firmly oppose bureacraticism and boastfulness; guard against formalism; avoid holding meetings and issuing documents that do not solve problems; refuse to confine ourselves to issuing general appeals; refrain from engaging in empty talk and platitude; and avoid reporting only good news and not the bad. More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should perform our official duties honestly and diligently in order to serve the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, immerse ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry out our work creatively. Qiao Shi hoped the deputies would actively publicize and implement the guidelines of the session, as well as the various resolutions and decisions adopted by the session. He expressed hope they would conscientiously perform their functions as NPC deputies, set an example in abiding by the Constitution and the law, and actively throw themselves into the great practice of reform and construction.
