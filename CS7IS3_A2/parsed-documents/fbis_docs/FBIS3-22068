They carried out a series of raids and encirclements that lasted more than two hours. With the security forces completely surrounding his hideout, the criminal opened fire on them. They responded in kind, forced him to surrender, seized the weapon he used in his crime, and transported him under armed guard to the Shtawrah Police Station, where Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij was supervising the pursuit along with the al-Biqa governor and several security forces commanders. The security forces handed the criminal over to Judge Khalid Hammud, the government's assistant delegate to the Military Tribunal. Judge Hammud immediately began interrogating the suspect. Minister Mirhij, meanwhile, left for the Sa'd Nayil township to offer his condolences to the family of martyred Sergeant Mustafa Faris.
