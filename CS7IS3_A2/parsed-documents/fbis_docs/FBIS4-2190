Information released by the Shenzhen Industrial and Commercial Administration shows that some unscrupulous elements from outside the country collaborated with others to engage in illegal futures broking, speculation on foreign exchange and fund-raising without prior authorization. The administration had on several occasions investigated some 230 cases of illegal futures broking during 1992 and 1993 alone with the seizure of a lot of computers and facsimile machines. Some of the suspects rounded up were dealt with by the judicial department. An official from the administration said that it would soon launch a rectification of the futures market here in a bid to crack down on illegal futures broking and speculation in foreign exchange with the eventual aim of protecting the interests of investors, purifying the market there and safeguarding normal economic order. The official stressed that entities and individuals were not allowed to carry out futures broking without prior consent from the State Securities Commission and registration with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. He added that neither were they allowed to engage in financial futures business or foreign exchange trading as well as fund-raising without the approval of the People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control. People found in violation of these stipulations will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the law while those found breaching them repeatedly will be harshly punished and even will be sent to the judicial department for legal action.
