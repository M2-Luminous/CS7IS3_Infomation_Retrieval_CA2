Since these development zones appeared in large numbers on a large scale and were poorly managed, land use management was in chaos. Since 1993, Guangdong began screening various types of development zones. Yuan Zheng, director of the provincial State Land Department, briefed this reporter a few days ago on how development zones in the province have been straightened out and how things stand now. According to Yuan, after a year of comprehensive overhaul, Guangdong has closed down and merged a total of 228 development zones established by townships and towns without authorization or which were approved by cities and counties. The province has decided to retain 83 development zones, of which 11 were approved by the central government, 45 approved by the provincial government, and 28 approved after applications were submitted anew. Yuan pointed out that the area approved for development zones by the central and provincial government had been limited. An overall plan has been worked out. Under the plan, an area measuring 1,560 square km of land will be assigned for development zones. Infrastructure and land developments in most development zones are roughly in place, which has created a favorable investment environment. In most development zones, transport and telecommunications services and electricity and water supplies are basically available, and large stretches of land have been cleared. Statistics show that 260,000 mu of land has been assigned for development zones at the provincial level and above, and of this, 120,000 mu has been developed. About 5,000 projects have been introduced into development zones at the provincial level and above, involving an investment of 110 billion yuan. For now, a total of 20 billion yuan has been spent on construction and a number of projects have gone on stream. For example, a total of 148 projects have been introduced into the Qingyuan Experimental Economic Development Zone to support poor areas, involving an investment of 1.8 billion yuan. The realized output value of 32 completed projects, which represented an investment of 800 million yuan, amounted to 200 million yuan last year and will increase to 1 billion this year. The Jiedong Development Zone has introduced 135 projects with a planned investment of 5 billion yuan, of which 400 million has been injected. A number of development zones are entering into negotiations with investors about introducing a number of major construction projects. For instance, the Shuidong Development Zone is planning to build a refinery producing 20 million tonnes of oil each year and an ethylene plant with an annual production capacity of 45 tonnes of ethylene [figure as published], and the Zhanjiang Donghaidao Development Zone plans a steel works with an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes. The development zones feature new methods of operation, new management techniques, and new approaches to land development, utilization, and management. Yuan said that the development zones have rationally arranged land for construction projects according to the basic state policy of ensuring arable land is not reduced. The planned area for development zones at provincial level and above throughout the province totals 2.34 million mu, of which 820,000 mu is under cultivation, accounting for 3.5 percent of the total, less than the national average. The planned area of the Shuidong Development Zone is 120,000 mu, of which 16,000 mu is arable land, 1.3 percent of the total. The Yuebei Industrial Development Zone has obtained land for construction projects by making use of marshland and has reclaimed 70 hectares of land. The development zones also feature a centralized monopoly of land. The local city or county government or the development zone management committee sees to it that land comes under unified planning, unified requisition, unified development, unified transfer, and unified management. This ensures smooth implementation of construction plans and that sufficient land is assigned for projects. Yuan said that a series of preferential policies also helped the development zones in land development. The development zone management can make its own decision on land use, including giving priority to certain projects. The development zone management is also allowed to adopt flexible land pricing policies. Land for industrial and high-tech projects will be transferred at cost price or at cost price plus an appropriate amount of subsidy. The buyer is allowed to develop the whole stretch of land through construction projects on an appropriate scale and to accept or transfer land use rights in the form of rent in kind, including exchanging highways or bridges for land. There are no restrictions on selling commodity houses abroad, and the client is exempt from land use charges for a number of years. With these preferential policies, the development zones have made great progress in land development and utilization. The current situation with regard to the development, utilization, and management of land in development zones is very good on the whole. However, major problems still exist. For instance, disorderly land management in one or two development zones, an excessive area of idle land, and defective land management systems. Therefore, the provincial state land department has stressed the need to manage land in development zones according to the law, approve land for development zones strictly according to state regulations, improve the operating mechanism of the market for development zone land, and further enforce a land management system characterized by "unified planning, unified requisition, unified development, unified transfer, and unified management" so that land use in development zones will be legalized and standardized.
