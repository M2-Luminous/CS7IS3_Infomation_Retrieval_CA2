The coming days will witness military operations against this entity in the occupied territories, not outside. He said these operations will target the settlers and the gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [PFLP-GC martyr]. He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the Zionist enemy.
