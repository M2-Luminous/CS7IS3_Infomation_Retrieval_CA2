Population planning as a method of managing human reproduction. [passages omitted] In setting population control goals, drawing up a population plan, transmitting it to lower levels for implementation, and supervising and inspecting its implementation, we must take into full consideration China's level of economic development and public thinking on reproduction, which is what all of this must be based on. Remove this base and go beyond the threshold defined by our level of economic development, and we would achieve nothing. Drawing up a population plan divorced from reality, setting overly ambitious population growth targets, and trying to reach those targets through command planning are bound to be counterproductive in the end. There may be some short-term success, but it is certain that it will neither last nor be consolidated. On the contrary, we may well end up with a compensatory population growth after a certain period of time. The principal inconsistency in population control in China today is essentially one between population control and the level of economic development, between relatively advanced population control methods and a more backward level of economic development. Fundamentally speaking, the difficulty China has to date in adjusting human reproduction stems from the backwardness of economic development and the low level of productive forces, from the fact that we are trying to establish a relatively advanced pattern of fertility on the basis of a backward economy. What is in existence now, it must be said, is only the rudiments of the condition needed for adjusting the pattern of human reproduction and population control. Thus, our population planning, adjustment and control must similarly be preliminary. Population planning can only be broad and flexible guidance planning. It is unrealistic to think that we can now achieve overly ambitious population control objectives through mandatory population planning. Birth control work in China was born under the planning system and inevitably therefore exhibits many of the latter's characteristics. In its formulation, transmission to lower level, implementation, and inspection, as well as in its format, targets, and content, population planning in fact has borrowed extensively from material reproduction planning. In particular, like command planning, population planning sets mandatory targets that must not be exceeded. Objectively speaking, for a variety of reasons we were nowhere near managing the process of material reproduction completely in accordance with a command plan even during the era of economic planning. Moreover, history has demonstrated that orchestrating material economic construction beyond the level of economic development in any specific stage through command planning militates against mobilizing the initiative of all quarters, fostering the development of multiple economies, raising the level of productive forces, and improving the people's living standards. If anything, the process of human reproduction is far more complex than market reproduction. It is influenced by a host of factors, including politics, society, history, even religion, geography, climate, and local customs and habits, in addition to economic development. Furthermore, the scope of application of population planning is wider than that of material reproduction planning. Material planning typically involves only the sectors, industries, and enterprises concerned. In the case of population planning broadly defined, in contrast, people's governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions, as well as all basic units are responsible for organizing and carrying out population planning. And a substantial number of citizens nationwide are the subjects of such planning; no other form of economic and social development planning has this characteristic. Just consider: Given this country's relatively low level of economic development, its long history of feudalism, its vast size, and the diversity of regional conditions, how can it possibly manage the very complex process of human reproduction through command planning? Planning is ideological. It is a subjective reflection of the objective and is based on our projection of how objective things will develop in the future. If we try to carry out a command population plan coercively in isolation from the reality in China, the inevitable result will be a divorce between the subjective and the objective in our guiding thought. Planning and reality will then be completely out of step with each other and the real effectiveness of population control will suffer. 2. To cite economic planning as the basic reason for the adoption of birth control programs in China has no basis in fact. On the other hand, it is also not objective to deny the intimate interdependency between China's population control program and its highly centralized form of economic planning. This is precisely why the formulation, transmission, and implementation of the population control plan, as well as its methods, which was evolved under the system of economic planning, will take a beating now since we have made the establishment of a socialist market economy the objective of economic structural reform. 2.1 Economic planning emphasizes administrative management of a highly centralized nature whereas the market economy stresses the use of the law of value to bring about the optimal allocation of resources. As reform deepens, administrative tools will play a diminishing role in economic management, some of them replaced by economic and legal tools. Administrative measures are the principal tools for implementing the population plan in China. For instance, individuals who violate the birth control policy would be subject to disciplinary sanctions and leading cadres are the target of "one-vote veto" for failing to accomplish the population control plan. In a market economy, enterprises operate as independent commodity producers and traders which exercise decision-making authority in their operations and take risk on their own. It is the enterprises' own bottom line that will determine their behavior. Out of economic self-interests, enterprise leaders are absolutely free to cut back on the use of or stop using administrative tools in dealing with violators of the family planning policy and other matters not directly related to production. They may even relax birth control management or scrap such management altogether. After the hiring system is changed, the powers and obligations of an employer vis-a-vis his employees and vice versa will be laid down explicitly in a contract. It is not likely that administrative sanctions can override this legal document and become valid, particularly in birth control cases. 2.2 With a market economy, China will no longer feature just one form of public ownership, namely public ownership. Instead, there will be multiple ownership systems dominated by public ownership. This will lead to the formation of a host of distribution mechanisms led by distribution according to work, with others playing a supplementary role. Price reform will spell an end to the assorted defects caused by distorted price signals and powerfully regulate the formation of personal disposable income. The demise of egalitarianism and the implementation of the policy of allowing some people to get rich ahead of others will inevitably widen income gaps. All these changes will deal a heavy blow to economic penalties as an instrument of birth control management. The policy of fining somebody for violating the population control plan does not work when the violator is high-income. He will simply pay up and have his child anyway. The rise in the incomes of rural and urban households will render insignificant the material incentives for having a one-child family. The government may make the incentives more generous but how is it going to pay for them? As for making compliance with the birth control policy a criterion in reviewing and approving certain types of economic activities, that too runs counter to certain tenets of the market economy. 2.3 In a market economy China's labor market will mature even more rapidly. The market restraining mechanism for achieving the optimal allocation of labor resources through the circulation of manpower will become stronger and stronger. Driven by economic interests, workers will migrate between urban and rural areas, among sectors, from one ownership system to another, and between enterprises, breaking down all barriers that have shackled them. Labor mobility in turn will spawn the movement of population. The fact of the matter is that already some of the underlying conditions that have hampered population movement have been reformed in recent years or are about to undergo some change. So far 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly administered by the central government have revamped their grain procurement and marketing system and many cities have abolished grain rationing. In fact grain has been circulating on the market like any other ordinary commodity. The rules for transforming the enterprise mechanism are clear. Enterprises are free to decide on their own how long they want to keep an employee and the size of their staff. There are some restrictions on the use of peasant workers; realistically speaking, however, it would be difficult to prevent an enterprise from choosing workers of a particular origin based on need. Housing reform will provide an even easier solution to the problem of housing people and workers on the move. Also in the works is the reform of the permanent residency registration system. As I see it, all these reforms mentioned above are a boost to economic development and would help check population growth in the long run. However, we must see that the current system of population growth management to a large extent is dependent on the system described above. The way a birth control policy violator is handled, for instance, is tied in with the various rules and regulations governing residency registration, housing, grain rationing, and employment. The implementation of the assorted reforms mentioned above and the consequent massive increase in the floating population will also deal a heavy blow to the territoriality principle of the present system of population growth management. In remunerating the ways in which the deepening of economic structural reform and the continuous improvement of the market mechanism will batter the mechanism and modes of operation of the present system of population growth management, we are not trying to link economic planning to family planning and population control or suggesting that the latter is based on the former. Instead what we are saying is that we must pragmatically understand the dependency of the operating mechanism of population planning on economic planning, appreciate the way in which our current work would be affected by our choice of a socialist market economy as the goal of economic reform, and realize the need to come up with a new population control mechanism and methods of management based on the principles of the market economy. The aim is to change the reproductive aspirations of society and alter its reproductive behavior, thus further achieving the basic national policy of family planning in the new era. We should not feel pessimistic because family planning work has come under heavy pressure. If we analyze the whole picture and think long term, in fact, the establishment of a socialist market economy would help change the public's thinking on reproduction in a fundamental way, which would improve the overall climate for family planning work and create a population growth control mechanism where the macroeconomy meets the micoreconomy, thereby giving an impetus to family planning work in China. This is how it will work: a) What has happened since reform got under way proves conclusively that a highly centralized planned economy is not compatible with the level of productive forces in China. The fact that there is just one ownership system is not conducive to mobilizing the initiative of all quarters and retards economic development. In putting forward unequivocally the establishment of a socialist market economy as the objective of economic structural reform, our basic purpose is to further liberate and develop productive forces, make China more powerful all around and raise the people's living standards. Using a wealth of facts from both China and the rest of the world, both past and present, many demographers have proved a causal relationship between economic development and fertility rates and identified the ways in which economic conditions influence reproductive aspirations. In China, it is economic backwardness that lies at the root of a fairly high birthrate. For this reason achieving fast economic growth and improving the people's living standards are a basic precondition for checking population growth. The relatively low natural population growth rates in the West are primarily the result of its high level of economic development. Here in China, we can also explain the fact that the overall urban birth rate is much lower than its rural counterpart by pointing to the higher living standard in cities, their relatively comprehensive social security system, and their more complete range of services. We have every reason to believe that as the market economy becomes more and more comprehensive and people's living standards keep going up, the basic conditions for birth control work will improve substantially and the reproductive aspirations of the people will change fundamentally. b. The perfection of the market economy will further blur the boundaries between the city and the countryside and spur the movement of rural workers and the rural population, thus dramatically accelerating urbanization in China. In the days of highly centralized economic planning, we used administrative methods to sever the links between the city and the countryside artificially and prevented the movement of the rural population in a variety of ways, using all our ingenuity to bind peasants to the soil. As a result, not only did Chinese urbanization suffer badly stunted growth and peasants' living standards lagged, but the vast number of peasants remained shackled ideologically with the philosophy of the small peasant economy and wedded to backward production methods, thereby hindering their acceptance of new concepts, new thinking, and new things. This ideological base has also reduced their acceptance of family planning propaganda and affected the implementation of the population plan. The development of the market economy will bring to fruition the realignment of elements of production. Grain, price, and housing reforms will gradually break down the assorted barriers to peasants entering a city to work, do business, or start an enterprise. The massive migration of peasants and the birth and growth of small and mid-sized cities in large numbers have become irreversible trends. When large numbers of peasants leave the land permanently or periodically, ending the small-peasant-economy way of life, and enter the cities to join forces with new capital goods and new production methods, they will become that much more amenable to new ideas, including ideas on reproduction. This will give a boost to the launching of rural birth control work. c. The reform of the employment system is an important component of the development of a market economy. In the past, the government took care of distribution in urban areas and gave workers jobs for life, at the same time making sure that peasants in the countryside were kept out of the cities. Now that arrangement will be dealt a heavy blow by the market economy. In accordance with the rules for transforming the enterprise operating mechanism, the enterprise hiring system of the future will be one of dual choice. The enterprise will decide the duration of employment, how many people it will hire, and the form of such employment. The employee, for his part, will also get to choose which enterprise he wants to join and in what capacity. Nowadays, enterprises particularly state enterprises, are over-staffed with a large number of redundant personnel. With hiring reform, this situation will become a thing of the past. Meanwhile, the state will phase out the practice of providing jobs to college and technical secondary school graduates. When we consider also the large numbers of peasants making their way into urban areas, we could see that the problem of labor oversupply in China will become apparent. For a while the employment market will come under enormous pressure. With a new mechanism, employment pressures will no longer be artificially masked. Not only will the government be aware of such pressures but, thanks to the media, so will every household and every individual. The awareness of employment pressures will influence the thinking of every individual, forcing him to modify his behavior, including reproductive behavior. d. The introduction of the market mechanism into the hiring system and employment system will hasten the maturation of the labor market and intensify the competition for jobs among workers. More and more, whether or not a worker lands a job, his working conditions, and the size of his paycheck will depend on his quality. The result is a deeper understanding by the public of the importance of a population's quality. There comes a point in economic development when the main driving force behind rising household incomes is no longer an increase in the quantity of labor inputs but an improvement in their quality. When that comes to pass, every family will naturally take special pains to improve the physical and cultural quality of its children by investing significantly more in their education. Thus willingly or unwillingly people must practice birth control. Moreover, young men and women in their prime reproductive years find themselves in a fiercely competitive job market. Their mission--raising their educational standard, acquiring work skills, and making themselves more competitive--will also force them to have fewer children. e. Both the reform and improvement of the urban social security system and the creation of a rural social security system are the objective requirements of perfecting the socialist market economy. In urban reform we should focus on expanding the scope of social security, diversifying the sources of insurance funds, and establishing a personal contribution mechanism to put an end to the practice of having the state pay for everything. These measures will consolidate the achievements of family planning in cities. In the countryside, we should concentrate on establishing a variety of social security systems to suit the characteristics of a locality. For starters, we need to provide for the elderly. In most rural areas in China today the elderly remain dependent on their children to provide for them, an arrangement that will come under challenge from the development of the market economy, the shift of rural manpower into non-agricultural sectors, the breakdown of urban-rural barriers, and the migration of urban and rural workers. It is objectively imperative that this practice be reformed and social security be introduced. Thus establishing a social security system in the countryside is absolutely not just a matter of providing welfare for the elderly, but has to do with the market economy. The creation of a rural social security system will powerfully stimulate changes in public thinking on reproduction. [passage omitted]
