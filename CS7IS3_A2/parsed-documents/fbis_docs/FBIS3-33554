Coming out of the meeting, Arias Cardenas said the meeting is the first step toward pacification. He also reiterated his commitment to those companions who in jail. [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] Basically, the reason for my being here today, at Miraflores Palace, accompanied by Captain Luis Valderrama and members of my family, is for an initial rapprochement with President Rafael Caldera. In all sincerity, I believe we are living in a somewhat new atmosphere which favors change and brings hope. I feel the changes -- or the beginning of the changes that started 4 February and 27 November 1992 -- are become stronger; one indication of this is that we have a new government which the Venezuelan people elected on 5 December 1983. [as heard] Our conversation mainly covered the political prisoners and the pacification process promoted by the president of the Republic. [end recording] Last night after the dismissal of his case and the case of nine other officers who participated in the first coup attempt of 1992, retired Lt. Col. Arias Cardenas said that to accept pardon does not mean he regrets his past actions. Arias Cardenas held an impromptu news conference on Los Proceres Avenue, during which he clarified that those who have been released are not abandoning those who are in prison. He feels it is just a matter of using different methods of struggle, adding that each individual's stand is respected. [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] One cannot think that the person who is in jail or who has been released is courageous or cowardly. There are different ways of confronting the truth, which we must do at this time, as a responsibility because of the trust all Venezuelans have. [sentence as heard] In the first place, I firmly declare that I am in complete solidarity with the companions who remain in prison and with their proposals. [end recording] Arias Cardenas, who is considered the ideologist of the 4 February 1992 coup attempt, pointed out that he is not ruling out participating in political activities if the circumstances so determine it. He explained that he requested his retirement 6 months ago precisely to engage in politics.
