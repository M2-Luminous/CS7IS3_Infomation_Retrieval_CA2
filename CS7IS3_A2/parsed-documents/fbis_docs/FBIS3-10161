The process will begin next week and will proceed in accordance with Article 234 of the General Banking Law. The statute, which was approved for discussion by the Venezuelan Central Bank, allows the bank to move from the intervention stage to the recovery stage. The decision was based on a report on the banks assets, prepared by the General Bank Superintendency last November. The report determined the lost capital and allows the process to continue without waiting for the final results of the official audit, which has not yet totaled the trust funds deposited at National Bank of Curacao. Now the missing Banco Latino assets have been posted as lost funds, the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade, will provide the financial institution with funds. The liquidity injection will be at no cost to Banco Latino, because it will be a capital investment, thus making Fogade the bank's new owner. These funds will allow Banco Latino to operate normally and begin its recovery process, which entails much more than paying back its depositors. The process could also restore the account holders' trust in the financial institution and prevent them from withdrawing all of their money. This would also improve the quality of the bank's assets, from the perspective of privatization. Rossen explained that in a normal situation such as this, the Intervention Board can now try to improve the quality of the bank's credit portfolio. To this end, the board has proposed several measures to be included in the Emergency Law being drafted by Congress. "Our proposals will turn loans into liquid funds, and enhance investments, thus allowing us to resume payment of the bank's obligations. If we could not count on the income from such collections as a key element toward recovery, we would have to resort to additional subsidies and bail out money." Rossen underscored the importance of the Emergency Law being drafted in Congress, because it will allow the bank to resume payments to its savings account holders. Noteworthy is the fact that there are 21 billion bolivares at the Central Bank. Only 9 billion have been paid out, while 12 billion are being held in escrow, because the bank has been unable to provide Fogade with funds in the amounts it has demanded. In addition to the beginning of the recovery process at Banco Latino, the Intervention Board will also begin collecting the bank's outstanding receivables, starting with exchange notes, and continuing with credit card balances. Rossen announced that the board has not ruled out the possibility of many account holders becoming shareholders of the financial institution. "We would have to open a negotiation process to start making yearly disbursements of 1 million bolivares to those people with large deposits, in the form of preferential cumulative dividend shares. The nature and value of such negotiable documents would change in the secondary markets, in such a case as the institution being sold to a foreign bank." The various payment formulas currently under study will allow us to improve the banks receivables and future selling qualities, and provide ways for the State to recover what it has invested in the institution, within approximately five years.
