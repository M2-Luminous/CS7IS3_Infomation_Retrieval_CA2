Although the primary target of the U.S. action is obviously Japan, trade experts point out the United States may also beef up pressure on other countries including Korea which it believes still uses unfair trade practices against it. Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), however, ruled out the possibility of Korea being picked as a priority foreign country (PFC) by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for investigation of alleged unfair trade practices. As grounds, they cited the balance in trade between the two countries, the existence of a well-functioning official channel for dialogue and Korea's accommodation during the Uruguay Round talks of most of the U.S. demands for market opening. Bilateral trade between Korea and United States has continued to strike a balance since 1991. Before then Korea had enjoyed surpluses. Trade officials from the two countries have been regularly meeting at the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) where they discuss ways to head off trade friction and promote industrial cooperation. "In all, trade relations between the two countries have recently been free from any serious problems," said Chon Sang-u, a ministry official in charge of trade with the U.S. Although the United States may not include Korea on the list of PFCs, the possibility still remains that it may want to apply additional pressure on Seoul to open its markets wider. In fact, during the recently ended DEC in Washington, D.C., the United States demanded that Korea shorten its schedule for opening the telecommunications and education markets, abolish restrictions on investment in the distribution sector and improve retailing practices. "Riding on the offensive momentum provided by the revival of Super 301, the U.S. may seek to put forward additional demands that Korea open wider its financial and service markets, strengthen protection of intellectual property rights and amend unfair wholesale and retail practices," said Chong Song-ki, an official of the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA). MOTIE officials said that although such a possibility cannot be ruled out, the government does not at the moment consider any acceleration of its original market opening schedule. "There's nothing particular that we can do now about Super 301. We will do business as usual," said Han Yong-su, director-general of the ministry's Trade Cooperation Bureau. "Business as usual," according to Han, includes efforts to expand bilateral trade without altering the present balance, continue the ongoing drive to wipe out administrative red tape and beef up the campaign to "internationalize" Korean society by changing outdated norms and practices. The Ministry's official stance is that the U.S. administration's revival of the Super 301 clause goes against the spirit of the Uruguay Round talks. "We are concerned that the U.S. measure might disrupt the newly emerging international economic order under the planned inauguration of the World Trade organization (WTO)," the ministry said in a press release. The ministry also urged the U.S. administration to refrain from invoking the retaliatory trade clause arbitrarily. While predicting that the renewal of Super 301 will not fundamentally affect the present smooth trade relations between the two countries, the ministry, however, made it clear that if and when the United States does take any unfavorable actions against Korea, Seoul will cope with them by resorting to the WTO's newly established settlement procedures. "Our official position has already been delivered to the U.S. through diplomatic channels," Han said. Under the revived trade legislation, the USTR will make public by the end of this month its survey of trade barriers of its trading partners. Based on this survey, called the national trade estimate (NTE), the U.S. will select specific trade practices of foreign countries for investigation. Thus the survey will give hints about which countries will be picked as PFCs. The list of actual PFCs will be announced by Sept. 30 this year based on the outcome of investigations. The list of actual PFCs will be announced by Sept. 30 this year after six months of investigation of priority foreign practices that the USTR want to correct. Negotiations between the USTR and PFCs will begin within 21 days after the list is announced and will last for 12 to 18 months. When the negotiations break down, the U.S. administration can take unilateral retaliatory measures. "The U.S. administration is not expected to actually go so far as to retaliate against its trade partners, although Japan may be an exception. But even for Japan, its ultimate aim is not to retaliate but to open the Japanese market wider," said KFTA's Chong. Korea has experience of succumbing to the U.S. threat to invoke the Super 301 clause when it had been in effect during the 1989-1990 period. AT the time, to avoid the PFC designation, Korea opened its agricultural market wider than it wanted and softened restrictions on foreign investment in Korea. According to trade experts, the revived Super 301 clause is more threatening than the previous one because it stipulates that the U.S. administration hold comprehensive negotiations with PFCs on their unfair trade practices.
