Our sources noted that the operation, which took place in the village of (Abu Hudaydah) in the Governorate of al-'Amarah resulted in the death of the above-mentioned person; his personal weapons were seized. Criminal 'Awdah 'Atwan is known by the residents of Abu Hudaydah and al-'Amarah marshlands as someone who sold his conscience and humanity to tyrant Saddam's regime. In doing so, he committed the ugliest crimes and attacks against innocent citizens. He personally executed three innocent citizens. Last week, the Islamic resistance forces set up an ambush in one of the sensitive points along the road between the district of al-Majarr and the subdistrict of Nahr 'Udayl in the Governorate of al-'Amarah. Our sources in the south said that the ambushers succeeded in attacking a military vehicle [word indistinct] transporting some regime forces along the above-mentioned road. The attack destroyed the vehicle and killed or injured all those inside it. Our sources noted that the resistance men found identity cards and documents on the bodies of the regime's men proving that the destroyed vehicle belonged to the 1st Company of the 3d Regiment of the 704th Brigade, which is deployed in the marshlands of al-'Amarah. The Islamic resistance forces returned safely to their bases. It later became clear that the regime had placed its forces in a state of alert and patrolled the road with armored vehicles.
