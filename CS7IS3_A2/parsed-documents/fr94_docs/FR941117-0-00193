FR941117-0-00193 FR941117-0-00013 c. Scope of financial information and operating data to be provided on an annual basis _(1) Definition of annual financial information. The amendments provide a definition of the term ``annual financial information,'' 91 a concept that was used, without definition, in the Proposed Amendments. The definition of annual financial information specifies both the timing of the information_that is, once a year_and, by referring to the final official statement, the type of financial information and operating data that is to be provided to the repositories. If financial information or operating data concerning an obligated person (or category of obligated persons in the case of financings using the objective criteria approach) is included in the final official statement, then annual financial information would consist of the same type of financial information or operating data. For example, if anticipated cash flow information is provided in the final official statement for a revenue bond financing, cash flow data reflecting actual operations must continue to be provided on an annual basis. Only the annual financial information called for by the undertakings need be sent to the repositories; other types of financial information and reports that may be prepared by the issuer or obligated persons are not subject to the rule's dissemination provisions. 91 Rule 15c2&hyph;12(f)(9). Many commenters addressed the issue of whether the rule should specify form and content of the information that should be provided on an annual basis, as well as for event specific information. 92 Some commenters argued that the rule should include specified formats for information to be provided, including financial statements and certain industry reporting formats, 93 while other commenters contended that no form or content should be specified and that the parties should be permitted to make determinations based on materiality alone. 94 As discussed below, the flexibility afforded by the concept of annual financial information addresses these concerns by providing a minimum standard for ongoing disclosure, but allowing the parties to define that standard with respect to each Offering of municipal securities. 92 See, e.g. , Letter of Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (``Dean Witter''); Letter of National League of Cities; Letter of NFMA; Joint Response; Letter of PSA; Letter of Tillinghast, Collins & Graham; Letter of the Treasurer of the State of Connecticut. 93 See, e.g. , Letter of Dain Bosworth, Inc.; Letter of First Albany Corporation; Letter of MSRB; Letter of NFMA; Letter of Standish, Ayer & Wood, Inc. 94 See, e.g. , Letter of CDFA; Letter of Chapman and Cutler; Letter of CIFA; Joint Response; Letter of H.M. Quackenbush; Letter of NABL. (2) Financial information. The proposal to mandate audited financial statements produced considerable comment. As with the proposed definition of final official statement, commenters expressed concern with the availability of audited financial statements on an annual basis, as well as the relevance of financial statements for certain types of financings. Some commenters indicated that some municipalities were not required by law to have independently audited financial statements, and any such requirement would impose a significant new expense. 95 A number of commenters also expressed doubt as to whether audited financial information could be delivered on an annual basis, because audits may not be completed for a number of years following the close of the fiscal year. 96 Commenters noted that in some cases, financial statements for certain types of entities were audited every year, and in other cases every 2&hyph;3 years. 97 Therefore, some of these commenters argued that the requirement for annual audited financial statements would have an adverse impact on an issuer's ability to access the public securities markets or increase its costs of financing. 98 95 See, e.g. Letter of Texas Water Development Board; Letter of State of Washington, Office of the Treasurer. 96 See, e.g. , Letter of City of Barling; Letter of Dain Bosworth, Inc.; Letter of Friday, Eldridge & Clark. 97 See, e.g. , Letter of AMP_Ohio; Letter of State of Indiana, State Board of Accounts; Letter of State of Montana, Department of Natural Resources and Conservation; Letter of Washington Finance Officers Association. 98 See, e.g. , Letter of AMP_Ohio; Letter of Washington Finance Officers Association. A number of commenters also raised concerns regarding the availability of full financial statements for certain issuers, whether or not audited. 99 As examples, commenters noted that some issuing entities do not have their own financial statements and may be included in the financial statements of a larger issuer or entity. 100 Commenters from two states indicated that governmental units of the states may be encompassed in the state's comprehensive annual financial report and that there may be only supplemental schedules that described the governmental units. 101 99 See, e.g. , Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of Florida Division of Bond Finance; Letter of Gust & Rosenfeld; Letter of Office of the State Auditor, Texas (``Texas Office of the State Auditor''). 100 See, e.g. , Letter of Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; Letter of Texas Office of the State Auditor. 101 See, e.g. , Letter of the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; Letter of Texas Office of the State Auditor.
