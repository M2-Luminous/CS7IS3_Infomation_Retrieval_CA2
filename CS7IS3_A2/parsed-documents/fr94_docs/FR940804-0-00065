FR940804-0-00065 FR940804-0-00022 The EPA believes that this approach is similar to the method courts traditionally use to grant interim equitable relief. Courts may grant preliminary injunctions to parties that the court determines are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, where there is no adequate legal remedy available, and where the public interest would not be served in not granting the injunction. Such injunctions may typically last until the court has finally decided the merits of the case, either for or against the party granted the injunction. Deferring or staying the application of sanctions upon proposed approval of a SIP revision is analogous, in that an EPA proposed approval represents EPA's view that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the disapproval deficiency and come into compliance with the requirements of the Act. Also, as SIP approval actions generally require notice-and-comment rulemaking before they can become final, if a sanctions clock is due to expire after proposed approval but before the Agency can practicably fulfill its notice and comment duties and grant final approval, there is no other ``remedy'' available to relieve the State from the punishment of sanctions, even though it is probable that the State has corrected the deficiency. Moreover, EPA does not believe, following proposed approvals, that it would be in the public interest for sanctions to remain in effect, as at that point the Agency believes that there is nothing further that the State need do to come into compliance, and thus there is no further need for the deterrent effect of sanctions. The EPA also believes that in these situations it would be especially unfair to States to begin the application of sanctions where the only reason the sanctions clock has not permanently stopped is that the Agency cannot complete its rulemaking process to finally approve the SIP before sanctions apply. Finally, EPA notes that like the judicial preliminary injunction model, this approach provides that upon reversal of EPA's preliminary assessment that the SIP revision is approvable, and that, therefore, the deficiency has not been corrected, sanctions would be in effect as if the interim final determination that the State had corrected the deficiency had never been made. The EPA also believes that this approach is consistent with the requirements of section 553 of the APA. Generally, under the APA, agency rulemaking affecting the rights of individuals must comply with certain minimum procedural requirements, including publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and providing an opportunity for the public to submit written comments on the proposal, before the rulemaking can have final effect. The EPA will not be providing an opportunity for public comment before those deferrals or stays are effective. Consequently, EPA's approach may appear to conflict with the requirements of the APA. However, EPA will provide an opportunity to comment on the proposed approval that was the basis for the interim final decision and will provide an opportunity, after the fact, for the public to comment on the interim final decision. Thus, an opportunity for comment will be provided before any sanctions clock is permanently stopped or any already applied sanctions are permanently lifted. In the context of the SIP approval rulemaking, and with respect to the interim final rule, the public would have an opportunity to comment on the appropriateness of EPA's interim determination that the State had corrected the deficiency and on whether the State should remain subject to sanctions, even though the deferral or stay is already effective. The basis for allowing such an interim final action stems from section 553(b)(B) of the APA which provides that the notice and opportunity for comment requirements do not apply when the Agency finds that those procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' In the case of sanctions, EPA believes it would be both impracticable and contrary to the public interest to have to propose and provide an opportunity to comment before any relief is provided from the effect of sanctions. First, until EPA proposes approval of a SIP revision, the Agency's first step in determining whether a State's SIP submittal meets the requirements of the Act, EPA is not in a position to propose that the State has corrected the deficiency; thus, there is no point in the process before proposed approval at which EPA could propose that the State has corrected the deficiency and provide an opportunity for meaningful public comment on the issue. Second, as discussed above, EPA believes it would be unfair to the State and its citizens, and thus not in the public interest, for sanctions to remain in effect following an EPA proposed approval, since at that point the Agency has completed a thorough evaluation of the State's SIP revision and publicly stated its belief that the submittal is approvable and that the State has corrected the deficiency, but due to the procedural requirements of the Act the Agency has not yet been able to issue a final approval. The EPA believes sanctions coming into effect following proposed approvals would unnecessarily risk potential dislocation in government programs and the marketplace. The EPA also believes that the risk of an inappropriate deferral or stay would be comparatively small, given the limited scope and duration deferrals and stays would have and given the rule's mechanism for making sanctions effective upon reversal of its initial determination that the State had corrected the deficiency. Consequently, EPA believes that the ``good cause'' exception under the APA allows the Agency to dispense with notice and comment procedures before deferrals and stays of sanctions become effective, and that it is thus appropriate to respond to the commenters with the approach adopted in today's rule. (5) Responses to Other Comments. The EPA does not support the alternative proposed by the commenters that EPA temporarily or permanently stop the sanction clocks started by disapprovals upon EPA receipt of a submittal that the State believes corrects the deficiency.
