Of whom? We can go back to the polls, hold new elections in no time. And then we will have a good laugh. The truth is that [Northern League Secretary] Bossi is a haywire splinter, with certain irrational traits. He has not understood the turn that things have taken since the elections. There are no more blank-check delegations. There is an agreement that we must honor. He reminds me of those characters of the past, those of the First Republic. Do you remember that guy who wanted to have a free hand at all costs?" We were watching the TG3 [third channel TV news] 7 o'clock news in the office of Roman lawyer Cesare Previti, Forza Italia's number two. We were watching a news show displaying in turn the faces of the "pole of freedoms," now the "squabble pole," triumvirate. Faces, such as [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's and [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's, which showed rage and tension. Tense faces, uttering icy words addressed to the odd man who has turned the tables on them and may end up giving their opponents a present. Bossi, instead, was shown wearing a windbreaker, smiling. Previti then broke out: "He will be the only one to blame if in the end everything collapses. If this guy betrays the alliance, the only solution will be to go back to the polls." [LA REPUBBLICA] Everything seemed to be ready: a government, a platform, a majority. From [Fiat director] Agnelli to [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, everybody wanted Berlusconi at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. [Previti] Speaking of Bertinotti, let me say that I found him a rather interesting person. Following Costanzo's election show, I got better acquainted with him, he was quite pleasant. [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you expecting the League's wrath? What unleashed it? [Previti] Who knows, it is difficult to say. There are no apparent facts or definite causes. Perhaps Bossi felt crushed by Forza Italia, by our electoral lists' enormous success, although, as a matter of fact, we had already witnessed some outbursts toward the end of the election campaign. However, the Senator [Bossi nickname] would be well advised not to indulge in outbursts, considering the 28 March election results. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a threat? [Previti] No, it is an argument based on readily available data and figures. In Milan, in the proportional round, Forza Italia defeated the League. And in Bossi's own constituency, we won a relative majority. All this explains why the League's leader is so jittery. He knows that his deputies' positions are rather precarious. [LA REPUBBLICA] Precarious? Does this mean that they will soon go over to Forza Italia? [Previti] No, I am not saying this. I am saying that, if we went back to the polls immediately, those deputies and senators would have to approach us in order to be reelected (may I remind you that, in the north, Fini had presented his own lists, and our agreement with the League was a fully-fledged electoral agreement). [LA REPUBBLICA] One-third of the pole of freedoms is still in Bossi's hands, for the moment. How will you manage to win them over? [LA REPUBBLICA] We were straightforward. We enabled the League's candidates to win votes, without arguing, and with no hidden aims. I wonder whether all the League members that have been elected are now backing Bossi, whether they wish to follow him into this adventure. I believe that many of them feel betrayed. We had asked for votes in order to govern, and we are now bogged down in these tactical stratagems, these games that reek of the old system. The country is waiting for a government, a guide. May I remind them, moreover, that they are largely answerable to Forza Italia's voters. Voters who opted for a more transparent policy: The winners govern the country. I have remarked that, even among the ranks of the defeated, this clarity, guaranteed by the new rules, is considered a positive innovation. [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, for you Bossi is a traitor. Did you expect him to be one? Do you know him well? [Previti] Not at all. I barely met him once, in Arcore [Berlusconi residence], when I still had no thought of entering into politics. However, I did become personally acquainted with Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni, last Sunday. We were in Silvio's gym, watching the soccer game on short-wave TV. I supported Lazio, and Speroni the Milan team. Gosh, he was wearing a buckle with a bull on it, with an inscription saying he has got what it takes, a leather tie.... [LA REPUBBLICA] What is Berlusconi's opinion of Bossi? [Previti] He also only met him by chance. Bossi always sends forth Maroni [League lower house floor leader], Formentini, Speroni. However, the League leader is warned. He has stumbled on a hard stone. Berlusconi is sailing full steam ahead. We are straightforward people, who have taken up straightforward commitments with the Italian people. We are in a position to submit a government plan and a platform by 15 April. If things do not develop smoothly, we will know whom to blame. Two months from now, in the European elections... [LA REPUBBLICA] What will happen then? [Previti] We will go to the polls in a free-for-all fashion and we will see who wins. Everything will be clearer then. Forza Italia will become a major party, a new count will have to be made. And you will see how the League will cool down, boy, will they cool down. [LA REPUBBLICA] Bossi says you are a nonexistent party. [Previti] And it will never exist in a traditional way, for that matter. We are not the sort of guys who go to Pontida [League rally venue], to have their hands kissed by the insane. [LA REPUBBLICA] Speaking of Pontida, next Sunday [10 April] Bossi will be raising the devil there. [Previti] I would advise him not to overdo things, not to carry things too far. He might be signing his own death sentence.
