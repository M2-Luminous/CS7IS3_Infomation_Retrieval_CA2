A signing ceremony to the effect was held here Tuesday [12 April]. The Shanghai port has so far set up sistership ties with eight foreign ports. The previous seven are the ports of Seattle, New Orleans, the New Jersey Port in the United States, Osaka and Yokohama in Japan, Antwerp in Belgium and Marseilles in France. As the biggest port in the ROK, Pusan Port handled a total of almost 70 million ton of goods last year. Since the two countries set up diplomatic relations in 1991 and especially since Shanghai and Pusan became sister cities in 1993, trade between the two sides has increased greatly. The two ports pledged to further their co-operation in shipping, technology, information and personnel exchanges.
