[passage omitted] This information was confirmed by Vasile Chirculescu, director of production at the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Mining Corporation, who also added that, quote, the strike has no legal basis, as it is taking place in the town's center and not in the miners' workplace, unquote. Miron Cosma, the chairman of the Confederation of Romania's Mining Trade Unions, who arrived in Targu Jiu at about 0900, made a statement to our correspondent saying that the principal reason behind the strike is the financial blockage, that is, the fact that the mining industry has been not paid debts of almost 200 billion lei. Another reason is the fact that during the [January] talks with the prime minister, he hinted at the fact that by 12 February all problems would be solved. However, nothing has been done until now, and the promised dialogue in connection with this labor conflict has not taken place either, Cosma asserted, adding that the government and the Gorj County Direction of Labor and Social Protection have violated the law by avoiding negotiations with the trade unions. According to Cosma, the strike that began today will be stopped only if a governmental delegation comes to Targu Jiu and signs a protocol offering guarantees for strikers' demands to be met. At this hour several hundred miners from the Gorj County coal mining units have gathered in the courtyard of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation. They are to be joined later by employees of mining units in Valcea and Mehedinti counties, reports our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu. In connection with the demands expressed by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation, State Secretary Octavian Partenie, specially authorized government representative for relations with the trade unions and employers, pointed out the following things to our correspondent: The indexation of salaries, the increase in the reference fund on the basis of efficiency parameters, and the possibility of negotiating salaries on the basis of performance criteria have been partially solved by a draft decision that is to be presented to the government later this week. The decision regarding salary indexations will also contain the text upon which the government has already agreed with the trade unions. The main problem, namely the issue of the financial blockage of the entire economy of the country, has been discussed by the executive over the past several weeks and they are trying to solve that problem. The brown coal mining corporation is not facing any difficulty in paying salaries and other payments to its employees or to pay its taxes and fees to the state budget, Partenie said.
