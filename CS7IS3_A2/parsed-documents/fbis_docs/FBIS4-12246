Members of the delegation accompanying the Palestinian president attended. They discussed developments in the Palestinian issue and continued discussing topics that the Palestinian president reviewed today with President Mubarak. Musa said afterward that he held contacts with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and added that he hopes the talks will continue. He expressed his hope that the car bomb in Israel today will not affect the negotiations, because the peace process is important and fundamental. He said the peace process can put an end to violence and that the launch of a Palestinian entity, implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Accord, and a move toward implementing the timetable will all pacify the situation. He noted that what is required is a fast and sincere implementation of the provisions of the Declaration of Principles. Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat said his talks with President Husni Mubarak and Musa today were important, positive, and constructive and would contribute greatly to advancing the peace process. He added that regrettably, the Palestinian side has seen no real gestures from the Israeli side for a precise, sincere, and swift implementation of what was agreed upon recently. [In two related Cairo-datelined reports, at 1835 GMT and 1845 GMT respectively on 6 April, Cairo MENA in Arabic adds the following: "Musa ruled out the possibility of visiting Israel right now." ["'Arafat refused to answer a question on the explosion in Israel today."]
