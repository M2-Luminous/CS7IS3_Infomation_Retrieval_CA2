First, as for the trade imbalance, which is the basic cause of the friction between Japan and the United States, it is almost certain that Japan's 1993 trade surplus with the United States will reach a high level. It also turned out that the Japanese-U.S. comprehensive economic consultations [framework talks] which are being held to correct this imbalance have so far merely widened the gap between the two countries. For example, while the most important point of these talks was whether or not Japan will agree to set numerical targets as a criterion in measuring the degree of the liberalization of its market, it was finally agreed at the Japanese-U.S. summit held in July that the vague expression "objective criterion" is to be used. Japanese industrial circles, however, are ready to totally refuse to accept such targets. At the Japanese-U.S. semiconductor talks, it was agreed, as an objective criterion, that the "[U.S. semiconductors'] share of the Japanese market should be 20 percent." However, this agreement was secretly changed to be regarded as a formal agreement between Japan and the United States. Because of this bitter past experience, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is also expressing its intention of totally rejecting numerical targets. In opposing this concept, [MITI] is even expressing its rejection of the three major U.S. automobile makers' enumerating their numerical targets as being to what extent they want to participate in the Japanese market -- that is, how many dealers they have in Japan, and how many cars with right-hand drive they export to Japan, etc. On the other hand, the United States, which insists that Japan set numerical targets, is trying to appease Japan by suggesting that a "failure to attain the numerical targets does not mean that we will take retaliatory measures." However, the Japanese side is not at all willing to accept this proposal. The distrust between the two countries is creating the deadlocked situation. If the two countries continue to take an uncompromising attitude, it is likely that the attitude of the Clinton administration toward the Hosokawa government will also largely change. Because of its expectations of the new government, the Clinton administration has so far to a certain extent given the Hosokawa government time to deal with the trade imbalance. Therefore, the United States did not make particularly strong requests to the Hosokawa government at the Japanese-U.S. summit held at the end of September and at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference held at the beginning of November. However, if there is still no sign of compromise at the Japanese- U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February, it is inevitable that President Clinton's attitude will stiffen. In the first place, the Congress will not put up with Japan's attitude. Midterm elections are due to be held this year. Because all 435 congressmen and one-third of the 100 senators face elections, intense pressure will be put on the government by congressmen and senators, who attach importance to the interests of their respective constituencies. It is impossible for President Clinton to disregard such pressure, for he earlier received a big favor from the Congress in having NAFTA ratified. The United States cannot expect economic growth unless it increases its exports, and as for Japan, it is a "nation which is dependent on exports." Under the circumstances, unless such a structure is changed, it is inevitable that economic conflicts will occur between the two countries. Although we do not hear the "theory of the Japanese threat" mentioned anymore, possibly because the United States is sympathetic to Japan because of its prolonged recession, it is likely that Japanese-U.S. relations will face a more serious phase henceforth.
