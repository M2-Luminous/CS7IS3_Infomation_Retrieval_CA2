Although hardening positions does not include any thought of ceasing the negotiations, the government was not far off from adopting such a position. The ministers are divided between those -- like Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer -- who support a halt to the negotiations until 'Arafat makes a public statement about his commitment to the interim agreements, and those -- like Peres and Rabin -- who believe that they should overlook the violations and base themselves on implementation of the agreements on the ground. Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said in a special interview with Dov Goldstein: "If the Palestinians violate the agreements they signed, they will never reach the stage they regard as their primary goal, negotiations on the permanent settlement." According to Singer, Israel has many ways to react to violations of the agreement by the PLO. "We will block the crossing from Gaza and Jericho. Aircraft will not land and will not take off from Gaza's airstrip. The Palestinians will not fish in the sea and their police vessels will not sail along the coast. We will block the Palestinian sources of funds. We will not transfer to them customs imposed on goods meant for Gaza and Jericho. "We will not transfer to the Palestinians the funds from income tax deducted from Palestinians working in Israel. There are many other sanctions we can impose. I hope there will be no need to impose any of them, but if there will be, Israel will not hesitate."
