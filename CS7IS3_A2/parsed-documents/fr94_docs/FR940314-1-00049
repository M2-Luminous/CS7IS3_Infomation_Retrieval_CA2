FR940314-1-00049 FR940314-1-00012 Recognizing that a person is subject to criminal liability for submitting false information to the Federal Government (18 U.S.C. 1001), FDA is proposing to require that a notice of claimed small business exemption contain a signed certification of the accuracy of the submission by a responsible individual for the company submitting the notice (proposed ยง101.9(j)(18)(iv)(F) and ยง101.36(f)(2)(iv)(F). Additional information to support the validity of the information provided in the notice may be required under section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act. Section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act provides that a notice of a claimed small business exemption shall ``contain such information'' as FDA (by delegation from the Secretary) may require ``to verify the information required'' about the number of full-time equivalent employees and unit sales of food products if the agency ``has questioned the validity of such information.'' Because the notice cannot include information that FDA has not yet required_that is, that FDA has not yet identified as necessary to verify the information in the notice_a two-step process is necessary to implement this provision. The agency must first review the notice and decide whether any verifying information is necessary and then be given access to that information. The agency is considering defining in this rulemaking the procedure through which it will obtain the verifying information that the statute clearly states that it may require. Information in the notice could be verified either by requiring the submission of supporting documentation or by inspecting that documentation at a firm's place of business. In some circumstances, inspection of records will be more practicable than submission, and vice versa. FDA is thus considering requiring that any company that claims the small business exemption provide the agency with access to its records that support the information contained in the exemption notice if the agency finds that such access is necessary to verify the information contained in the notice. In some situations, the agency may instead require the submission of supporting information to the agency. FDA tentatively finds that it has ample legal authority to impose these requirements. Under section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)), FDA has the authority to adopt by regulation requirements that are necessary for the efficient enforcement of the act, including section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act. (See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 617 (1973); United States v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 246 (2d Cir. 1977).) Courts have recognized FDA's authority to impose records inspection requirements where they effectuate the goals of the act. (See Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 163&hyph;64 (1967); National Confectioners Association v. Califano, 569 F.2d 690, 693 & n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1978).) Implementing section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act through the sole method of requiring submission of verifying information to the agency could be unduly burdensome for both the agency and the companies claiming the small business exemption. For example, the agency could determine, under section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, that information in a particular notice must be verified by examining a firm's payroll records and invoices. Copying all of these documents and submitting them to the agency could present difficulty for a small business claiming the exemption. This difficulty could be avoided if FDA examined the relevant documents at the firm's premises. Moreover, verifying the information contained in notice of claimed exemption by inspecting documents at the firm's place of business, and copying only those needed, would in many cases be a more efficient use of the agency's investigational resources. This approach is consistent with FDA's actions in other areas where it has required that records be made available to agency employees. (See, e.g., 21 CFR 108.25(g) (acidified foods); 108.35(h) (thermal processing of low-acid foods); 172.320 (amino acids).) The agency points out that its contemplated approach is fully consistent with Congress' desire, as reflected in the legislative history of the 1993 amendments, that the small business exemption be obtained in a simple and straightforward manner without complicated reporting. (See 139 Congressional Record E 2016 (August 5, 1993) (statement of Rep. Dingell) (``The system is a simple one that does not require complicated reporting or a response from FDA.''); see also 139 Cong. Rec. S 10817 (August 6, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (The 1993 amendments ``provide[] a straightforward system under which a company simply notifies the FDA that one or more of its products qualify for an exemption''); id. at S 10818 (statement of Sen. Hatch).) Under the approach that the agency is considering, a company would merely have to file a simple notice with the agency. It would then be up to the agency to determine whether any matter needs verification and to take steps to view the documentation required to verify the relevant information.
