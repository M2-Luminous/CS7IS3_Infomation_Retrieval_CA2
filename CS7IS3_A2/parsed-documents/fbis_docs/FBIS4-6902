Here is Mr. Zlenko at the presss conference: [Begin Zlenko recording in Russian fading into Vietnamese translation] This is the first visit to Vietnam by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the Republic separated from the former USSR. In its foreign policy, Ukraine attached great importance to relations with countries in Asia and the Pacific, in which Vietnam plays an important role. Ukraine has been confronted with numerous difficulties in its economic reform when shifting to a market economy. Production has declined, information increased, and people's life degraded. In this situation, Ukraine needs to find new trade partners, especially restoring relations with traditional clients such as Vietnam. According to economics, Asia-Pacific has been a dynamic and promising region of the 20th century. Ukraine admires the achievements of the Vietnamese people in economic reform while maintaining political stability. It is good for Ukraine to learn from the experience of Vietnam and other countries in the region. The Ukrainian foreign minister said: He had talks with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam and met with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides agreed to continue their friendship and bilateral comprehensive cooperation in which Ukraine can develop its potentials in engineering, oil, and gas exploitation, food processing, and construction. The two sides also agreed to continue the process for signing agrements on encouragement and protection of investments, and avoidance of double taxation which will serve as a legal foundation for new bilateral relations to bear fruits. The Ukrainian foreign minister also said Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet would visit Ukraine in June this year and believed the visit would be an important step for further development of bilateral relations. Speaking with newsmen on the situation in Bosnia, the Ukrainian diplomat said: Ukraine wanted to solve the conflict through peaceful negotiations. Ukraine was gravely concerned about what had happened there would not only cause much losses and sorrow for local people but also threaten to drag other Balkan states into the conflict. Ukraine hopes efforts by the world community, including Russia, would soon peacefully solve the crisis. [end recording]
