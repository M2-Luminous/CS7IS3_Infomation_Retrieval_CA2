That is what happened with the Marxist utopia of communism. That, alas, is what in many ways is also happening with one of our new utopias--the privatization program that is being implemented now. Privatization Socialist Style It is difficult to understand the reasons that conditioned the rather broadly and persistently propagandized opinion that the privatization being conducted in Russia at the present time is radical and "of the people"--the kind that will create an extensive class of private property owners and that will include almost all Russian citizens in this middle class. For if we divert our attention from the forceful and bombastic declaratory statements of the supporters of such a program (set, by the way, by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet according to its own principles), then it is not difficult to see that in a number of its features--fortunately, not in all of them--it is utopian, and in addition to this it has a leveling, orthodox-socialistic character. First, the program is being conducted in such a way that the main part of the national wealth remains under state domination. The volume of properties being received by vouchers is trifling (for each, the "note" has a value on the order of about one-fourth of an average monthly wage, or $15). All of the natural resources, "public" enterprises, and controlling blocks of shares of stock of a majority of the enterprises converted to joint-stock companies remain with the government. Second, the distribution itself of state property by vouchers takes place according to the socialist principle--the division of property among all fellow citizens "as equals." And if such a division under conditions of deeply rooted private property attitudes (as, for example, in the Czech and Slovak republics) is capable of reinforcing these attitudes and expanding their subject makeup, then, under conditions of the domination of state property and the until now the indestructible parasitical-consumer psychology of a majority of the population, a similar result is possible, but then this is not always, only during the use of vouchers for the acquisition of property by the "labor collective"--however, with all of the contradictions inherent in the given method of privatization. Third, that which in Russia is now called "privatization" is built on an understanding of property that corresponds to socialist concepts that equate property with wealth, benefits, and the source of a mellow and carefree life (the idea of its division "as equals" comes from this). Meanwhile, property in the economy is not so much a consumer blessing as much as a burden and responsibility--a material basis for the application of intensive labor, enterprise, risk, brains, and talent. Its main criterion and indicator are "one's own" investments and the investment of profits in production. It is this effect that private property gives under conditions of competition and market rivalry. And, consequently, the general task of real privatization does not consist in dividing objects of property "as equals," but making property really private and, consequently, an incentive for intensive labor, an increase in labor productivity, a factor of responsibility for work, and a force that motivates "personal" investments. The Insidious Voucher It is necessary, of course, to see that the privatization being conducted currently has positive aspects (as, by the way, some facets of socialist concepts are not without sense). It "turned" Russian citizens toward questions of property, and the rudiments of business appeared. The fundamental deficiency of the ongoing privatization program is that it is aimed at the implementation of utopian ideas--to make all citizens of Russia private property subjects with the help of privatization voucher-checks. Well, vouchers have a known moral significance: They are evidence that the state is a debtor to its own citizens; in some measure, vouchers can have the character of temporary material assistance to citizens. But it is impossible in principle to transform all of our fellow citizens into private property owners--bearers of small parts of the wealth of former state property--with the help of vouchers. Not only because of the scantiness of the "portion" received and the modest prospects of acquiring incomes on the shares of stock acquired for vouchers. And not only because state property and a parasitical consumer psychology continue to reign in society. But principally because this is contradicted by the very nature of a dynamic commodity market economy, on the creation of which economic reforms are calculated, inasmuch as property-owning citizens who do not participate in production can only be property-owning rentiers who parasitize on production and on the results of the activity of property-owning producers (that is why in countries with a developed economy, pensioners, servicemen, and workers in the budgetary institutions are supported by the state and are not directly supported by property-owning producers). It seems that already now a number of aspects of a privatization that is built on a system of vouchers has engendered a lot of negative consequences. First, many important elements of privatization relating to production and having independent significance were "driven" by concerns for the success of the voucher system, and so that shares of stock of any enterprises being privatized could be acquired by all voucher owners. Second, the voucher system, contrary to the purpose of property in production, is even a disincentive to work. In a situation of all-out propaganda ("gold vouchers," "thousand percent incomes," etcetera, etcetera), the impression is created that it is possible to receive impressive incomes at the expense of "the work of others" through shares of stock acquired for vouchers. Third, also with respect to enterprises whose shares of stock were acquired for vouchers--this is a disincentive, inasmuch as such a procedure involves an increase in the number of people who do not work in production, but who claim a share of the profits, in a word, still another tax on profits that is not justified by anything. Well, and the very idea of a "return" with the help of vouchers to pensioners, doctors, teachers, servicemen, and state budget employees of state property (attractive and tempting, just like all socialist ideas) is futile and without promise. They Got What They Were Fighting Against In behalf of the success of the voucher system, the ongoing privatization program essentially limited the rights of the labor collectives. This, in addition to everything else, alienated a substantial number of labor collectives from democratic movements with which the privatization program is associated. At the same time, there are a lot of reasons for the guarded and even negative attitude toward the privatization being implemented by labor collectives. After all, the "labor collectives" that were formed under conditions of the socialistic command-planning system were in themselves not adapted to economic management as property owners, and they frequently were only a cover and a conduit for commands issued by the party-administrative elite. Therefore, in the opinion of the author of these lines, the "lease-purchase" variant of privatization that operated in the past, which was optimal for post-totalitarian conditions, did not have the labor collective as the strong point as such, but the "organization of leaseholders," which at first mastered the difficult school of "its own" economic management step by step, and only afterwards became a fully-fledged property owner. The system of privatization in operation, which is geared to voucher distribution, nevertheless could not bypass the labor collectives, and a substantial number of the latter, having overcome by hook or crook the obstacles and impediments created for them, became "closed" joint-stock companies--property owners of privatized property. But they became "as such" without changing, and without adapting to difficult economic management as private property owners. Well, it happens. As one of the unexpected consequences of "people's" privatization, Russian society received precisely that against which it was fighting, and also in a worse variant. In a number of oblasts and sectors of the national economy, and in a number of localities, enclaves of the command-planning system were firmly established under the flag of labor collectives and the aegis of the old regime director corps. And now there is no need to be surprised that a base of the past party-administrative aktiv has been consolidated and that the source of the increasing strength of communist and procommunist circles has been broadened. But What Is To Be Done? First of all, it is necessary to see the truth, the real state of affairs. Unfortunately, until very recently the reaction of the adherents of the current programs of "people's" privatization to critical considerations and proposals was not of a practical nature, and it sometimes ended up in irritated, peremptory cries and the application of labels to the authors of these kinds of considerations and proposals. Is it really necessary to wait for a complete crash that will also cancel the movement forward on the most complicated problems of reorganizing property in order to agree on obvious facts, to discuss debatable ideas, and to begin to make corrections in the ongoing privatization process? Then, it is clear, it is necessary to explain oneself to the people immediately. It must be believed that the authors of the programs in effect sincerely wanted to make all Russians property owners of those riches that they earned a long time ago, and to create equal conditions for everyone to enter the market. But then, not everything that is planned works out. The people will understand, if they are talked to sincerely and honestly. And judging by everything, it is still not too late to develop a system of compensatory measures. The main thing is this, after preserving everything that is positive that has already been achieved in the process of privatization, to persistently spread the privatization processes directly to production. In order that private property would begin to work not only in the sphere of marketplace resales and clever currency operations, but so that it would become a powerful incentive to work. Three measures are presented here as priorities. First-- resolute legislative and governmental support in the production of private business and all forms of private property (not "forms of private property" in general, but specifically private ownership), i.e., private entrepreneurs, intact production cooperatives, and private-collective enterprises--all of those that on the basis of "their own" property, market competition, risk, and responsibility work in the market to saturate it with quality goods and services. It is precisely with respect to such private commodity producers (but not "commodity producers" in general) that it is necessary finally to decide substantially to reduce taxes, to remove all restrictions that encroach on economic freedom, to support them with credits, to establish for them, as for all other "commodity producers" (bureaucratic subsidized state enterprises also hide behind this cunning formula) single, stable "rules of the game"--civil legislation worked out in detail. Second-- inclusion of the workers themselves in the practical relations of the private property of enterprises converted to joint-stock companies. Here, without in any way wrecking the system of already established joint-stock enterprises and their current forms, it would be quite justified to strengthen and enrich this system, conditionally speaking, with "producer societies" established for worker-joint-stock enterprises that would have, for example, "doubled shares of stock" [sdvoyennyye aktsii]: in order, however, that the normatively established part of the incomes for these shares goes to investment in production. It can be confidently predicted that the effect of such an inclusion of the workers themselves of converted joint-stock companies with respect to private property in the sphere of production will be significant. Third--the kind of reorganization of open joint-stock companies (after a resolution of all questions associated with voucher privatization) when their "openness" would be oriented not on the possessors of papers, behind which there is no real wealth, but on actual domestic and foreign investors--the possessors of capital. Such a "directed openness" would make it possible, as experience indicates, to implement a structural, technical, and technological restructuring of production and ensure a considerable increase in the productivity of labor, market vitality, and the activeness of enterprises. These and other corrections in the ongoing privatization program will give it, as can be expected, a real and effective nature and will make it possible to put into effect the potential of private property as a powerful work incentive and a high degree of responsibility for work, which are factors in the growing investments in production. It is necessary just to free oneself of "voucher illusions" and the current utopian hopes that are associated with them.
