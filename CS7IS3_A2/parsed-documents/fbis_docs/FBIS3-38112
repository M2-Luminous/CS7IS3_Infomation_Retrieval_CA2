Yesterday, CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] Defense Minister Leo Delcroix presented his mid-term assessment, commenting in passing on his plans for the current year. "This will be the year when things really happen," he anticipated. "The year during which the decisions on restructuring will be implemented on the ground." Here Delcroix was referring to the continuation of the Army reform process to which the government gave a "green light" in January 1993. On the ground, this will primarily entail repatriation from Germany of all units deployed east of the Rhine (13,000 soldiers, including 3,200 professionals); in 1994, explained Minister Delcroix, no more than 18,000 Belgians would remain in Germany, as against 48,000 in 1990. These movements have major socioeconomic implications. Initially, the Defense Ministry had decided to build 250 homes, at little cost (because they would in many cases be located on military sites -- L'ECHO editor's note). Assuredly this number will be insufficient. As for the subject of personnel problems -- an item which "eats up" 60 percent of the ministry's annual department -- the former national secretary of the CVP has promised to pay special attention to this. Being henceforth constrained to "follow" the labor market with a view to lowering the average age of officers, the Army will also adopt a policy of outplacement in order to avoid "difficult situations" as far as possible. Finally, 1994 will mark the arrival of the first short-term volunteers, while the government has also just come out in favor of employing military personnel outside the Army. A Budget To Be Earned The speech by the successor of...Guy Coeme displays the desire to manage a compressed budget as best he can. "The Army must earn its budget," said Delcroix. Remember, one of the first measures taken by the Dehaene government in the spring of 1992, was to decree a freeze in nominal terms of the national defense budget for the entire period covered by the convergence plan. In a nutshell, this means that the "envelope" would remain at its ceiling of 98 billion Belgian francs [BFr] until 1997, which implies a progressive reduction in real terms (due to inflation -- L'ECHO editor's note). In order to gain freedom of movement within this tight "corset," Leo Delcroix is expecting to make plenty of money from the sale of military equipment and buildings, which began in 1993 and should give him some breathing space. Over the period in which the Army will be restructured, i.e. until 1997, a total amount of BFr3.6 billion had been budgeted as profit from such sales. "However, it may turn out to be more," is the message being whispered in the Ministry of Defense. Nonetheless, until now, the balance from these sales transactions is hardly brilliant, and is not yet giving cause for optimism. In terms of "light equipment," since last May public sales, which take place every two months in Neder-over-Heembeek, have yielded BFr250 million. However, for "heavy equipment," where the purchasers are nations, the balance is zero. The sales procedure (especially regarding aircraft) is long and tedious, requiring approval by the foreign minister and, possibly, by his colleague, the minister for economic affairs...or by the manufacturer. The most problematic transaction, it would seem, concerns "surplus" (more than 80) F-16's, which are in direct competition with the armada of 600 similar machines that the United States is looking to sell (and where the U.S. manufacturer has a right of inspection of sales by our country! -- L'ECHO editor's note). Nonetheless, some dossiers, it is claimed, have progressed, and the first effects of this should make themselves felt in the very near future (the three minehunters and 60 Mirage fighters are apparently arousing some interest). Finally there remains the profit from sales of military sites. Those whose reallocation does not pose a problem, brought in a mere BFr15 million in 1993. However, the serious business should get off the ground this year. In order to be able to sell the buildings in question, and above all to gain price estimates, the regions have been asked to launch the procedure which would allocate these sites a specific function, depending on their sectoral plans. Details are expected to trickle in over the next few months. The Shadow of Guy Coeme These sales of equipment and sites are important...for they will determine the government's policy on purchases. Last July, the government approved the "medium-term investment plan" (PMT) proposed by its Ministry of Defense. This plan fixes the limit on purchases that can be made over the years to come with a view to modernizing the Army. As Minister Delcroix pointed out, the main priorities of the PMT are modernization of the 48 F-16's (that are being retained), purchase of 250 trucks for the Army, and construction of four minesweepers for the Navy. A second list of lower priority investments in infrastructure is subject to certain conditions. Its consideration and the effective realization of the "urgent" list depend on the budgetary resources and, consequently, on the result of the sales. [passage omitted]
