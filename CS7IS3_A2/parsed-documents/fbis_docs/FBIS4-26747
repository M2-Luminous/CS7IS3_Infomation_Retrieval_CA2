To achieve this goal, the South China province will open all sectors to foreign investment, apart from special industries which still fall under central control, said Lu Ruihua, managing vice-governor in an interview with Business Weekly last week. In addition to improving the infrastructure, Guangdong expects to set up a concrete market framework and introduce an economic development system in line with international practice. Lu said he hopes this will create a better investment climate. "We are offering the markets, the stocks, the interest and the efficiency to overseas investors to let them earn big money in the province," Lu said. Foreign investment will be used to develop infrastructure industries like energy, transport and telecommunications, ethylene, automobiles, electronics, textiles and medicine. Meanwhile, Guangdong is steering foreign investment toward new and high-tech industries as well as high-value-added sectors and export-oriented agriculture. But rural areas still hope foreign investment will arrive to develop labour-intensive processing industries. Guangdong also hopes to receive more loans from foreign financial groups to invest in the province. The province also needs to set up more service centers to better support investors. To woo foreign businessmen, Guangdong is organizing a foreign trade and investment fair in Hong Kong from June 28 to July 2 and a similar fair in the United States in mid-November. Foreign capital is expected to play an important role in future economic growth, Lu said. In the first five months this year Guangdong attracted $4.09 billion in foreign investment up 37.6 per cent over the same period last year. Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Huizhou Zhanjiang, Shantou and Jieyang reported foreign investment increases of more than 50 per cent. Despite a 10 per cent drop of investment from Hong Kong, funds from the United States, Britain France, Thailand and Australia soared by more than 50 per cent during the January-May period. In the period from 1979 to 1993, Guangdong attracted foreign investment commitments of $84.9 billion and actual overseas investment of $29.45 billion. Both numbers account for over 30 per cent of the national total in those categories. And by 1993, Guangdong had registered over 41,000 foreign-funded firms.
