Ossetia MK0906083694 Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 8 Jun 94 p 3 MK0906083694 Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian BFN [Unattributed report in the "NEGA Reports" column] [Text] North Ossetia -- A meeting has taken place in Vladikavkaz between republic President Akhsarbek Galazov, parliament head Yuriy Biragov, and Provisional Administration chief Vladimir Lozovoy. The focus of attention was on matters related to the rehabilitation of housing and communications destroyed in the course of the tragic events of October and November 1992, as well as socioeconomic problems in the state of emergency zone. Also taking part in the discussion were members of the government and parliament of North Ossetia, as well as representatives of federal ministries and departments on a fact-finding mission in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. According to Vladimir Lozovoy, a large group of Russian Federation ministry and department chiefs arrived in the conflict zone to organize preparation for the return of refugees and forced resettlers to four populated areas in Prigorodnyy Rayon, in line with the Russian Federation president's 30 May 1994 edict On Introducing a State of Emergency in Parts of the Territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The meeting pinpointed the main lines of activity by the republic leadership toward adjusting the situation. North Ossetia is ready to implement the Russian president's edict and a corresponding resolution by the Russian Federation Government, but the refugee problem should be resolved in a comprehensive manner, on the basis of the agreements signed in Kislovodsk. A decisive say here belongs to conciliation commissions that were set up in all populated areas of Prigorodnyy Rayon. Their activity is already yielding some results. Thus, residents in the village of Kurtat at their meeting ruled that six Ingushi families return to their former homes, specifying them by name.
