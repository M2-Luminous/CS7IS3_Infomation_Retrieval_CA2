After the scandal resulting from the presence of American troops in Somalia and their ignominious withdrawal from that country, the issue of the mode of American participation in the formation of peacekeeping forces was put on the agendas of the U.S. Administration and Congress. After months of debate and enquiry, in a document that has been published recently, the United States has called for the clarification of eight points before it makes any decisions on dispatching of UN forces. [sentence as heard] According to the U.S. president's national security adviser, the most important of those eight issues is whether U.S. interests will be guaranteed by the intervention of UN forces and whether international peace and security will be violated or the two will be threatened. Moreover, the United States seeks a definite table for UN operations on the basis of common objectives and political-military strategy, and the determination of the number of forces and a precise assessment of operation expenses. The United States will participate only in operations that will achieve total success with a maximum number of 15 casualties. The fact that the United States regards any threat to its own vital interests as a threat to international peace and security and then shows interest in participating in the formation of peacekeeping forces is in reality the most conspicuous aspect of change in the United Nations after the Cold War era. The approach of the permanent members of the UN Security Council toward world issues indicates that not much remains of the UN Security Council as an international council; and in fact the Western Members of the Security Council act as a board of directors, only safeguarding their own interests. During the Cold War era, those states used to abstain from participating in UN peacekeeping activities in the form of an implicit agreement. But at the moment, following changes in international circumstances, they are considered as the eminent activist in UN peacekeeping. That presence and cooperation is indicative of the change in the role of UN peacekeeping forces. Peacekeeping is a term related to the Cold War era, an era when the two sides of a conflict would come to an agreement after a long period of fighting and UN soldiers would take the responsibility of guarding that agreement as a buffer and impartial force. During that era, which lasted from 1948 to 1990, most UN soldiers were from north European states, Nepal, Sri Lanka, as well as some African states. But under present circumstances, the so-called peacekeeping force intervenes as one of the warring sides, oversees elections, purges police forces, armies, and government departments, and trains new forces; such that in operations in Cambodia the management of eight ministries was in the hands of those forces. In such a case peacekeeping is not the issue; the safeguarding of interests is the objective, and since those operations are selective, biased countries like America are attracted to them. Under present world circumstances, because of the serious popular resistance in other countries in the face of interference by countries such as America in their internal affairs and public opinion, Western states that are the permanent members of the UN Security Council benefit from UN operations as a cover for their hegemonic objectives.
