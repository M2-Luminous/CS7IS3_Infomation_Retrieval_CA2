RP94&hyph;309 et al. (69 FERC ¶ 61,234). In particular, Tennessee has clarified, through the tariff sheet listed in Item A, which surcharges apply to the PTR Rate Schedule and clearly stated the rate after current adjustment will be increased to reflect the applicable surcharges. In Item B, Tennessee has reflected the removal of GSR costs from its IT rates for the period of September 1993 through April 1994 and a reduction to the GSR components effective May 1 and August 1 (respectively). Tennessee is, however, reserving its right to seek rehearing of the Commission's order but has adjusted the rates as specified by the Commission, as demonstrated in Schedules 1&hyph;1.3. In Item C, Tennessee modified the effective date of the settlement fuel rates for Rate Schedule NET shippers to November 1, 1992. This change does not apply to the Segment U rates which are subject to separate determination in Docket No. RP92&hyph;132. Finally, in Item D, Tennessee has reflected the appropriate settlement rate for OSP under the T&hyph;180 Rate Schedule for the period November 1992 through September 1993 and from September 1993 to current. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
