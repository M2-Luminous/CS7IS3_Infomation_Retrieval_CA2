In addition, he has refused North Korea's recent proposals to discuss the issue of the additional inspections at the third U.S.-North Korean talks. Foreign Minister Han, who is now staying in Washington to seek joint measures for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, made those remarks prior to a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. He added that if North Korea does not accept the IAEA's request for additional inspections, the international community, including the United Nations, will have no choice other than imposing sanctions on North Korea. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that if North Korea does not change its attitude but instead strongly reacts to the international community by withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the international community, including the ROK, the United States, and the United Nations, will respond strongly. Foreign Minister Han said: During the ROK-PRC summit talks and the ROK-PRC foreign ministers' talks, China stressed that it would exercise influence over North Korea only if a phase of North-South dialogue continues. China has also asked the ROK side to create an atmosphere in which China can fully play a role in resolving the nuclear issue. In addition, Foreign Minister Han said that he would meet with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher to discuss if the UN Security Council will adopt a statement in the name of its president or adopt a resolution. He stressed that if the UN Security Council adopts the statement, it will include the deadline for North Korean nuclear inspections and additional steps at the UN level. Foreign Minister Han is expected to meet UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and representatives of the permanent member states of the UN Security Council on 31 March and ask for their cooperation.
