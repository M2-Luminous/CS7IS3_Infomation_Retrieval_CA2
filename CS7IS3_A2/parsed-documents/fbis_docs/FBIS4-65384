Leading newspapers such as EL MUNDO, EL PAIS, DIARIO 16, and CINCO DIAS report regularly on this topic. The two latter sources have added weekly environmental supplements titled "Biosphere" and "Environment" respectively. The following are environmental issues being reported prominently in the Spanish press. Environmental Complaints Viewed A 26 March article in EL PAIS notes that one-third of all complaints received by the Public Defender's Office in 1993 were related to the environment and of these 90 percent focused on noise pollution. Margarita Retuerto, acting public defender/ombudsman interviewed by EL PAIS, criticized Spain's legal track record on the environment. Retuerto said that Spain currently "lacks the legal framework" to properly handle environmental pollution cases and is at a further disadvantage due to its "disjointed and dispersed bureaucracy." Aside from noise pollution, citizens complained about "environmental pollution, insufficient protection for open spaces and waterways, and demanded the right to have greater access to environmental information." According to the Public Defender's Office, the number of environmental complaints rose steadily in 1993, pointing to citizens' increased awareness. ENDESA Case Profiled According to a 1 February commentary in CINCO DIAS by Maria A. Gonzalez, attorney and director of the Praxis Environmental Consulting firm, a current environmental case before the courts involves the National Electric Power Company (ENDESA). ENDESA's Teruel-based power plant is charged with spreading acid rain throughout a large forested area in El Maestrazgo, a mountainous district of the Castellon and Teruel provinces in eastern Spain. Approximately 200,000 hectares of forests in the El Maestrazgo region were ravaged with damages estimated at around 10 billion pesetas ($73 million). A 22 February article in CINCO DIAS by Arturo Cenzano reports that legal proceedings began six years ago and involve ENDESA's president Feliciano Fuster and three other executives. Fuster has been sentenced to pay a fine worth 5 billion pesetas ($36.5 million). The prosecutor has asked for one-year prison sentences for these individuals, which has angered environmental groups demanding longer sentences. A 26 March article in EL PAIS reports that ENDESA has already begun taking steps to reduce pollution stemming from its Teruel power plant. According to this article, in March 1994, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, Minister of Industry and Energy announced that ENDESA would spend 23 billion pesetas ($167.9 million) to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. In her CINCO DIAS commentary, Gonzalez points to the difficulties inherent in determining guilt when several potential polluters are involved in a single case. Further difficulties arise when it comes to verifying and substantiating relationships between the causes and effects of pollution. In some cases, the cumulative effects of pollution cannot be ascribed to a single factor, but rather to a variety of causes that are completely unrelated. For example, in March 1993 CINCO DIAS published the findings of the Center for Environmental Studies on the Mediterranean (CEAM), which exonerated ENDESA of sole responsibility for causing acid rain in Castellon. The report blames two petrochemical complexes in southern France and the Piombino region in central Italy for spreading sulfur dioxide emissions in the Castellon district. Cenzano's article notes that the ENDESA lawsuit has caused anxiety among people who depend on jobs created by the Teruel-based Electric Power Company. The Aragon Employers Association is concerned because ENDESA created 6,400 jobs in an area that has been struggling economically. According to Cenzano, members of the Employers Association defend ENDESA on the grounds that the company has been a proven leader in the fight against environmental waste by investing upwards of 30 billion pesetas ($219 million) over the past few years. Companies Seek Information on Environmental Issues The Center for Documentation and Information on Industry and the Environment (CIDIMA), located in Madrid, offers Spanish companies a wide range of information on environmental concerns and legislation, according to a 15 March report in CINCO DIAS by Ana Hernando. The center, which opened in February 1994, is located at and under the direction of the School for Industrial Organization (EOI). CIDIMA director Jesus Santa-Olalla, who was interviewed by CINCO DIAS, believes the center's customers will be small and medium-sized businesses that lack access to information on environmental standards. During its first month in operation, CIDIMA was primarily consulted by companies concerned about violating environmental standards, service-oriented companies, retailers, and a vast number of private and public institutions focusing on environmental issues. Most requests focused on EU [European Union] environmental standards and nonpolluting or "clean" technologies. CIDIMA maintains contacts with similar centers in France, Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom for informational exchanges. For instance, the center has an ongoing agreement with the British Library. CIDIMA is currently busy setting up branches in several of Spain's autonomous communities so that environmental organizations within these areas can distribute CIDIMA services. EOI's board of directors is now considering establishing a CIDIMA branch in Seville, because it believes "this city could well become a springboard for providing CIDIMA services to South America." Negotiations are now under way with the Argentine Government to set up a branch in that country. To set up CIDIMA, EOI invested 50 million pesetas ($365,000), which also happens to be CIDIMA's projected annual budget. Santa-Olalla noted that at first companies felt "threatened by the large investments needed to equip businesses with environmentally sound technologies." Now, however, corporations are changing their attitudes and realizing that in the long run, the effects of environmental improvements will help them "generate larger profits and make their products more competitive." Large Investments Needed To Adapt to EU Standards In the 15 March CINCO DIAS Ana Hernando quotes estimates of between 1.5 and 3 trillion pesetas ($10.9-21.9 billion) that would be needed to adapt Spanish industries to EU environmental standards. Reportedly, the chemical sector will require the largest investment. This sector will absorb an estimated 39 percent of the financial aid available through the European Fund for Economic Compensation to introduce more environmentally sound technology. The energy sector will require an investment of 31 percent, the automobile industry 9 percent, and the construction industry 5 percent of the European Funds' financial assistance. Economic forecasts calculate that the Spanish oil industry will have to invest more than 500 billion pesetas ($3.65 billion) during the next seven years to safeguard the environment. The Ministry of Industry and Energy plans to promote projects and technologies geared toward reducing pollution levels. By EU standards, the environmental sector in Spain remains a fledgling one, since Spanish companies in this sector account for only 3 percent of EU's total market for the environmental industry. By the year 2000, however, the environmental industry in Spain will grow to around 50 trillion pesetas ($365 billion).
