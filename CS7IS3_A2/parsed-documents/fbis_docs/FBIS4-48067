FBIS4-48067 "drafr091_b_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 EAST AFRICA Kenya Court Nullifies Opposition MP's Election Court Nullifies Opposition MP's Election EA1005213994 Nairobi Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Network in English 1102 GMT 10 May 94 EA1005213994 Nairobi Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Network in English 1102 GMT 10 May 94 English BFN [Excerpt] The election court today nullified the election of Mr. Geoffrey Muraya Macharia as the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy [FORD]-Asili MP for Mathare constituency in Nairobi. Justice Emmanuel O'Kubaso, John Mwera, and Gideon Mbito in their ruling said the electoral commission erred in not providing clearly marked ballot papers. As a result, the judges contended, over 43,000 ballot papers were unmarked, adding that a large number of votes were not stamped. The court ruled that after a recount, Muraya Macharia garnered 6,001 stamped votes and 16,344 unstamped votes. The petitioner, Mr. Frederick Masinde of FORD-Kenya, scored 8,306 stamped votes and 10,620 unstamped votes. Consequently, the judges explained that Mr. Masinde scored over 2,000 votes more than Mr. Muraya going by the number of the marked votes. The judges, however, noted that no election offense had been committed and ordered Mr. Muraya and the electoral commission to meet the cost of the suit. In the 1992 general elections, Mr. Muraya garnered 23,864 votes, while Mr. Masinde got 19,579. [passage omitted]
