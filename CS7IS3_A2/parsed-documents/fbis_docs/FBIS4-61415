Draft To Be Considered Following State Duma's Move"] [Text] The State Duma budget committee's subcommittee on currency regulation has drawn up the draft federal law "On the Maximum Amount of Foreign Borrowing by the Russian Federation and the Maximum Amount of Credits To Be Granted by It to Foreign States in 1994." The draft law is designed to tighten control over the growth in Russia's foreign debt, which has already exceeded $80 billion. Under the draft law, Russia's international treaties on attracting or granting state credits are subject to mandatory ratification by parliament. In that respect the draft law is a logical follow-up to the presidential edict "On the Procedure for Decisionmaking on the Conclusion of International Treaties" of 8 November 1993. It is well known that thanks to negotiations with its creditor countries, Russia paid only $2 billion in 1992 and $2.2 billion in 1993 instead of the $20 billion due under the initial payment schedule. In 1994, payments toward debt servicing and debt repayment, taking into account those postponed from 1993, are expected to reach $32 billion or an estimated 70 percent of overall exports forecast for 1994 by committee specialists and IMF experts -- of course, unless Russian negotiators manage to reach an agreement with Western creditors on debt rescheduling, restructuring, or canceling a part of the debt altogether. At the same time, according to the draft's authors, "International experience has shown that countries exceeding the debt-servicing rate of 25 percent tend to be unable to cope with the debt problem on their own, without a partial cancellation of the debt." Given that, the lower chamber's budget committee has proposed that the parliament ratify not only agreements on attracting or granting credits that exceed the upper limit it would set annually, but also where the amount of money to be attracted or granted exceeds $100 million. The subcommittee has also proposed that the limit of foreign borrowing for 1994 be reduced to $4.7 billion, whereas the Finance Ministry, drawing on its calculations, has suggested that it be raised to $5.7 billion. It is expected that the draft law will be considered by the State Duma at one of its first meetings after it moves to its new building.
