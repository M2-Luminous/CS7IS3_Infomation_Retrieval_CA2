Commenting on the intraparty discussion at an 5 April news conference, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, stressed: "We intend to cautiously study what our party can do after grasping the situation a little more clearly." SDPJ Vice Chairman Inoue recently met with a high-ranking North Korean official in Beijing. It is said that during the meeting, Inoue got the impression the North Korean official showed a forward-looking attitude toward a visit by the delegation. However, the remark made by Chairman Murayama at the news conference indicated his cautious attitude toward sending the delegation to North Korea. During the news conference, Chairman Murayama also stated: "If there is a role to be played by the SDPJ in easing tensions in Asia, the SDPJ is willing to play that role aggressively."
