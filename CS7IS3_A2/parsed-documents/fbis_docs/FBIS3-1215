Mr Coetsee said: "In view of the unrest and prevailing conditions in Ciskei it has been decided to place SADF troops on the basis of readiness at the Ciskei. "These troops could be deployed swiftly and on short notice inside the Ciskei to calm the situation," Mr Coetsee said. Defence Ministry spokesman Das Herbst stressed that the troops would only be placed along the border and would not be deployed inside the homeland. The move follows requests from former Ciskei military leader Brig Oupa Gqozo that the South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council take over the administration of Ciskei. Brig Gqozo formally stepped down on Tuesday.
