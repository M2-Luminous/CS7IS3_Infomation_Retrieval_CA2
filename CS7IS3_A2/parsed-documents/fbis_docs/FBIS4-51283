The full text is as follows: On May 26, President Bill Clinton of the United States announced his decision to extend China's MFN status for 1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN review from human rights issue. This decision will create favorable conditions for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic cooperation between the two sides and the improvement and growth of the overall relations between the two countries. It therefore serves the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples. The Chinese Government and people welcome this decision of President Clinton. The MFN treatment that China and the United States grant to each other in accordance with the agreement on trade relations between the two governments is purely a reciprocal and mutually-beneficial arrangement that serves the interests of both sides. It constitutes the basis for normal trade between them. We have consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade issues or attaching conditions and requirements. What the U.S. side did in the past few years on the MFN issue has impaired the bilateral trade and economic exchanges and the overall relations between the two countries, to the strong dissatisfaction of the two peoples. We have to point out with regret that while announcing the renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side stated that the existing sanctions against China would be maintained. It should be pointed out in particular that the U.S. side has made unwarranted charges about human rights situation in China. This constitutes an interference in China's internal affairs, which is totally unacceptable to us. We hope that the U.S. Government, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples, will immediately remove all sanctions against China and abandon all measures detrimental to the development of bilateral relations. China and the United States share broad interests. The current situation offers a historical opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government attaches importance to these relations and has made and will continue to make major efforts for their improvement and growth. We hope that the U.S. Government, on its part, will take a realistic and forward-looking stand in the overall interests of Sino-American relations and take concrete action to show its sincerity for enhancing relations between the two countries. We are convinced that so long as both sides strictly abide by the guidelines and principles set forth in the three Sino-American joint communiques, enhance mutual trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperation and refrain from confrontation, Sino-American relations will enjoy smooth and healthy progress.
