Addressing the constituent conference of the party's Moscow organization on Saturday, Gaydar expressed his opinion saying that "the organizational weakness and crumbliness of the democratic movement represent a serious threat for Russia's future." The new party of a parliamentarian type which is being created on the initiative of the Russia's Choice faction is intended "to unite those who share the valuables of the market, democracy, and private ownership." As Gaydar said, the implementation of the party's program "will assist in stabilization of the situation in the country and its growth." In Gaydar's opinion, Russia is experiencing "an inevitable wave of reaction with respect to the deep transformations underway in the country now" but "not the beginning of an irreversible turn backwards." He believes that "this wave will go away" because "the communists and their allies, the radical nationalists, have no notion what to offer to the society" but the "unpopular program" which "was already implemented in Russia some time ago."
