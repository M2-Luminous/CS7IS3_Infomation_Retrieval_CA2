FR941007-2-00017 FR941007-2-00006 Lansheng Petitioners contend that the record in this investigation reflects no de facto evidence of Lansheng's independence from government control. The fact that the SAMB holds 74.5 percent of the shares in Lansheng allows the SAMB to have absolute control over the selection of the company board of directors and the appointment of the company's general managers and chairman of the board. Because the SAMB, a governmental agency, has control over the company's operations, petitioners argue, Lansheng should not be considered for a separate rate. Respondents argue that the record shows the role of the SAMB in the operation of Lansheng to be extremely limited. The shares held by the SAMB are ``entrusted'' to the management of the company and, therefore, the SAMB's role is similar to that of an ``inactive investor'', or title holder. Respondents point to the fact that Lansheng will be free to sell all of its shares to the public within three years as an indication of the limited role of the SAMB during Lansheng's transition from a state-owned company to a share company. Respondents state that the functions of the board of directors and general manager are not governed by the SAMB but are defined in the company's articles of association. Respondents contend that petitioners fail to recognize that the Department considers evidence relating to all aspects of de facto control and does not necessarily preclude a respondent from a separate rate based on information dealing with one aspect of governmental control. According to respondents, evidence regarding other factors of de facto control further demonstrates that Lansheng's operations are not subject to governmental control by the SAMB or any other governmental entity. Therefore, respondents argue, Lansheng should be given a separate rate. DOC Position We agree with respondents, as explained above in the ``Separate Rates'' section, that each exporter should receive a separate rate. Comment 2: Universe of Manufacturers/Sellers Petitioners argue that only a fraction of the manufacturers and sellers of paper clips in the PRC during the POI participated in the investigation, and cite several firms which were listed in the petition and submissions by respondents that did not respond to the questionnaire. Two of these firms are reported as being located in Zhejiang Province, where ZLIP and ZMEC are located. Petitioners cite several cases stating that all PRC firms owned by the same governmental authority, and which produced or sold the subject merchandise during the POI, must cooperate in the investigation in order for respondent firms to receive a separate rate from the Department (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China (HSLW) (58 FR 48833, September 20, 1993)). Because certain firms mentioned in previous submissions did not participate in the investigation, petitioners assert that it is impossible for the Department to determine that the respondent firms seeking a separate rate are actually independent and not related to any other, unidentified or non-participating PRC company involved in the production and sale of the subject merchandise to the United States. ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng argue that the Department should not preclude them from receiving their own company-specific separate rate simply because other potentially state-owned paper clip manufactures and exporters did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. Respondents cite Silicon Carbide, wherein ``state-ownership'' is not considered to be indicative of common control by a single entity. Respondents assert that any state-owned company is entitled to a separate rate if it can prove absence of de facto and de jure control by a government entity. Firms which refuse to participate or which do not satisfy the above-mentioned separate rates test are assumed to be under central government control and are assigned a country-wide ``all-others'' rate. Respondents assert that AMEC, ALIP and Lansheng have established that there is an absence of de facto and de jure control by the central government and, therefore, that they qualify for company-specific separate rates, even though other state-owned firms in the PRC did not participate in the investigation.
