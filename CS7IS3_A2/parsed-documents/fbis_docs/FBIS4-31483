On 4 May 1994, the Bucharest Municipality Tribunal approved the application for registration of the RCP headquartered in Targu-Jiu. RCP founder Victor Hancu had said then that his party was not a follower of the former RCP. After a half-hour deliberation, the Supreme Court ruled the decision: "To grant the contestations and the intervention requests, to annul the Bucharest Municipality Tribunal's decision of 4 May 1994, and to reject the application for registration of the Romanian Communist Party." During the trial, the challengers' defendants have invoked law 51/1991 regarding Romania's national security, Article 3, Paragraph H, which stipulates: "The initiation, organization, carrying out, and support in whatever manner of totalitarian and extremist actions of communist, fascist, or iron-guardist expression is banned." In his defense and in defending the party he initiated, Victor Hancu said: "We are not the followers of the RCP and most of our members had not been enrolled in the former Communist Party. We have no former activists in our structures."
