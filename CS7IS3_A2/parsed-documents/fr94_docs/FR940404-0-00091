FR940404-0-00091 FR940404-0-00023 To further address the commenters' concerns, the Bureau has added a provision to its final rule, excluding from the inmate's IFRP calculation a set amount of monies deposited into the inmate's trust fund account. See 28 CFR 545.11(b) and further discussion below in the section entitled ``4. Conditioning Use of the Its Upon Participation in the IFRP.'' This helps ensure that the inmate is able to make telephone calls with monies sent to the inmate from members of the community for telephone calls. If the inmate elects not to use these funds to call the sender of the money, the sender has the option of not forwarding additional monies. e. Some commenters believe that the actual administration of the ITS may be more expensive because additional staff will be needed to operate the system. Implementation of the ITS at most institutions does require additional employees who are responsible for the operation of the ITS. However, the Bureau believes that the costs for additional staff are well justified by the significant benefits of the ITS, described above in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS.'' f. Comments stated that a ``dual system'' would not be difficult or costly to install and maintain; e.g., that ``the systems already installed at institutions could be reprogrammed very easily *␣*␣* with little or no modification of existing equipment.'' The Bureau disagrees with this position. The contract for the ITS was awarded for a primarily direct-dial system. The contractor estimates that it would cost several million dollars to modify the system to provide collect call on demand capability. g. Finally, there are security reasons for rejecting the commenters' suggestion that the final regulations be amended to permit inmates to make collect calls on demand. As noted above in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,'' inmates are able to use the unlimited collect call system to engage in various forms of harassment and criminal activity. Providing a ``dual system'' that would permit inmates to call anyone collect would do nothing to resolve these problems. For example, an inmate could still bill a call to a party who has no intention of paying. An inmate also could more easily monopolize the telephone, due to the absence of financial constraints on that inmate, and resulting tensions could jeopardize the safety and security of the institution. It might be possible to curb some of this abuse by limiting inmate collect calls to numbers on an approved telephone list and requiring those inmates to use Personal Access Codes (PACs) similar to those required by these amended regulations for making direct-dialed ITS calls. However, again, this would not prevent inmates from billing calls to a party who has no intention of paying. In addition, inmates would have less of an incentive to keep secret their PACs, as required in 28 CFR 540.101(c). The PACs could be used to place collect calls, for which the inmates bear no financial responsibility, rather than direct-dialed calls, for which the inmates are financially responsible. This would undermine many of the security features of the ITS because it would be more difficult for the Bureau to monitor and restrict illegal or abusive inmate telephone calls if the Bureau did not know which inmate was using which PAC. Similarly, an inmate could circumvent some of the telephone list restrictions by using other inmates' PACs to call numbers that he or she was not permitted to call. In concluding a response on this issue, the Bureau believes that restricting collect calls on demand furthers important penological and security goals. At the same time, the final rule adequately addresses the needs of inmates to make collect calls in appropriate circumstances. For these reasons, the Bureau has decided not to implement a ``dual system'' with collect call on demand capability. 3. Constitutional Concerns Some commenters suggested that operation of the ITS is a violation of the constitutional rights of inmates and others, as follows: a. First Amendment rights to free speech. Several commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate their First Amendment rights to free speech without providing any detail as to the alleged violations. Our review of the comments on this issue suggests that at least some of the the arguments are based on inaccurate or unrealistic expectations. The Bureau, by implementing the ITS, does not intend to, nor does it, unconstitutionally restrict an inmate's opportunity for freedom of speech. Bureau regulations provide for several means of communication, including correspondence, visiting and telephones. See 28 CFR part 540, subparts B and D. The revised rule is not intended to, nor does it, prevent an inmate from exercising his or her right to communicate. One inmate commenter said that he would have personally called in his comments on the proposed rule but that ``the number was not approved.'' The Bureau points out that this commenter would not have been able to call in his comments under the former collect call system either, as the Bureau does not accept collect calls and the appropriate method for commenting on proposed regulations is to send written comments to the Bureau. One commenter, an association of newspaper editors and reporters, asserted that the ITS hinders the rights of the press and the public to gain access to important information about prison inmates and prison conditions. Primary concerns expressed by the commenter were that the revised telephone regulations would hamper the ability of inmates to communicate with the press and that the regulations potentially threaten the relationship between journalists and their sources; that restrictions on collect calls and the use of an authorized telephone list establish procedural hurdles placing significant new burdens on the inmate's ability to reach the community; that the ITS does not allow for timely telephone access to the media; that the disclosure by a journalist of the information required by the Request for Telephone Privilege form was inappropriate. The commenter noted that journalists do not have to provide this information in order to receive Special Mail from inmates. The commenter further indicated that while Bureau regulations may implicate substantial government interests, the regulatory sweep is too broad.
