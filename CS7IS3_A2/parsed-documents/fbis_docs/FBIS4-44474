The Urban-Rural Income-Distribution Gap Rural residents and city dwellers are two major interest groups with different features in Chinese society. As these two groups have completely different distribution mechanisms, as well as quite differing distribution orders, clarifying our urban-rural income-gap status quo and analyzing the factors producing the gap, is of key significance in understanding China's overall income distribution. When our traditional system had just begun to be perfected in 1957, the average income of China's city dwellers was 3.48 times that of rural residents, which figure had basically stabilized by pre-cultural revolution 1964 at about 2.38 times, where it stayed until 1979. But as reform and opening up occurred first in the rural areas, steadily raising agricultural labor productivity, our urban-rural income-distribution gap has shrunk yearly since 1979. By the mid-1980s, our urban-rural income-distribution gap has dropped below 1.9. And while it rose only slightly afterwards, it had clearly increased to 2.31 by 1989 and 2.42 by 1990, surpassing even that of 1978. The clear growth of this urban-rural gap has aroused widespread public concern. The phased change in this urban-rural income gap was the inevitable outcome of the phased advance of reform and opening and the phased adjustment of our economic policy. Of the factors causing the change in our urban-rural income-distribution order, prices were one of the most direct ones. In 1979, when the state raised the procurement prices for 18 categories of farm and sideline products, the composite comparative price index for industrial and agricultural commodities dropped to 82 percent. Peasant income went up 19.4 percent from 1978. In the following years, prices were deregulated yearly, with the excess-purchase markup percentage rising steadily. From 1979 through 1981, the percentages of the price factor in overall peasant income growth were respectively 4.1 percent, 18.1 percent, and 18.8 percent. By 1989, the composite comparative price index for industrial and agricultural commodities had shot up from 1988's 93.7 percent to 103.2 percent, reaching 107.4 percent by 1990, with the urban-rural income-distribution gap growing respectively to 2.31 and 2.42. In addition, the responsibility system of linking remuneration to output in the rural areas that was first tested in 1979 and then gradually expanded and fully implemented from 1982 to 1984, along with the basic change in the rural organizational structure, sharply aroused peasant production initiative. During that time, peasant households had land-use rights, acquiring independent property rights, directive planning and administrative control of production was abolished in rural areas, a commodity economy steadily developed, markets gradually formed, and the enormous energies released by system reform combined with the state's 3-decade post-liberation investment in agricultural, fixed assets and infrastructures to sharply raise agricultural labor productivity. Our agricultural growth rates from 1981 through 1984 were respectively 5.8 percent, 11.3 percent, 7.8 percent, and 12.3 percent, approaching and exceeding our GNP growth rates. During this period, our urban economic-system reform had just begun, with distribution-system changes reflected only in areas, such as the raising of wages step by step and the restoration of the bonus system, while all manufactured goods and service prices remained mostly under directive-plan control. So in this phase, our urban-rural income gap dropped to a historic low. But the "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Economic-System Reform" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee showed that our reform priority had shifted from the rural areas to cities. After this, urban economic reform advanced quickly, with enterprises acquiring increasing independent operating authority and planned management steadily shrinking in scope. The dual-track pricing system, with bonus maximums no longer set, and the various forms of the responsibility system practiced after 1988, clearly slanted our profit-distribution order toward the cities, with the urban-rural income gap growing again to its 1987 level of 2.19. It needs to be pointed out that while the comparative profits of [agricultural] cultivation began to drop in this stage, the large shift of the rural surplus workforce to nonfarm industry, with the rapid rise of all types of village and township run enterprises, clearly raised the percentage of non-farm income in peasant net income to a certain extent keeping the urban-rural income gap at a fairly reasonable level. But the 1989 improvement and rectification sharply cut back the growth of township and village enterprises, slowing the growth rate of rural nonfarm industry. Over 30 million peasants who had left the soil but not the countryside lost their jobs in nonfarm industry, returning to traditional agriculture, which had worsened by 1990. In peasant per capita net income, the percentage of nonfarm income dropped to 26.53 percent. Still in the period of improvement and rectification, due to the basic difference in urban and rural distribution mechanisms, while the 1990 nonfarm industry growth rates were 5.5 percent for industry, 3 percent for communications and transportation, -6.9 percent for commerce, and zero growth for construction, the agricultural growth rate was a high 7.5 percent. But the peasant net income growth rate was only 4.7 percent, with the nonfarm employee wage growth rate reaching a high 12.7 percent, and the urban and rural household average cost of living income up 10 percent. The above analysis involves only the overt urban-rural income gap and its causes. But a covert urban-rural income gap was also very evident. First, urban housing was generally assigned by the [work] unit and the state, at very low rents; health care costs were also borne by the state and collectives, with everyone receiving pensions after retirement. After 1984, city-dweller subsidies clearly increased. A sampling and projection by a CASS Economic Institute income-distribution taskforce shows that if all types of subsidies are included, our 1988 urban-rural income gap was 2.36, higher than the 2.91 result obtained from overt-income calculations. In short, China's urban-rural income gap is one of the most glaring yet easily overlooked problems in the field of distribution. This gap was formed by both system factors and policy impacts. But while acknowledging our urban-rural distribution gap, we also need to note that since reform and opening, our overall urban-rural distribution trend has been toward improvement and rationalization. From 1952 to 1978, our rural income growth rate was 1.95 percent, while our urban income growth rate was 3.15 percent, meaning that urban incomes grew faster than rural ones. But from 1978 to 1990, rural incomes averaged growth of 6.37 percent, while urban incomes averaged growth of only 5.08 percent, meaning that rural incomes grew faster than urban ones. So as to accumulated effect and overall trend, reform and opening have still improved our urban-rural income distribution. As to the phased results, whenever reform and opening were proceeding more smoothly, our urban-rural income-distribution gap was more rational, and vice versa. This shows that it is only by persisting in reform and opening that we can perfect our socialist distribution system, to speed up the growth of our productive forces. III. The Regional Income-Distribution Gap As China is vast in territory, with sharp differences in natural and geographic conditions, and very uneven economic development, our income-distribution gap among provinces is quite obvious. In our initial reform and opening period in 1980, net peasant income throughout China averaged 204.89 yuan, with 10 provinces and municipalities having incomes higher than the average, and the highest incomes being in Shanghai, where they averaged 397.35 yuan a year. There were 18 provinces and municipalities with incomes lower then the average, with the lowest incomes being in Shaanxi, where net income averaged 142.49 yuan a year. Shanghai incomes were 2.78 times those of Shaanxi, with the high-income group of provinces and municipalities concentrated in the agriculturally-developed three eastern provinces, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the three municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai). The income-distribution inequality index W (Elteto-Frigyes) was 42.96 percent for all provinces, with the inequality index U for the provinces and municipalities below the average income being 23.19 percent, and the inequality index V for the provinces and municipalities above the average income at 25.73 percent. Beginning in 1980, the degree of income-distribution inequality among provinces rose steadily. By 1990, the highest incomes were in Shanghai Municipality, where net incomes averaged 1,664.35 yuan a year, while the lowest ones were in Gansu Province, where net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, making Shanghai incomes 4.7 times that of Gansu's. By 1990, the W index had risen to 46.74 percent, about 4 points higher than in 1980, while the U and V indexes had climbed respectively to 26.32 percent and 32.72 percent, both more than 10 points higher than in 1980. During this decade, the larger regional income-gap was characterized mainly by a larger gap between income from the collective economy and other nonproduction income, with the W indexes for these two categories of income respectively at 93 percent and 60.54 percent, far larger than the inequality index for peasant net income. The household-operation income index W was 27.92 percent, lower than the overall gap: this included the V index for provinces and municipalities above the average income at only 9.6 percent, and the U index for those below the average which was at 20.2 percent. It is thus obvious that the gap between developed and undeveloped provinces in household-operation income where the key source is traditional cultivation income, was certainly not the major source of the peasant income gap. In contrast to the peasant income gap, urban-household income inequality among provinces was much less. In 1990, the inequality index W was 30 percent for the lowest income group among provinces, and 28 percent for the highest income group, but only about 25 percent for the middle-income group. It is thus obvious that the urban income gap was most glaring among the lowest and highest income levels. In the provinces and municipalities with incomes above the average, inequality was lowest for the middle-income group, with the V index at only 10.7 percent, while in the provinces and municipalities with incomes below the average, inequality was lower for the high-income group, with the inequality index U at about 12 percent. So urban income-distribution equalitarianism remains quite evident. In urban household income, the gap among average employee wages in all provinces and municipalties was also not too large. In 1981, annual employee incomes were highest in Tibet and Qinghai, and lowest in Jiangsu, with the national employee-wage inequality index W at 16.37. There were 17 provinces and municipalities below the average, with the U index at 7.49 percent, and 12 above the average, with the V index at 9.6 percent and except for the three municipalities, most of the rest being minority nationality and border regions. The major source of the wage difference was the regional difference between the highland and border regions. From 1981 to 1986, the inequality indexes climbed yearly, reaching their maximums by 1986, when the U, V and W indexes were respectively 14.06 percent, 21.08 percent, and 32.19 percent higher than in 1981 by 7, 12, and 16 points, respectively. But after 1986, the employee-wage inequality index fell yearly, with the U, V and W indexes by 1990 down respectively to 10.65 percent, 16.71 percent, and 25.51 percent. In 1990, average yearly wages were 3,178 yuan for the highest-income Tibet, and 1,729 yuan for the lowest-income Jiangxi. Generally, average wages were relatively higher for economically more developed regions and mostly lower for undeveloped ones, except for border regions. Among all provinces and municipalities, distribution inequality was greater for those with wages above the national average than for those with incomes below the national average. That the employee-wage income gap first grew and then shrank was closely related to wage-reform progress in the 1980s. Before 1985, wage reform was basically a resumption of certain effective pre-cultural revolution bonus systems, with adoption of methods, such as additional wages for all employees in batches. But the 1985 enterprise and institutional wage reform actually reinforced the equalitarian-distribution method. The causes of the income-distribution gap among provinces were as follows: The production-factor structure. In eastern China, education had long been more advanced, with the percentages of illiteracy and semiliteracy among those over 15 years of age lower than the national average, while in western China, these percentages were higher than the national average. The percentage of those older than 6 with higher than junior high school educations was higher in the east than in the west. This literacy discrepancy directly affected workforce quality, even more so in its market-economy concepts. Generally, most poorly-educated workers had information problems and no way to get rich, being unable to quickly master new technology and diversified economic means, they were only able to engage in traditional, inefficient work. But regions and groups where educational quality was higher were able to adapt to market-economy laws. Based on their own advantages, while engaging in traditional agriculture, they shifted surplus labor and surplus worktime to nonfarm industry, with urban employees taking up second occupations and other ways to get rich. As the impact of this education gap on income distribution was potential and longstanding, it was very hard to change quickly in a short period of time. As to natural and geographic conditions, the east was far more advantaged than the west. Superior natural and geographic conditions contributed to agricultural development, thus supporting light industry growth, to bring along the economic development of the whole region. In addition, eastern China had far superior transportation facilities, information channels and investment climates than western and central China, enabling it to attract an inflow of talent, money, and technology from other parts of China and abroad. Starting in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the state increased its investment in the eastern coastal zone, pushing this region's percentage of national investment to 50.6 percent, far exceeding its 1953-1980 level of 40.6 percent. During the whole 1980s, state investment in the eastern zone and this region's own investment growth rate both far exceeded that for western and central China, enabling the eastern region to combine its human capital, funding, and geographic advantages to quickly raise its production level, promoting its economic takeoff, and speeding up its economic growth rate. The economic-development gap was the main cause of the income-distribution gap among eastern, central, and western China, as well as that between the coastal and interior zones. The most obvious feature of the regional income-distribution gap as shown in development level was the makeup of the rural industrial structure. As China has such a large population, whether rural surplus labor can shift from traditional agriculture to nonfarm industry, and the rate and scale of this shift, largely determine a region's economic development and income levels. Eastern China's ratio of GVAO to GNP is only about 37 percent, while central and western China's are respectively 55 percent and approximately 65 percent. Conversely, eastern China's ratio of rural GVIO to GNP is about 50 percent, far exceeding the output value of traditional agriculture, while central and western China's are respectively only 29.3 percent and 22.3 percent. In 1989, in Jiangsu with a higher level of rural industrial development, the ratio of traditional-agricultural gross output value to GVAO was only 27.9 percent, which figure for Guizhou was 75.45 percent. This huge difference in rural industrial structure obviously affects the regional income-distribution makeup. In the regional distribution gap, in addition to the impact of the productive-forces gap, state macroeconomic policy was also a very important factor. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the state has adopted an uneven-development regional policy, employing a laddered development strategy of SEZs--open coastal cities--coastal EDZs--open cities along the Chang Jiang and open border zones--interior, to drive overall economic development. The coastal zones that were opened first enjoyed more autonomy and more preferential policies than the interior areas, such as investment-project examination and approval, foreign-investment attraction, foreign trade, foreign-exchange retention, loan scale, and tax burden. These policy preferences on one hand attracted a steady inflow of overseas advanced equipment, technology, and funding and domestic outstanding talent and economic resources, enabling these zones to steadily upgrade their industrial structures and quickly develop their manufacturing industries. On the other hand, they enabled these zones to use a slanted price structure of lower prices for domestic primary products, resource products, raw materials, and energy and higher ones for finished goods, to benefit in the exchange of products with the interior, enhancing their accumulated might, and forming market and profit structures more favorable to the eastern region. The eastern region's faster investment and steady expansion of domestic and foreign markets clearly raised its employment rate, changing its workforce's job structure, and raising its overall income level. As to the distribution-policy effect, the zones that were opened first with a faster reform pace were the first to break free from the iron-ricebowl and big-pottist (all eating out of one big pot) distribution system, to establish efficiency-oriented incentive forces, in which incomes were closely linked to work done and efficiency produced. While raising overall incomes, they also widened income grades, stimulating the initiative of their whole workforce. In short, China's regional income gap was caused by the development gap and macroeconomic policy differences. IV. The Income-Distribution Gap by Ownership System and Industry Since 1978, China has encouraged the suitable development of its non-state economy, bringing marked change to the purely state-owned economic structure under the traditional system. In urban employment, employment figures for the collective and other non-state economies climbed respectively from 1978's 21.52 percent and 0.16 percent to 23.54 percent and 5.67 percent by 1990. In GVIO, collective-enterprise output value rose to 35 percent, with output value for nonstate economic components, such as individual, private, and "the three kinds of foreign trade" enterprises, up from 0.7 percent to 10 percent. By the end of 1991, the number of household operations throughout China had grown to 14.168 million, employing 22.58 million, with registered capital of 48.82 billion yuan; there were 108,000 private enterprises, employing 1.839 million, with registered capital of 12.32 billion yuan. So while generally speaking, the public economy remains China's dominant one, an order of the coexistence and development of the diversified economy has essentially evolved. This change in the ownership order has resulted in a changed income-distribution structure. We will now describe our income-distribution status quo and features by ownership system and industry. China's income distribution by ownership system is characterized as follows: 1. Average incomes are higher for employees in state enterprises than in collective ones. The general scope of this is over 23 percent, with the difference being fairly stable at 31 percent at its highest in 1979, and at 23 percent at its lowest in 1983, 1984, and 1987. The difference in the average annual wage growth rates for employees under state and collective ownership is almost nil. 2. Average wages are higher for employees in nonstate enterprises than in state enterprises. At their highest point in 1990, average wages for employees in nonstate enterprises were respectively 2.232 and 1.77 times those in collective and state enterprises, with the absolute value being over 1,700 yuan more. And the employee-wage growth rate is also 14.2 percent higher for nonstate than state enterprises. 3. The employee income gap between state and collective enterprises widens during times of economic retrenchment, shrinking during periods of economic expansion. From 1983 to 1985, our economy grew very quickly, with the wage gap between employees in state and collective enterprises dropping to about 23 percent; in 1986 when our economic growth rate fell, this gap rose to 27 percent. In 1987 and 1988 our economic growth rate accelerated, shrinking the gap to 23 percent. But in 1989, with economic recession and soft markets, the gap grew again to 32.8 percent. The income-distribution gap among various Chinese industries was smaller. As to the national average, the wage-growth rate from 1978 to 1990 basically did not differ much, with that of the fastest-growing industries, such as culture, education, and public health, only 1.7 points higher than that of the slowest-growing ones, such as commerce and catering services. The wage-gap inequality index among industries remained at about 10 percent for most years, as well as showing no yearly growth momentum. Comparing the initial reform and opening period to the most recent years, the U index among the lower-income sectors also did not grow. And while the V index among the higher-income sectors grew somewhat after 1985, its growth was not serious. The income-distribution gap among sectors by ownership system was larger for state than collective ownership, and larger for other forms of ownership than for state ownership, which completely tallies with the mass of calculation results. Within state-owned industries, the inequality indexes were lowest for 1982 and 1983 at respectively 7.53 percent and 8.01 percent, and highest for 1979 and 1989 at respectively 9.58 percent and 9.33 percent. The U index among the lower-income sectors was clearly lower than the V index among the higher-income sectors, showing that the income gap was smaller for the low-income sector than for the high-income one. The overall-model W index rose more obviously in 1989 and 1990. Within collectively owned industries, the inequality indexes for 1979 to 1983 were higher than for the years afer 1983. This shows that the distribution-equalitarianism tendency among collective industries was more serious after 1983. In addition, for collective ownership, the U index within low-income industries was higher than the V index within high-income ones, showing that the inequality was greater within low-income industries than high-income ones. This was precisely the opposite of the case for state industry. Among industries of other forms of ownership, the income-distribution inequality indexes U, V, and W were all higher than for state and collective ownership. Their variation coefficient VC was highest in 1985 at 31 percent and lowest in 1989 at 17 percent. It needs to be pointed out that for the distribution gap among industries as used here, since industrial concentration was greater, the results derived from calculations of average level might differ from those by particular industry. But due to data-validity problems, we were unable in this article to make a more detailed division or more thorough exploration. The abovementioned income-distribution features among various Chinese ownership systems had profound system settings. 1) Enterprises of varying forms of ownership had differing capital sources. The investment sources of state enterprises had long been direct appropriations from state revenue. Even once the investment system was reformed, by 1990, state-budgeted investment still made up 13.2 percent of state-enterprise fixed assets, with self-raised investment at 42.5 percent, while collective enterprises received only 0.42 percent of their funds from the national budget, with self-raised investment at 47.66 percent, making self-financed investment 5 points higher for collective than state enterprises. For enterprises of the same size, tax rates were the same for ones of varying forms of ownership (with the exception of "the three kinds of foreign trade" enterprises), with the state not obtaining asset taxes or rents from its invested capital. This investment-source difference, as to both earned-profit capability and profit distribution, caused differences between state and collective enterprises. 2) As to industrial makeup, collective enterprises were concentrated mostly in lines, such as light industry, commerce, and catering services, while state enterprises were mainly distributed in the field of heavy industry. As China had always focused its energies on establishing a complete industrial system from the early days of the founding of the PRC to the late 1970s, emphasizing heavy-industrial development, when the state set wage policy, it had always set wages higher for heavy than light industry, to reflect its industrial difference. This difference has always followed along, being a system factor causing the wage discrepancy between state and collective enterprises. 3) As to employee quality and makeup, average literacy levels were higher for employees in state than collective enterprises, with state enterprises having about 33 percent more employees with more than high school educations. But collective enterprises had 20 percent more women employees than state enterprises. These differences in employee quality were bound to cause a discrepancy in wage levels. 4) State enterprises were generally larger than collective ones. In 1990 for instance, the average unit in state industrial enterprises had 418 employees, while urban collective industrial enterprises averaged only 115 employees, with the enterprise size-effect generally creating a distribution discrepancy. 5) During periods of national economic fluctuation, state enterprises received much more government protection than collective ones, with employee wage and bonus rigidity higher than collective ones. So while economic growth rates declined, employee incomes certainly did not drop correspondingly. In contrast, collective enterprises largely had to pay the price of retrenchment, with their employee incomes generally falling along with economic growth rates. During times of economic expansion, these two sectors were restrained by state macroeconomic control about the same. These were factors in the different degrees of impact on their wage levels by economic fluctuations. [passage omitted] V. The Income-Distribution Gap Among Chinese Residents China's rural household income-distribution order underwent a great change after rural economic reform. As rural farm-worker productivity increased, a large group of surplus rural workers shifted out of traditional agriculture, speeding up the mobility and reorganization of the rural productive forces, resulting in the evolution and upgrading of the rural industrial structure. These changes in the level of productive forces and industrial structure, while raising rural income levels, also widened the income gaps among various regions and households. By 1989 and 1990, the rural income base coefficient had reached 31 percent, 10 points higher than in 1978. As to all provinces, by 1990, in more economically-developed Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong and minority nationality-concentrated Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia, the base coefficient was higher at 30-34 percent. In the three municipalities and central China's Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the base coefficient was lower at 20-25 percent, being lowest in Jiangxi at 20 percent. As to the three main regions of east, central and west, the peasant income gap was higher in eastern China, with the base coefficient at 32 percent; with the gap smaller in central China at 27 percent, and at 28 percent in western China. The wider rural income gap after reform and opening had many causes. 1. The various contract responsibility systems practiced in the rural areas thoroughly broke free from the pre-reform collective economy's "big pottism," from a system perspective creating the climate and terms for better income distribution and making it possible for peasants to get wealthy through autonomous hard work. 2. The varying amount of production essentials possessed by peasant households was also a key factor in the distribution gap. While rural land was distributed by headcount, as to families of the same size, differences in the numbers of family members who were workers caused differences in the gains derived from the same amounts of land. Statistics show that in a family of five, every additional worker raised overall household income by 357 yuan. This was because peasant households with more workers could not only invest more labor in the same amount of land, choosing more cash crops that required more labor, but also could invest surplus labor and time in household sidelines, construction, transportation, commerce, and township industries, thus raising overall family income. In addition to the income disparity caused by varying numbers of workers, worker quality also had an obvious impact on income distribution. Putting peasant family-member education levels in eight grades, from illiterate and semiliterate to college graduate, each one-grade raise in peasant family-member average education-grade increased peasant household overall income by 34.97 yuan. Peasant household-worker quantity and quality is reflected not only in agricultural production, but also in choice of household sidelines, diversified operations, and nonfarm industry capabilities. Data shows that for every 100 workers with educations above junior high school, 40 are in purely peasant households, while 58, or 45 percent more, work in nonfarm industry. This distribution impact due to worker quality was hard to reflect under the distribution system before reform and opening. In addition, as to production essentials, the size of household assets such as large farm machinery and equipment, the fixed assets needed for nonfarm industry and the working capital needed for the production process, similarly had an obvious impact on overall peasant-household income. Data shows that based on overall peasant-household income, productive assets have a returns rate of 9 percent a year. 3. Peasant-household geographic and natural conditions also have a significant impact on peasant income. Peasant households in more economically-developed regions have higher incomes. In 1990, in the three municipalities of Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, peasant incomes averaged respectively 1,664.65 yuan, 1,261.11 yuan, and 1,069.04 yuan; 1985 to 1990 income growth rates averaged respectively 15.61 percent, 10.22 percent, and 13.62 percent, all higher than the national average of 9.63 percent. But in provinces and autonomous regions, such as Gansu, Guizhou, and Tibet, due to poorer natural and geographic conditions, 1990 net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, 435.14 yuan, and 437.71 yuan, respectively, only about one-quarter that of the average Shanghai peasant income; net income annual growth rates were respectively 9.35 percent, 8.61 percent, and 4.35 percent, all below the national average. This shows that the peasants living in these places have not only current net incomes lower than other regions, but also an income gap that is still continuing to widen. 4. The peasant-household income gap is also reflected in household production structure and operating orientation. By 1990, the percentage of purely peasant households had dropped to 25 percent, with that of those engaged mainly in agriculture but concurrently working in nonfarm industry at 65 percent, and those working mainly in nonfarm industry while continuing to do some farming at 10 percent. This evolution of the rural industrial structure has changed the workforce disposition, changing peasant-household income sources, and causing an income gap among peasant families. In contrast to the rural income-distribution situation, urban income-distribution inequality is much less. From 1985 to 1990, the urban income-distribution base coefficient was 20-22 percent. Using the information-theory concept of entropy, and Theil Henri's proposed dual methodology, the calculated urban income-distribution T and L coefficients were respectively 13-14 percent and 11-12 percent. In other words, when the overall low-income group is larger, China's overall urban income-distribution level is lower than the base coefficient at equal-value calculation. Of the calculations for 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1990, the base coefficient was higher than the national average for 17 and lower for seven. The base coefficient was highest for Xinjiang at 33.6 percent, with Guangdong and Qinghai next at respectively 25 percent and 25.7 percent, and lowest for Liaoning at only 18 percent, with Tianjin and Hebei respectively at 19.8 percent and 19.6 percent. The T-index calculations resulted similarly in Xinjiang being the highest at 22.9 percent, and higher for provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai, Hainan, and Fujian, with the trend being similar to the results calculated according to the base coefficient. The similar results achieved from calculations according to these four different methodologies show that China's overall urban income distribution is still quite equal. Moreover, as to the time order from 1985 to the present, there has not been any significant expansion trend. The causes of our relative urban-income equality are our urban-employee wage and subsidy systems and our urban population's employment system. The urban wage system that had been practiced ever since the founding of the PRC was characterized by equalitarianism right from the start. This had reached an extremely severe degree during the cultural revolution. But after reform and opening, in 1985, we conducted a one-time national reform of our wage system. This reform, widely instituted enterprises for the linking of payrolls to economic efficiency, while devolving state wage-management jurisdiction to lower administrative levels, leaving the state to control only the total payroll. In institutions, we changed the graded wage system to a structural one of mostly wages by job. Our main aspirations in this wage reform were to break free from equalitarianism, to reflect a spirit of rewarding hard work and excellence and penalizing indolence and inferiority. But as enterprise wage reform largely tried to widen the income gap among enterprises, this change quite naturally was resisted by enterprise competition, obviously not achieving its desired result. In the distribution among employees within enterprises, the resistance to breaking with equalitarianism was even greater. In state organs and institutions, the institution of the structural wage system not only did not eliminate distribution equalitarianism, but also naturally affected the household income-distribution situation. After 1985, employee non-wage income grew very quickly. While the ratio of urban-employee non-wage income to gross income was 20.3 percent in 1985, this had climbed to 25.7 percent by 1990. Of the many types of non-wage income, such as bathing, transportation, and labor costs, most were equalitarian distribution without regard for matters, such as age, seniority, rank, or contribution. This made employee overall income-distribution equalitarianism even more serious. In addition, related price reform and the practice of various nonstaple-food subsidies were even more so distributed according to headcount. China's employment system also had an obvious impact in urban household income-equalization. In the cities, as long as a youth reaching working age waited patiently, with no nitpicking about job quality or employment site, a job was just a matter of time. And once employed, minus special conditions, quitting or being fired was generally impossible. The number of employed household members was one of the factors affecting the income gap. And the universal full employment shrank the income gap. Finally, most urban residents had no capital goods or investments, which ensured from another perspective that the income gap would not grow too large. Of course, while the rapid increase in household operations and the rise of stock markets in recent years have shaken urban income-distribution equalization, they have not yet at least had a substantial impact on the overall income-distribution order, or become its decisive factor. Putting urban and rural residents together for a graded ranking, to calculate the income-distribution inequality coefficient, shows that China's national income-distribution inequality is greater than that calculated separately for either rural or urban residents. Moreover, this inequality is growing in extent yearly. This shows that China's income-distribution inequality is due largely to our dual-economy feature. To improve China's income-distribution situation, we will have to on one hand overcome our urban income-equalitarianism tendency, and on the other strive to shrink our urban-rural distribution gap. VI. The Matter of Absolute vs Relative Poverty Absolute vs relative poverty is another angle from which to measure income-distribution inequality. We are here adopting the methodology proposed by Victor R. Fuchs, calling thalf of the population with incomes less than the average the relative-poverty population. In defining rural absolute poverty, we are using the PRC State Council's 1985 definition, that those with average annual net incomes below 200 yuan are in absolute poverty, and those with net incomes averaging less than 150 yuan a year are in extreme poverty. Based on a comparison of the 1985 rural absolute-poverty line and the national average, we have set the urban absolute-poverty line at 375 yuan, using the same method to set that year's urban extreme-poverty line at 282 yuan. When calculating absolute poverty, while we have used the same criteria for all years, we have respectively used the urban-rural retail price indexes to correct the poverty lines for all years. In addition, when calculating the percentage of the population that is in absolute peoverty, we have assumed that the incomes of the lowest-income group conform to consecutive even distribution. Our calculations show that from 1981 through 1990, our percentage of urban absolute-poverty households was in a general declining trend, with the percentage of extreme-poverty ones not so stable, being highest in 1988 at 3.67 percent, and lowest in 1984 at only 0.97 percent. From a macroeconomic-setting analysis, this trend was rational, as 1984 was this decade's year of highest GNP growth at 14.7 percent, while that year's overall urban retail price index was only 2.5 percent, with the urban average annual income-growth rate at a high of 15.23 percent. While 1988 saw a GNP growth rate of 11 percent, with average income growth of 17.8 percent, that year's urban overall retail price index reached a high of 21.3 percent. Under normal conditions, during periods of inflation, low-income losses and gross-income ratios are necessarily much greater than high-income losses and gross income ratios. So it was not strange that 1988 saw a higher percentage of households in extreme poverty. In rural areas, the percentages of absolute and extreme poverty experienced a process of first falling and then rising, which was obviously on the same track with the urban-rural income gap first shrinking and then growing. This shows that the changes in the percentages of rural absolute and relative poverty are more sensitive to changes in urban-rural income-distribution policy than those at the average-income level. In other words, changes in urban-rural income-distribution policy have a more direct and severe impact on the low-income stratum. Official statistics for 1988 and 1989 show the number of rural poverty-households respectively at 19.7775 million and 19.5456 million, with the poverty-stricken populations respectively at 88.48 million and 86.61 million, for percentages of the whole rural population respectively at 10.74 percent and 10.41 percent. Obviously, official estimates are much more conservative than our calculations. Relative poverty is a phenomenon that has always existed in economic life. In the first half of the 1980s, our urban relative-poverty rate was quite low at 2.61-4.3 percent. In 1985, our percentage of relative-poverty households rose to 12.48 percent, since then it has remained at 8-9 percent. That our relative-poverty-household rates stayed higher during the last half of the 1980s than during the first half was due to our income-distribution policy being more open and flexible. In the rural areas after 1981, the percentages of households in relative poverty rose yearly, peaking in 1989 at 15.6 percent. The rise in the percentage of relative-poverty households in the rural areas confirms from another angle the annually widening rural income-distribution gap, which is basically consistent with our conclusions in the previous sections of this article. Rural absolute and relative poverty are caused by many factors. 1. In certain regions, such as remote mountain areas, rocky mountainous areas, high, cold mountain areas, minority nationality regions, reserve areas, and localities with a high incidence of disease, due to poor natural and geographic conditions, residents who are dependent mostly on farming and livestock-raising income have generally lower incomes, having become a group of households and populations that can hardly escape their poverty. 2. In ordinary areas, certain peasant populations are large in size, with many non-adult children and old people who cannot work, or longstanding family illnesses, a lack of workers or strong workers, shortages of labor to put into production, and even more difficulty in having surplus labor to engage in other industrial-sideline production, leaving their gross incomes too low, and their average incomes even lower. 3. Capital goods and real estate ownership is generally low. In contrast to others, these peasant households have to put more of their incomes into acquiring housing and improving their living conditions, which is bound to further squeeze out production funds, thus further lowering their production-fund input, creating a lack of reproduction capability, and forming a vicious cycle. 4. The percentage of purely farm households in the poverty-stricken population is very high, with very few engaged in industrial sideline production, leaving them largely dependent on the weather, unable to supplement agriculture with industry, and with lower incomes. The causes of urban poverty are mainly too few family members working and too low job and industry incomes. As a key feature of urban employment is that family-member jobs are more concentrated, with many husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters all working in the same factory or unit, if the income of the factory or unit is low, this affects not only the individual, but also the whole family's income. In addition, urban single-member and unemployable families are also a component of poverty-stricken households. [passage omitted] VII. The Illegal-Income Problem There is no use denying that China's high-income stratum contains both those who got rich through hard work and operating in the right way, as well as no lack of upstarts who exploited their authority for private gain. The public aversion to and bitter hatred of income-distribution injustice is directed largely toward this illegal-income phenomenon and those with illegal incomes. Illegal incomes come in many types, such as through bribetaking and illegal profiteering. Some exploit foreign business and trade activities to buy in commodities and equipment of poor quality through improper trading procedures, taking bribes from foreign firms at the cost of sacrificing national and collective interests; others exploit their commodity-distribution authority in domestic commodity transactions, in violation of national policy, to distribute certain planned-target commodities in short market supply to nonplanned-distribution partners, taking bribes for this; and yet others exploit their job responsibilities in areas, such as personnel, residence registration management authority, job planning and transfer, and residence movement and registration, to solicit bribes from their service partners. Certain housing-management personnel exploit their housing-assignment authority, some key school officials take advantage of their student-recruitment authority, and certain hospital doctors and nurses make use of their patient-reception and operation-performance powers to demand and take improper gifts from their service targets. Some industrial and commercial management personnel, tax collectors, and health quarantine officials engage in extortion activities, such as industrial and commercial registration, tax examination and collection, and health inspection. There are many such examples that do not need to be listed one by one. In addition, certain people exploit our dual-track system of planning and markets, making exorbitant profits through lease-finding activities. Such people might take advantage of powers, such as shareholding-enterprise-listing examination and approval authority and loan-allotment jurisdiction, to demand firsthand shares from enterprises or they might profiteer through commodities in short market supply, gold and foreign exchange, or cultural relics and antiques, to get very rich through black-market trading. Some household operators and private enterprise owners practice bribery and gift-giving, buying off tax collectors to evade taxes; some use means, such as under and deceptive reporting of business turnover, overreporting of costs and underreporting of income to evade taxes. A few enterprise officers and accountants use public office for private gain, embezzling public monies and stealing what is entrusted to their care in economic activities. While the phenomenon of illegally acquired income is a very isolated one in China, it certainly has an inestimable impact on China's income-distribution order and the public mindset. These illegal-income recipients have a consumption style far above that of ordinary families, making some people feel outdone, and leaving people even more sensitive to income-distribution injustice. This phenomenon is even likely to cause public dissatisfaction with government and is a hidden danger to social and political stability. The black-market, lease-finding, and corruption phenomenon is the inevitable outcome of an unsound legal system and imperfect business-management system. It is an unavoidable economic phenomenon for developing countries in a particular economic-development stage. It can be gradually overcome only through reforming the political and economic systems, establishing sound legal institutions, perfecting market forces and improving government administration. VIII. A Brief Summary We have learned through analyzing the income-distribution-gap status quo that China's urban-rural distribution gap is still quite large, with our rural-income base coefficient quite high at about 30 percent. We also have a distribution gap between developed zones and undeveloped regions. First, we need to affirm that China's rural base coefficient remains within an internationally-recognized rational standard. As to our interregional gap, from the efficiency angle, while economically backward regions have a lower level of development, their income ratio to the national average is higher than that of developed zones. Taking 1989 for instance, the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong had a ratio of income to the national average of respectively 73.99 percent, 85.24 percent, and 98.73 percent, with a ratio of rural consumption to per capita GNP of respectively 43.26 percent, 44.45 percent, and 41.76 percent. But the three provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu had a ratio of urban consumption to per capita GNP of respectively 168.3 percent, 140.44 percent, and 181.72 percent, as well as a ratio of rural consumption to per capita GNP of respectively 55.94 percent, 54.91 percent, and 42.26 percent, all higher than Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong. This shows that the state provides distribution consideration and subsidies to backward regions. In addition, as to the way to eliminate the urban-rural and regional gaps, either through curbing the high-income stratum and high-income-region income growth to shrink the gap, or through promoting faster economic development in low-income regions and among the low-income stratum, thus achieving a high-level of joint prosperity, our correct option obviously must be the latter. From a development perspective, China is going to be faced with a long historical period of still quite difficult industrialization and urbanization missions. By 1990, China still had 73.59 percent of its population living in rural areas, with about 60 percent of its workforce engaged in farmwork. To decrease our agricultural population and workforce, so that the rural population shifts to cities and the agricultural workforce to nonfarm industry, our immediate option must be to continue to vigorously develop in a planned and step-by-step way all types of township and village enterprises that conform to our industrial-development orientation. In this process, the different paces of workforce shift, the order in which this occurs, and the difference in labor productivity of traditional and modern industry, will be bound to mean that the income gap among groups will exist and grow. But this is precisely an essential process that must be undergone in order to achieve joint prosperity. In addition, in western China, in certain relatively backward border zones, we have speeded up the pace of reform and opening in recent years, so that as our national industrialization ladder advances, coastal-zone-development marginal costs rise steadily and western China speeds up its development of resource industries, such as raw materials and power, the development gap among regions will eventually shrink. Of course, this process will be a long one, not to be accomplished all in one move.
