"They (China) said we should not be in a great hurry to push for this (arms registry) proposal because ... to push too hard might itself raise suspicions," Mr. Severino said after China's foreign ministry officials met with their local counterparts for the annual Philippines-China bilateral consultations in Manila last Thursday. Manila called for the establishment of an arms registry in the region during a senior officials meeting among member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok recently to ensure transparency of military armaments, particularly on imports, exports, enhancement and weapons expenditures. Mr. Severino said Beijing has agreed, however, to an ASEAN proposal to have Brunei collect various proposals on the framework and mechanism of a regional arms registry. "What was agreed upon was to look at several proposals (for an arms registry) and then study it even further. But we told them (Beijing) we are pushing for more speed and progress on this," Mr. Severino said. During the ASEAN senior officials meet, member-states agreed to temporarily shelve the Philippine proposal for an arms registry. Instead, the officials suggested that the United Nations model be studied further since it was only established last year. The Philippine proposal goes beyond the scope of the UN model and includes transparency on the production of indigenous military weapons as well as expenditures. Despite having a different perspective on the Philippine proposal Beijing has nonetheless supported Manila's call to have the arms registry issue tackled during next month's ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok. The ARF will bring together the foreign ministers of the six ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) along with its seven dialogue partners (Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and the United States) to tackle growing security concerns in the Asia Pacific. It will also have China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea in the discussion table.
