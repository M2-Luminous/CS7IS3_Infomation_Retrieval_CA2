The U.S. administration has come to feel strongly the importance of Japan-U.S. interdependence, and realizes that "excessive pressure on Japan will have the opposite effect, and will undermine U.S. interests as well." The key to bringing about a breakthrough in bilateral trade talks is whether Japan will be able to correct its rigid stance over the next two months while the temporary U.S. "cease-fire," as evidenced in the suspension of sanctions against Japan over government procurement, takes effect. Statement With the U.S. Congress in Mind After a meeting of the U.S. Government policy coordination body, the National Economic Council (NEC) last weekend, a senior White House official said: "This time, Japan will surely get our message." He was talking about the flexible approach of the United States to Japan--for instance, the "suspension for two months" of procedures to impose sanctions under the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act on the issue of Japanese Government procurement. Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market was also part of such efforts. While the statement made by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor indicating the new U.S. attitude also contained tough expressions, such as: "Japanese Government procurement of supercomputers continues to be subject to special monitoring," the fact that the statement was made late on a Saturday afternoon without an attendant news conference, as if it was being hidden from the public, clearly shows Kantor wanted to avoid irritating Congress by adopting a softer stance. There had been heated debate in the NEC before this conclusion was reached. Against the USTR's strong wish to push through with sanctions, the NEC staff and officials of the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce took a more cautious attitude. The USTR, which had had a major say on the matter since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in mid-February, was held in check for once. Apprehensions Over Rapid Yen Appreciation According to a Treasury official, the decisive argument was: "Japan and the United States are in the same boat in a relationship of interdependence." Any further pressure on Japan, it was argued, would cause further yen appreciation and dollar depreciation, a trend which had already been aggravated by the inauguration of the Hata administration, which is believed to have a very shaky hold on power. The result would not only delay economic recovery in Japan, it could also dampen U.S. economic conditions with a rise in long-term U.S. interest rates, which in turn could bring about chaos in the world market. "Economic confrontation between Japan and the United States does more harm than good." Faced with the historic prospect of the exchange rate dipping below 100 yen to a dollar, the U.S. administration, at long last, began to take a realistic view. Kantor had also presented to Tsutomu Hata, (then) deputy prime minister and foreign minister, proposals on the pending issue of objective criteria in the framework talks which were more acceptable to Japan. The new suggestions linked the issue to the "objectives of the framework talks" to increase Japanese imports and expand foreign participation in the Japanese market. The United States has not taken a more considerate stance toward Japan since July last year. Nevertheless, the position adopted by the United States has a deadline of "two months." Depending on the Japanese response, the United States may turn to a tougher USTR-inspired position just before the meeting of leaders of the advanced countries (the Naples summit) in July. Japanese bureaucrats have been quick to voice the opinion that "the United States has no right to press Japan to respond by imposing a deadline." This attitude may offset all the efforts by U.S. officials to take a more moderate position. If Japan continues to talk and act as if under a spell which forces it to answer "no" to every suggestion, there can be no improvement in the situation. On the other hand, former Under Secretary of State Robert Zoellick advises that "right now, if only Japan compromises a little, the situation may improve." For example, if Japan makes certain concessions on government procurement, where the United States has suspended the imposition of sanctions, there is the possibility that a solution in this area may be reached very quickly. Speculation About a Final Solution in "September" As far as tax reform, one of the keys to a compromise between the two countries, is concerned, the belief is growing even in the United States that the Social Democratic Party of Japan's decision to leave the coalition government has made it impossible for any sort of tax reform policy to be decided upon before the end of June. Even if a conclusion on tax reform is delayed, however, Japan might still be able to get round this if something is done about the midterm prospects of the current account surplus. Furthermore, the prevailing view in the White House is that final agreement on the framework talks will come in "September," rather than July. Although at present the dominant view within the U.S. administration is that it would not be wise to corner a politically unstable Japan, it is high time Japan also came up with effective ideas.
