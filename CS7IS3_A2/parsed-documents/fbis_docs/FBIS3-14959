This was stated today by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, replying to a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent regarding the fate of anti-aircraft defense, the Navy, and other structures of the Defense Department. He did, however, point out specifically that the Ministry of Defense is not yet "ready to bring all the arms of the forces into a single integrated structure." Any reshaping will, in the opinion of the military leader, invariably bring in its wake disruption of the administration system, which must not be permitted.
