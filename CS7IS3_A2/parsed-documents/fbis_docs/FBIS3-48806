In the midst of a prolonged business slump, judging even from past examples, we will encounter the real severity in the unemployment rate after this. With hopes that the slump would bottom out also proving futile, and GNP for the April-June quarter being the second quarter of negative growth following the July-September 1992 quarter period, prolongation of the bubble-burst recession became clear. Along with that, apprehension has spread that the employment situation will worsen after this, so interest in the trend of the unemployment rate has begun to grow. In the initial phase of the recession a period of 2.1 percent unemployment continued for some time, but beginning about one year ago, the unemployment rate gradually rose and in July 1993 has become 2.5 percent. Since the unemployment rate did not increase for a long time, it seems likely that we are in a situation in which a view will spread that Japan's statistics on unemployment are not grasping the real situation. But before dismissing it as just a problem of statistics, we should take into account fully the actual situation of the labor market which lies behind the unemployment rate. Otherwise, it will be impossible to foresee accurately the development of the future employment situation that will accompany prolongation of the recession. The Bubble Reserve If we follow the economic white paper for the current fiscal year and say that the high point of the last period of prosperity was the April-June quarter of 1991, the unemployment rate progressed at the same level of 2.1 percent for one year after that. It began to rise in July-September 1992, five quarters later. In past recessionary phases, changes in the unemployment rate were such that, generally the rise in the unemployment rate has been slow in the first half of the recession, and the tempo of the rise has quickened as it approached the business trough of the second half. Yet, for the unemployment rate to not rise at all for one year, as happened this time, is a rare phenomenon even in past recessions. But it is not completely without precedent; the situation in the recession following the "Izanagi boom" of October 1965 to July 1970 resembled this time. The way in which Japanese companies promote employment adjustment affects deeply the fact that the tempo of unemployment-rate increase quickens in the latter half of a recession. In the initial stage of a recession, companies mainly promote reductions in overtime, and as the recession advances further, they gradually begin to reduce employment. Here, too, they begin with temporary and part-time employees, and finally adjust regular employment when the recession has become fairly severe. Therefore, it means that generation of jobless persons, which raises the unemployment rate, is concentrated in the latter half of a recession. The question is the reason which has particularly delayed the rise in the unemployment rate this time. It seems that the greatest reason is found in the labor market during the bubble period of prosperity. In the bubble period of prosperity, the effective job offer ratio rose to 1.4 times that during the Izanagi boom. In a complete change from what had been the case up till then, companies were forced to go to considerable trouble to secure employees. Therefore, memories of that trouble probably did not fade easily even when they entered a slump. Furthermore, there are also limitations on labor supply for the medium to long term. It seems that this kind of situation caused them to hold back for some time on adjustment of employees. The high level of company revenue stored up in the bubble period of prosperity also made such holding back possible. The unemployment rate turned upward from the July-September 1992 quarter, and, although the rate of increase in the unemployment rate did not reach that of the recession following the first oil crisis, it has approached that of the latter half of the slump following the second oil crisist and returned to the ordinary rise in the unemployment rate during a slump. This indicates that accompanying the lengthening of the recession, a change has begun to occur in companies' heretofore cautious posture toward employment. The Japanese and U.S. Definitions Are About the Same Next, let us turn to the question of unemployment statistics. The view that Japan's unemployment statistics do not grasp the situation of the labor market accurately has been repeated every time up till now that a slump has occurred. At its root is a perception, regarding the level of Japan's unemployment being markedly lower than that of Europe and the United States and the rise in the unemployment rate during recessions being too low, that the real situation is not so. Until now the assertion has often appeared that if one looked at Japan's unemployment rate by U.S. criteria, it would be twice what it is at present. It was conventional wisdom that by nature Japan's definition of an unemployed person was strict, and that the unemployment rate had become less than in Europe and the United States for that reason. But that was not something based on a strict comparison. Beginning about 1980, after the Statistics Bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency began to use the kind of research that makes it possible to change over to U.S. definition of an unemployed person, quantitative comparison of Japan's unemployment rate with those of Europe and the United States became possible. At about that time, based on the results of that research, I made a preliminary calculation of Japan's unemployment rate based on the U.S. definition of an unemployed person. As a result of that, it became clear that the unemployment rate was at about the same level by Japan's definition and by the U.S. definition. The unemployed of Japan's definition are persons 1) among those who have not done work accompanied by income during the week of the survey (1 week) and are capable of working, who 2) actively sought employment in the week of the survey (1 week), or 3) actively sought employment in the past and are awaiting the results of that activity. The U.S. unemployed are persons 1) among those who have not done work accompanied by income during the week of the survey (1 week) and are capable of working, who 2) actively sought employment during the past four weeks including the week of the survey, or 3) have been laid off and are awaiting a return to work, or 4) have employment arranged to begin within 30 days. What differs in Japan and the United States is that the period in which employment is sought in item 2 is short in Japan, at 1 week, but in the United States it is the past four weeks, as well as Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4. Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4 are all ones that are included as exceptions in the unemployed by removing the condition of seeking employment in 2. Next, based on a February 1993 special labor force survey, I will make a preliminary calculation of the number of unemployed according to the U.S. definition. The number of unemployed at that point in time was 1.57 million, and the unemployment rate was 2.4 percent. First, of those in Japan's item 3, we exclude 360,000 persons who did not seek employment in the last four weeks, and next we add to the unemployed the non-labor force population other than those unemployed by the Japanese definition: 120,000 who sought employment in the last four weeks and 190,000 who had arranged for employment to begin within 30 days. In regard to U.S. item 3, since Japan has no system of layoffs, we do not adjust it. The result is that the number of unemployed by the U.S. definition comes to 1.52 million, and the unemployment rate comes to 2.4 percent. Thus, the difference between the Japanese definition and the U.S. definition is small. But if we look at it separately by sex, the unemployment rate for females comes out to be higher by the U.S. definition because it extends the period during which employment is sought. In Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, they publish unemployment rates based on the number of persons seeking employment who are registered at employment offices. Therefore, it is difficult, as it stands, to compare with such countries as Japan and the United States, which publish the unemployment rate based on sample surveys. However, the EC has recently begun to conduct an annual survey that employs the same definition of the unemployed as the United States, so comparison with the EC has become easy. The unemployment rate in that EC survey, for 1991, comes to 7 percent for England, 9 percent for France, and 4 percent for Germany, considerably higher than Japan. Furthermore, the U.S. unemployment rate at that time was 7 percent. Cyclical Factors and Structural Factors It is possible to view the unemployment rate by dividing it into the part that fluctuates in response to poor or good business conditions and the part that is not influenced by changes in business conditions. The unemployment rate that fluctuates with business conditions is called the insufficient-demand unemployment rate, or the cyclical unemployment rate. On the other hand, the unemployment rate that is not influenced by fluctuations in business conditions is called the structural unemployment rate, the balanced unemployment rate, the full-employment unemployment rate, or the natural unemployment rate. The way of referring to them varies because the respective definitions differ depending on economic theory and unemployment theory. The difference between the Japanese unemployment rate and those of Europe and the United States is found mainly in the part of the unemployment rate that is not influenced by fluctuations in business conditions. The FY92 White Paper on the World Economy presented the results of an estimate which divided the unemployment rate of Europe and the United States into a cyclical unemployment rate and a structural unemployment rate. Therefore, applying this, we shall advance our discussion of the cyclical unemployment rate and the structural unemployment rate. According to the cyclical unemployment rate, Germany is 0.7 percent, England and France are 1.7 percent, and the United States is 3.8 percent; therefore, Germany is low and the United States is high. Japan is closer to Germany. The level of the cyclical unemployment rate depends on the method of employment adjustment. If, as in Japan, one adopts an employment-adjustment method which emphasizes reduction of working hours, the cyclical unemployment rate is low. Germany, too, seems to have a system of shortening working hours, and it can be seen that adjustment of working hours is carried out. In contrast to this, because of the diffusion of the layoff system, emphasis in the United States is placed on adjustment of employees rather than on reduction of working hours, so the cyclical unemployment rate seems to have become high. Concerning the structural unemployment rate, the United States is 3.3 percent, England is 7.3 percent, France is 7.5 percent, and Germany is 7.7 percent, so it is high in each country of Europe and the United States. Japan is on the level of 2 percent, lower than Europe and the United States. The level of the structural unemployment rate depends on the supply and demand adjustment in the labor market. If the labor market's performance is good, the structural unemployment rate is low, as in Japan. In recent years, in the midst of internationalization and the advance of technological innovation, every nation has been exposed to structural changes in the demand for manpower. If the supply side's response to structural changes in demand is unsuccessful, the structural unemployment rate continues to climb. However long one might wait, there is no hope for recovery in demand for types of occupation for which there has been a structural decline in demand. Workers in such occupations must acquire new occupational skills and transfer to occupations for which demand is increasing. If they cannot do that, the workers will continue to be out of work. Japanese companies educate and train workers in-house and are carrying out employment management that emphasizes making the best use of staff within the company; therefore, in response to structural changes in demand, adjustment of supply and demand is first attempted by assignment changes within the company or the enterprise group. Then, when it becomes difficult by internal adjustment alone, it is for the first time left to adjustment of the market outside the company. That is, in Japan a worker's change of occupation is promoted in an in-house labor market, so generation of the structurally unemployed is restrained there. In contrast to this, in Europe and the United States an in-house labor market is not functioning as it is in Japan, so the response to structural changes depends directly on adjustment of supply and demand in the external labor market. That apparently invites increases in the structurally unemployed. Of course, all sorts of factors have influenced the difference in the structural unemployment rate between Japan and Europe and the United States, but it is thought that, among them, the difference of using an in-house labor market accounts for considerable weight. Even in Japan, the rigorous employment adjustment of dismissals and inviting voluntary retirement was carried out after the first oil crisis. Therefore, from the 1970's into the 1980's, the unemployment rate at the peak time of business conditions rose, and the structural employment rate became higher, albeit slightly, than that of Europe and the United States. It Is Necessary From a Long-Term Perspective, But... The current recession is about to become as long as the one after the second oil crisis, which, at three years, was the longest in recent years. In past recessions, the unemployment rate remained high even after business conditions had passed their low point and turned to an expansionary phase, taking some time before the unemployment rate fell. Furthermore, after the first oil crisis, the unemployment rate continued to rise even in an expansionary phase. This is because, although generation of new unemployment declined along with the recovery of business, the unemployed who did not find new positions remained unemployed for some time even after the low point in business conditions passed. From such experiences in the past, we feel that the unemployment problem would become more severe in the future. Moreover, in the current recession, the production index for manufacturing industries is recently showing its greatest decline, if one excludes the slump following the first oil crisis, which was the greatest since World War II. Notwithstanding that in the initial phase of the recession, companies refrained from adjustment of employed personnel, the bill for that would come due after this. With the strong yen and the cold summer, companies are revising downward by a wide margin their estimates of future demand, and are intensifying measures toward employment adjustment. Lately, newspapers almost every day carry articles about companies implementing employment adjustment and suspending for the next fiscal year the hiring of new graduates. Just a little while ago, managers were howling about the difficulty of securing workers. Those managers are now struggling to adjust employment. What a bewildering change. Even if they can weather the current crisis by implementing employment adjustment, in terms of the future, it will for the most part come out to be a loss in the aspect of securing manpower. Accompanying the advent of an aging society, the Japan of the future is about to become a society in which the size of the working population will continue to decline. Do not managers need a viewpoint that is fixed on that kind of future? At present it is important to prevent greater deterioration of the unemployment situation. In order to do that, it is necessary that business conditions recover as soon as possible, and company managers have a bright outlook. Japan's unemployment rate is low and is not sensitive to business conditions. But as we have seen so far, important information for grasping movements in the employment situation is contained in the fluctuations of the unemployment rate. It seems that making use of this in judging the employment situation is precisely what is important.
