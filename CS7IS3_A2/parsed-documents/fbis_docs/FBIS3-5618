But Ranariddh, making the remarks in a dinner meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, said it will not do for the Khmer Rouge to try to "bargain" its way through the door. Rather, the guerrilla group must enter through dialogue with the government on national reconciliation in a sincere manner, he was quoted as saying. Ranariddh, who arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day to attend a two-day international aid conference beginning Thursday, did not clarify what role the Khmer Rouge could be given in the future political makeup of the country. He previously rejected proposals to give the Khmer Rouge posts in the cabinet in exchange for a return of territories under its control and integration of its guerrilla army into the nation's unified armed forces. The officials said Ranariddh said it is not permissible that the Khmer Rouge continues to control large tracts of territory. The guerrilla group, which held the nation under a rule of terror from 1975 to 1978, still controls an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the country's territory. Ranariddh said the Khmer Rouge has not responded to the governments repeated calls for a ceasefire despite the fact that repeated concessions have been made to them. He suggested the ball is now in the court of the guerrilla group. Ranariddh made the remarks in the wake of message issued by ailing Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing calling for a ceasefire. "The war between the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) forces has so far brought nothing but destruction, separation, suffering, pain, shame and despair for Cambodia, for our nation and especially our poor people," the king said in a statement dated March 7. Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan has reportedly responded by expressing support for Sihanouk. Government forces are reportedly preparing an attack on the Khmer Rouge's headquarters in Pailin, some 300 kilometers northwest of Phnom Penh near the Thai border.
