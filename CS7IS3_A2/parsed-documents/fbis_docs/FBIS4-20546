The European, and especially the German, air and space industry has experienced a crisis year. Even the near future does not look much better. International airlines cancel about as many aircraft contracts as they award. Military aircraft production is suffering drastically reduced procurement, and the governments in the United States and Japan are even more concerned about these industries than is the German government. The consequences for DASA (Deutsche Aerospace AG), under whose roof almost 70% of the German aviation and space industry is concentrated, are now known. By 1996, DASA will shut down six plants; it will give up three more sites and reduce its work staff by another 10,300, down to a total of 70,000 remaining positions. But even these drastic measures will only stabilize the situation for Daimler's subsidiary under the most optimistic premises. In a conversation with Handelsblatt, Hartmut Mehdorn, DASA's chairman for the aviation sector, said: "The measures we have announced will only suffice if there is a positive decision for the construction of the European fighter aircraft, if our remaining development departments continue with the FLA (future large aircraft) project, and if we can build 120 to 130 Airbuses a year. If any one of these premises falls through, we shall have other problems to confront and for which we will require help." A further setback looms for the already markedly reduced production of the Airbus. The only current major, hotly contested contract for commercial aircraft--Saudi Arabia's $6 billion U.S. dollar order for some 50 to 60 aircraft--will, in the opinion of experts in the aviation field, go exclusively to U.S. producers. As a result, production by the Airbus partners (DASA, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Casa) will sink still further because part of that contract had already been included in their plans--over optimistically it now seems. But the Europeans have still not abandoned all hope because President Clinton's (who personally fought for this business) announcement that Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas had won the entire contract has not yet been officially confirmed. As Mehdorn puts it, "the door is still not closed." Cost of the Jaeger 90 Can Provoke New Arguments More hopeful is the belief that Bonn will make a positive procurement decision for the EFA fighter aircraft (Jaeger 90). Since DASA's public announcement of a substantial reduction in its work force, there have been an increasing number of signals from Bonn indicating that no foreign-built competitor aircraft will be purchased. However, the costs involved in the construction of the high-tech Jaeger 90 could well provoke new discussions. Mehdorn said: "On the basis of 1988 cost estimates, the EFA will cost DM57.8 million. That amount represents the `fly-away' cost for which the industry is responsible and which really cannot change very much. We are not responsible for the higher system costs, which include the logistics expenditures of the customer over the entire service life." In DASA's opinion, there is considerable room for savings in the system costs, which have been put at about DM130 million. The cost negotiations between Bonn and the EFA Consortium, set for 1995, should provide fireworks both because of the inflation-driven cost increases since 1988 as well as because of the greater costs resulting from technical and bureaucratic delays. If the decision is positive for EFA, then the production capacities can--to a considerable degree--be fully utilized. That, however, does not hold for the development departments. Consequently, Mehdorn is relying on the "future large aircraft," a tactical military transport successor to the aging German-French Transall aircraft. This new four-engine heavy cargo aircraft (payload 25 tons), which will also be offered for commercial use, must, in the opinion of DASA planners in Germany and France, be ready by the year 2002. This means that the program has to be approved in 1994. Mehdorn wants to win Bonn over to the FLA and to this end proposes a revolutionary way for the military to procure it. "We want this to be different from the EFA process. We have proposed to make this aircraft efficient and inexpensive from the industrial point of view." We can do this if the governments involved dispense with their conventional comprehensive, detailed technical specifications and merely prescribe "what the aircraft must be able to do." DASA and Aerospatiale, as well as partners who join in the venture later, will develop, build, and finance "structures as in the Airbus project, using available Airbus components." The aid that would still be required from the government could then be limited to DM25 million yearly, a credit pledge, and a guaranteed procurement. However, Mehdorn does not believe that even a successor to the Transall will ensure the continued existence of a German aviation industrial capability in the long term. To do that, the entire financial support policy would have to be restructured and intensified. He wants a yearly budget of at least DM300 million for "technology projects." In this way, Mehdorn believes, the aviation and space industry could retain its capability and participate in a market, which is estimated to reach a volume of DM800 billion in the next 20 years. Moreover, new aircraft programs would have to be indirectly subsidized, as in the United States, because direct development subsidies would be greatly reduced. "To match the United States in these matters, we need an advance development program borne entirely by the government," DASA's chairman asserts, estimating that U.S. subsidies via NASA in 1993 and 94 amounted to about $1 billion U.S. dollars annually and another $1.6 billion dollars annually via the Air Force. Although no specific amounts of financial subsidies are available in the case of Japan, the upcoming competitor against the European aviation and space industry, DASA believes that the accumulation of patents identified indicate that aviation and space is Japan's "next strategic attack point." In order to meet this attack, Mehdorn asserts that, in addition to financial outlays, Germany needs an "integrated aviation support structure, in which industry, the universities, the major research institutes, the DLR (German Aerospace Research Institute), and the various responsible ministries all participate." The Americans, especially Boeing, the world's leading producer of commercial aircraft, which is already cooperating closely with Japanese companies, are serving as midwives at the birth of the Japanese aviation and space industry. So as not to have that developing alliance become a competitor against the European Airbus partners right from its inception, the head of DASA, Juergen Schrempp, entered into an agreement with Boeing to establish a joint working group, consisting of the Airbus partners and Boeing, to make a feasibility study for one of the most ambitious aircraft projects ever--a large 500 to 600-seat aircraft. The feasibility study, which was ready in March, concluded that "owing to the enormously high costs of development, estimated at $10-12 billion U.S. dollars, a project of this nature could only be undertaken on a worldwide basis. It is still problematical as to whether joint trans-Atlantic measures will follow from that conclusion." Mehdorn concludes: "Just as there are opponents in this country to cooperation with Boeing, there are opponents to cooperation with Europe at Boeing."
