He informed journalists that the Crimean Communist Party Central Committee issued a statement which calls renewal of the Republic of Crimea's 6 May 1992 Constitution "inappropriate to the present time and allows dishonorable leaders in Ukraine, Crimea, and Russia to inflame interethnic hostility and a bloody conflict." Leonid Hrach noted at the news conference that the Crimean Communist Party is ready to cooperate with any political forces in order to unite efforts against inflaming conflicts and to speak out in favor of civic peace and interethnic accord. According to Leonid Hrach, the actions of Crimea's Supreme Council in adopting the first version of the 6 May 1992 Constitution and suspending the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution revoking the Republic of Crimea's resolution renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood, are criminal.
