It appears, however, that the world is failing, as evidenced by the continued fighting between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, the trend will be towards prolonged fighting if foreign arms are poured into the country. Thailand's view, which opposes arms being supplied from a dozen countries for the Cambodian Government to fight the Khmer Rouge, may carry little weight in light of repeated remarks by Cambodian Government officials accusing Thailand of aiding the Khmer Rouge. Though Thailand has not supported the Khmer Rouge as accused, if those countries believe those accusations they could provide funds and arms to the Cambodian Government as requested. We wish to tell the world, especially the countries involved in the Paris agreement, that arms or financial support for any Cambodian side will make peace in Cambodia, which really is not that far away, completely impossible to achieve. The civil war will continue with more Cambodians becoming victims. We sympathize with King Sihanouk being discouraged by disunity among the Cambodian people, which is causing peace to be unattainable. Couple this unity problem with foreign arms support -- so the Cambodians can kill each other, so that one faction will gain outright victory -- will fuel incessant fighting in Cambodia and endanger the region and the world. We feel that if the superpowers really want peace to return to Cambodia, they should avoid arms support for any Cambodian faction. They should convene another meeting of the countries involved in the Paris agreement to find a solution to the civil war and forge national reconciliation for the Cambodian people and eventually for their survival. We wish to warn the Cambodian Government that to completely subjugate the rival faction by war requires an overwhelming superiority. In the interest of the future of the Cambodian nation, national reconciliation must not be forged by continued violence.
