Endara explained that the conditions that led to Panama's expulsion are a thing of the past and that the country now is involved in a democratic process that became stronger with the 8 May general elections -- elections in which opposition candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares was elected. Endara's petition was expressed in a letter he sent to the Rio Group. In the letter, Endara stressed: I feel an era is ending with this last diplomatic effort I am making today. With your support, my country and people will again occupy a place of honor which, because of a lack of democracy, was suddenly snatched away from them, and which now, thank God, is being returned.
