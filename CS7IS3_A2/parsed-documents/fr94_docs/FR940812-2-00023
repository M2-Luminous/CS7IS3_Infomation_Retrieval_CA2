Take notice that Ogden Martin Systems of Onondaga Limited Partnership (the ``Partnership''), a Delaware limited partnership, on August 1, 1994, filed a petition, pursuant to 18 CFR 385.207, seeking waiver of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (``Commission'') regulations regarding accounting practices, reporting requirements, property dispositions and consolidations, securities issuance or assumptions of liability and the holding of interlocking positions. The Partnership has also filed a Motion for Refund of Filing Fee, pursuant to 18 CFR 381.109, seeking the refund of the $10,930 filing fee that accompanied the petition. The Partnership will operate a municipal solid waste-to-energy facility (the ``Facility'') under a Solid Waste Service Agreement with the Onondaga County Resource Recovery Agency. The Facility will have a maximum net electric power production capacity in excess of thirty megawatts and, as a result, is not exempt by section 201(e) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act from regulation under Part II of the Federal Power Act. The Facility is certified as a qualifying small power production facility within the meaning of sections 201 and 210 of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of the Petition or Motion should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before August 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
