[Mazowiecki] "This disagreement, this impossibility to agree some sort of joint stance, but one that is consistently implemented, of course encourages agression, encourages the perpetration of transgressions of human rights with impunity." In Mazowiecki's view, the very threat of air strikes would allow the war to be broken off. The leader of the Democratic Union does not think that NATO will decide to use force. [Mazowiecki] "We are constantly having to deal with the situation whereby, if one thing is said in Brussels, the next day [pauses].... If the ministers say one thing, the next day the ambassadors of these same countries say something else, ameliorating it, changing it. This is indeed worthy of condemnation in this situation--the incapability of adopting a joint stance."
