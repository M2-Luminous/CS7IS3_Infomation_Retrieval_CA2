The present circumstances thus require unity of ranks to confront all the challenges facing the country. Oh brothers and sisters, we do not doubt at all and everybody has got the good intention. However, the required results from all parties have not been realized completely despite the efforts made by the National Dialogue Commission. In my name and on behalf of all the members of the National Dialogue Commission, I thank all the parties which have dealt with us with all seriousness and sincerity." [end recording] [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Abdelkader Bensalah, conference spokesman] The idea of the National Dialogue Commission was right from the beginning, to go into the depth of the matter and find out its facts with precision and caution in light of its importance and seriousness. The Commission has always had the conviction that dealing with this matter required time and patience at the same time. The Commission has, through its endeavors toward this Islamic tendency registered tangible results, the most important of which is represented in the latter's acceptance of dialogue as a principle and as a political method to deal with this problem and the need to arrive gradually at its solution. From these premises, the Commission has embodied this option, i.e. that of continuing dialogue when it included it in the platform for national consensus. [end recording] [Correspondent] The official spokesman concluded his speech by stressing the need to adhere to dialogue as a positive means to ensure its continuation and deepening by the transitional bodies, considering that the dialogue is a pressing need for dealing with all parties. After this, opportunity was given to journalists to ask questions, and the national spokesman declined to answer some of them considering that they were premature. [passage omitted]
