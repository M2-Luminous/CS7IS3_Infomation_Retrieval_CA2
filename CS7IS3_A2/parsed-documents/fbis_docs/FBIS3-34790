The minister is aware that these debts were the result of regional and international circumstances that forced Jordan--due to its position--to bear the consequences of these circumstances. The instability in the region, whose responsibility is shouldered by the entire international community, forced Jordan to be on the longest Arab front with Israel. This exhausted a huge portion of the loans Jordan was forced to seek. At a time when Israel was receiving all forms of support from the United States and the allied countries, including France, Jordan was not receiving even the Arab assistance decided by Arab summit conferences, whose decisions were not respected. Jordan's share of international support was below what is needed although Jordan was a main victim of the Western allies' support for Israel and the Cold War between the Eastern and Western blocs. Juppe emphasized that his country will support the rescheduling of Jordan's debts, and the United States had earlier announced that it was seriously studying economic and military support for Jordan. We hope that these encouraging signs would be implemented in order to compensate this country for the losses caused by circumstances that Jordan did not create and for which it is not responsible. Based on its position, message, and principles, Jordan remained committed to its principles and endured the consequences of such commitment and the duties stipulated in the pan-Arab and international charters. Jordan stands as a main test for the international good intentions toward stability and justice in the Middle East. The more Jordan is compensated for its debts and burden caused by instability and lack of justice, the more the international intentions toward the region and the future relations with it would be in the right direction.
