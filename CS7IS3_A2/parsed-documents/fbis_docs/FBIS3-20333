The collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, with all its consequences, seemed to offer Washington and Moscow the opportunity to put "human interests" before the traditional kind of contemptible superpower policy, according to Gorbachev's definition. The fiction of a permanent U.S.-Russian harmony appeared, which was to last in spite of all the natural differences between these major states, thus allowing a bilateral, global peace management. But the success of the nationalist-communist forces at the Russian parliamentary elections swept this idea away and made it obvious that Russia is continuing its traditional efforts to expand its power. During his visit to Moscow in January, President Clinton still allocated to his hosts a peacemaking role in their region -- as defined by the Russian military doctrine; but now a countermovement is beginning to form in Washington that does not want to grant Moscow the right to use disciplinary measures against its neighbors. This was triggered by the shrill nationalist rhetoric that is even being used by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, trying to outdo the "patriots" of all shades on the right-wing side. Other things worth thinking about are the removal from government of many reformers, Moscow's pressure on the Baltic states, its increasingly dominating position over Belarus, its ambiguous policy toward the Ukraine, its attempts to make the CIS a de facto USSR, and, last but not least, a new tone that can easily be recognized as the old Soviet one. In the spring, Moscow returned to its old playgrounds in the Balkans and the Middle East -- with intentions that are still unclear. Thus, Kozyrev told his U.S. colleague Christopher in Russia's Far Eastern fortress of Vladivostok that they now have a "mature relationship," which can only mean: Moscow feels equal to Washington and there is no trace of subordination. Russia cannot be expected to stay in a submissive position in the long run, following Washington's orders and not conducting a policy of its own interests. It cannot be blamed for wanting to maintain its interest; this is legitimate, as long as it is not done at the expense of others. This is the crucial point where more and more U.S. politicians stop because they think they can discern a new imperialistic tone in Moscow's behavior and demands. Now the question arises whether today's and tomorrow's Russia is still the one with which the United States can conduct politics based on partnership. Are the premises on which the concept of a partnership of superpowers is based still correct, even if Russia is to join the Partnership for Peace program under NATO's umbrella? It demands a special status for itself, which worries Washington just as much as East and Central Europe. After his visit to Moscow, U.S. Secretary for Defense Perry spoke of a "pragmatic partnership"; the new formula admits that relations between the two superpowers have become more difficult, and it contains Washington's announcement of wanting to adapt itself to this. The security adviser of former President Carter and spokesman of an opposition group within the ruling Democrats, Zbigniev Brzezinski, has now demanded an investigation into President Clinton's Russia policy, with the aim of reassessing Russia's future role in the light of possible new developments. Among these he counts the failure of democracy in Russia, or continuing political instability, together with internal radicalization. In this case, Washington's concept would be outdated anyhow. Also, there are considerations about how and for how long Boris Yeltsin can remain in power, and who his successor will be. Brzezinski is not the only critic of an U.S. foreign policy that was for a long time uncritical toward Russia, and he is not warning in vain either. President Clinton himself has set a corrective sign by receiving in short order the presidents of Ukraine, Georgia, and Kazakhstan, all reform states under Moscow's pressure. He spoke out for the "territorial integrity" of Ukraine at a time when it was jeopardized from the periphery and the Crimea. Today, Washington holds the view that an independent Ukraine is more important for the West's security than a nuclear-free one. Another view is that Russia must not be allowed to patch its old empire back together. Next year, the small CIS states and the Baltic republics together are to receive as much in financial aid as Russia. The United States still needs Russia for disarmament and peacekeeping measures, but it has stopped overlooking its intentions and its neighbors.
