The rebels, led by Joseph Kony, on Monday ambushed a vehicle operating a daily passenger service between Lira and Kitgum, at Ludel and subsequently set it ablaze, witnesses said according to the NEW VISION newspaper. Some of the passengers, who were badly injured, said a group of about 50 rebels jumped on to the road ahead of the vehicle and opened fire, shooting sporadically both in the air and at the vehicle. The vehicle's driver was hit in the arm by two bullets while the conductor got a hard kick on the knee from one of the rebels who had taken cover in the nearby bush. Earlier in the day, the rebels abducted and held hostage two Roman Catholic missionaries, Spaniard Luigi Paolino Aguilera and another unnamed black priest, together with two nuns from Lira's Paranga mission, reports said. The papal envoy here, reached by telephone by the Italian news agency ANSA, said Father Aguilera had returned safe and sound to the Kitgum mission, 380 kilometres (about 240 miles) north of Kampala. Aguilera, a member of the Comboniani order based at Padua in northern Italy, was held by the rebels for just one day, but subjected to five hours of "indoctrination" in the bush before he was set free, ANSA reported. The Italian news agency said the two nuns were still in the hands of the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), but made no mention of the black priest also said to have been abducted. Other reports here said that at least one of the priests had been released, but a Ugandan Catholic Secretariat spokesman could not be reached for further details. NEW VISION said two priests and two nuns were held hostage by the rebels apparently for use as human shields in the event of an attack by government forces. Security sources in Lira said on Wednesday that government troops based at Pajule, 15 kilometres (12 miles) from the scene of the incident, moved swiftly in pursuit, but arrived late and only managed to find the vehicle in which the priests had been travelling. The attack on travellers is seen by the people in the area as an attempt by the rebels to make their presence in the region felt, a gesture that would form the basis for future negotiations with the government. The LRA, a remnant of the voodoo priestess Alice Lakwena's Holy Spirit Army, has stepped up attacks on government forces since February 19, after negotiations with the government broke down. On February 13, President Yoweri Museveni gave the rebels one week to surrender or else face the might of the Ugandan army.
