President Jiang proclaimed this "Decision" in Order of the President of the People's Republic of China No. 12. The "Decision" will to into effect from 1 January 1994. This is a major revision of China's individual income tax system. It shows that a major step has been made to make the individual income tax system become more legalized, scientific, standardized and rationalized. The proclamation and enforcement of the revised individual income tax law is of great significance in promoting the healthy development of China's socialist market economy, opening the country even wider to the outside world, ameliorating the uneven distribution of incomes in society and protecting the nation's rights and interests in taxation. To reform China's individual income tax system is an objective requirement in continuously developing the socialist market economy, deepening the reform and opening to the outside world. Prior to the reform, China's individual income tax system was composed of three tax laws and regulations. The enforcement of these laws and regulations has played a positive role in promoting economic and technical cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries, regulating the incomes of individuals and increasing the revenues of the state. However, with the development of the situation, some contradictions and problems have gradually cropped up. They are often manifested as follows: 1. The tax laws and regulations are not standardized in taxing individuals with similar incomes and dividing the categories of taxpayers. 2. Expense deductions seem to be low, while normal tax rates too high. 3. The tax laws and regulations can no longer keep pace with the many social and economic changes in terms of the scope of taxation, taxable items and tax exemption policy. There is a need to readjust and improve them. In light of the aforementioned problems, the "Decision" made the following important revisions of the 1980 Individual Income Tax Law on the basis of the principle of "treating all taxpayers on an equal basis, simplifying the tax system and making reasonable adjustments" after summing up the past experience and using the experience in foreign countries as a reference. 1. Efforts have been made to expand the sphere of the Individual Income Tax Law to include Chinese citizens, foreigners and self-employed industrial and commercial establishments into a single uniform individual income tax law. 2. In accordance with international practice, the concept of "resident" is introduced to differentiate the taxpayers' limited liabilities from their unlimited ones in paying taxes. 3. Five more taxable items have been added according to the actual situation in social and economic life. They are "incomes of self-employed industrial and commercial establishments in production and business," "income of institutions and enterprises from their contracted and rental businesses", "income from the transfer of properties," "income from authors' remuneration" and "unexpected incomes." 4. Tax burdens have been properly adjusted. The tax rate table for income tax from wages and salaries is divided into nine steps instead of six steps. The "Decision" stipulates that self-employed industrial and commercial establishments in production and businesses must pay income tax at progressive rates ranging 5 to 35 percent levied on their income in excess of specific amounts. Those who are paid extremely high remunerations for a certain type of work may be asked to pay higher income tax on a percentage basis. In addition, people are allowed to deduct from their income taxes the amount of their donations to education or public welfare funds. 5. More items have been added for tax exemption in accordance with the state of affairs in China. It is important to enact a good tax law, but even more important is that we must do a good job in enforcing such a law and ensure that laws are observed, that their enforcement is strict and that law breakers are dealt with. To levy the individual income tax constitutes an important means of the state in strengthening its macroeconomic control. We must earnestly carry out this work in levying and collecting the individual income tax. This law directly affects the distribution of individual benefits. It is an important issue of policy, and it involves many aspects of life. It is difficult to levy and enforce this law. In enforcing this law, the tax authorities must not only work hard, but also acquire the full understanding and support of the large number of taxpayers and people in all sectors of life in society. It is for this reason that the local party and government leadership must firmly strengthen their leadership in enforcing this law. The various departments concerned must energetically coordinate with one another in this regard. Directly shouldering the responsibility in levying the lax, the tax authorities have an arduous task to perform. On the one hand, they must adopt all measures to give publicity to the significance and the spirit in reforming the individual income tax law so that all taxpayers will understand this law and consciously pay their income tax according to the law; while on the other hand, they must earnestly sum up their past experience in collecting income tax, and firmly and in a down-to-earth manner achieve their goal of acting according to law and levying the tax on the basis of the prescribed tax rates. Currently, there is less than two months left before the new individual income tax law goes into effect. The tax authorities at all levels must seize every opportunity to actively carry out their preparations in propaganda and training work and in studies in order to enforce the new tax law with a good beginning. It is our belief that with the vigorous support of the party and government leadership at all levels, the close coordination of the various tax authorities, the full understanding of the large number of taxpayers and the joint efforts of all the cadres in the taxation departments, China will definitely be able to achieve new progress in levying and collecting individual income tax and let this individual income tax play its due active role.
