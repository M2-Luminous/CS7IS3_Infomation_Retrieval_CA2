The United States also thinks that Israel must disarm the settlers and supply them with light weapons for self-defense only. These issues were scheduled to be raised in the preparatory talks of Nabil Sha'th with Dennis Ross, U.S. peace talks coordinator, and Martin Indyk, a member of the National Security Council, before Sha'th's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher this afternoon.
