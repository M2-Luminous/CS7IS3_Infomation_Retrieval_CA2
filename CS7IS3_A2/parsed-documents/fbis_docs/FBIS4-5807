Shirai made the remark in a press conference, commenting on what was said by Akimasa Egawa in a press conference Monday. The bureau chief told the press some broadcasting companies had reported that certain candidates were considered safe bets for election, but that several of them were found later to have been unsuccessful. Egawa said some administrative action, such as admonition, verbal or in writing, will be given to such companies. The vice minister said his ministry will decide whether or not to ask the companies to be more careful in making forecasts while giving due consideration to freedom in editing programs.
