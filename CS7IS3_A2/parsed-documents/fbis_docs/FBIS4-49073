The circular says: Economic crime offenders involved in a grave case in which the Changcheng Company of Mechanical, Electrical, Scientific, and Technological Industries in Beijing illegally raised funds were given sentences in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, reporters who received bribes and concocted misleading public opinions for this illegal funding activity were punished in accordance with the law. A small number of reporters who could not resist monetary temptations compiled fake stories aimed at confusing the public. As a result, they severely disturbed the economic order and damaged the interests of the state and the people. They also tarnished the reputation of the party's papers. We should learn from this lesson and further improve professional ethics among reporters. The circular points out: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China has achieved, under the party's leadership, outstanding results in the press work and made important contributions to the drive of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The overall quality of our reporters is good. Specially after the issuance of the circulars concerning the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying and selling of book numbers," the ill practices that are against the professional ethics of the press and publications have been curbed. We must treat the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying and selling of book numbers" as well as the effort to improve professional ethics among reporters as a long-term work and persist in carrying it out. By using the above-mentioned case as a negative example, we should launch a thoroughgoing campaign to boost journalistic ethics and strengthen the construction of the press. The circular urges propaganda departments of all local CPC committees and press units to conduct, in the light of the guiding spirit of the national meeting on propaganda and ideological work and local realities, an investigation on the work of carrying out the "circular concerning strengthening the construction of the professional ethics among the reporters" issued by the Propaganda Department and the Press and Publications Administration last year. Those who achieve good results should be commended while those who continue the ill practices of "paid journalism" should be severely dealt with. It is necessary to organize reporters to conduct discussions on the Changcheng Company case and draw lessons from it. In the light of the characteristics of their work, press units should formulate relevant regulations and systems to tighten self-discipline and conscientiously accept public supervision. It is necessary to energetically advocate the work style of the reporters who go deep into the realities of life, who immerse themselves among the masses, who maintain closed ties with the people, and who work hard. We should commend collectives and individuals who go down to the grass-roots units, who are honest in performing their duties, who observe laws and disciples, and who make outstanding contributions to the drive of reform, opening, and modernization.
