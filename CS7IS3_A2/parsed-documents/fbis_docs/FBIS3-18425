Why has it been so difficult? [Andreatta] These have been the first negotiations toward widening the European Union [EU] since Maastricht, and a group of countries, including Italy, wants to set very strict conditions -- that is to say, immediately bringing even new member countries in at the stage where Europe has no borders. [Tomassini] Turning to Austria, how and in what way is the entry of this country into the EU important for Italy? [Andreatta] For Italy it means truly implementing Maastricht. In effect, we only had free borders with France. A large part of our borders were still subject to the delays of frontier controls. Above all, politically speaking, Austria's membership, which we have strongly advocated, represents the opening of possibilities in a new and imminent cycle in which countries from central and eastern Europe join the Union. [Tomassini] Some people will certainly be thinking that an enlarged Europe is tantamount to a watered down Europe. Is there a real risk that some of the original spirit of the community will be lost? [Andreatta] Of course. Any institution which grows is subject to tensions, but it is also enriched. The culture of northern democracies will be a very important component in the future Europe. But I believe that this risk must be faced, because events which have happened since 1989 mean that if Europe wants a political role it must bring order to the process of developing democracies in the former socialist countries. This entails enlargement.
