He refused to specify the size of the debt. According to our source, however, who does not wish to be named but comes directly from the TA SR, this debt exceeds 18 million korunas. He says that the debt exists because the daily has not used any funds from the government subsidy for its operation. "Everybody reproaches us for publishing REPUBLIKA for government money, but it has financed itself," he emphasized. So far, however, circulation has not been large enough, he says, to cover all of the expenditure. As Kleiman also said, the TA SR management reached an agreement with certain entities to pay all of the outstanding debts by surrendering the REPUBLIKA banner and all concomitant rights. "They are prominent entities, with a certain political position on the Slovak political scene," he said. He categorically refused the idea that state treasury funds would be used to pay the debt. According to Jan Comaj, deputy chief editor of REPUBLIKA, the new publisher of the daily will be REPUBLIKA Ltd. Dusan Kleiman said that REPUBLIKA, which was supposed to be a news-oriented daily, has gradually become an opinion-forming popular daily, and, thereby, it transgressed the publisher's original concept. "We meant to make it into a newspaper version of CNN, but it ended the way it did," the TA SR director said.
