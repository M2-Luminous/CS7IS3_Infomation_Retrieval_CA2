He is the neoisolationist who in the 1992 U.S. presidential election fought former President Bush for nomination as the Republican Party's presidential candidate. Though a neoisolationist, he is not a lightweight who indulges in irresponsible flattery of the public. He is a political commentator who served as a special adviser to [former] President Nixon and as a presidential adviser to [former] President Ford and [former] President Reagan, and who sets forth vigorous arguments in newspapers and on television. Buchanan wrote an article in the 8 September 1991 edition of THE WASHINGTON POST about two and a half years ago and argued that "North Korea, which is openly trying to produce an atomic bomb is fearsome. But why is Kim Il-song's atomic bomb our problem, not that of the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, and Russia?" Since the range of the "Nodong-1" ground-to-ground missiles that North Korea possesses is 1,000 km, it is impossible for them to reach Hawaii. Why, in spite of this, must the United States alone worry about North Korean nuclear weapons? I feel as though the angry voice of Buchanan is carried to us that the Japanese must think this has nothing to do with them. In the same article Buchanan stated that "The United States should announce the date on which it will withdraw all U.S. ground units from the Republic of Korea. Why must young American men be the first to die in the event that North Korea attacks across the demilitarized zone?" and "The security treaty with Japan should be scrapped. If the relatively small countries of East Asia fear the hegemony of Japan and China and desire the presence of the U.S. Navy, they must pay the cost." Most Japanese probably feel strange when they hear this kind of statement because postwar Japan placed security, which is considered the first consideration for an ordinary country, completely in hands of the United States. Therefore, when there is an emergency on the Korean peninsula, most Japanese look on as idle spectators or make light of it, thinking that in the end the United States will probably do something. They firmly believe that since the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was concluded at the request of the United States, the United States would never broach the subject of scrapping it. And they are convinced that the reason Japan has been at peace is that it has a "peace constitution." They have frowned upon persons who say things contrary to this "common knowledge," thinking them to be hawks or right wing. But what would they do if they themselves were U.S. citizens? Would they try to shed their blood were there an emergency on the Korean peninsula? Should Japan face danger, would they rescue, by a war to the death, selfish Japanese who is carefree while entrusting the safety of their own country to the United States? Now that the Cold War is over, I think that what U.S. citizens really feel are reflected in what Buchanan says. Buchanan garnered 37 percent of the votes in the New Hampshire primary that was held on 18 February 1992. President Bush, the incumbent, got 53 percent. Then Prime Minister Miyazawa was asked his impression by the press corps and answered: "Somebody like Buchanan is probably big only in that place (New Hampshire)." Buchanan heard of this and it made him very angry. In the end Buchanan did not become the presidential candidate of the Republican Party, but I think we cannot simply overlook the isolationist trend or the inward-looking posture that is being born in the United States. The Isolationist Posture of "Postwar Generation" Clinton Then, what kind of posture does the Clinton administration have? I have observed the past five presidents: Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. It is impossible to unreasonably classify these administrations in a black or white manner as having been internationalist or isolationist, or "outward-looking" or "inward-looking," but I think that what the Clinton adminstration, which was born against the background of the end of the Cold War, aims at is very distinctive. First, Clinton is the first postwar-generation president who does not know what things were like before World War II. Second, it is necessary to remember that the reason the administration was born is found in the rebuilding of the domestic economy. Third, the cold treatment of Japan. Fourth, the patronage of Russia, particularly of President Yeltsin personally, to an extent which can be felt to be abnormal. From this my diagnosis is that the Clinton administration is clearly an "isolationist" administration and has begun to lose both the will and the ability to fulfill the role of policeman throughout the world. In other words, its orientation is the neoisolationist tendency which Buchanan advocates, so one can assume that it will do its utmost to avoid action that will shed the blood of young American men for the sake of Japan or the Korean peninsula. While he was the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Clinton made a speech at the Los Angeles conference on world problems on 13 August 1992: "In order to play a firm role in the new world, the United States must restore its economic strength." In concrete terms he said that it was encouragement of investment and strengthening of industry's international competitiveness. This basic view runs through his inaugural address, the "comprehensive economic policy" announced on 17 February 1993 after his inauguration, and his State of the Union Address read before a joint session of Congress on 25 January 1994. What the president stressed in the State of the Union Address was probably a request for the cooperation of Congress concerning job creation, universal national insurance, welfare reform, promotion of democracy, anticrime measures, and revitalization of U.S. communities, and making clear the attitude of stressing domestic affairs. In the small space which dealt with foreign affairs, only 10 percent of the entire State of the Union Address, where he advocated that the United States recover its leadership and support democratization, nothing differs from what had been said repeatedly up till now. Japan Does Not Notice "Change of Heart" of the United States When one gives it some thought, there is reason for the Clinton administration to become "isolationist," and something is the matter with those who say such things as that it were outrageous for the United States to abandon the position of world policeman. Are not Japanese the only ones who have not noticed that the world environment changed completely with the end of the Cold War? Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard University wrote an article titled "Why Is International Ascendancy Important?" in the Spring 1993 issue of INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, and heaped scathing criticism on Japan. In the article he listed existence of a common enemy, a relationship of common economic interests, and agreement of values as preconditions for an alliance. Economic friction between Japan and the United States has existed for some time, but it had only secondary importance when the common enemy of the "Soviet threat" existed before one's eyes. However, now that the "Soviet threat" has diminished, one should judge that Japan and the United States have entered an economic war. The common values of democracy and market economy that Japan and the United States hold will probably not disappear, but it is difficult to think that they will become the absolute condition for an alliance. It is necessary for Japan to become aware quickly that the content of the Japan-U.S. relationship has changed. The Clinton administration fixed its eyes on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and in November 1993 held an APEC summit conference in Seattle. President Clinton, who made a speech at the conference, declared openly that "The United States has no intention of continuing to bear the heavy burden of its military presence and regional leadership in Asia if denied the benefit of growth which produces stability." If told frankly that the United States participates in APEC because it can gain economic benefit, and that without such benefit, it will not shoulder unnecessary responsibility in the region, people who cannot free themselves from old stereotyped thinking will probably be shocked. But if Japan tries standing in the U.S. position, it is a very natural statement. If I were President Clinton, I would probably just roar at a country that was shocked by this: "Don't act like a baby!" In the Gulf war Japan paid $13 billion and left the dangerous, dirty, and difficult international job to 29 countries, including the United States. Therefore, in the event that an emergency should occur on the Korean peninsula, it would have neither qualification nor grounds for rebuttal if it were informed by President Clinton that "we will leave the dangerous work to Japan and will shoulder only a suitable amount of money." It is merely a matter of Japan being convinced arbitrarily that, although the Cold War has ended, since the United States is still the leading country in the world, in an emergency on the Korean peninsula it has a "duty" or a "responsibility" to control it. At the beginning of last January an agreement was reached at U.S.-North Korean working-level talks. But why didn't the U.S. side insist strongly on a special inspection of the two unreported nuclear waste storage facilities in the vicinity of Yongbyon? The 7 January issue of THE WASHINGTON POST criticized the negotiation method and rapped "virtual unconditional surrender of the United States," but from the very beginning the Clinton administration has been timid, not wanting to make a dangerous gamble on the Korean peninsula. Notwithstanding that even the WASHINGTON POST would criticize that "the Clinton administration's adventurism is dangerous," should it reject North Korea's demands and plunge into an all-out showdown. Congressional criticism of the Clinton administration's measures toward Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti was always "refrain from going too far." When President Clinton met with President Yeltsin in Vancouver in April 1993 he advised the Russian leader, who was about to visit Japan, "when Japanese say yes it means no." President Yeltsin wrote this down in a note, but forgot to take the note with him when he left the site of the meeting. In spite of the fact that Russia's reform policy line has to be revised and that the extreme right has risen in Zhirinovskiy, it is said that President Clinton, who visited Moscow in mid-January, was in high spirits at a dinner party held at President Yeltsin's villa and played his saxophone. One wonders would President Clinton ever perform "Summertime" and "My Funny Valentine" at Prime Minister Hosokawa's villa in Karuizawa? Presidential Assistant W. Anthony Lake (in charge of national security) announced last September that the United States would change the Cold War era strategy of "containment," and adopt a "strategy of expansion" which enlarged the group of nations with democratic government and market economies. That will do for an ideal, but does the United States have the strength to support it? It is uncertain whether public opinion will emerge which demands that at times the blood of young American men should be shed in order to advance a "strategy of expansion." If the "isolationist" posture is continued into the 21st century, the U.S. military presence in Asia may end. Japan is not even mentally prepared to deal with that.
