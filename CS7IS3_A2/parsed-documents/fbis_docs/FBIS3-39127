Eight months after his denunciation of a "Social Munich" and his call for a "cultural revolution" in order to combat unemployment, the president of the National Assembly yesterday issued a new warning to the government of Edouard Balladur. "The fight against unemployment must now carry the same weight as -- if not more weight than -- the defense of monetary parities in the fundamental budget choices," he stated at a colloquium on budgetary policy organized by the Government Audit Office. For Philippe Seguin the fight against unemployment is "the necessary precondition not only for economic growth but also for stabilizing the state budget." The fight against unemployment "must lie upstream of the budgetary procedure," because "a formidable recessionary spiral has set in whereby unemployment and social exclusion increase government expenditure while limiting income," the RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy explained. He also made a series of proposals for better parliamentary control of public finances, suggesting in particular that the country's social budget should be submitted to the deputies and senators every year. He invited Pierre Joxe, the president of the Audit Office, to submit his report on the budget implementation to the National Assembly. Budgetary policy, after having been ousted by liberal and monetarist ideology in the eighties, seems to be the subject of renewed interest, believes Jacques Spindler, professor of economics. But the margins for maneuver are limited. The growing interdependence of economies prevents -- or in any event severely limits -- any budgetary stimulation of the economy at national level. This is why the OFCE [French Economic Observatory] is calling for a policy of recovery at European level coupled with a sharp fall in interest rates. The use of budgetary policy as an instrument of economic policy suffers from a number of limitations. Firstly, there is "great uncertainty on the economic diagnosis itself," stressed Jean-Luc Pain, assistant director at the budget office. The true situation is only known later, and the decisionmakers only have fragmented information on the exact causes of the recession. There is also the lack of budget flexibility. Budget margins have been reduced and most European countries are committed to policies designed to cut public expenditure. The erosion of the debt level due to growth rates above interest rates no longer works. "The snowball effect which affects the public debt has a supplanting effect even within the budget," stresses Gilbert Venet, assistant director at the economic forecast office. Interest payments on the debt (15 percent of government expenditure) are thus made at the expense of other expenditure. Michel Delebarre, a former minister, has also called for a review of the procedures for debating the budget in Parliament and a clarification of budget orientations. "Does allowing every minister to defend the funds of his ministry really help to achieve a coherent budget?" he wondered.
