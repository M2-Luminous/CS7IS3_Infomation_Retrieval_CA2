He praised the Egyptian leaders' efforts to help achieve this progress. At a news conference this afternoon, Dr. Sha'th said both sides are doing their best to reach an agreement and that the Israeli delegation will for the first time remain in Cairo over the weekend. Dr. Sha'th said that the only topics officially deferred to the meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are the size of the Jericho area and the Palestinian presence on the Allenby Bridge. If any other problems remain, they will be automatically deferred to them. Dr. Sha'th said the negotiators will continue their talks until a final agreement is signed. He explained that the date of the signing of the agreement will not be set until official invitations are sent for the attendance of the signing ceremony. Dr. Sha'th said we are moving quickly and it is very difficult for us to evaluate what we have achieved so far. Asked whether an agreement has been reached on the issue of legal jurisdiction, Dr. Sha'th said this point is still under discussion. He indicated that today's talks did not encounter any major problems. They dealt with the transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinian civilian authority. He noted that these points were agreed on before but that they are being incorporated into one document. He added that there has been progress made on the issue of detainees. Asked whether the Palestinian and Israeli delegations will defer the issue of legal jurisdiction to the 'Arafat-Peres meeting, Dr. Sha'th said we are trying not to leave out any point we can discuss. We are trying to spare 'Arafat and Peres the effort. He added that the timetable being prepared now is measured in days and not weeks. Dr. Sha'th said he met with Israeli Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni, who promised to help speed up the negotiating process, especially on the issuance of Palestinian stamps, which is a point of disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.
