Therefore the question of the new labor compensation has become no less crucial for the "State Duma boys" than the question of their rights and authority. It was decided by a majority of votes to make deputy's salaries equal to minister's salaries. But as it turned out not all of the voters knew how much a minister makes. In order to reveal the secret the speaker had to invite Ye. Gaydar to the podium. And when the speaker gave the figure of 157,000 rubles [R] certain deputies "got out their calculators" and decided to make adjustments. N. Parinov suggested making the salary of a deputy equal to two ministerial salaries, and A. Volkov evaluated the monthly work of a deputy at $3,000 (and that is about R5 million today). But modesty still won out. After all, increments still have to be added to that salary: 50 percent--for the special nature and intensiveness of labor and 40 percent...for length of service. (Although deputies of the first convocation were elected for only two years.) In general the labor compensation for a deputy at first will be almost R300,000. If parliamentary correspondents had had the right to vote at meetings of the State Duma I would have suggested 1.5 ministerial salaries because the less a bureaucrat makes the more inclined he is to take bribes. It was decided that each deputy would receive the same amount (with the exception of the speaker; he is to receive 40 percent more). And this being the case, the deputies cannot take their eyes off the fact that A. Chubays, A. Zaveryukha, E. Pamfilova, S. Shakhray, A. Shokhin, V. Danilov-Danilyan, and Yu. Kalmykov hold two seats at the same time: in the State Duma and in the Government. And, in keeping with the proclaimed equality (monetary), they handed down a "sentence" for the government minority: "Work in the Government of Russia shall be carried out on a nonreimbursable (unpaid) basis." After the question of the deputies' credentials, which give them the right to immediate reception by leaders and other officials of organs of state power and local self-government and the question of the diplomatic passport, and after the solution to the money problem, naturally, there arose the question of office and dwelling space. According to the "Temporary Provisions" adopted by the State Duma on supporting the activity of deputies, each one is granted office space, and for those who have become "legal indigents"--dwelling space with furniture and a telephone although, true, without the right to privatize it. For now the people from out of town have moved into hotels. All costs and also the cost of the travel of the deputy and his family to the capital are at state expense. In Moscow and Moscow Oblast the people's elect will travel on official transportation assigned to them personally, and in the outlying areas they will be given automotive transportation of the local administration, and in public transportation the deputy will arrange for his own travel using his credentials. Medical treatment of the deputy shall be provided at the government level. Vacations last 48 working days. A deputy of the State Duma must be given all kinds of assistance in the local areas. In order to carry out his tasks successfully he may appoint up to five assistants and, naturally, they will not work for free (for five subordinates there will be two "State Duma" wages). Before working in parliament even two weeks the deputies added to the "Temporary Provisions" a point about the termination of their authority. Upon termination of his authority the deputy shall move at state expense to the region (where he came from) and must receive work equal to his previous work. Following the logic of the temporary document, it would be possible for S. Shakhray and A. Shokhin upon termination of their deputy authority to return to their previous posts which have already been eliminated today--posts of deputy prime ministers. But the fate of the "Temporary Provisions" which give the aforementioned benefits will depend on the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation.
