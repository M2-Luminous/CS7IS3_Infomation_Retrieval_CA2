All efforts to solve high unemployment must focus on structural changes, "since, even after the solution of the economic problems, unemployment will remain," albeit at a lower level. This was stated by Rexrodt on Monday [14 March] before the beginning of the first employment conference of the seven major industrialized nations (G-7) in Detroit, Michigan. Only "a steady economic policy," which is aimed at improving the conditions for competition, easing the cost burden on the enterprises, more flexibility on the labor market, and further privatization, can create "larger room for creating new jobs," Finance Minister Theo Waigel, of the Christian Social Union, said. The two-day G-7 conference, which will be attended by Germany, the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Canada, was to be opened at noon (local time) by U.S. President Clinton. [passage omitted] During a breakfast with President Clinton and the labor, economic, and finance ministers of the G-7, Waigel emphasized that the world could not expect any "patent prescriptions" from the conference. "The alarming situation on the labor market" is a worldwide, and especially a European problem and it is "the result of technological developments, structural inflexibility, and the revolutionary changes in connection with the lifting of the Iron Curtain." Solutions can, therefore, not be achieved in the short term, Waigel concluded.
