The Papa Egoro Movement bases its political independence on what it considers the crisis in which the country finds itself and which has been generated, in its opinion, by the attitude of the traditional parties that have governed Panama. Raul Leis, secretary general of the movement, maintains that they respect the initiative of some political parties to seek unity. [Begin Leis recording] We must greet that type of initiative, rather than attack it. We must greet it with respect. It is a democratic, free initiative of the parties. Sincerely, however, we see it as having a very fragile basis, because it is not based on a specific government platform or on a genuine effort at rapprochement, but is rather an anti-effort, a position against another party. The Papa Egoro Movement has always had a position that is not anti anything, but rather a pro-Panama position. [end recording] Leis ruled out the possibility that the Papa Egoro Movement's position is directed at favoring the PRD, because there is no connection between the two parties. During the news conference, Mariela Arce announced the holding of an event as homage to mother earth, which has been organized by the Papa Egoro Movement for this coming Saturday, 23 April, in Parque Urraca beginning at 1400. This event anticipates the participation of a large number of national groups that will participate with presidential candidate Ruben Blades and his orchestra as well as his government team.
