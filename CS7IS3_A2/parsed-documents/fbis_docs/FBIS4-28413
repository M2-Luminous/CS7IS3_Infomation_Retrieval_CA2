FBIS4-28413 "dreas112_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea Yi In-mo Sends Letters to ROK Prisoners Yi In-mo Sends Letters to ROK Prisoners SK0806000894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1530 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0806000894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army who returned to the socialist homeland on March 19 last year and is now widely known as the incarnation of faith and will, sent letters on June 7 to Kim In- so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea. In the letter to Kim In-so he says he feels aggrieved at the thought of Kim, a septuagenarian who has got a chronic disease during his nearly 34 years of prison life and is now working lonely with a colleague at a desolate quarry in South Korea without flesh and blood. He writes that respected General Kim Chong-il shows deep concern for unconverted long-term prisoners like Kim In-so and is making every effort to fetch them to the North so that they may recover their health and live in happiness with their families for the rest of their life. "The South Korean authorities say that you "have got citizenship", but this is a mere excuse for refusing to repatriate you," the letter says, and expresses the belief that he will daringly wage a struggle for his repatriation as fierce as his struggle for existence and thus bring earlier the day of reunion. In the letter to Ham Se-hwan, Yi recalls that Ham was really concerned for him when he was in the South. Noting that the DPRK is making every possible effort for an early repatriation of Ham Se-hwan, an ailing old man subjected to a hard life in an alien place, to his hometown where his sister and relatives live, the letter asks ham to fight for his repatriation to the North with confidence, for the day of their reunion in Pyongyang.
