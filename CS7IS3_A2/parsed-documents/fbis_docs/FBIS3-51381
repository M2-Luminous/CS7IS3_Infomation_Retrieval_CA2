The sources minimized the importance of the sanction that will end on 17 January. A military source said Mermot "has the command channels open" and he, therefore, continues "commanding the division." The source said Mermot is a member of the Supreme Tribunal on Promotions and Resources, adding that for the past 30 days he has been working at Army Command headquarters, where he currently is serving his strict arrest. "The sanction of strict arrest is continuous for a period. Then we have, according to the characteristics of the violation, suspensions, reassignments, reassignment suspensions, and trial by military justice," the source said. Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, said Gen. Mermot's sanction is an Army "internal and administrative issue." A military source added: "The fact that a general has been sanctioned does not mean it did not happen before or that it will not happen again."
