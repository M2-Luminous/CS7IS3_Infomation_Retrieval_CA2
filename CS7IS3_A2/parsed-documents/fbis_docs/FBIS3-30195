The national door must be opened even wider when market-oriented production is the common trend in the world. In this trend, the thought of producing everything for our consumption is not beneficial. [passage omitted] How can we change social production to a social possession form? Historical reality shows that it is a natural development process of the production force. Only the strong development of the production force can create the absolutely necessary requisite conditions for socialism. Marx said poverty will be common if these requisite conditions do not exist. Deprivation will exist and the need to fight for necessary materials will return. People will plunge into their old garbage dump. Our country is transitioning to socialism without a capitalist regime. It means that we do not have enough of those absolutely necessary requisite conditions. These conditions must be understood in light of the background that the world is entering its third millennium. We must open our door because of that very basic reason. Determination, even iron-like determination, is not enough to build the necessary material requisite conditions. Worse still, it is too little. Together with that iron-like determination, we must have giant material establishments, hundreds of billions of dollars in capital, and modern techniques and technologies. Otherwise, economic lagging will be certain. We must also have a broad external market and socioeconomic management knowledge that is suitable to civilization. But these are things that our country is severely deprived of at the moment. And the opening of the door is mainly to reduce deprivation or, as Lenin said, it is a method to seek the contribution of external hands to our undertaking. But will we be able to implement our intention? The historical reality and results of years of renovation have given us an affirmative answer. During the Leninist era, while Russia was in the aiming sight of imperialism, there were people entering the country, not from their charity, but from their greed. Today, according to the French Communist Party's judgment, imperialism is still an economic and political imperialism. Moreover, it is also a justice imperialism, as remarked by Ramsay Clark, former U.S. attorney general. [passage omitted] A special character of our living at this time is the world economic race in the background of competition and cooperation on the basis of mutual existence. This background, together with challenges, is creating favorable opportunities for us. The increasing dependence among different nations means that we need them, but that they need us as well. Therefore, opening the door is necessary and possible. But how to open so the owner is not blown away by hurricanes and the house does not become a hut in the wilderness? What can we do so that we do not lose ourselves? That is where the key issue rests. Can we manage in a way such that only we receive the benefits? Lenin denounced this idea by saying that whoever wants to sign a land lease agreement on the basis of communist principles should be put in a mental hospital. According to a review of the Committee for International Processing Zones, good processing zones must have favorable labor conditions such as low wages, good workers, and concessional taxes. In conclusion, both economic and political benefits must be favorable. And this should be made clear. Even former U.S. President Richard Nixon, in his strategy to destroy the USSR, said clearly in 1988 that the requisite for material aid and its use was aimed at provoking the fight for national rights in the USSR; if the devil of self-esteem and national hatred was aroused, the door for peaceful evolution would be widely open. Everybody must seek their own benefit. Therefore, the dominating principle is bilateral benefit. There can be winners and losers when the door is already open. The important thing is that we have to realize the changelessness and the content and limit of the benefit upon which the two sides have agreed. We need to have a clear concept of our benefit, realizing temporary and long-term benefits and fundamental and secondary benefits. The fundamental and long-term benefit to our country is that we have to develop our production force at all means to build socialism. That means that we cannot fall on the concept of one-sided economy and one-sided marketing. Every economic development step must be a better step for the implementation of social fairness to strengthen economic independence and social stabilization. [passage omitted] Under present conditions where our country is adopting a market-oriented economy and an open-door policy, the legislative system must create a safe corridor of laws for various trade activities to create a favorable and safe environment for foreign investment in Vietnam and to maintain order in economic management. It is necessary to make extensive use of principles in civil laws by harmoniously combining the long-lasting character of principles with necessary institutional renovation to suit changes in economic relations and to ensure the feasibility of projects, and so forth. [passage omitted] We need laws and also economic strength to protect ourselves. We must create economic spearheads in the context of interdependence and in the internationalization of production. Although we need the assistance of other countries, we should not allow ourselves to be viewed as less important by them because this will make it impossible for us to avoid being dependent on the outside. The self-governing character in the open-door period must also be guaranteed for various substantive issues. In his time, Lenin came up with many specific stipulations such as on the question of land lease; on how to improve the livelihood of workers; restore and develop the working class, market products, and fix sale prices; on conditions for hiring local and foreign workers and for ensuring their material life and payment; on whether local specialists could be allowed to work for foreign countries; on regulations governing scientific and technical activities and trade union organizations, and the like. Although there are many other specific matters to be taken into account, the quality and abilities of the persons involved in this field of activity are, after all, deciding factors. This is because political incapability and ignorance will be reasons for failure. As the country is just opening its door, so many noteworthy incidents have occurred. Price bargaining is a fact of life. But if workers of certain factories place their boss above all, if both the host and guests collude with one another in turning their joint venture into a site to consume obsolete machinery and equipment and unsalable goods of other countries for the purpose of tax evasion and tax fraud, if 70 percent of the total machinery imports are the kind that need to be thrown into a junk yard as cited in NHAN DAN, we hardly will be able to protect ourselves from succumbing to the influx of foreign money and goods.
