Speaking at the 31st Conference on Security Policy in Munich, Perry stressed, however, that the United States would by no means take such steps unilaterally, because 28,000 lightly armed UN soldiers stationed in Bosnia, who had been made available by its allies, were surrounded by 200,000 "highly armed combatants." NATO had the capacity to carry out such air strikes, Perry underlined. It would be possible to begin such a strike only an hour after the command was given, because all the means necessary to do so had been deployed. Consideration would still have to be paid to the probable political consequences of such an attack. Thought must be given not just to the first act, but also to whom would play the second and third acts and end the drama, Perry said. Perry said another available option was to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia. On the other hand, he ruled out a military enforcement of a peace solution in Bosnia. Perry also rejected the view that NATO and the United States were inactive. The provision of supplies from the air alone had assumed dimensions which were comparable to the Berlin airlift.
