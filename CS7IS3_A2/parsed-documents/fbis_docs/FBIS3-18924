He nevertheless said the solution of "partial membership" would be more realistic for his country because complete adherence to the Union's economic pillar (the first) would involve "costs and delays." In contrast, he hopes Poland can be integrated into the two other pillars (CFSP [Common Foreign Security Policy] and Home Affairs) as soon as possible so as to "prepare for subsequent full membership." At a restricted press conference the day after the first session of the EC/Poland Association Council, Mr. Olechowski underscored the favourable and rapid development of the country's main economic indicators, which today makes it possible for Poland to envisage "giving tangible form to its desire for membership in the European Union." Following a period of recession, the Polish economy registered growth of 4.5 percent in 1993, i.e. the highest in Europe (East and West alike), due to growth in the industrial sector (7 percent to 10 percent) which is itself based on a sharp rise in productivity. Poland has also managed to slash inflation from 600 percent in 1990 to 30 percent. The country has some two million private companies and 60 percent of the workforce is employed in the private sector. The most striking development may be the shrinking of the public sector, which provided the earnings of 60 percent of Polish households two years ago, compared to only 35 percent today, he noted. Political developments are also encouraging. Mr. Olechowski said that Poland's democratic institutions are "surprisingly mature." These promising signs make it possible for Poland to aspire to "political membership" enabling it to participate in the development of the common foreign and security policy and intergovernmental cooperation in home and justice affairs. "This would certainly be a much more convincing and effective solution than, for example, a partnership or another form of relations," he told the Association Council. With respect to the Union's economic sphere, Mr. Olechowski said that "waiting periods and derogations" would be necessary, in particular for the integration of Polish agriculture and participation in EMU [European Monetary Union]. Regarding agriculture, he recalled that this sector still employs 25 percent of the workforce in Poland, adding that a reduction in terms of jobs and, in general, an "adjustment" would have to be undertaken in the long term. In these circumstances, full membership seems "impossible" and partial membership "interesting." For Mr. Olechowski, it would be preferable to set a timetable with objectives and deadlines at the earliest opportunity so as to more clearly target the adjustments required, "giving a sense of commitment" and "conferring credibility to our objective of full membership. Partial membership would be the proof that the wider Europe is not a pure figment of the imagination but a project already underway," he added. The minister commented that Poland could promote this approach beginning in the latter half of this year, when Germany takes over the rotating Presidency of the Council of the Union. In his view, this Presidency will be "particularly open to the questions raised by its neighbours." Mr. Olechowski regretted that the Czech Republic and Slovakia cannot join in the membership movement launched by their Visegrad Group partners. The minister was to meet NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner later on Tuesday [8 March], along with the President of the Western European Union [WEU] Jacques Poos and its Secretary General Wim Eekelen. Membership in the WEU must also be considered an integral part of the process of Poland's integration into the European Union.
