SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final rule published on September 1, 1987 (52 FR 32992) set forth the basic procedures used under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. This was subsequently amended by final rules published August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33461), October 21, 1988 (53 FR 41331), December 16, 1988 (53 FR 50515), May 30, 1990 (55 FR 21863), and October 22, 1990 (55 FR 42560). An explicit tenet of these final rules, and one based on the statute authorizing use of DRGs by CHAMPUS, is that the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS), and that, whenever practicable, the CHAMPUS system will follow the same rules that apply to the Medicare PPS. HCFA publishes these changes annually in the Federal Register and discusses in detail the impact of the changes. In addition, this notice updates the rates and weights in accordance with our previous final rules. The actual changes we are making, along with a description of their relationship to the Medicare PPS, are detailed below. I. Medicare PPS Changes Which Affect the CHAMPUS DRG-Based Payment System Following is a discussion of the changes the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has made to the Medicare PPS which affect the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. A. DRG Classifications Under both the Medicare PPS and the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, cases are classified into the appropriate DRG by a Grouper program. The Grouper classifies each case into a DRG on the basis of the diagnosis and procedure codes and demographic information (that is, sex, age, and discharge status). The Grouper used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is the same as the current Medicare Grouper with two modifications. The CHAMPUS system has replaced Medicare DRG 435 with two age-based DRGs (900 and 901), and we have implemented thirty-four (34) neonatal DRGs in place of Medicare DRGs 385 through 390. Grouping for all other DRGs under the CHAMPUS system is identical to the Medicare PPS. For FY 1995, HCFA will implement a number of changes in major diagnostic categories (MDCs), revisions to secondary and major problems lists and surgical hierarchies to improve DRG classifications based on resource utilization. The CHAMPUS Grouper will incorporate all changes made to the Medicare Grouper. B. Wage Index and Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board Guidelines CHAMPUS will continue to use the same wage index amounts used for the Medicare PPS. In addition, CHAMPUS will duplicate all changes with regard to the wage index for specific hospitals which are redesignated by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. Consistent with HCFA, rural hospitals will receive the same payment rate as other urban hospitals. C. Hospital Market Basket We will update the adjusted standardized amounts according to the final updated hospital market basket used for the Medicare PPS according to HCFA's September 1 final rule. D. Outlier Payments
