All enterprises and organizations that go into the international market are obliged to submit information to the governor's office once each quarter on negotiations and agreements reached with foreign companies. According to the text of the directive, the necessity for such control is the result of "an increase in the extensiveness of export of raw materials without the creation of a basis for long-term economic activity of a majority of the participants in foreign economic relations and its negative influence on the formation of prices in the international market." In 1993, 380 enterprises and organizations were engaged in export-import operations on Sakhalin. The turnover totaled $390 million, given a prolonged balance of $90 million. Exporter accounts received $222.3 million; however, according to the estimates of authorities, the incomes could have been one and a half times higher. Poorly orienting themselves with respect to prices on the world market, the enterprises that got into it for the first time sometimes sold fish, biological resources, commercial timber, and saw timber at prices that were cheaper by a factor of two or more.
