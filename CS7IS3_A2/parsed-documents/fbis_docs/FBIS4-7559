"We would like to speed up economic transformation," he told reporters. "There are provisional governments which manage to do much more than those which have more time, because they have enough courage to take resolute steps," Moravcik said, adding that "it would be good if we could lay down irreversible elements for the future of Slovakia." The government's policy statement is to be discussed by Parliament on April 12. Moravcik confirmed his intention to secure a stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support Slovakia's payments balance. The IMF's condition for the loan is that Slovakia keep its budget deficit below the four percent mark. He denied speculations that his cabinet was preparing to devalue the Slovak currency. The government intends to gain additional budget revenue from privatization income and by fighting against tax and customs duty evasions, Moravcik said. Nevertheless, he said "certain restrictions will be necessary" and will have an effect on the social sphere. He indicated the possibility of cutting state subsidies and liberalizing prices to a greater extent, which, he said, should not affect the poorer strata of the population. Moravcik said the decision of the former Meciar cabinet to sell part of the shares of the steel producer Vychodoslovenske zieleziarne [East Slovak Iron Works] VSZ in Kosice to a private company, headed by ex-finance minister Julius Toth, for one-fifth of their nominal price was an example of the impoverishment of the state. "The (Meciar) cabinet actually decided to pour one billion crowns from the state into the private sphere for free," said Moravcik. He added that no offense had been committed from the legal point of view, but members of the former cabinet who approved of the sale ought to bear political responsibility. He said the possibility of canceling the transaction was being considered.
