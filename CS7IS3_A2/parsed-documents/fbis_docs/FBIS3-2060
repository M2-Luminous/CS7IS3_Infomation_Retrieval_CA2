Applications to open new air companies will be scrutinized strictly, according to sources with the CAAC. Import of new planes will be strictly controlled, according to the official, who added that investment will shifted to training and ground facilities. Sources quoted the unidentified official as saying at a working conference here that in the past few years business volume of the CAAC kept growing at 30 percent annually, a rare phenomenon in the development of international air companies. "It is not the will alone that decides what the development speed should be. Flight safety will certainly be endangered if we keep seeking quick results and work against the realizable possibilities," the official was quoted as saying. Previously there were six sub-administrative bureaus under the CAAC and ten flight fleets, which have by now been expanded into 33 air companies and 45 flight fleets, with 754 planes of all kinds. In 1986, total passenger seats in CAAC topped 15,400, with 288 domestic and international air routes and business amounting to 1.5 billion ton-kilometers, while in 1993 the seats increased to over 50,000, with 610 home and international air routes and business totalling 5.1 billion ton-kilometers.
