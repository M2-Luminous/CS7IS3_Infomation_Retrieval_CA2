High-ranking U.S. officials have arrived in Phnom Penh to consider military assistance to the two-headed government. 2. This is further irrefutable proof that the United States is interfering directly and deeply in the Cambodian issue. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has repeatedly exposed this interference, and the international community is well aware of the fact that the Western alliance headed by the United States has continued kindling the Hanoi Vietnamese war of aggression in Cambodia by relying on the communist Vietnamese forces and their Cambodian puppets. The military offensives against Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Anlung Veng, and Pailin provide clear proof. They have suffered repeated defeats in this war they have continued to kindle. Their forces are collapsing everywhere. In view of this situation, the Western allies, particularly the United States, have not sought an appropriate and peaceful solution that is beneficial to all sides for the Cambodian people [words indistinct]. They have resorted to every means to continue the war through to the end. 3. Military assistance from the United States and Western powers will hamper the Cambodian king's roundtable before it is even held. 4. Despite the announcement and appeal for military aid for the two-headed government made by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and Winston Lord, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, ministers from the ASEAN countries and other peace-loving countries in the region and around the world have vehemently opposed such aid. They have demanded national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia in order to end the Cambodian problem permanently. But the United States has stubbornly sent its high-ranking officials to Phnom Penh to discuss the aid issue. This constitutes shameless and arrogant contempt for the Cambodian people and the entire international community. The PDK, National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], and Cambodian nation and people most vehemently condemn the United States and Western allies providing military aid to the two-headed government. This aid will only kindle the communist Vietnamese war of aggression even more vigorously. The Cambodian nation and people do not want this war. The entire world has already said that the tragedy in Cambodia began after the United States interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs in 1970 and the communist Vietnamese kindled the war to massacre the Cambodian people at the end of 1978. Therefore, the United States should stop interfering in Cambodian affairs. The Cambodian nation and people and the NADK will continue to fight resolutely against all of the enemy's maneuvers -- whether military or political -- until eternal peace and national reconciliation is achieved for the beloved motherland.
