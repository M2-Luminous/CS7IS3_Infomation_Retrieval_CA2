According to a ceremony for the establishment of the China Container Industry Association held here Thursday [14 April], China can now turn out 250,000 standard containers a year, making it the biggest producer in this field. But, sources said, sales of containers and technology for making the containers has fallen behind production, and the management of the container industry is inefficient.

It will collect and transmit information about container production and sales, and new technology so as to promote fair competition, improve quality, and enhance cooperation in design, manufacture and quality control.
