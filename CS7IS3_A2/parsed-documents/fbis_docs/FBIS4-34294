Meanwhile, student protests against the government continue. Orlando Hernandez, chief of the Metropolitan Police (PM), told the press his men had also found enough fuel and containers to make an additional 50 Molotov cocktails. The materials were found at Andres Eloy Blanco High School. Student demonstrations worsened in the last few hours, in protest of the repression against student activities, the high cost of living, the plans to increase fares for urban transportation, and the government's poor handling of the banking crisis. Hundreds of depositors of the eight banks in which the government intervened yesterday gathered outside the head offices of these institutions in an attempt to pressure the government into allowing them to withdraw their money. The government will administrate the funds of the eight intervened banks. Depositors will be allowed to have access to only a portion of their money. A group of students from a high school in the western section of Caracas hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at riot police, who responded with tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Two policemen were injured in the clashes and taken to nearby hospitals. In other cities around the country, such as Maracaibo, Barquisimeto, and Valencia, protests continued for a third consecutive day. In light of this, the National Guard has moved in. Local news media have reported 100 peasants were arrested in the town of Turen, 400 km from Caracas, after staging demonstrations to protest high prices and looting several stores. Defense Minister Rafael Montero has accused Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias (who led the February 1992 coup attempt) of being one of the instigators of the recent wave of protests the country has experienced.
