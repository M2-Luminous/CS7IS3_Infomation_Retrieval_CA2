FBIS4-8773 "dreeu074_i_94046" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Events in Gorazde -- 18 April Events in Gorazde -- 18 April Gorazde `Condemned to Death' by UN AU1804160894 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1500 GMT 18 Apr 94 AU1804160894 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Excerpt] In the organization of the Ministry for Information, a Sarajevo-Gorazde radio bridge was established today for domestic and foreign reporters. Mediha Colo has compiled a report based on the information collected this way. [Colo] The reporters were acquainted with the situation in Gorazde this afternoon by Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the Gorazde assembly: [Ohranovic] Gorazde is going through the worst day since the offensive started. The town is disappearing from the face of the earth. I have no words to describe what is happening here today. It is impossible to reach the killed and the wounded, so we are unable to give the exact number. The Gorazde citizens that are still alive are wondering whether they have been condemned to death by the international community. One of the facts that speak to that effect is that General Rose's monitors have fled Gorazde without our knowledge. I believe that this fact confirms the full ruthlessness of the international community. [Colo] The foreign reporters insisted on speaking with one of the representatives of the international institutions that have remained in Gorazde, but Esad Ohranovic said: [Ohranovic] They do not want to speak to reporters or the international community. They told us that they were forbidden to do so. [Colo] One of the reporters' questions referred to today's situation in the Gorazde war hospital. [Ohranovic] The hospital is being shelled at the moment from three directions, so one cannot really count the number of shells landing on the hospital. All the surrounding buildings, residential areas are on fire. This must be the worst day from the beginning of the offensive. One can no longer count the number of shells landing. [Colo] The tanks are in the town, Mr. Ohranovic said. Asked how many there were, he said: [Ohranovic] It is hard to say, but there are somewhere between 20 to 40 tanks, it depends on the shelling of the town. [Colo] How far away are they from the center? [Ohranovic] Depends, from 500 to 600 meters. [Colo] We know you have been unable to tell us so far, but can you say now where the front line is? [Ohranovic] It is in the town itself. From the direction of Ustipraca, that is some 100 meters from the petrol station, and [words indistinct] from the hospital, and on the right side -- you probably know Gorazde -- in the direction of Cajnice, that is around the bus station.
