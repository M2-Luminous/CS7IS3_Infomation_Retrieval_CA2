On behalf of the party Central Committee, State Council, and CMC I would like to warmly congratulate the comrades who have been promoted to the rank of general. The promotion of these comrades to the rank of general once again demonstrates the great importance placed by the party and state on army building, and reflects the CMC's great trust and deep concern. It is hoped the comrades who have been promoted in rank will highly cherish the great honor bestowed upon them by the party and people, recognize the heavy responsibility they are shouldering, do honor to their mission, justify the great trust placed in them, learn modestly, work hard, and make new contributions to strengthening our army's revolutionization, modernization, and regularization. Since the 14th National CPC Congress, the CMC has strengthened strategic guidance over national defense and army building; vigorously promoted our army's fine tradition; further intensified efforts to build up leadership bodies and cadre ranks; and carried out a variety of tasks related to military and political affairs, logistics, defense-related scientific research, equipment upgrading, and the buildup of reserve forces under the guiding principles of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas for army building during the new period. It has brought about new improvements in the army's rallying power and combat effectiveness, made substantial progress in army building, and successfully completed the various tasks assigned by the party and state. Our country's socialist modernization drive is currently in a crucial period. Seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability is in the general interest of party-wide work. Realizing and maintaining this general interest is inevitably required for upholding the party's basic line, with the goal of ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our national economy, as well as the all-around advancement and ultimate success of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The entire party and army, as well as people across the country, should conscientiously safeguard, defer to, and promote this general interest. During the entire modernization process, we must properly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability, making every effort to advance reform and development amid stability and to ensure long-term social stability through reform and development. A strong army and strong national defense always provide powerful support for reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as a reliable guarantee for consolidating state power, promoting social stability and economic development, and bringing the people peace. Comrades throughout the army should fully recognize the heavy responsibility shouldered by our army, defer to and serve the general interest of party-wide work in everything they do, prepare themselves for danger in times of peace, be always on the alert, make every effort to improve army building, and make even greater contributions to promoting reform and development, safeguarding the motherland's security and unity, and maintaining social stability and unity. Senior cadres in our army are the backbone of military administration. The party Central Committee and CMC's strategic intentions should first be carried out through senior cadres. Now the party Central Committee has laid down its major policies and principles, and the CMC has provided clear-cut work guidance, the important thing is to carry them out. Leading cadres at all levels must earnestly practice what they advocate. More important, senior cadres should pay close attention to political studies; heighten the concept of party spirit; resolutely follow the party's instructions; steadfastly implement the party's line, principles, and policies; firmly follow the party Central Committee and CMC's command; faithfully and assiduously work for the party and people with a keen sense of dedication and responsibility; and splendidly accomplish the chief mission assigned to them by history. As early as when the entire party shifted the focus of its work to socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping noted explicitly: "The entire party must learn anew." He said: "Our party, CPC members, and the Chinese people should always learn in the face of an endless stream of new problems." Because of the swift progress in our national construction and army building, new contradictions, problems, expertise, and experiences have come to the fore in an endless stream, and we should doubly stress learning, investigation, and study. With a clear theoretical understanding and a firm theoretical basis, we can implement the party's line, principles, and policies more conscientiously. For senior army cadres to intensify their learning and studies is not only important for their own progress and improvement but also for long-term army building. Keeping reality in mind, senior cadres throughout the army must conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as his ideas for army building during the new period. They should gain a profound understanding of the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; work hard to study and master the scientific world outlook and methodology on dialectical and historical materialism that pervade Comrade Xiaoping's works; and strive to inherit and improve upon Mao Zedong's military thought. They should pay attention to acquiring modern scientific and technological know-how, study strategies and tactics for waging a people's war in a high-technology setting, and master the skills of commanding modern warfare. Through learning, they should improve their theoretical knowledge of Marxism, strengthen their political conviction in socialism, conscientiously remold their world outlook, actively improve their leadership style and methods, and continue to improve their leadership standards and commanding skills. In short, every senior cadre should learn, and learn anew, in real earnest. We should take the lead in promoting an arduous pioneering spirit and the fine work style of maintaining close ties with the masses. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a completely new cause that has never been tried before. To put the state and army's great pioneering work into practice, it is imperative that we carry forward the tradition of Red Army veterans, promote the "five types of revolutionary spirit" [revolutionary and death-defying spirit; spirit of observing strict discipline and sacrificing oneself; spirit of selflessness and placing other people's interests above one's own; spirit of defeating all enemies and overcoming all difficulties; and spirit of scoring victory by maintaining revolutionary optimism and surmounting all difficulties -- from speech by Deng Xiaoping at a CPC Central Committee work conference on 25 December 1980] initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, always maintain our flesh-and-blood ties with people, and make concerted efforts to keep advancing our cause. Senior cadres throughout the army must always serve the people wholeheartedly, earnestly work for people's interests, wage arduous struggles, honestly perform their official duties, and take a modest, prudent, and realistic approach. They must project this good image when they appear before the broad ranks of cadres and fighters, and when they conduct themselves in society. This is a question of great importance to troop morale and the army's high prestige. They should keep in mind our army's character and goal at all times, not pursue personal fame and wealth, give no thought to personal gain or loss, and devote all their energy and attention to the party and army's cause. They should exercise their power correctly, readily accept supervision by party organizations and people, closely guard against the corrosion of debauchery, prevent the practice of trading power for money, and always maintain the sterling qualities of CPC members and revolutionary armymen. They should heed cadres and fighters' voices, keep people's well-being in mind despite their high positions, think of ways to solve the practical problems of grass-roots units, and stay in touch with people at all times. They should go deep into the realities of life, go down to grass-roots units, throw themselves into practical work, and guard against empty talk and formalism. Through the exemplary conduct of senior cadres, we should carry forward and improve upon our party and army's fine tradition and work style in the new situation. In building up leadership bodies, we should earnestly groom and select prominent young cadres who are both professionally competent and politically reliable, advance the cause of introducing younger leadership bodies, and place old, middle-aged, and young people in leadership positions in a step-by-step manner to facilitate the maturity of an endless stream of new people. This is an urgent task in army building. Senior cadres should bear the solemn responsibility for grooming and selecting prominent young cadres. The cadres we select must be true communists, show a spirit of dedication to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and be able to inherit the heroic spirit of veteran comrades in following the direction of revolutionary struggle. We should carry out education in this respect, impart our experiences, and help and set an example for new hands so that there will be no lack of successors to our cause, and so that our party and army's fine tradition will be passed from generation to generation. We should administer the army strictly. This is an important thought consistently emphasized by Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Strict military administration is not only an important principle governing army building but also an inevitable path for strengthening all facets of army building. Only strictness can guarantee discipline, orderliness, unity, and combat effectiveness. This people's army of ours has always been known for its close-knit organization and strict discipline. This is an important cause of our army's strong rallying power and combat effectiveness. To administer the army strictly, we should, first and foremost, adopt a strict approach toward senior cadres. Senior cadres should serve as models in following commands, in strictly observing discipline, and in rigorously enforcing rules and regulations. They should implement the policy decisions, decrees, and directives of the party Central Committee and CMC to the letter in order to ensure that government and military decrees will be relayed to relevant units without obstruction. They should enforce military discipline strictly, mete out rewards and punishment strictly and impartially, administer troops rigorously, and earnestly set standards for troop behavior in accordance with rules and regulations. They should improve troop education and training while bearing in mind the need for a high degree of difficulty, rigorousness, and actual combat. They should strengthen all aspects of army building at the grass-roots level and earnestly lay a solid foundation for troops in accordance with the demands of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level." They should make unremitting efforts to improve the army's work style and tighten troop discipline, strengthen regular ideological and administrative work, devote great efforts to improving the commanding skills of grass-roots cadres, and enhance unity between officers and men. They should further improve "double-support" work [support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs, support the government and cherish the people], actively launch activities to promote socialist spiritual civilization through joint army-civilian efforts, and enhance the army's unity with the government and people. Our army must maintain a good image in all sectors of society as reflected by its observance of disciplinary rules and laws, neat appearance, and strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. It should become an awe-inspiring and culturally advanced army which enjoys the people's love and esteem. Through rigorous training, strict administration, and in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work, we should maintain the high degree of stability and unified centralism in the army; truly achieve political soundness, military proficiency, a fine work style, strict discipline, and effective logistics support; and constantly improve combat effectiveness. Comrades: At present, the overall situation in our country is very good as far as reform, opening up, and modernization are concerned. We are full of confidence. At the same time, we should be aware that we will face a considerable number of new contradictions and problems in the course of progress, and we cannot afford to slacken our efforts in the slightest degree. We must redouble our efforts to convert the policy decisions of the party Central Committee and CMC into conscientious actions by officers and men throughout the army. The party and people have assigned the important task of commanding troops to our senior cadres at this historical moment. I believe that you will surely be able to shoulder this heavy historical responsibility; strive to make the country strong; keep blazing new trails and forging ahead; build the people's army under the party's absolute leadership into an even better one; and unflinchingly achieve the grand goal set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping of building a strong, modern, and regular revolutionary army.
