It has still to be learned which political parties and public associations have won the greater trust of the electorate and why, and which candidates did not get elected to parliament and for what reasons. But it may be said even today that Kazakhstanis link their hopes for a better life with the new parliament. His thoughts on the paths of development of sovereign Kazakhstan, the political situation, and the unfolding interethnic relations are shared today by People's Writer Olzhas Suleymenov, chairman of the People's Congress of Kazakhstan party. He was nominated for deputy of the Supreme Council on the official slate for Semipalatinsk Oblast and has, according to the preliminary data, been elected to the new parliament. [Ambartsumyan] Olzhas Omarovich, the first question is connected with the "comrade" form of address. As distinct from many other representatives of your party, you have retained it. [Suleymenov] It is what we acquired over many decades of dealings with one another. The word "comrade" retains a particle of the warmth of the soul of our fathers. And they are not to blame for the fact that our Great History of what is now the former Soviet Union bore within it the tragic element of the era of "victorious socialism." We must see realistically what has happened to us and draw certain conclusions for the future, not wasting our acquired values, but, on the contrary, multiplying them. Genuine innovation does not cancel out all traditions but implies the development of the best. We have been accustomed to beginning each new stage of history with a castigation of the past. This is why history as such has not been preserved in our consciousness. The "accursed past" the whole time. But there were in that past both joy and great discoveries also. And the main discovery, which has been called into question in recent years, unfortunately, is the friendship of the peoples. We should not give it away to anyone. To no independent orators and ranters, to no new careerist. Internationalism is for this reason the firm foundation of our party's political program. The vital need for such a foundation is all the more obvious now, when some multinational republics are before our eyes becoming tragically mononational. In international Kazakhstan, people have more things in common than they have differences. When I visit the Kazakh villages and see under what conditions people deprived of electricity, water, and telephones are dragging out a "survival" existence, it is clear that this problem will not be resolved by Kazakhs alone. The Russian-speaking population in the overpopulated industrial cities has its troubles also. The shortage of drinking water is growing in Mangistau Oblast, for example. Were the nuclear-powered desalination plant to be halted, the oblast would be left without water, heating, and light. And Mangistau means hundreds of thousands of people, oilfields, and a powerful industry. The main reason for the trouble is the exodus of specialists to Russia, to Ukraine. Why? Uncertainty as to the future. [Ambartsumyan] The period of formation of the sovereign state is complex and contradictory. We are now hearing the opinions of many people, political scientists included, concerning the possibility of the introduction of dual citizenship in the republic. [Suleymenov] The demand for second citizenship is the effect, and the cause is lack of confidence that the rights of certain categories of citizens in the republic will not be infringed. Language rights, primarily. If a person is persuaded that, on account of his ignorance of Kazakh, neither he nor his children have a future, he will, of course, look to where knowledge of Russian secures for him a normal life. The Constitution seemingly guarantees against persecution on a language basis, but in reality everything is far more complicated. And if in the name of the tranquillity of Kazakhstan and its 17 million citizens it is necessary to revise certain articles of the Constitution, this should, I believe, be done. The causes of a maturing conflict need to be removed. It is impossible to imagine that in Kazakhstan over 50 percent of the population will have other citizenship. This is like being on a passenger airliner. Half the people have parachutes and, should an accident occur, could save themselves, and the other half? It is rational and logical to have an airplane in a state of good repair and to improve its control in order that we might feel confident about the success of the flight. Then no one would require any parachute. I want the Kazakh land to live in peace, tranquillity, and satiety. The Kazakhs to feel dignified. The Russians to have a better life here than in Russia, Ukrainians, better than in Ukraine, the Germans, better than in Germany, and so forth. And then no one would want to leave us. People would be proud of their Kazakh citizenship. "We are the people of Kazakhstan"--this is the motto of our party. The Russian Kazakhstani has long been distinguished from the Russian. A different cast of consciousness. For example, my school comrade Aleksey Ugreninov, having married, left for Krasnodon. Six months later he wrote me a letter: "Before, when I lived in Kazakhstan, if I heard a dombra on the air, I would turn off the radio. Now, living in Krasnodon, hearing Kazakh music, I turn the volume up full and sit and weep. I greatly miss Kazakhstan, my homeland, where I was born and raised." [Ambartsumyan] You have already partially touched on a very serious, difficult question--the two official languages. [Suleymenov] We must be realists and recognize that the official language was for decades Russian. Kazakh--nominally the official language--is only just being pulled up to the level of Russian. And we know that there have been far from professional attempts to speed up this progress. But they have only discredited this mission itself. Thank God, the government has put right many zealous administrators, who had "endeavored" to translate clerical work into Kazakh immediately. And I saw how high-class doctors, totally at a loss, not knowing how to fill out the history of a disease in Kazakh, quit. Who suffered from this? Patients, the people. The process of the formation of a second official language is very long, delicate, and complex. It cannot be accomplished by some edict of rayon, city, oblast, or republic authorities. Our language, like many others also, was sacrificed to the idea of the communist society. It was said that in the future there would be no national differences. And our fathers and grandfathers believed this. And the peoples are not to blame for the fact that so pronounced a linguistic disproportion took shape over 70 and more years. And it cannot be eliminated in two or three years. For this reason we objectively have two official languages. One is traditional-official, the other is fledgling-official. If necessary, this should, I believe, be documented by the new parliament so that there should be no speculation or repressive measures and so that people who are the exponents of the Russian language should feel themselves to be full-blooded citizens of the republic and be at ease over their children's future. So that Kazakh should gain strength, ascend, and naturally penetrate all spheres. I have made my credo: "To elevate the steppe without belittling the mountains," my life's conviction. And only such a path of development of the Kazakh nation will be fruitful. [Ambartsumyan] You have advanced the slogan: "From age-old dependence through independence to a recognition of interdependence." Could you, perhaps, decode this? [Suleymenov] Last summer I proposed the incorporation in the program of our party, the NKK [People's Congress of Kazakhstan], the idea of a future confederation of the states of Eurasia. Its initial stage implies confederal relations between Kazakhstan and Russia. After this, I was rebuked in certain news media for not being a patriot of my country. But I love Kazakhstan, and I have no need to prove this, I think. The main token of the difficult period of disintegration of the USSR has been the steep fall in production, constituting 50 percent in some republics. The people are, consequently, becoming impoverished. We all feel and understand full well the need for the restoration of economic union, primarily with Russia, but within the framework of a confederal agreement. Sovereignty and independence here by no means imply one state's self-isolation from another. This is the same independence as that of the vivifying organs in each organism. All the best sober-minded forces of our republic, therefore, should be aspiring to the creation of an infrastructure of a future community of states that preserves the conditions for the full, free, and equal coexistence of sovereign countries in the example of the European economic confederation, which has already been created. There is no escaping the fact that Kazakhstan is economically dependent on Russia and that Russia depends to a large extent on Kazakhstan also. All the Urals foundries without exception are unable to cope without Sokolovskaya-Sarbay ore and without our nonferrous metals, and 92 percent of native chromium is mined on Aktyubinsk land. And without Kazakhstan chromium, there is no Russian alloyed steel. We will, therefore, make every effort to preserve the common economic space and raise it to the higher level of confederal union. [Ambartsumyan] But for this it is necessary to create the corresponding legislative base, which would enable the government to undertake important economic reforms. [Suleymenov] I hope that the newly elected professional parliament will be capable of tackling this problem. It is very important that society not split along national lines. The epidemic of national demarcation which has gripped certain republics of the former Union is penetrating Kazakhstan also. Unless we are able to resist this phenomenon, we will have no future. If, however, we recognize this danger in time and take the path of good sense and common sense, we can look forward to a splendid future. If we avail ourselves in proprietary and solicitous fashion of the powerful resource base of Kazakhstan and the strong personnel potential (and this means thousands of engineers, highly skilled workers, specialists of agriculture, and scientists), we can achieve a great deal. And our party, the People's Congress of Kazakhstan, offers such a program. [Ambartsumyan] Your party has a strong economic analysis group. Can we already speak of specific efforts to its credit? [Suleymenov] Yes, highly skilled economists, historians, political scientists, psychologists, entrepreneurs, and representatives of religious beliefs are members of this group. Our comrades carefully analyze the phenomena occurring in the life of the republic, make forecasts, and generate specific recommendations, which are subsequently used in various party programs. And some of them are being implemented already. Not many readers know, for example, that Kazakhstan wool was going begging and that thousands of tonnes of it had piled up at the warehouses. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, it had been used for sewing the greatcoats of men of the Soviet Army. Now everyone in any way connected with this production had been left without a crust. And here our economists and entrepreneurs drew up a special program for use of the wool and set up the Klem corporation for the manufacture of carpets and felt. Equipment is being purchased in Turkey, and it will be distributed in the villages among the seamstresses free of charge. Good-quality and inexpensive carpets made from Kazakhstan wool will be made at home. We are thinking of increasing their manufacture in the future to 1 million items a year. The problems of work for the women in the countryside are being resolved in this way to some extent. We would like to set up garment production at the home in the cities also. If the women receive all that they need, from the machines through the thread, there will be no need to build giant garment factories. But the people would obtain from the home workers, on the other hand, a particular quantity of high-quality merchandise produced on a competitive basis and under the aegis of this firm or the other. In the past year alone, funds of our entrepreneurs purchased an Italian baby food plant and four bakeries. One of them, in Pavlodar, is already producing fresh bread. The others are located in Semipalatinsk and West Kazakhstan oblasts. Medicines and 1,000 tonnes of baby food have been purchased for $1 million. Members of our party are channeling all this to needy people free of charge around the oblasts, in targeted fashion, down to the rayon component. [Ambartsumyan] The Nevada-Semipalatinsk international antinuclear movement, of which you are a founder and the permanent president, is five years old now. You write frequently in the press and speak on television on this subject. Nonetheless, what are your strongest impressions in connection with the minor anniversary of this movement? [Suleymenov] The most appalling thing was that the nuclear testing at the Semipalatinsk range was carried out in an atmosphere of eerie secrecy. Therefore, even the people living in this region did not know what was going on there. They were frightened when the earth shook beneath them (the force of the jolts reached 5) and were subjected to lethal radiation. How many persons departed life for this reason, no one knows. Two diagnoses--tuberculosis or brucellosis--were made of the deceased. And only when our movement appeared were we able to make contact with some documents of that time. Many people now know Karipbek Kuyukov of Semipalatinsk Oblast. He was born without arms, but became an artist. He draws with a brush and pencil clenched between his teeth. We went to Japan together and took part in protest demonstrations against the nuclear tests carried out in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I recall how he went into the square, where several thousand people were gathered, and said: "The gesture of our movement is an open palm, five continents against five test ranges. But I cannot make this gesture." And the whole square raised its hands with open palms. An unforgettable, stupendous feeling gripped all those present. I am grateful to and have profound respect for the parents of Karipbek Kuyukov. They raised him, feeling by the hour his and their own misfortune. What a great feat of mother and father! He is now nearly 30 years old. And he is telling people of the world what misfortune nuclear weapons bring. [Ambartsumyan] Concluding the interview, I have to ask you about your literary plans. Your numerous admirers want to see new poems and works. [Suleymenov] At this time the fate of literature does not excite me as much as the fate of my readers. We writers are going into politics not because we lack economists or because there is none beside us to uphold people's rights, but because we feel the need for personal, direct participation in the formation of our state. But I am working, nonetheless, and completing in draft form my new book, which will be entitled "One Thousand and One Words." I hope to be able to present it to my readers this year.
