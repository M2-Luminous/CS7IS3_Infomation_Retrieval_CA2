This is the message of a signed article by the China Center for International Studies carried in today's PEOPLE'S DAILY in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the proclamation of the five principles. It stresses that the five principles are still indispensable in preserving world peace and promoting development in the current multipolarized world, both politically and economically. The five principles, namely mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were jointly initiated by China, India and Myanmar [Burma] in late June 1954. The world of today, featured by the dismembering of the former Soviet Union and the relatively weakening of the United States, provides an excellent opportunity and extensive base for the implementation of the five principles, the article says. In this aspect, the imposing of ideology by any one country on another to the neglect of the sovereignty of independent states can no longer work, the article notes. The developed countries should provide more preferential conditions for the developing countries in the forms of economic aid, technical transfer and trade while thoroughly abandoning the practice of attaching political conditions while doing so. Thus, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and equality and mutual benefit are of conspicuous significance nowadays, the article says. Despite the end of the Cold War, the conflicts centering on sovereignty have become even more prominent, as the western countries are still trying to infringe on the sovereignty of the Third World countries and interfere in their internal affairs by advocating "human rights ahead of sovereignty" and "sovereignty is outmoded". The fact is that while chanting "sovereignty is out of date", some developed countries never bother to limit their own sovereignty, but rather to set barriers to other countries' efforts to protect their sovereignty. Only by upholding the five principles, the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs in particular, can the third world countries maintain their independence and develop their economies. The five principles have so far been well accepted by the world as the fundamental standards in handling not only bilateral but also multilateral relations among countries, the article says. In conclusion, the article says that in the present transition period from the old world pattern to a new one, adherence to the five principles will help solve the issues facing the world and establish a fair and reasonable new international order.
