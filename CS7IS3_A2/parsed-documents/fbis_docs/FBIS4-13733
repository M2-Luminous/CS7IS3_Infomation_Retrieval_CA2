Three years after the agreement for a referendum was reached at the United Nations, the Sahraoui organization highlights the Moroccan trick of carrying out the referendum with an electoral role twice as long as the one established by Spain. Over to our reporter Maria Jose Castejon: [Castejon] The hope for peace in the Western Sahara that began three years ago could well boil down to nothing. The former Spanish colony is once again threatened by war if the block on the self-determination referendum is not lifted within the next three months. In this race against the clock, a movement formed by European municipalities, parliamentarians, and other nongovernmental organizations, has held a conference in Madrid to raise awareness and to put pressure on the United Nations so that Morocco abandons its stubborn position that it has maintained over the last few years. One of the speakers, Odon Elorza, the mayor of San Sebastian, believes that the international community should be held responsible if war flares up again in the Sahara. [indistinct passage omitted] [Castejon] Mohamed Abelaziz, the president of the Sahara Arab Democratic Republic, who is also head of the Polisario, is at the conference. Despite the threat of war, he never stops talking about hope. Abelaziz has asked Spain to play a more active role because it is well aware of what is happening in the Western Sahara. He wants the electoral role drawn up by the Spaniards in 1974 to be respected. Its use as the basis for the referendum is the main claim of the Polisario. Abelaziz says that the UN secretary general's proposal to add to the electoral role is unacceptable because it would mean giving Morocco a free hand in turning the referendum into a joke by adding hundreds of thousands of voters who are not from the Sahara to the role.
