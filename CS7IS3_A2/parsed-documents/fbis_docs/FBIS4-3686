The meeting, covering a wide range of issues, proceeded in a practical and in-depth manner, according to a Chinese spokesman. Dzhumagulov said that Kyrgyzstan, which is carrying out economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening economic ties with China and to learning from its experience, especially in rural reform. He said that over 70 Sino-Kyrgyz joint ventures in food processing, leather making and other areas are operating smoothly. He added that the two sides are considering cooperation in public health, paper-making and other fields. Dzhumagulov hoped that the two countries will explore the vast potential existing for cooperation in energy, mining, agriculture, communications and transportation. He added that cooperation in these fields would not only be beneficial to the two countries, but would also have a positive impact on the economic prosperity of the region. Premier Li Peng said that the difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan are "only temporary, and through effort, will undoubtedly be overcome." Referring to the rapid growth of bilateral trade, Li said "potentials still exist" and that the Chinese Government, and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in particular, would strive to promote trade and economic cooperation with Kyrgyzstan. He said that "there has been already a good beginning." Li also said both sides need to create better conditions and strive to resolve problems hampering the development of trade and economic cooperation. Experts in the two countries should make in-depth studies of the large projects proposed by Prime Minister Dzhumagulov on cooperation in mining and hydro-power generation, Li said. The Chinese Government encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in the economic construction of Kyrgyzstan on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, he said. During the talks, Li invited Dzhumagulov to visit China when it is convenient for him, and the Kyrgyz premier accepted the invitation with pleasure.
