Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- J.L. Viljoen, South Africa's ambassador to the Republic of China [ROC], opened Taiwan voting in his country's first all-race elections when he cast his ballot at 7 a.m. All citizens and permanent residents of South Africa above the age of 18 residing or traveling here are eligible to vote at Taipei's polling station, Viljoen said. The polling station, located at the South African Embassy on Tinhua North Road, will remain open until 7 p.m. Tuesday [26 April], he added. Although a few hundred South Africans have already cast their ballots, the envoy said he did not know how many voters will turn out for the one-day vote. In order to ensure the poll's fairness, the South African government invited Chou Nien-tzu, a researcher at National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations, and Arlene Lang, a U.S. citizen, to act as observers at the Taipei polling station. All the ballot boxes will be sealed and transported back to South Africa via express delivery for vote counting, which will begin on April 29, Viljoen said. The South African polls, which will elect the president, National Assembly, nine governors, and nine regional assemblies, opened Tuesday morning and will continue through April 28.
