Highlighting the issues right from the start might not be good as it could relate to the position of a particular country, he added. The country may ask why should it attend the meeting if it were to be the subject of criticism ... Then it might lose interest, he told a press conference at the end of a two-day official visit to Singapore. The 18-member ARF created during the ASEAN ministerial meeting (AMM) here last year is scheduled to hold its first session in Bangkok in July. It is made up of ASEAN, its dialogue partners, and regional powers. I think the first forum should give opportunities for general discussion on the subject of confidence-building measures, said Abdullah who was here at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart, Prof. S. Jayakumar. But, certainly, we wouldn't want to stop anybody from raising questions which may be sensitive, he added, saying he did not rule out the probability. He said he did not think there would be difficulty in handling such issues because this is not going to be a meeting of strangers. Abdullah said the ARF was an important forum and, naturally, Malaysia wanted it to succeed.
