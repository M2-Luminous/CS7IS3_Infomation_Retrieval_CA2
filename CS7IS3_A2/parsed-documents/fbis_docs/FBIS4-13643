According to Shohat, the Palestinians presented new demands during this week's talks. He has informed chief Palestinian delegate Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] that these demands are unacceptable and that they are liable to result in a very serious crisis in the economic negotiations. Shohat asserted that the Palestinians want to expand the list of products whose customs Israel has consented to reduce. The original list has been doubled by the Palestinians, and it now includes goods to be imported from countries which do not trade with Israel, namely Arab countries. We cannot agree to such things, Shohat said; the import regime must be uniform. There is no telling whether the Israeli verbal escalation was designed to produce psychological pressure on the Palestinians. In any event, the negotiations will continue through the night. Tomorrow the finance minister will return to Israel to attend the 24 April cabinet meeting. He will fly back to Paris straight after the meeting. The Israeli delegation will stay in the French capital to continue the talks with the Palestinians.
