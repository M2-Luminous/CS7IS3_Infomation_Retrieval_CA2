Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-14JAN94-CHINA-FRANCE China-France-U.S. Beijing, Paris Restore Bilateral Ties In a move that could have serious implications for U.S. trade and economic relations with China, Beijing has announced the restoration of bilateral ties with France. Relations between Beijing and Paris had soured after France agreed in November 1992 to sell 60 Mirage 2000 jet fighters to Taiwan. According to a joint communique on the previously unpublicized 23-28 December visit to China by Jacques Friedmann, a special envoy of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, the two countries have decided to restore their "traditional friendly relations and cooperation" on the basis of the principles on which they established diplomatic ties (Xinhua, 12 January). In addition, Xinhua reported that the two governments also agreed to "intensify" their "political consultations" and to "develop" bilateral economic and trade relations. The communique went on to suggest that Paris will also reap economic rewards for its agreement not to "authorize" French companies to sell arms to Taiwan, noting that China "welcomes participation on an equal footing" by French enterprises in the Chinese market. During Chancellor Helmut Kohl's late November visit to China, Beijing had rewarded Bonn for its decision not to sell weapons to Taiwan and for its low- key position on human rights by awarding a number of lucrative economic contracts to German companies.
