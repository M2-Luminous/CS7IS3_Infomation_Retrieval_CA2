"Since April 1976, I have visited China several times, each time has left me a very deep impression," Mubarak said, smiling, when meeting with the Chinese journalists in a large study in his Heliopolis Presidential Palace. The president will pay a three-day state visit to China from April 21 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. This will be his sixth tour of China and the fourth since he became president. Sino-Egyptian relations have both historical and political dimensions, said Mubarak, pointing out that Egypt is the first Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of China. So far as the political dimension is concerned, he said, these relations are based on a firmly established friendship that consists in cooperation, consultation and coordination on international and Arab issues. These relations proceed from the major role played by China on the international arena and the important role enjoyed by Egypt in the Arab world, the Middle East and Africa, he added. The president noted that the historical heritage of both Egypt and China, mutual confidence between the two countries and their cooperation in the economic, cultural and scientific fields have laid a solid foundation for mutual understanding between the two peoples, which has in turn further boosted the strong friendly ties existing between Cairo and Beijing at the highest level. "If our political relations have become so firmly established, we of course hope that our economic cooperation and our trade exchange will come up to the same level." The big progress the Chinese have made in their economic development and the impetus that has been given to the Egyptian economy in recent years are likely to create wide prospects for Egypt and China to expand their trade and increase their shares in the world trade, Mubarak said. Those two facts are also likely to enable Egypt to make use of the industrial and technological progress achieved by China, he added. "We cannot ignore the importance of the economic and political role of the countries in Asia, particularly in the Far East, which contribute 50 percent of the world production, that foreshadows that the next century will be the century of Asia," Mubarak said. Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a number of Asian countries have promoted Egypt to devote due attention to fostering cooperation and understanding with the Asian countries, he said.
