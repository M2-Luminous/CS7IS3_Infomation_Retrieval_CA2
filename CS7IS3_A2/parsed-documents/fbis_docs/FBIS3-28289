This measure is being taken in response to U.S. demands in the insurance sector negotiations at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks to promote more transparency in government administration. This proposal will be presented at the bilateral negotiations to be held in Washington on 7 February as a compromise plan. While MOF will work further on the details of the public hearing system, concrete measures being considered include allowing a certain period of time for insurance companies to submit written suggestions on insurance structural reform to the MOF, and giving foreign insurance companies the opportunity to attend deliberations at the Insurance Council, and to state their views. At the framework talks, the U.S. Government has been demanding since last fall more transparency in the process of structural reform. At first, the United States had demanded that structural reform should proceed simultaneously with bilateral negotiations but has recently softened its position to demanding opportunities for private insurance companies, including foreign insurers, to state their views before the structural reform plan is formally decided upon. The U.S. Government is apprehensive that the MOF may proceed with structural reform while coordinating with Japanese insurance companies, thereby excluding foreign companies' participation. Furthermore, in the United States, structural reform is always accompanied by free airing of views from the private sector after the draft plan is announced. In some cases, opinions of the private sector are incorporated into the final plan. Such difference in administrative procedures is one reason why the United States seeks a public hearing system similar to its own. MOF is in the process of reforming the insurance system, with particular emphasis on amending the Insurance Law. It plans to present the draft amendments to the regular Diet session in 1995. Among the reform measures being considered are: liberalizing the third sector insurance -- such as insurance for injuries, illnesses and nursing services -- where both life and non-life insurance companies participate, and introducing a brokerage system, where brokers recommend the most advantageous insurance policies for the clients. U.S. insurance companies have also shown great interest in the outcome of the reform plan.
