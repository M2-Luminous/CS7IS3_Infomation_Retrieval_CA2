Silva Cimma mentioned the issue after being asked about press reports published by EL MERCURIO quoting him as saying in Brasilia that Chile would negotiate its membership with NAFTA and Mercosur. According to news agency reports, Silva Cimma said: "We will try to move forward, negotiating with both mechanisms." He reportedly said there is no incompatibility in this approach. Asked about this report, the minister said he found it very strange that such a thing has been said, and that he was misinterpreted. "I never said that. Chilean policy remains totally the same," he replied. Silva Cimma denied that he talked about the issue in Brasilia during a news conference, explaining that there was no such conference and that was he was asked by only two journalists about Mercosur. "I told them: 'Look, we like Mercosur, but for various reasons we cannot join it.'" The document that created Mercosur is known as the Treaty of Asuncion, which was signed in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Under the treaty's terms, there will be a customs union among those countries as of 1 January 1995, with zero internal tariffs and a common external tariff, while their economic policies will be made as consistent as possible. The Chilean position toward this treaty has remained unchanged. Chile has noted its satisfaction over the treaty, expressed thanks for the repeated invitations to join it, and refused to do it for technical and not political reasons. Summing up, there are three reasons that prevent Chile from joining Mercosur: 1) the difficult short-term coordination of the bilateral agreements signed within Mercosur on matters like protection against third countries, nontariff restrictions, foreign investment, incorporation of new technology, intellectual property, and pharmaceutical patents; 2) The weight of the Brazilian economy in the group, because of its protectionist policy and economic imbalances; and 3) The fact that Chile has eliminated all nontariff restrictions through bilateral agreements, while Mercosur will not enforce this measure until 1 January 1995.
