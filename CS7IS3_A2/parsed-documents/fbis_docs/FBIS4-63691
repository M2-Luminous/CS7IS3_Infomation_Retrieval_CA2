Independent Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the fighting which began at the beginning of this month between the militias of the Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani has resulted in hundreds of military and civilian casualties, both dead and wounded, and similar numbers taken prisoner, in addition to serious material losses. The sources said that tension returned in the past few days after last week's guarded calm during which the leaders of the parties of Barzani and Talabani tried in vain to implement agreements they had reached for stopping the fighting and normalizing the situation. Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that fierce fighting broke out yesterday between the two parties in the strategic city of Shaqlawah near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region, and, according to some other sources, widespread clashes have been going on for days in the eastern areas near the border with Iran between PUK forces and forces of the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] and Hizballah, the two Islamic organizations suspected of receiving financial and military aid from Iran. The sources also said that a prominent member of Talabani's party was killed last Tuesday in an ambush laid by the Islamists. They said that Hasan Kawistani, member of the PUK leadership, and 16 of his companions were killed in the Hajj 'Umran area northeast of Irbil near the border with Iran when they were on their way to a meeting with local officials of Barzani's party. The same sources said that the population in Irbil, al-Sulaymaniyah, and other Kurdish cities are facing increasing shortages of food, medicine, and basic services because of the suspension of transport movement on the road linking the two biggest Kurdish cities with Zakhu near the Turkish border, through which the Kurds received most of their food and medical needs.
