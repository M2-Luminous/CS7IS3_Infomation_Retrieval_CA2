[Musa] What does the Arabization and internationalization of the crisis mean? Some people are fearful of these two words, and this means leaving things as they are and looking at the crisis with indifference. We urgently call for respecting the UN ceasefire resolution. The party that does not implement the ceasefire resolution will be violating international legitimacy. We were afraid of the Arabization or internationalization in the Gulf war and there are some now who want to do the same in a tacit attempt to let the blood flow. We reject this totally and reject this reasoning. [Abu-Mansur] When will Egypt recognize the Democratic Republic in south Yemen? When will it recognize the secession? [Musa] Egypt supports Arab and international legitimacy in this issue as in others. We support Yemeni unity. But this unity cannot be imposed and cannot be maintained through bloodshed. This is a clear stand and there is no need to elaborate further on it. Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar al-Muntasir replied to AL-ANWAR'S questions as follows: [Abu-Mansur] Is the "Lockerbie" case included in the African summit's agenda? Are you seeking an African stand supporting your views as was the case, for example, with the Arab League? [Al-Muntasir] The Lockerbie issue was raised at the committee level. We want the summit to issue a resolution supporting Libya as the Arab League and the Nonaligned Movement have done. We believe that merely holding the summit in fraternal Tunisia means a decision that supports our stand on the Lockerbie case and the decisions on extraditing the Libyans accused of exploding an American plane over Scotland several years ago. [Abu-Mansur] What are the new factors and developments in the dispute between Libya and the three Western countries--the United States, France, and Britain? It has been reported that the issue is going around in a vicious circle. [Al-Muntasir] We still hold that the Libyans are innocent. But we have agreed to have them tried in a neutral country or before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. We are expecting the OAU summit in Tunisia to issue a resolution backing Libya's demand, similar to the ones issued by the Arab League and the OAU. We are hoping for this, especially as Tunisia is hosting the summit. [Abu-Mansur] What is the Libyan Jamahiriyah's stand on the Yemeni crisis? What solutions do you propose to stop the bloodshed? [Al-Muntasir] We are now in an African forum and there is no scope for dealing with this issue. But in reply to your question, I say that we support Yemeni unity and Libya cannot support the south's secession from the north. Regarding the solution, we believe that it should be a Yemeni one in the first place because the dispute is an internal one. Officials there should find a solution that takes into account the Yemeni people's interests and responds to their aspirations and hopes. We in Libya believe that the Yemeni people cannot lean toward partition and fragmentation. We have conveyed our stand to the Yemeni brothers. [Abu-Mansur] How do you assess the efforts to Arabize and internationalize the Yemeni crisis so as to contain the war and limit the losses caused by the bloody conflict, which is taking the form of a "scorched earth action?" [Al-Muntasir] We in Libya reject the internationalization of the Yemeni crisis. [Abu-Mansur] And the Arabization? What do you say to that? [Al-Muntasir] We say: There is no power and might without God Almighty. [passage omitted]
