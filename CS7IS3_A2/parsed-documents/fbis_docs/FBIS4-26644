Wen Shizhen, acting governor of the province, said that Liaoning is mapping out a blueprint to revitalize its state-owned economic sector and bring another economic boom to the former industrial leader of China. Liaoning, with a population topping 40 million, has more than 1,260 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for one-tenth of the nation's total. These enterprises have given great help to the country during past decades. But due to long-term running under a tightly planned economy, most of them have problems adjusting themselves to the demands of the market economy which China is implementing. Still worse, an economic boom is hindered by outdated equipment and means of production. The acting governor said that the province is making vigorous efforts to restructure its economy. The state-owned sector is being revived and new economic sectors, including private firms, rural enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, have been developing rapidly. By 1995, the majority of state-owned enterprises are expected to make a profit as new management systems and relevant reforms are being carried out in them. The industrial output value of the non-state-owned economic sector makes up 47.5 percent of the province's total, compared with only 16.4 percent in 1978. The rural enterprises have generated one-third of the province's gross product, reaching 164.3 billion yuan last year. According to the acting governor, a market system for commodities, finance, technology and labor will be established in the province soon, to guide enterprises' production according to market demand. The present planning system will be phased out. Social security insurance and the housing system will also be reformed to cope with the new situation. The province will open further to the outside world. The port city of Dalian will be built into a center of finance, trade and information services. Foreign businessmen are encouraged to invest in basic industries, infrastructure facilities and high-tech sectors. Export-oriented ventures are also welcomed. Liaoning has huge economic development potential as it has vast reserves in oil, iron, coal, non-ferrous metals and diamonds. It is self-sufficient in food supplies. In addition, the number of high-grade personnel in science and technology and in management is large. Geographic advantages, including a long coastline and numerous ports, will also help the province's development, said the acting governor.
