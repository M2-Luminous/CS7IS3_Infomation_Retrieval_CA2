Strub: "Dissemination and Exploitation: A Greater Emphasis" -- first paragraph is INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER introduction] [Text] Activity 3 of the Fourth Framework Programme is devoted to the diffusion and optimisation of results, and will further integrate all the EC's efforts in these areas under one programme. According to Dr. A.Strub, Director of DG XIII/D (Dissemination and Exploitation of RTD Results, Technology Transfer and Innovation), this will consolidate and enhance Europe's ability to convert its undoubted scientific prowess into internationally competitive products and services. [INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] Is this the first time that the dissemination and exploitation of research results has been given such priority? [Strub] Yes, certainly. Dissemination and exploitation is now one of the four major headings of the Fourth Framework Programme, giving these themes a much higher profile. What we are seeing here is the continuation of a long-term trend. As each Framework Programme succeeds its predecessor, the role of dissemination and exploitation has become more prominent. On the other hand, the current situation is that the funds proposed under this heading of the Fourth Framework Programme are not as high as the European Commission originally proposed, or as the European Parliament wished. Nevertheless, I expect that the dissemination and exploitation work which was begun under the Second Framework programme, and is now being developed and expanded under the Third, will make further strides forward under the Fourth. [INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] What, in your view, are the main features of Activity 3? [Strub] From my point of view, one of the main features is the inclusion of work which up to now has been done under SPRINT [Strategic Program for Innovation and Technology Transfer]. Both SPRINT and VALUE [program for the dissemination and utilization of research results in science and technology] are run from within my Directorate, and both programmes operate in the technology transfer area. VALUE concentrates on promoting the dissemination and exploitation of the results of Community-funded research, whereas SPRINT has a brief which is much broader -- to contribute towards the creation of a better environment in Europe for innovation and technology transfer. Up to now the administrative basis of the two programmes have been quite different, with VALUE within the framework programme system and SPRINT outside it. The two programmes have much in common and many shared interests, and the physical proximity of the two management teams means that coordination and cooperation between them is excellent. But having both under the same administrative `root' will further improve coherence between the two programmes and facilitate the undertaking of integrated joint projects. By the way, this poses a nomenclature problem. Should we keep the names VALUE and SPRINT, which everyone knows, or should we find a new name to cover both activities and to demonstrate that they are merged? Another point worth noting is that the network of organisations set up under the THERMIE [European Technologies for Energy Control] programme to promote energy technologies is also put under Activity 3. That adds even more opportunities for a shared approach. [INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] How will the financial environment for SME's [small and medium-sized enterprises] and European industry in general be improved to make taking up new technologies easier and more attractive? [Strub] One of the objectives of Activity 3 is to improve the financial environment for the dissemination of technology. there will be two main strands to this. One will target the interface between the financial world and innovative firms. The aim will be to improve communication across this interface, and facilitate investment in technological project. SPRINT has already done some work in this area -- the SPRINT Investment Fora, for example. The other strand will involve pilot financial schemes specifically aimed at encouraging SMEs to make use of research results and new technological developments. The SPRINT Technology Performance Financing Scheme, which has been a forerunner in this area, will be continued. We still hope that -- notwithstanding the reluctance of some Member States -- the Commission will also be authorised to try out a new financial `instrument,' and that the funds finally made available to Activity 3 will allow it. This instrument is intended to improve the possibilities for financing the uptaking of technologies and RTD results by SMEs and will be adapted to the needs and practices of each Member State.
