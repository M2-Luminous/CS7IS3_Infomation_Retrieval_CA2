The past four decades of economic development have culminated in a global awareness, and the "State of the World Report 1994" has presented additionally some irrefutable and shocking facts. These became apparent at the meeting of the World Awareness Group, which has scientifically evaluated the developmental activities of the past four decades and has adopted the mandate to direct the course of action for the next 40 years. The administrators, policymakers, and sociologists of the world have been using this report as a path finder. It has been translated into 27 languages. Ten million copies of the English edition alone have been printed from New York, London, and New Delhi. Eleven hundred copies were distributed among world leaders participating in the recent International Financial Forum in Davos. The first disadvantage of making economic advancement the goal of development has been an imbalanced and astounding grabbing for ownership of the substances that keep the earth alive. Before human intervention, the production capacity of earth-related materials from forests and pastures was about 150 billion tons. Humans destroyed about 12 percent of this and used about 27 percent. Thus 40 percent has already been used up by humans, leaving only 60 percent for other living things. This 40 percent is from that portion which was easily accessible to humans. Now, the trend is to reach for more and more. What will be the result of this? When the forests are invaded too much, it impacts the water resources. In spite of the noise made about the preservation of forests, 130 million hectares of the world's forests have been destroyed from 1970-90. The majority of these were tropical forests, which were home to and a treasury of many varied species of flora and fauna. In destroying these forests, a delicate balance of biodiversity, forest resources, and a well-established eco-system of symbiotic creatures has been irrevocably upset. The procreation and natural balance has been replaced by a market philosophy of industrial production, based on human selfishness. Biotechnology, acclaimed widely as the hope of the future, is the biggest culprit as it sucks the earth repeatedly, until there is nothing left. The same thing that was done to the forests has been repeated with farm lands. Four decades of development have been showing astounding food and other production due to the green revolution. Along with improved food grain production, meat production has also increased 2.6 times. This would have made those pushing for advancement happy, except that after 1984 there was a sudden decrease in food production. The increase had been a direct result of improvements in irrigating and fertilizing techniques. A ton of fertilizer used to yield 9 tons of produce, but once the productivity zenith was reached, it fell to only 2 tons. Between 1984 and 1993, the annual food production went down from 29 million tons to only 12 million tons. In the next 40 years, by the year 2030, should the same condition prevail, the yield would only be 248 kg per capita, compared to the top production year 1984 with a per capita production of 346 kg. The fluctuation in food production directly impacts meat production. We must not assume wrongly that the per capita growth in food production has met food demands and has lead to self-sufficiency and uplifting of living standards of the poor. This misconception can be dispelled by looking at the per capita consumption statistics worldwide. The annual per capita food consumption for Canada was 974 kg, and for the United States, 860 kg, when for India it was 186 kg, and for Bangladesh 176 kg! This striking difference is because those countries' greatest use of food products is to convert them into fodder for obtaining animal-protein in the form of meat, eggs, and milk. An American's average annual consumption includes 42 kg of beef, 28 kg of pork, 44 kg of poultry, and 271 kg of milk, whereas an Indian's food consumption is mainly to wipe out hunger, and stay alive. There has been an extraordinary increase also in fisheries. It had increased to an annual production of 100 million tons in 1990, from a mere 22 million tons in 1950. The per capita consumption had risen from 9 kg per year to 19 kg, but now there is a marked decrease in this also. This has decreased to only 11 kg per capita. The main reason for this is the pollution of the ocean floor from where 90 percent of the fish are obtained. This picture of economic development makes it clear that our planet is hurtling towards its demise. The dance of death will be felt more acutely in the poorer nations since the peoples of these countries are more directly dependent for sustenance on water, forest, and earth resources. Converting to a market economy has brought about a basic change in their generations-old ways of living, and traditions. The temple of economics is the market and money its god. Even in this the place for foreign currency, especially the "dollar" has the highest place. The industrialized nations of the world have trapped the rest of the world into the spread of this snake's hood of market economy so that probably there is no nation left whose leader does not have to supplicate himself to this method. They are acquiring materials through free trade. Under this system it really does not matter who rules a country. Those who accept this way have only one rule -- economic slavery. It is clear from the examples of Japan and the Netherlands how countries that make trade their mainstay remain affluent, even when they lack basic natural resources. Japan sells cars and computers, and from that income buys food, wood, oil, iron, and other raw materials. The Netherlands uses 10 percent of its farm, pasture, and forest lands for production. Japan's annual per capita national production is $18,000. Japan's trade stretches far to Canada, whose forests have been leased by Japan for a long while now. The clearing of the tropical forests in neighboring East Asia is for its expanding self-indulgence, and to fulfill its commercial needs. The aborigines, who have already been rendered poor by deforestation, are being pushed towards starvation. The exports and imports of these countries can show us how they keep their trade balanced. Holland exports milk and milk-products, while it imports the fodder for its cattle from far-off Thailand. India is a big importer of crude oil. In 1989/90, we imported 5.460 billion rupees [Rs] worth of crude oil. There is a permanent goal to improve this. India is also importing the dung from Dutch cows, since there is a danger of Holland's rivers becoming polluted by it. These cows are sent to the slaughter-house anyway once they stop yielding milk. The increase in population in the next 40 years will be significant. The world population has doubled in the last 40 years from 2.50 billion to 5.2 billion. And every year it has increased by 70 million. The next 40 years are likely to see an increase to 8.900 billion. That means a yearly 90-million increase. The rate of increase in Western countries will be very low. In Russia and in Italy, the population will decrease by 1 and 2 million, respectively. In the last 40 years in India, the population has shown an increase of 307 million, and an increase of 590 million is expected in the next 40. We will rank second only to China, as we already do, with a population count of 1.443 billion. The dreams of a comfortable life that poor nations dream and the promises of their governments of bright futures all will get crushed. During 1950-60, the rate of economic growth for the world was 4.9 percent and per capita was 3.1 percent. During 1990-93 it dropped to 0.9 and 0.8 percent, respectively. It can be argued that these are global figures, and in a developing nation like India, the annual rate of growth has been higher. No matter how good the growth, the benefits from it reach only the handful of people controlling the power and the economies of these rich and poor nations. These developments are issuing a warning to develop new methods of survival, other than those aimed at economic growth. It would be foolish to ignore this warning, saying that it may be a matter of choice for the rich nations to leave the path of prosperity through economic growth, but a poor country has no option and cannot give it up. From the Himalayas in the north to the oceans in the south and east, I witnessed for one week (17-24 February) the battleground where this is being fought. In Tehri, the highest dam in Asia, at 260.5 meters, has been constructed, killing the effluent Bhagirathi river, submerging a 42 sq km plain, and uprooting 100,000 people. Why? To sustain big, mainly export-oriented industries; to provide a few more hours of electricity at night to the cities; to increase the production of exportable sugarcane in western Uttar Pradesh, which is already 100-percent irrigated; and to meet the increased demand for water of the fun-seeking tourists that come to Delhi's five-star hotels. In Medhak Zilla near Hyderabad, on 300 acres of farmable land, an Alkabir slaughterhouse with the capacity for killing 120,000 cattle has been built. In the seashore city of Tanjore, the granary of the south, fisheries are set up at the cost of destroying 10 thousand hectares of farmable land. As I coursed along the seashore to the north-east towards Orissa, I found that there also these fisheries have been established, destroying sealife and forests on the seashore. There is a plan to commercialize the seashore areas of Puri by constructing hotels for tourists. Delhi has announced agreements to export 15,000 tons of buffalo meat every year to the Philippines and buffaloes to Vietnam. Animal and animal-product exports are going to increase from Rs3 billion to Rs20 billion per year. Behind all these plans is the clout of influential political leaders, i.e., the elected representatives of the people of these regions. In the end, the result of such pressure cannot be anything other than the consumption of the very last lump of the flesh of silent nature and the silent millions with their filial dependence on her.
