Jordi Pujol made no change to the schedule which he is following during his five-day official visit to Germany, on which he is accompanied by 50 Catalan businessmen in the hope of winning new investments in that community. In the meantime, the Catalan cabinet had a normal working day, with the councillors in their offices. Pujol took the view that the strike "is not important" in itself, but the fact that it could lead the government to amend the contents of the labor reform, which has had CiU's parliamentary support, is important. According to Pujol, the coalition will not withdraw its support from the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] even if the strike is a massive success, but it will if the Socialist Party "gives in and decides to change policy." Speaking to the same effect, Miguel Roca [Democratic Convergence of Catalonia Secretary General] Miquel Roca asserted yesterday that "the trade unions will have to reflect," since yesterday's strike "is not a general strike," with a considerable impact on industry, but has had "a very modest impact" on small and medium-sized industry, "virtually none" on trade, and "very little" on the civil service and the services sector. In Roca's opinion, this uneven response and the much lesser impact than the 14 December 1988 strike are "a sign" that the government should "go ahead with the aims laid down in the the field of economic and labor policy."
