While the war claims more victims, famine increases every tenth of a second because relief operations have been suspended, affecting more than 130,000 people. Should the situation continue, famine and war could claim 50 lives daily. The hospital recently renovated by the Belgian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres has been shut down and the patients left to their own devices. Hospital sources say the hospital is providing only first aid treatment.
