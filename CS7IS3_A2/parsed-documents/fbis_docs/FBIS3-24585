N. Kamenev, V. I. Nalivayko; UDC 621.372.8:535] [Abstract] A feasibility is demonstrated for developing a converter of a monochromatic light beam into a line of parallel light beams of identical intensity. A three-dimensional divider of the monochromatic radiation was examined here. This divider can be useful for the development of three-dimensional integrated-optical circuits. The proposed device includes a waveguide, and input and output diffraction gratings. Planar waveguides, obtained by diffusion of silver ions into an oxide glass substrate, were used. The input and output elements of the demultiplier consist of a thin relief type diffraction grating. The elements were prepared by projecting the interference pattern produced by crossed beams of argon laser, on the 0.4 - 0.6ï¿½m thick As[.sup]2[/]S[.sub]3[/] films, sputtered by a thermal evaporation in a vacuum. After exposure, the diffraction efficiency (DE) increased during the transformation process of the grating structure. For an effective performance of the device, the input grating must have a maximum possible value of the DE. In the experiments performed here, the DE was on the order of 50%.
