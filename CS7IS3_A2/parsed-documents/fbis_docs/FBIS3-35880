Gorbunovs does not consider the holding of the referendum the best political means to tackle the problem of the Skrunda radar at the moment, because in that case the inter-state talks with Russia on troop withdrawal could come to a halt. The discontinuation of the talks in the present Latvian situation would be very undesirable, Gorbunovs stressed. The visit of the Saeima delegation to the United States shows that possibilities of tackling issues related to the withdrawal of the Russian army have not been exhausted, Gorbunovs said. According to him, at the moment Latvia's main opportunity for tackling the issue of the army withdrawal is to continue interstate talks with Russia. The Latvian National Security Council has not passed a specific resolution on holding a referendum on the Skrunda radar issue, because a law on referenda has not been passed. According to Gorbunovs, the drafting of such a law would take about one month.
