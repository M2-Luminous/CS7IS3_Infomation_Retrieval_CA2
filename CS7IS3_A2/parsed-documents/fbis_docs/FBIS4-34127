The weekly magazine TRABAJADORES indicates there is concern and uncertainty among the people regarding their income, following the decisions to cleanse the local economy and reduce excess cash in circulation, calculated at 11 billion pesos (an amount equal to dollars). The measures include increasing certain prices and tariffs and eliminating several subsidies. The steps are directed at reactivating production and, therefore, supply. Experts say these factors will contribute to the restoration of the people's buying power. After stressing this is not the time to raise the issue of general salary increases, the editorial column reminds readers the amount of cash in circulation does not necessarily determine the amount received but, rather, its purchasing power. It goes on to explain that Cuban black market activities are often awarded certain virtues, but this activity, also known as the underground economy and deemed illegal and unproductive on the island, feeds on the state's resources or those that should be sold to the state. It simply redistributes the goods instead of promoting production. Along this same line, and given the black market's inability to generate more products or services to meet the demand, it would be inconsistent to raise the people's salary with the current excessive levels of cash already in circulation. The article also finds "salary adjustments to meet the price increases" an economic nonsense. This also renders as unviable production incentives by way of monetary awards or salary increases. The TRABAJADORES editorial does recognize, however, influential sectors of the national economy, such as tourism, oil, mining, agriculture, the sugar industry, transportation, power generation, port movement, and other such activities do receive economic incentives in foreign currency for their production efforts. TRABAJADORES underscored this procedure is consistent with the new economic system the Cuban authorities have designed, under the present circumstances, "to bring the Socialist formula of payment in accordance with the quantity and quality of each worker's contribution."
