If the case is not appealed, or is affirmed on appeal, then the antidumping duty orders on El FPDs will be revoked.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Diminich or Richard Rimlinger, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 26, 1991, the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that a U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of FPDs from the Japan (56 FR 43937, Sept. 5, 1991). On September 4, 1991, the Department published an antidumping duty order on EL FPDs (56 FR 43741). The ITC decision was appealed, and the CIT remanded the determination to the ITC to reconsider its injury determination. On March 8, 1993, the ITC determined on remand that no U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of El FPDs. This remand was affirmed by the CIT on April 14, 1994, Hosiden Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 94&hyph;60 (CIT April 14, 1994). Accordingly, absent an appeal, or , if appealed, upon a final decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) affirming the CIT, the antidumping duty order will be revoked. Plaintiffs in the proceedings obtained an injunction enjoining liquidation of entries of EL FPDs that remain unliquidated as of 5 p.m., January 24, 1994. Therefore, revocation of the order will be effective for all entries that remain unliquidated as of the date of revocation. Suspension of Liquidation In its decision in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the CAFC held that the Department must publish notice of a decision of the CIT or the CAFC which is not in harmony with the Department's or the ITC's respective determinations. Publication of this notice fulfills that obligation. The CAFC also held that in such a case, the Department must suspend liquidation until there is a final decision in the action. Therefore, the Department is continuing to suspend liquidation at the current cash deposit rate pending the expiration of the period of appeal of, if appealed, pending a final decision of the CAFC. Dated: April 30, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10992 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
