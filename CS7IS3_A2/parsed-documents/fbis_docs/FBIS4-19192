Baratta is here to attend Thursday's official ceremony in which the 117 nations involved in the seven-year-long Uruguay Round of GATT talks will sign the accords reached in December. He compared the Uruguay Round to the Bretton Woods accords of 1944, which led to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Uruguay Round accord allegedly makes a significant step toward the creation of a World Trade Organization, which was one of the original goals of GATT when it was founded in 1948. Italy, Baratta said, was in danger of falling behind competitors on the global markets because its technological strength is limited to the textiles industry. The new accords, however, will force rich countries to reduce trade barriers and will favor development of poor countries, allowing more room for Italian exports to both, according to Baratta. The greatest weakness of Italian businesses, Baratta said, is that they do not have sufficient capital to plan "aggressive" investments abroad, investments which Baratta said may not yield returns in the short term but allow companies to plant a foot solidly inside future markets. Italian companies are mostly small- and medium-sized ones, they are flexible and good at marketing, but they can only "follow" market trends rather than setting them, Baratta added.
