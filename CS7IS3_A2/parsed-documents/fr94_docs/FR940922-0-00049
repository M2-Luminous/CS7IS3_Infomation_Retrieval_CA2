FR940922-0-00049 FR940922-0-00018 RSPA is issuing this extension of the compliance dates without prior notice and comments because we view this as a noncontroversial and necessary amendment and do not anticipate any adverse comments. However, if RSPA receives comments by September 30, 1994, that illustrate that an extension of the compliance dates is not in the public interest, RSPA will remove this final rule and propose another date. If no such comments are received, RSPA will publish a document in the Federal Register confirming the compliance dates. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Although the underlying rule was significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034), this action is not significant because it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect of extending compliance dates. A regulatory evaluation for the December 20, 1991 final rule is available for review in the docket. Executive Order 12612 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). Federal law expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements applicable to the transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not substantively the same as Federal requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These subjects are: (A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous material; (B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material; (C) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous material and requirements respecting the number, contents, and placement of those documents; (D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or (E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material. This final rule concerns classification, packaging, labeling, and marking of hazardous material. Therefore, this final rule preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements that are not substantively the same as Federal requirements on these subjects. Section 5125(b)(2) of title 49 U.S.C. provides that when DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects, after November 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and no later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective date of Federal preemption of this final rule will be April 3, 1995. Because RSPA lacks discretion in this area, preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule affects shippers and carriers of infectious substances and regulated medical waste, some of whom may be small entities. The effect of the rule is to provide regulatory relief to these entities. Therefore, I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act This amendment does not impose information collection or recordkeeping requirements.
