See notes 14&hyph;15, supra, and accompanying text. (2) as applicable, as of May 24, 1993, identify the following for each person or other entity (including officers, directors and partners) identified in (1) above: residence, citizenship, office or directorship held, number of shares or nature of partnership interests, number of votes, and percentage of votes; also, if the entity is other than an individual, petitions must also identify the name, address, and citizenship of the natural person authorized to vote the stock; and (3) Answer the following: (a) Have the ownership and other interests listed pursuant to (1) and (2) above remained the same since May 24, 1993? (b) Have the officers, directors or partners continued to retain their positions since May 24, 1993? If the answer to (a) or (b) is ``No,'' please explain. 14. Petitioners must also certify that, in the case of an individual petitioner, he or she is not subject to a denial of federal benefits, that includes FCC benefits, pursuant to section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. section 862, or, in the case of a non-individual petitioner, (e.g., corporation, partnership, or other unincorporated association), no party to the application is subject to a denial of federal benefits, that includes FCC benefits, pursuant to that section. For the definition of a ``party'' for these purposes, see 47 CFR 1.2002(b). 15. The Commission has no authority to extend the Congressionally mandated deadline date, so it is imperative that waiver petitions be filed on time.
