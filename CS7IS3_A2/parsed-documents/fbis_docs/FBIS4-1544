The key to whether or not we can undertake this important historical mission and successfully create a socialist market economic system never before seen in the history of mankind lies in our party and in upholding and improving its leadership. Historical experiences have shown that upholding the party's leadership and consolidating its position at the helm of the state are the most important political guarantees for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Meanwhile, historical experiences have also shown that it is not very easy for us to unswervingly and consistently uphold this political principle. Under the new situation of establishing a socialist market economic system, some comrades may have a confused idea about the party's ruling position and their consciousness of being at the helm of the state may be attenuated. As a result, a tendency to undermine the party's leadership may appear. This warrants our attention. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in an important speech he delivered at the beginning of 1992: "If we do not watch out for signs when they begin to crop up, things will go wrong." Especially during the crucial period when our reform, which revolves around the establishment of a new system, enters a phase of tackling major, difficult tasks, it is all the more necessary for us to attach a high degree of importance to the issue of the party's ruling position; successfully achieve ideological and organizational improvement of the party; successfully improve its work style; and strengthen and improve leadership over reform, opening up, and economic work. In the process of Establishing and Improving a Socialist Market Economic System, We Must Always Prevent a Tendency To Ignore the Party's Leadership Our party proposed establishing a socialist market economic system to enable the market to play a basic role in the allocation of resources under macroeconomic regulation and control by a socialist country. It is integrated with the basic socialist system. Upholding the party's leadership is, of course, one of the points that should be implied by the proposal. The establishment and improvement of a socialist market economic system will surely further liberate and develop social productive forces, further consolidate our party's ruling position, and further consolidate the material base for a socialist system. Therefore, the kind of confused idea that the party's leadership role under a market economy is unimportant should not occur in the first place. However, a small number of comrades do have a misunderstanding of the issue. Some people say: "Since we are establishing a market economy, anyone can become part of the leadership. Why do we still have to stress leadership by the Communist Party?" Why does such an erroneous concept appear? I think the reasons are found mainly in the following two aspects: The first is misconceptions. Because of their failure to gain a genuine understanding of the essence and meaning of the socialist market economy, as well as the role and significance of the party's ruling status, some comrades cannot truly understand the compatibility between the socialist market economy and maintenance of the party's ruling status, and have inevitably acquired some misconceptions. 1) The shift by the party and government from direct to indirect economic management in a market economy could lead some people to think the party's functions in leading the economy will be weakened. An important feature of the market economy is the independence of various economic entities. This has created a wrong impression among some people, who are led to believe that a market economy is equivalent to a decentralized and laissez-faire economy not subject to leadership and interference. Therefore, they deem it unnecessary to stress the party's leadership over economic construction. Specifically, we need to spend some time exploring the means by which the party exercises correct and effective leadership over economic work at a time when we have just taken a step forward toward building a socialist market economy. We are not very experienced in this respect, and this could generate a feeling among some comrades that the party's functions in leading the economy will be weakened. (2) The pursuit of material benefits in a market economy will become the primary motive force driving various market competitors to participate in economic activities. This could generate a feeling among some people that the party's ideological leadership will diminish. Some people are of the opinion that the market economy encourages the practice of making a profit in the market, the pursuit of maximum profits, and the use of money to arouse people's initiative. Therefore, they think the party's greatest asset -- ideological and political work -- need not be put to use any more and that it will no longer play much of a role. The party's previously effective measures, such as those used to mobilize, guide, educate, and restrain its members through ideological means, will no longer be useful. The current tendency of some localities toward neglecting ideological and political work, as well as socialist spiritual civilization, has a great deal to do with this misconception. 3) Various economic entities will become independent corporate bodies in a market economy. This could lead people to think that primary party organizations, especially party organizations in enterprises, will weaken their functions as political cores. Some comrades are of the opinion that the pursuit of a market economy entitles various market competitors, especially state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, and including state-owned large and medium enterprises, to make decisions about their cadres, to hire professionals, and to select the workers they need in the labor market. Under such circumstances, party organizations will not be able to play their role as leadership cores, and they will have to gradually diminish or even abandon such a role. Some people have proposed: "It is no longer appropriate to discuss the role of party organizations in enterprises as political cores at a time when a socialist market economy is being developed." These misconceptions are precisely the major ideological causes leading some comrades to neglect the party's leading role. Next is international influence. Western politicians and theorists repeatedly publicize the consistency of having a market economy, private ownership, and multi-party system, and the inconsistency of a market economy, socialist public ownership, and communist party holding office. Some of our comrades have been influenced by these erroneous media opinions and by the fact the former Soviet Union and some East European nations have been practicing the multi-party system during the course of promoting the market economy since they disintegrated and underwent evolution. In particular, bourgeois liberalists and those deeply influenced by them, uphold even more Western capitalist theories and the experience of "drastic changes" in some former socialist countries. They absurdly believe the market economy is inevitably linked to private ownership and the capitalist system, and that a long coexistence between plural economic sectors and the one-party-rule political system is impossible. So, they hope the communist party's ruling status will end someday. Some of our comrades have also been more or less influenced by some hostile forces abroad and stubborn bourgeois liberalists at home who distort China's socialist market economic structure. The above analysis shows us two things: First, fundamentally speaking, in the new situation in which we are developing a socialist market economy, our party has favorable conditions for constantly consolidating and strengthening its ruling status; however, its ruling status is also facing some new circumstances and new challenges created by an existing erroneous tendency of overlooking party leadership. If we fail to pay attention to the tendency and adopt effective measures to deal with it, our party's leadership over political, economic, ideological, and organizational affairs will likely be weakened. Second, a great deal of arduous and meticulous work indeed remains to be done to truly prevent and overcome the erroneous tendency of overlooking the party's leadership under market economy conditions. It needs a theoretical explanation. We should clearly explain to people the accurate definition of a socialist market economy, eliminate their misunderstandings caused by the distortion of the socialist market economy, and make them understand the consistency between developing a market economy and upholding party leadership. It needs practical deeds even more. We should discover the best and most effective way for the party to hold office and to exercise correct leadership over political, economic, ideological, and organizational affairs. It is for this reason that we should, during the entire course of establishing and perfecting a socialist market economic structure, always keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's words: "Without leadership by the party a big country like China would be torn apart by strife, and incapable of accomplishing anything. Whether inside or outside the party, all tendencies towards weakening, breaking away from, opposing or liquidating leadership by the party must be criticized. The individuals involved should be educated or, if necessary, struggles should be waged against them." (Volume 2 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 317) This is a key to accelerating the establishment of the new structure. To Establish a Socialist Market Economic Structure Is To Enhance the Role of the Party Leadership, Not To Weaken It Understanding the party's role of holding office under the conditions of socialist market economy is in fact a question of understanding the role of party leadership under the conditions of a market economy. To develop a socialist market economic structure is not to weaken party leadership. On the contrary, it has set new tasks and new demands on party leadership, and it requires us to take a further step to strengthen and improve it. Then, what kinds of new tasks and demands does promotion of the socialist market economy pose on the party's leadership? I think there are at least the following tasks and demands: First, developing the socialist market economy is a brand new subject; more than ever before, this work needs the party's scientific guidance, theoretically and in principle and policy. Experience shows the planned economy itself cannot effectively advance the development of productive forces, and we must develop a socialist market economy. But we really do not have a solution ready as to how to develop a socialist market economy. As Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we have never encountered most of the problems cropping up in the process of developing a socialist market economic system. Although we may make use of some practices of the capitalist market economy outside the country, what we are developing, after all, is a socialist market economy. And, over the past decades, people have had very little knowledge of the market economy. All this greatly demands that we provide theoretical and scientific guidance -- that the party establish relevant principles and policy conforming to market economic reality to guide people's practice. History since the founding of the People's Republic shows that only the CPC can provide theoretical and scientific guidance concerning the line, principle, and policy for developing a socialist market economy. This is because our party is armed with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our party has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, accumulated rich experience in economic construction over the last few decades, and cultivated a large number of backbone economic construction cadres. The most important thing is that the market economy we want to develop is one that will be integrated with the basic socialist system -- it follows the general laws of a market economy and demonstrates the characteristics of the essence of socialism. In this sense, promotion of the development of a socialist market economy is absolutely inseparable from the CPC's leadership. The facts also prove this -- it is the CPC itself which has realized the ills of the old economic system and established the basic theory and policy of a socialist market economy. Since the party has established the development of a socialist market economic system as the objective of reform of the economic system, it is completely able to establish a correct principle and policy to guide the practice of this task. Second, since the socialist market economy will pluralize and decentralize interests, it has become increasingly necessary for the party to coordinate the handling of all types of contradictions so the overall interests of the state can be safeguarded. One important feature of the socialist market economy lies in the pluralization and decentralization of interests, and this feature will inevitably give rise to more contradictions, conflicts, and friction in all sorts of economic contacts. This certainly will be the case, especially during the initial period following the establishment of the socialist market economic system when market-related laws and regulations are inadequate. Not only will there be vertical contradictions between the state, collectives, and individuals; there will also be lateral contradictions between markets and between regions. While certain contradictions can be settled through administrative or economic laws, some cannot be resolved without the party's intervention. In particular, major issues involving the long-range and fundamental interests of people in the country, and major projects which yield conspicuous social results but inconspicuous economic results, they can hardly be resolved by counting merely on administrative and economic measures. The formulation and implementation of these measures must be accomplished through those who will firmly enforce them. Representing the fundamental interests of people of all nationalities in the country, the party has a uniform program and discipline, it can stay aloof of the economic interests of various principal market components, and can coordinate and settle various contradictions with the objective of safeguarding the overall interests of the state as well as the fundamental and long-range interests of the people. If the party's leading role weakens, the situation will become one in which the main market components will scramble for benefits and the state's overall interests will suffer losses. This can very well be explained by the heavy cost which the former Soviet Union paid in pushing the so-called transition toward a market economy. The transition not only gave rise to social unrests within its republics, but it also gave rise to friction and conflict among the republics, and eventually led to the disintegration of the state. In China, local authorities and enterprises have had fairly substantial autonomy since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy, and in spite of the appearance of interest-related differences and contradictions during the course of economic development, on the whole these differences and contradictions can be gradually dealt with, thanks to the CPC's ideological, organizational, and political guarantee. Besides, the existence of departmentalism, decentralism, and small-group mentality in some places also dictates that the party must have stronger leadership. We should say, therefore, the party's leadership is essential for settling all kinds of contradictions, friction, and conflicts emerging during the course of economic development; and party leadership is an important requirement for safeguarding national stability. Third, the negative and corrupt phenomena generated from the establishment of our socialist market economic system must be effectively stopped and combated through exercising strong party leadership. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: The establishment of our socialist market economic system must go through a difficult process of replacing the old system with a new one. The loopholes and weak links caused by inadequate and defective rules and mechanisms during this process also provides opportunities for corrupt phenomena to generate. This is a very practical observation. While we cannot assert the market economy will certainly generate corruption, we dare say the possibilities for corrupt phenomena to generate have noticeably increased owing to the above-mentioned objective causes as well as the limitations of the market economy itself. While these negative and corrupt phenomena can be stopped and corrected through administrative and legal measures, these measures also have their limitations: They can crack down on misconduct, but they cannot eliminate the thought which gives rise to the misconduct; they can correct what has gone wrong, but they cannot prevent what may go wrong; they can correct corruption which violates discipline and the law, they cannot eliminate the negative phenomenon characterized by "continuous minor mistakes even if the commission of major mistakes has been avoided." Ample facts show that even countries with the best and most comprehensive legal systems have not yet been able to uproot corruption. One important point is that the CPC considers it as its objective to eliminate exploitation and corruption and uproot bipolerization. This class attribute dictates the CPC must commit itself to waging protracted, unremitting struggles against all sorts of corruption. The party can effectively educate and closely supervise its members and the entire society through all kinds of disciplinary rules and regulations, and it can also select the most outstanding elements to execute discipline and law and wage organized struggles. These roles that it plays cannot be substituted by any other organization. Fourth, while the establishment of a socialist market economic system needs all sorts of conditions, it needs the party even more to create these conditions. Take mental conditions, for instance. We need a powerful media to propagate knowledge about the market economy, to change people's mind sets, clear up people's misunderstandings about the market economy, and sum up and propagate all experiences of success. In terms of organizational conditions, we need the party to train and select economic experts, managers, and specialists in various fields; form united and pragmatic leading groups with members who perform their duties honestly; and give full scope to the roles played by democratic parties and mass organizations so people in all quarters will actively throw themselves into the great cause of building our market economy. In terms of political conditions, we need the party to foster people's democracy and exercise dictatorship over enemies, as well as to ensure a peaceful international environment so the state can enjoy political stability. We cannot possibly materialize these "needs" through counting on economic organizations alone. Only the organizationally strong CPC armed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics can rally the forces in all social quarters at home to victoriously expedite the process of building our socialist market economy. We can see from what has been discussed above that the party must strengthen its leadership as well as its status of being the ruling party, instead of a weakening and wavering of its ruling status during the course of building our socialist market economic system. The Party Must Constantly Improve Its Leadership Style To Keep Pace With Requirements in the Development of the Socialist Market Economy The fact the party's ruling status remains unchanged after a socialist market economic system has been established does not mean it must not change its leadership style. After all, the replacement of the traditional planned economy by a socialist market economy is a change with far-reaching significance and tremendous impact. This being the case, the party can no longer apply the conventional methods it used to in leading planned economic affairs, and it must seek new leadership styles and methods compatible with the development of the socialist market economy. The key to improving party leadership and making it compatible with the needs of our socialist market economy lies in settling the issue about what the party ought and ought not to take charge of so that it can do a good job in taking charge of what it should and will certainly not involve itself in things which are not its business. It must also make sure that this principle will remain absolutely unchanged no matter what new situations, new contradictions, or new problems may arise. In accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress, the party's basic leading roles should be primarily political, ideological, and organizational. The party's political leadership rests with its leadership over political principles, political orientation, and major policy decisions. This is to say that, on the basis of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the objectives and missions set for building a socialist market economic system, and China's actual situation, the party should formulate practical lines and general and specific policies which represent the interests of the overwhelming majority of people; and, during different periods of development, come up with correct policy decisions in connection with major domestic and world issues to make sure the state will develop along a socialist course with Chinese characteristics. The party's ideological leadership means it will persist in educating and arming the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and, through the party's propaganda, mobilization, and ideological and political work, help party members, cadres, and the people understand and grasp the party's basic line and the theory of a socialist market economy, and become familiar with the party's general and specific policies so that the will of the party will become their voluntary actions. In exercising organizational leadership, the party's main job is to recommend economically proficient cadres, who can also effectively uphold the party's basic theory and basic lines and follow through with the party's intentions [yi tu 1942 0956], to work at state organs, departments making overall economic planning, departments in charge of economic affairs, and large enterprise groups to take charge of major offices; and, through the organization and mobilization launched by party organizations, party cadres, and the broad masses of communist party members at various levels, guide the people to materialize all the party's propositions and accomplish all its missions. Given the aforementioned basic functions of the party's leadership, in perceiving and handling the relationship between the party and government, we should change the party's past leading style in which it directly managed specific economic work matters. Instead, from the viewpoint of the overall situation, we should focus on providing leadership in strategic theory, lines, principles, and policies concerning economic work. In addition, we should turn the party's ideas into the state's will through a legal process, and, through party organizations' activities and members' exemplary vanguard role, motivate the broad masses to materialize this will. In perceiving and handling the relationship between the party and enterprises and institutions, we should change the past practice in which party organizations did all administrative work and commanded production operations. Instead, we should use our energy primarily to ensure and supervise the implementation of all party and state guidelines and policies on doing good ideological and political work among cadres and workers; and on strengthening leadership over trade unions, organizations of Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations. Specific matters concerning production work and business operations should be independently and effectively carried out by factory directors, managers, or production and administration organs. Evidently, clearly defining the basic functions of the party's leadership is the precondition for improving its leading style. With this understanding, it will not be difficult to find the principle and way that should be followed in improving the party's leading style; we will be able to eliminate the uncertainty and confusion in handling the relationship between the party and government. Party organizations must truly have a good grip of the three aforementioned basic functions and endeavor to carry them out. They must not become tied up with specific economic matters and must not weaken the three basic functions; nor should they use reform as a pretext to incorporate the three basic functions, which pertain to party organizations, into administration departments. We should prevent the two aforementioned situations from happening in practical work. Currently, we should particularly guard against the tendency of using the need to accommodate the new market economic situation to make the party's leadership in enterprises a part of enterprises' administrative work. If party organizations of enterprises are incorporated into enterprises' administration departments, how can they play their political, ideological, and organizational leading role? I think internal organs of party organizations of industrial and mining enterprises may be set up according to the category an enterprise is in. Some internal organs of medium and small enterprises may be merged and their personnel reduced, but the party's organization departments must not be incorporated into administration and personnel departments. Organization departments of party committees should not only be responsible for supervising cadres, but, more importantly, they should properly manage party organizations and party members. Propaganda departments of party committees should publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm party members and workers, and conduct ideological and political work. It will be difficult to accomplish the party's tasks if organization and propaganda departments of party committees are abrogated and only a party's general office is in operation. It is even necessary to establish a united front work department in some large enterprises; of course the personnel should be kept to a minimum. Currently, China is in the process of developing a socialist market economic system; therefore, a leading style in line with market economic development remains to be gradually developed and summed up in practice. We believe that, with the common efforts of comrades of the whole party, the party's new leading style will be refined day by day.
