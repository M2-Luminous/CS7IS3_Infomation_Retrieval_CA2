Following U.S. President Clinton's order given on 22 March to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea and the announcement that more than 40 missile launchers and an 800-member Patriot battalion will be moved to South Korea, war conspiracies are being plotted in the U.S. Defense Department everyday, and corresponding actual fighting measures are being taken. According to reports from Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry raved on 24 March that if the UN Security Council decides to impose sanctions against our country, the United States will send additional troops and weapons to South Korea. Concurrently, the 25 March issue of the South Korean paper CHOSON ILBO quoted U.S. military sources as saying that a plan was being worked out by the U.S. military to hurl 600,000-strong military strength including two Marine divisions, more than 200 warships, over 1,600 planes from the U.S. mainland within 80 days, repeat 80 days, in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Slocombe said on 24 March at a hearing at the defense committee of the U.S. Congress that U.S. carrier task fleets are in full readiness for mobilization to cope with a possible contingency on the Korean peninsula and the mobilization system of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South Korea was under reexamination. He raved that apart from the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South Korea, 22,000 U.S. Marine forces, an Army special unit, and 50 each of the F-15C interceptor planes and F-16 multipurpose fighters from the island of Okinawa in Japan, and U.S. carrier military strength from Yokosuka port can be mobilized additionally. Facts show that the U.S. military is in a posture to take military actions as soon as the UN Security Council takes sanction measures. Due to the U.S. war maniacs, darker clouds of war are approaching the Korean peninsula, and a dangerous situation on the brink of war is being created. This was the first time since the Korean War in 1950 that it was reported the U.S. Marine forces, planes, and various warships could be swept in herd to the Korean peninsula like a pack of wolves. The reason the world is watching the Korean peninsula with grave concern is because it is considered that a new nuclear war might erupt right here. Currently, the United States is devising a sinister plot to commit to the Korean war not only its elite force from its mainland, but also the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces occupying South Korea that are familiar with our country's topography and most of the U.S. armed forces stationed in Okinawa, Japan. Moreover, the heads of the U.S. military are dispatching in advance its aircraft carriers and submarines to places that will be favorable in their operations. The U.S. Naval fleet consisted of 30 ships, and the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson have not only been already mobilized near the waters of our country, but on 24 March the U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, Birmingham entered Yokosuka port. On the surface, the United States is finding fault with us by saying that it is dissatisfied with the nuclear inspection on us and so on, but this is only an excuse. In reality, the series of military moves prove that the United States is expanding step by step its oppressive strategy on Korea in accordance with the war scenario it already wrote. Moreover, what cannot be overlooked is the fact that reports are being made that U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will crawl into South Korea and Japan to personally examine and command on-the-spot the conditions for promoting military operations. Historically, this kind of act is carried out frequently on the eve of war. Such was the case during the 1950 Korean war and during the 1990 Persian Gulf war. We are dealing with high vigilance over the fact that the U.S. defense secretary is personally acting as the leader in preparing to invade us. Currently the United States formed a special strike force to revive the adventurous military operation, which was carried out in Grenada and Panama, against our republic. However, the United States can by no means frighten our people through this kind of barbarous operation and achieve its goal. As we have repeatedly elucidated, we don't want war, but we are by no means afraid of war. We are ready for both dialogue and war. The attempt to swallow us up is a foolish act of trying to break a boulder deeply rooted in the center of the earth, with a rotten egg. No one can touch our sacred territory and defame our nation's dignity. Those who enjoy fire die by being burnt without exception. The United States must not carry out rash and thoughtless acts. It will be favorable for the United States to correctly see who it is dealing with and act rationally.
