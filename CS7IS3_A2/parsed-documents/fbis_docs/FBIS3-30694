Kwasniewski said that "there are serious problems which should not be underrated," but declined to give a clear cut answer to reporters' questions about the possible resignation of Vice-Premier and Finance Minister Marek Borowski. The leader of SLD declared that "it would certainly be the worst way out if we provoked a major rift within the ruling coalition or a political conflict on a national scale" and added that there were numerous possibilities of avoiding such a scenario. According to Kwasniewski, neither his alliance nor the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) of Prime Minister pawlak had at the present time any alternative to the current coalition arrangment. What was needed was a better coordination of their activities. Referring to the expected topics of his Thursday night meeting with Pawlak, Kwasniewski said he wanted to discuss not only the style and manners of making politics but a few fundamental questions as well. They were the mode of operation of the government and economic concepts. In this connection Kwasniewski spoke critically about opinions on economic issues voiced recently by PSL politicians such as the minister for foreign economic cooperation, the chairman of the Sejm Privatization Committee and the prime minister.
