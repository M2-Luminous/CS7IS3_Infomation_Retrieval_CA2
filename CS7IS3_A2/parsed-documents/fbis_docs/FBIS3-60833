But, it seems, some of the opposing factions in that country have not as yet learned from the past hard experience since they've done it again. A massive bomb explosion wrecked the headquarters of the Christian Phalange Party in Beirut yesterday (Monday) as a result of which two innocent people were killed and dozens of others were injured. The Christian Phalange Party was responsible for some of Lebanon's cruellest acts of crime during that country's decade and half years old civil war that came to a partial end in 1991. But despite their poor past performance record the bombing, or the act of planting it, was most unwarranted, a big mistake and an act of utmost narrow-mindedness. This latest act of terrorism is bound to breathe new life in the old and evil religious and factional animus, and trigger a new round of vengefulness, destruction and killing. What is most unfortunate is that in this midst a series of most innocent people, who have nothing to do with the dirty game of politics and political rivalry, will most likely pay the price. In yesterday's bombing two people, including a young boy, who had nothing to do with the Phalange Party or its activities, were killed. Also according to the reports, panic-stricken residents of the buildings around the party headquarters shouted hysterically as they forced their way through the wreckage to find their loved ones. Words alone cannot describe the dastardliness and the cruelness of the act. One has to put himself in the shoes of those whose loved ones were killed or maimed by the bombing to grasp the extent of the crime. Why? Why not put the blind evil of hate behind? Bomb attacks were frequent during the civil war, and whether the terrorists like to admit it or not, in Lebanon bombings have run their course. They are ineffective weapons of persuasion and can't make a dent in anybody's mind except perhaps foster hatred -- what Lebanon can and must do without. The bombings harm everyone including the very people or groups they are supposed to help. The experience of using a bomb as a means of furthering one's political goal has not been successful in that country, and the only thing they have managed to bring about is to make the whole of Lebanon measurably poorer, irrespective of one's religious or party affiliation. Lebanon is like a boat and all the Lebanese people in it will either be saved by reaching the shore (of prosperity) or sink together. One bad thing about terrorist bombings is that they scare off tourists who bring badly needed foreign exchange into that country, as well as investments by affluent Lebanese expatriates or foreign companies. After all who would want to get caught in the crossfire of bombings? Not only that the rich Lebanese, who would want to bring their moneys into Lebanon and invest there, would be scared off, but also the friendly countries and international lending institutions which have made their contributions and loans contingent upon progress in the national reconciliation process, and in general, Lebanon's peace and stability would be forced to have a change of mind. The different Lebanese factions must have learned by now that Lebanon should have a place for all legitimate religions and political religious groups with no exception. And that the different factions will have to put their human and material resources together if they want to see Lebanon on a development course again. Those responsible for the planting of the bomb at the Phalange Party headquarters must have not grown enough to understand the wastefulness and folly of their act. But one thing is plenty clear: Those behind the act are not just the enemies of the phalangists but also their own party, clan, families, and in short the enemies of Lebanon and every individual in it. A word of advice for the phalangists: Nothing in life is as sweet as the exercise of prudence and forgiveness. However, before they begin thinking about quenching their sense of revenge by killing innocent people and destroying their life-earned properties, the phalangists should look into their own political setup to make sure the bomb was not an inside job by the ultra-inept who would like to see a resurgence of religious and factional enmity in Lebanon.
