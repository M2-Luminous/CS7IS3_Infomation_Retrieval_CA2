Not because the EAEC could turn out to be contrary to Australian interests. After all, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir proposed the EAEC as a regional forum expressly excluding the "white" economies of North America, Australia and New Zealand (all members of the Australian-initiated Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation [APEC] group). But over the past year, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, seemed to represent a sensible view that we had little to gain by making direct attacks on EAEC, and possibly something to lose. Now Senator McMullan says our Government has a "distinct preference" that the "EAEC either not go ahead or not get any additional significance because we think it would be divisive in the region". He also emphasised that even if Australia were allowed to join, our Government would still think EAEC wrong in "principle". It may have been wiser to wait and see how both APEC and EAEC develop, and how the relationship between the two grows. The war of words over the two bodies had eased after last year's ASEAN meeting in Singapore. A compromise was effected whereby Malaysia's EAEC would go ahead, but as a caucus within APEC. Australia was assured that the EAEC would not be allowed to develop in a divisive manner. At that time Senator Evans implied Australia should moderate its public attacks on the EAEC. Moderation had several things in its favour. Little would be gained by provoking Dr Mahathir. In any event, it was premature to make judgments about the direction of the EAEC. Indeed, since Singapore, there has been a strong push within ASEAN and among Australian trade experts, including Professor Ross Garnaut, for the EAEC eventually to be opened to Australia. Conversely, departing from moderation as Senator McMullan has done carries risks. Over the past year a view has arisen in regional capitals, including Tokyo, that APEC has grown so large that it risks losing coherence as a grouping. There has also been concern that it could be too subject to American influence. That influence is resented when it is seen to try to impose trade quotas on Japan, link China's trade with human rights, and Indonesia's with labour rights. The United States is also using its influence to try to thwart the EAEC, and the danger for Australia in openly attacking that body is that we may be seen within the region as a stalking horse for American influence. What Senator McMullan -- and presumably the Government -- seems to be forgetting is that Australia's interests in the region should be paramount. APEC was an Australian initiative and a diplomatic triumph. In the long term it should not matter if Australia's self-interest is also served by a non-discriminatory EAEC or a link between the free trade areas of ASEAN and Australia-New Zealand, or by some combination of these all within the framework of APEC and operating under the new GATT rules. We should not risk limiting our options at what is still a relatively early stage of our integration with this dynamic region.
