FR941206-0-00160 FR941206-0-00019 The EPA believes that the commenters claiming that removing ``permit-as-a-shield'' will be disruptive to TSDF implementation planning are greatly overstating the adverse or disruptive effects that an accelerated implementation will have on TSDF owner and operator planning and operations because the control technologies for the different kinds of management units are varied and widely available. The EPA specifically considered the costs and economic impacts of the various control options in the regulatory impact analysis for the proposed rule (RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;91&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00494). Based on this analysis, the EPA found that the costs of installing and operating air emission control equipment required by the control options are projected to be less than 1 percent of the total cost of hazardous waste management at TSDF. Any air emission control equipment supply availability constraints resulting from these rules should be short term, if at all. Furthermore, TSDF owners and operators required to install air emission control equipment to comply with the subpart CC standards are allowed up to an additional 30 months after the rule's effective date to complete the equipment design and installation if they can document that the air emission controls cannot be installed and operating by the effective date, for reasons such as the unavailability of control equipment. Also, the EPA expects that many TSDF owners and operators will choose to treat their hazardous waste earlier in the management sequence that they now do to reduce the organic content of the waste in accordance with one of the treatment requirements allowed for in the final subpart CC standards, and thus avoid the cost of installing and operating the control equipment on the downstream tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. The EPA also encourages the use of pollution prevention techniques as a means of reducing the quantity of waste generated, the organic concentration of the waste, or the toxicity of constituents in the waste. F. Waste Stabilization in Tanks Just prior to the long-scheduled and publicly-known promulgation date, representatives from the hazardous waste treatment industry notified the EPA of their opinion that the draft requirements for waste stabilization operations performed in tanks are economically and technically infeasible. These draft requirements are included in a May 19, 1994 interim review draft of the final rule, made publicly available in June 1994. (See RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00509.) Moreover, the industry indicated that volatilization of organic constituents during stabilization operations are negligible. No data were submitted to the EPA in support of these assertions. Industry representatives nevertheless feel strongly that for the majority of waste streams treated by stabilization, the organic constituents in the waste are not volatilized during the stabilization process. Additionally, they allege that for these same stabilization operations: (1) It is technically infeasible to comply with the air emission control requirements for tanks in the subpart CC standards; and (2) It is not feasible to treat organic waste prior to stabilization such that the volatile organic concentration of the waste entering the stabilization process would be below 100 ppmw, and the downstream units managing the waste (including the stabilization tanks) would thereby be exempt from subpart CC tank control requirements. (See RCRA docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESF&hyph;FFFFF.) These statements contradict the conclusions drawn by the EPA based on site visits to observe hazardous waste stabilization processes, and experiments and studies conducted by the EPA to characterize waste stabilization processes and estimate associated organic emissions. The most recent EPA studies were mentioned in the Notice of Data Availability (see 57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) and were made available for public review and comment in the docket for this rulemaking (see RCRA docket number F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;FFFFF). No comments were received concerning the validity of these stabilization study conclusions. At the same time, however, and despite the inappropriate timing of industry's comments on this issue (compounded by the industry's failure to comment on the information presented by the Notice of Data Availability), the EPA has determined that it may be worthwhile to review pertinent data for current waste stabilization activities at hazardous waste TSDF. Industry has pledged to provide detailed data from an emissions test conducted to measure organic emissions from a full-scale stabilization operation treating hazardous waste streams. The test will be conducted using the EPA approved sampling and analytical methods, and the volatile organic concentration of the waste streams will be measured using Method 25D, with gas chromatography and with mass spectrometry (see RCRA docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESF&hyph;FFFFF). The EPA will accept until September 6, 1995 all pertinent information and comments on the following limited issues: (1) Volatilization of organics during waste stabilization activities, (2) feasibility of treating organic wastes to destroy or remove organics prior to stabilization to immobilize toxic metals, and (3) alternative organic emission controls applicable to stabilization tanks. Persons interested in submitting comments or data pertaining to these issues should notify the EPA of their intent by contacting Ms. Michele Aston at the address listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section at the beginning of this preamble. Written information and comments regarding the above issues should be mailed to the RCRA Docket Office (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, room 2616, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Please send an original and two copies of all information, and refer to RCRA docket number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESA&hyph;FFFFF. The EPA will assess all submitted information, and will make a rapid determination whether to amend the requirements under the subpart CC standards being promulgated today for tanks in which waste stabilization operations are performed. The EPA emphasizes that the current record does not support any amendment to these standards. However, if the EPA were to amend the requirements for stabilization tanks, the amendment could include any of the provisions described below, a modification of today's promulgated requirements, or possibly other options.
