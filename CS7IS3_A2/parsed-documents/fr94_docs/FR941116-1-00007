Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Limited, AVRO International Aerospace Division (Formerly British Aerospace, plc; British Aerospace Commercial Aircraft Limited): Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;126&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and &hyph;300A series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To correct generator control units (GCU) that may have the under-frequency trip level set too high, which could lead to the unwanted shut down of an electrical generator, accomplish the following: (a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, check the part and serial number on the data plate of each generator control unit (GCU). If the part number is one of those affected and the serial number is listed in Addendum 1 of GEC-Marconi Service Bulletin HGE 24&hyph;23, dated March 11, 1994, prior to further flight, conduct a closed loop test to determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level, in accordance with that service bulletin. (1) If the level exceeds that specified in GEC-Marconi Service Bulletin HGE 24&hyph;23, dated March 11, 1994, prior to further flight, adjust the level in accordance with that service bulletin; or replace the GCU with a serviceable unit, in accordance with Avro Service Bulletin S.B. 24&hyph;103, dated March 24, 1994. (2) Prior to further flight, after adjustment or replacement of the GCU as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this AD, conduct the post assembly testing in accordance with Avro Service Bulletin S.B. 24&hyph;103, dated March 24, 1994. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on November 9, 1994. S.R. Miller, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
