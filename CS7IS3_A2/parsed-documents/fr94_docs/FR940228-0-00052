FR940228-0-00052 FR940228-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 17 RIN 2900&hyph;AG72 To Amend the Travel Authority for Beneficiaries Who Are in Receipt of Pension AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending the regulations that govern its program to provide for the transportation of claimants and beneficiaries to VA health care facilities. The amendments will correct an inadvertent error made when the Department last promulgated regulations pertaining to this program in 1991. This amendment will delete an inaccurate reference to beneficiaries who are in receipt of pension as not subject to a travel deductable. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Monica J. Wilkins, Policies and Procedures Division (161B1), Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420; Phone (202) 535&hyph;7439. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 21, 1991, the Department of Veterans Affairs amended its regulations governing the beneficiary travel program to implement changes in law made by Public Law 100&hyph;322. Generally, that law authorized the Government to pay for travel for certain categories of veterans but imposed a ``deductible'' on the amount of the benefit. Other categories of veterans could receive travel benefits without having to pay the deductible. The 1991 amendments to the implementing regulations correctly provided that a veteran in receipt of pension benefits was required to pay a deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(b)(3)). However, in another place, the same regulation inadvertently provided that a veteran in receipt of VA pension benefits could receive transportation expenses without being subject to the deductible. (See: 38 CFR 17.100(c)(3)). The latter provision is inconsistent with the law, and this amendment will correct that error. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. This regulation concerned the provision of beneficiary travel to a specified category of eligible veterans. No paperwork, administrative or other regulatory burdens are imposed upon small entities. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers are 64.009, 64.010 and 64.011.
