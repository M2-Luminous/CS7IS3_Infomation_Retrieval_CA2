In view of the different images of these two publications, the symbiosis seems rather odd: In St. Petersburg CHAS PIK claims to be the "newspaper of the intelligentsia." As President Anatoliy Yezhelev of the Chas Pik Publishing House, a joint-stock company, told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent, the weekly, like other newspapers in St. Petersburg, is under considerable financial strain: "The newspaper needs a sound investor to move up to a new qualitative level, and this could take hundreds of millions of rubles." CHAS PIK plans to begin by becoming a daily newspaper and attracting advertising revenue. Anatoliy Yezhelev explained that the talks with MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS had just begun, and that the discussion concerned the creation of a joint news and commercial service in St. Petersburg and Moscow. As the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent later learned, however, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already been offered a package of CHAS PIK stock at face value by one of the weekly's main shareholders--the UniREM joint venture. Other shareholders--two city banks and the St. Petersburg Union of Journalists--own a negligible percentage of the stock. The main stockholders are the members of the newspaper labor collective. The CHAS PIK journalists told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent that persistent attempts were being made to force them to sign a "quit-claim" to their employee stock. Many members of the collective have already signed papers of this kind, possibly in the fear of administrative penalties. Only a few have refused, and they want to know why MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS was chosen as the investor and what kind of policies it intends to pursue after it gets the controlling share of the stock. Anatoliy Yezhelev explained the choice of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS as a matter of pure ethics: "We received extremely tempting bids for our stock from large financial corporations, but we do not want to fall under the influence of the banks--we would rather deal with our journalist colleagues."
