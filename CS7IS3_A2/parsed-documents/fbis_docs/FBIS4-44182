Kinkel said today on the fringes of a meeting of the FDP executive in Bonn that the party's overall image had not been good in recent months. However, the FDP at land level [Saxony-Anhalt FDP] had also contributed to the election defeat. Kinkel announced a "motivation campaign" by the FDP at national level for the summer, but also particularly in the regional associations in Saxony, Bavaria, and Brandenburg where landtag elections are still to take place. The aim is to lay greater emphasis on the function and policies of the FDP under the motto "Germany needs the liberals."
