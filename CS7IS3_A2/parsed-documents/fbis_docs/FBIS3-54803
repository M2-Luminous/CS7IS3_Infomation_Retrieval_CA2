Is this the case? For instance, in the elections to the Moscow City Duma, people were entitled to vote either for one of the candidates or against all of them. It turned out that if voters supported one candidate, their votes against the other candidates seemingly did not exist. And that is not all. Those voters who were opposed to all the candidates were deprived of their votes. Their ballot papers were not taken into account. Do you not believe me? You want to see it for yourself? Be my guest! Let's look at the voting returns: Electoral District No. 1. M.I. Moskvin-Tarkhanov elected. He won the votes of 29,180 Muscovites. Votes against all candidates -- and, consequently, against him too -- came to 37,681. Electoral District No. 2. N.M. Moskovchenko elected. "For" -- 18,017. "Against" -- 30,379. Electoral District No. 3. S.A. Goncharov elected. "For" -- 16,881. "Against" -- 19,561. Electoral District No. 4. V.G. Makarov elected. "For" -- 23,440. "Against" -- 26,367. And so on in all the districts bar four. And in nine of the 35 districts the number of those who voted against all candidates was more than 10,000 greater than the number of votes gained by the candidate who became deputy. Particularly noteworthy was District No. 18. There the elected deputy won 27,091 votes, but there were 42,153 votes against all candidates -- some 15,000 more. In the four districts where the balance was positive, the situation was as follows: District No. 4. -- S.Yu. Osadchiy: "for" 24,471, "against all" 23,662; District No. 21 -- S.Yu. Zhuravlev: "for" -- 35,393, "against" 30,433; District No. 26 -- S.O. Shokhin: "for" 32,531, "against" 31,427; District No. 28 -- V.K. Plotnikov: "for" 30,540, "against" 26,429. I repeat that this was even though voters had the chance to vote not against any specific candidate but against the whole pack. Why was this possible? The State Duma elections were regulated by three legal acts -- the appendix to presidential edict No. 1400 of 21 September, presidential edict No. 1557 of 1 October, and presidential edict No. 1846 of 6 November. Under this last edict the "Statute on State Duma Elections" lost the requirement that the number of votes cast "for" a candidate should be greater than the number of votes cast "against." But it said nothing about the city duma. It is not known who removed the similar requirement from the Statute on City Duma Elections, when it was done, or on what grounds. So it transpires that in Moscow -- a city of many millions -- only four deputies won a majority. [Shumilina ends] From the PRAVDA Editorial Office: We do not want to offend anyone or -- God forbid! -- suspect anyone of impropriety. But several questions have arisen, and the answers to them would allow us and our readers to have no doubts that we have moved from the Year of Democracy into the Year of Great Democracy. If the answers are forthcoming from the numerous delegations of foreign observers, we will be very grateful. Thus: 1. Is the form of the single-seat ballot paper for individual elections of deputies fair and democratic when it is proposed that the duly elected person be determined not by crossing out the names of the others but merely by placing a mark against the name of the favored person? And, if it is democratic, then how do those who voted "against everyone" differ from those who did not vote? 2. Were any foreign observers constantly present at Central Electoral Commission information bureaus during the two-week computation of the overall election results? And what is the explanation for the fact that the information on the voting results in the regions on a Russia-wide scale varied so markedly during different times -- in the first three days, after a week, and finally? 3. Do the esteemed foreign observers think it logical that Russians should have heard a great deal about their official presence in our country, but should never have seen their official views of the results? We hope that our Russia-wide issues will not overshadow the main city-level question put to the relevant authorities by the writer of the above note. In any event, we would like some clarification -- were deputies elected to the city duma like this or?... Happy New Year, esteemed readers!
