"I cannot realize how individuals that were called restorers of the historical rights of Romanians in Bessarabia, now doubt this right, saying we are two peoples, we have two languages, we should have two hymns, two flags." According to the senator, reasons for such a state of things should be sought, as "something happened" in the meantime. "We should not haste and attack these people until we find the reasons, and if there is nothing more to do after that, we must finally accept relations of adversaries," the interviewed adds. In his opinion, Snegur risks to remain in history as he was the last time, "without hopes for the Romanian people and for his biography." "To a certain extent, I am ready to understand him, but I cannot accept him pulling out my eye and saying he wishes me good, placing instead another taken from a Moscow pharmacy," asserted Paunescu, mentioning that "Snegur will be sentenced to become Romanian post-mortem."
