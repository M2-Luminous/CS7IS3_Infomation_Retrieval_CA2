In an exclusive statement to MENA in Beirut, he said that this Israeli reasoning is unacceptable and Israel has to respect the agreement and withdraw on the dates set down in the agreement. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid rejected the Israeli claims that these dates are not sacred, adding: Otherwise, why would the agreement mention them? No Arab negotiator can accept this. He stressed that the dates are sacred and must be respected. The Arab League secretary general said that Israel's noncompliance with these agreements will affect the Washington negotiations. He expressed fear that Israel would lose its credibility in the agreements that it will conclude. He stressed the need to continue the peace negotiations despite the difficulties, adding that the continuation of the negotiations is necessary to restore our legitimate rights. He also stressed that peace is not a gift from Israel to the Arab countries and that the peace being asked from the Arab countries is also asked from Israel, which will benefit more from it; this imposes on it commitments that it must implement and respect. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid called on the Security Council to be fair in implementing its resolutions and not to have double standards when it comes to implementing the resolutions that represent international legitimacy and which include Resolution 425, which demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon. On the future of his own initiative to bring about Arab reconciliation, the Arab League secretary general said: The Arab countries must get together in solidarity to unite ranks and positions. He noted that his initiative aimed at achieving Arab solidarity based on a common basis despite the differences among some Arab countries. He added: I stressed in my initiative that we should be frank before we have reconciliation. This does not mean that we should forget the past as if nothing had happened but whoever did wrong must rectify his error so that we can turn over a new leaf that will achieve unity in the Arab destiny.
