"Although there's speculation that the SDP will join a third coalition government by returning to the fold or it may form a grand alliance with the LDP to force a dissolution of the House of Representatives, while the multiseat constituency system is still in place, such moves would be contrary to the momentum of history," he said. Hosokawa was speaking about recent political developments at a party in a Tokyo hotel to mark the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New Party [JNP], which he founded in 1992. The statements were Hosokawa's first public remarks since the administration of his successor, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, was launched April 25 following Hosokawa's fall from grace amid allegations about his shadowy personal finances. The speech came shortly before an alleged rightist assailant fired a shot in the Keio Plaza Hotel. The assailant, Masakatsu Nozoe, was quickly overpowered and later claimed shooting at the ceiling in a show of protest against Hosokawa. "Although the withdrawal of the SDP from the ruling coalition was prompted by the formation of the unified parliamentary bloc, Kaishin (Innovation), it constituted a part of the historical adjustment process of the 1955 system," Hosokawa said. The 1955 system refers to the fundamental power balance of the LDP-led conservative political camp and the SDP-led left-leaning opposition camp, which had been in place since 1955, when the LDP was formed from the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. Hosokawa refuted allegations that the days of the Japan New Party are numbered due to public disillusion with the party following the Hosokawa scandal. "If the public thinks that the JNP's role no longer exists due to the fall of the Hosokawa administration, we have to stir up our courage against such a perception," he said. The JNP made an impressive debut on the national political scene during last July's general election, when the party won 35 seats in the powerful lower chamber after its anticorruption campaign attracted corruption-weary voters.
