Fighting is continuing in the region, and the reports coming from there are very contradictory. Thus, Abkhaz sources reported yesterday evening a victory in the Kodori gorge; Georgian sources refute this report. In our bulletin tonight, we have reportage from both sides of the trenches: [Begin recording] [Correspondent Medeya Akhalkatsi] Since nightfall, Abkhaz formations have been carrying out very intensive shelling against the Georgian mountain village of Zemo-Lada using heavy equipment, mortars, and large-caliber artillery. The Gudauta side has begun using banned phosphorous shells and Grad systems. Several helicopters are periodically bringing in additional personnel and military equipment from the direction of Sukhumi. Despite this, Georgian border troops and volunteer units are managing to contain the attack and to hold their positions. There are dozens of dead and wounded on both sides as a result of the constant battles. There are also casualties among the civilian population. Thousands of people are leaving their homes and swelling the already large list of displaced persons. Women and children are being evacuated first. [Correspondent Ruslan Khashig] The situation in the Kodori gorge in Abkhazia is fully under the control of the republic's armed forces today. The government of Abkhazia is taking urgent measures these days to normalize life in the villages of Nizhnyaya and Verkhnyaya Lata. Local authorities are being restored, and foodstuffs are being delivered there. As a result of the operation, units of Georgian troops who had been dug in at Lata since last autumn have now been driven out. These units are currently blockaded in the mountain village of Azhara.
