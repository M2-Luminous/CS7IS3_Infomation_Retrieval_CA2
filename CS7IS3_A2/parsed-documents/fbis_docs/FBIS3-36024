This was announced to Interfax by the committee's Chief Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist Party's faction). In his opinion, it was necessary to utilize the provisions of the former law on Constitutional Court, which did not contradict the new Constitution adopted at the referendum on December 12, before a new law on Constitutional Court was adopted. He reminded that the Russian Federation's constituent members were energetically issuing new laws and acts which at times failed to conform with the Russian Constitution. Ilyukhin also qualified several decrees of the Russian president as "non-constitutional." According to Ilyukhin, the president exceeded his powers when signing the decree on elimination of the Security Ministry and on establishment of the Federal Service of Counter-Intelligence subordinated to the Russian president. According to the deputy, the new Russian Constitution does not mention the right of the president to resubordinate the ministries. Ilyukhin considers this move aimed at establishing a second government parallel with the cabinet of Chernomyrdin. Ilyukhin is concerned over the fact that Yeltsin may not be satisfied with resubordination of intelligence and counter-intelligence and that he "harbors the idea to resubordinate the Interior Ministry and the army." According to Ilyukhin, this is to say that these bodies will be beyond judicial and prosecutor's control and also beyond the parliament's control" leaving them uncontrollable as during the Stalin era.
