FR940603-2-00010 FR940603-2-00009 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;201&hyph;802] Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review Gray Portland Cement and Clinker From Mexico AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration/Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on gray portland cement and clinker from Mexico. The review covers exports of this merchandise to the United States during the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993, and one firm, CEMEX, S.A. The results of this review indicate the existence of dumping margins for the period. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gabriel Adler, Officer of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1757. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 3, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 41239) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' for the August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993, period of review (POR) of the antidumping duty order on gray portland cement and clinker from Mexico (55 FR 35371, August 29, 1990). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22, CEMEX, S.A. (CEMEX) and the petitioners, the Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement and the National Cement Co. of California, Inc., requested a review. On September 30, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping Review'' for CEMEX (58 FR 51053). Thus, the Department is now conducting a review of this respondent pursuant to section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of Review The products covered by this review include gray portland cement and clinker. Gray portland cement is a hydraulic cement and the primary component of concrete. Clinker, an intermediate material product produced when manufacturing cement, has no use other than of being ground into finished cement. Gray portland cement is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 2523.29, and cement clinker is currently classifiable under number 2523.10. Gray portland cement has also been entered under number 2523.90 as ``other hydraulic cements.'' The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service (the Customs Service) purposes only. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. Best Information Available On October 14, 1993, we sent CEMEX a standard antidumping questionnaire which instructed CEMEX to report U.S. sales and home market sales of such or similar merchandise. In a letter dated November 16, 1993, CEMEX requested that it be excused from reporting home market sales of Type I cement, merchandise similar but not identical to Type II and Type V cement. CEMEX noted that during the POR it had sold only Type II and Type V cement in the United States, and stated that it had sufficient home market sales of these types of cement in the home market for a fair value comparison. CEMEX argued that, in accordance with statutory requirements and the Department's practice, fair value comparisons should, wherever possible, be based upon sales of identical merchandise, and therefore there was no need to report home market sales of Type I cement. In a letter dated November 29, 1993, we denied CEMEX's request. We noted that in the second administrative review, covering the period August 1, 1991, through July 31, 1992, we had found that CEMEX's home market sales of Type II and Type V cement had not been made in the ordinary course of trade and we had disregarded those sales for comparison purposes. We noted that, given such a finding in a previous review, it was possible that a similar situation might exist with regard to home market sales of Type II and Type V cement in the instant review. We therefore required CEMEX to report home market sales of Type I cement. On January 10, 1994, CEMEX responded to our standard questionnaire. In its response, CEMEX did not provide the required information regarding home market sales of Type I cement. Rather, CEMEX argued that in its view its home market sales of Type II and Type V cement had always been made in the ordinary course of trade, and constituted sufficient basis for a fair value comparison. On February 4, 1994, we issued a supplementary questionnaire to CEMEX that, among other things, reiterated the requirement that CEMEX report its home market sales of Type I cement. We emphasized that these sales relevant to CEMEX's claim that its home market sales of Type II and Type V cement had been made in the ordinary course of trade during the period of the third review. We noted in the cover letter that lack or incompleteness of response might result in our relying on best information available (BIA).
