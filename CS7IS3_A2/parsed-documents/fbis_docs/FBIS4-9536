Maciej Jankowski added that the strike should not interrupt everyday life in towns and cities. [Begin recording] [Jankowski] I suppose that about 1,000 enterprises will join the strike. In Warsaw alone, all of the big enterprises expressed readiness and are prepared for it. These are: the FSO [small car plant], the Warsaw steelworks, Elemis, the Wola-Rawar arms enterprise, and Ursus [tractor enterprise], as always. [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a classic strike?. [Jankowski] Yes, a strike including the halting of production. In tens of enterprises, sirens will be sounded, flags displayed, and rallies organized. All large leading enterprises have stopped because there is no other way. [end recording] According to Maciej Jankowski, the strike was announced because there was no will on the part of the government to implement solutions put forward by the Solidarity and approved by specialists.
