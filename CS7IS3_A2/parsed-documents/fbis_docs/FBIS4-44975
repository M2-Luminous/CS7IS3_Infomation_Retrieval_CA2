Katyal: "Kashmiris Fed Up With Militancy, Feel Envoys"] [Text] New Delhi, May 2. The third group of Ambassadors, which visited Jammu and Kashmir last week, returned with the dominant impression that the people there were fed up with the prolonged dislocation of their daily lives and craved for an early return of normality. Though the Huriyat leaders in Srinagar did not see the Ambassadors -- ten of them, mostly from the Muslim and Latin American countries -- they were able to get a complete picture of the situation there. They were briefed by the State Governor, Gen. (Retd.) K.V. Krishna Rao, and various others like the former Chief Minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, the representative of human rights organisation and spokesmen of the migrants. During their stay in Jammu, they saw two Huriyat leaders, Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ahmed Shah Gilani, in jail. Contrary to the account given by official sources here, the group's assessment was a mixed affair, but New Delhi has no reason to be unhappy about it. The Ambassadors found the Kashmir problem highly complex which needed to be resolved politically, not through force. The situation did not admit of any "unsettling" solution, according to them. They did not find any indication of the political process which, as claimed by the Government, had been initiated, of late. At the same time, they found evidence of external backing to militancy (the source of this support, obviously, is the Pakistan-occupied areas of Kashmir, but the group preferred not to identify it). Ordinary citizens of the State, both in the valley and in Jammu, according to the group's assessment, would like the violence to end and the situation brought back to normal. They complained of having been squeezed by the two-sided violence, by the militants, on the one hand, and the security forces, on the other -- and would like the situation to settle soon. The visiting Envoys were impressed by the representatives of the migrants, belonging to both the communities, who narrated their tales of woe. At another level, Mr. Lone and Mr. Gilani took an extreme line, of the type followed by the militants. Also, they complained of the treatment meted out to them in the jail, especially objecting that they had been clubbed with ordinary convicts. No Cause for Complaint Confirming the accounts earlier emanating from Srinagar, the Ambassadors found no cause for complaint about the arrangements for their trip. They did not blame the authorities for the episode at Srinagar where the leaders of Huriyat insisted on the Ambassadors coming to its office in the downtown area, rejecting the suggestions for a meeting either at the tourist complex or at the residence of the Mir Wahiz, one of the leading lights of the organisation, near Nagin Lake. The two groups of the Delhi-based Ambassadors who had gone to the State earlier, had found the Huriyat leaders speaking with several voices. This umbrella organisation of 33 groups, big and small, conveyed differing views on the modalities for resolving the present deadlock and putting an end to violence -- and though extreme sentiments were articulated by most of them, some others were either non-committal or chose to prevaricate, and avoided taking extreme postures. To claim, as official sources did today, that the impressions of the Envoys represented a change in the attitude of their Governments towards India is a case of inverted logic. As a matter of fact, the observations of the visiting Ambassadors would help their Governments to see the situation in a proper perspective instead of being influenced by Pakistan's propaganda.
