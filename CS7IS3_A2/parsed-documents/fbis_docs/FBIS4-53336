Some 160 participants, including 20 Chinese delegates from cities such as Xian and Shanghai, will discuss ideas on further promoting exchanges and mutual understanding. The delegates are expected to offer ideas on youth exchanges as well as city planning and management, organizers said. The conference, hosted by the Japan-China Friendship Association, is the first of its kind to be held on such a large scale, organizers said. The western Japanese port city of Kobe and Tianjin, southeast of Beijing, were the first to conclude sister-city ties in June 1973 and since then some 150 similar sets of ties have been established. Nara was selected as the site of the symposium because of the ancient capital's history of dispatching envoys to China from the seventh to ninth centuries.
