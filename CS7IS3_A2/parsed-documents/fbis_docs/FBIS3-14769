North Ossetian president Akhsarbek galazov supported the pronouncement and said "the interested sides should have a chance to agree between themselves and the federal bodies should listen to the opinion of regional representatives". He added they have agreed with Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev on further negotiations. Aushev agreed with Galazov, but said "they should remember about refugees". In his words, the participation in the conciliatory commission has brought no results and the North Ossetian president should name the exact date of his solution of the Ingush refugee problem.
