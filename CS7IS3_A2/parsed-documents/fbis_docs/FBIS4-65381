In Vienna, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative on Cyprus, are trying hard to find ways to amend the 21 March UN document, with the goal of persuading the Turks and Turkish Cypriots to agree to the implementation of the confidence-building measures. U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher said clearly: "We will consider alternative ways if the effort to implement the confidence-building measures fails." Boucher questioned the 21 March UN document--although the UN secretary general and UN Security Council adopted it--and said the goal is to reach an agreement on the original confidence-building measures package, exactly as Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas wants. The U.S. diplomat reiterated that the United States and the United Nations will make every effort to implement the confidence-building measures. They are also discussing the upcoming report that the UN secretary general will submit to the Security Council. Boucher said the effort on the confidence-building measures is not dead and added that "if there is another way to implement the measures, an effort will be made to find it." Boucher refrained from commenting on the Vienna talks. But, according to reliable sources, eight points of the 21 March document--identified by Lamb during his talks in Nicosia earlier this month--are being discussed. Feissel, representing the United Nations, and two representatives of Denktas are participating in the talks. The U.S. coordinator and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevic attended the talks as "observers." Speaking for the Cypriot Government, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis stressed that "there are no prospects for progress in the Vienna talks."
