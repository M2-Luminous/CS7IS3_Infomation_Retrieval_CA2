The "leading edge" of this development work is intended for aviation and rocket-space machine building. Russian development firms have strong technological positions in this field, which enabled them relatively successfully to carry out the first stage of entry into the world market: about 20% of the financing of the programs is now accounted for by foreign contracts. The representatives of the leading Russian enterprises -- NPO VIAM, NPO Kompozit and others -- became frequent guests of Western colleagues: in particular, a delegation of the NPO VIAM during the past week held scheduled consultations with the Dassault Company and other French partners. Our reviewer Sergey Morgachev and our expert Igor Vershinin comment on the situation in this market. World market for aerospace materials Results of Technological Race Russian enterprises have a general advantage over Western competitors with respect to metallic materials for aerospace technology. In the case of ceramics one can speak in general of parity, although the relation of capabilities with respect to different types of materials is different. With respect to composite materials, the United States has the general advantage, although in this field as well some Russian developments are entirely competitive. Specialists point out the leadership of Russian firms with respect to the strength and plastic qualities of alloys based on aluminum, molybdenum and niobium with their high melting points, as well as intermetallide compounds, and heat-resistant nickel alloys. The All- Russian Institute of Aviation Materials (NPO VIAM) stands out as the leading firm for conceptual development work, whereas experimental production is for the most part concentrated in the All-Russian Institute of Light Alloys (both in Moscow). Nowhere in the world is there an equal to Russian heat- and erosion- resistant protective ceramic coverings based on silicon and zirconium compounds and heat-shielding ceramics based on quartz and carbon-carbon compounds. Many of these technologies were developed in their time within the framework of the Buran program. The principal enterprises working along these lines are the NPO VIAM and the NPO Tekhnologiya. The United States, on the other hand, leads the way in another key direction in work in the ceramics field: development of construction materials for engines. Finally, Russian composite materials of the carbon-carbon and carbon- silicon carbide type, used for heat shielding of construction elements, are of equal quality to American products. The methods for producing these materials are technologically more feasible, simpler than the corresponding American methods. The key Russian firms working in this field are the NPO Kompozit and the State Scientific Research Institute for Graphite-Based Materials.

New work requires thoroughly adequate financing which can be ensured only when the entire aerospace complex emerges from its crisis and its domestic and foreign markets are restored. Direct foreign contracts for the sale of technologies concluded during the last year or two by Russian firms have proven their practical worth but are no more than a tactical solution for the problem of retaining their place among the world leaders of the branch. Among the partners who have already concluded contracts are the following: NPO VIAM and the ONERA company in France (coverings based on carbon and carbon-carbon materials); NPO VIAM and Dasso in France (attachment parts from niobium alloys with antioxidation coverings); NPO VIAM and the SEP company in France (intermetallide materials of the nickel-aluminum and titanium-aluminum type); NPO Tekhnologiya and the ONERA company in France (fibrous quartz-based heat-shielding materials); NPO Kompozit and the CSIRO company in France (carbon-based composites); NPO VIAM, NPO Tekhnologiya and Beijing Institute of Aviation Materials (nickel and titanium alloys, including equipment for their production, construction ceramics). It is assumed that the financial receipts from foreign contracts in 1993 will amount to about 1/5 of total amount of income for the firms engaged in development work on aerospace materials. Negotiations and consultations are now underway for concluding contracts between the NPO VIAM, NPO Kompozit, NPO Tekhnologiya and Rolls Royce in Great Britain, Goldschmidt G.A., MTU Munchen (Germany), United Aircraft, United Technologies and Dow Corning in the United States, and the Indian Space Agency. In addition, Russian developers of such materials evidently will receive subcontracts in connection with the Russian- American project for the orbital station Alpha. For the time being it has not come to the handing out of these orders, but hypothetically the priority in such awards will be to the Kompozit enterprise as the firm traditionally belonging to the rocket-space complex. The Russian presence in the world market is gradually expanding. American companies, not interested so much in Russian technologies as in the economic optimization of their projects by cooperation with Russia, are ready to place orders in Russia for finished products, including the development and production of materials. With respect to West European companies, they specifically covet Russian technologies (which they need, in particular, in connection with work on the HERMES and HOTOL spaceplanes). World Market The world market for materials for aerospace machine building by the beginning of the 1990's was about 15 billion dollars (including Russian production in world prices); about 1/3 of the volume of this market was accounted for by Russia. This share, unquestionably, has now undoubtedly decreased due to the general economic crisis in Russia. The United States is taking the leading role in the market. The principal group of goods, as before, remains metallic materials, despite a tendency to their being squeezed out by ceramics and composites (see diagram). Aerospace Materials The creation of modern types of aviation and space equipment requires the development of materials having enormous resistance to mechanical loads, high pressures, aggressive media, high temperatures and multiple changes in operating mode. Most of the market is accounted for by metallic materials: based on aluminum (covering of wings, structural and reinforcing components), nickel (heat-resistant components of gas turbine engines), iron (reinforcing components), titanium (structural components, skin and attachment components, lines), materials with a high melting point -- molybdenum, niobium, tungsten (nozzles, control surfaces, structural and attachment components), intermetallide compounds (high-temperature units). Ceramic materials (based on graphite, oxides, carbides, borides) are used as coverings of metals for their protection against oxidation, wear and erosion, and also as heat-shielding elements, and in the future -- as engine components. Composite materials (a combination of materials of the type metal-ceramic, ceramic-ceramic, polymer-polymer) are used as components of the skin, propellers, compressor blades, ailerons, other control surfaces and chassis, for the skins of rockets and in structural components of fuel tanks.
