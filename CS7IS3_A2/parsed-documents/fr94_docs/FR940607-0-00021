FR940607-0-00021 FR940607-0-00007 (e) Most significant issue or set of issues presented . Where the taxpayer has not substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy the taxpayer may nonetheless be a prevailing party if the taxpayer substantially prevails with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented. The issues presented include those raised as of the administrative proceeding date and those raised subsequently. Only in a multiple issue proceeding can a most significant issue or set of issues presented exist. However, not all multiple issue proceedings contain a most significant issue or set of issues presented. An issue or set of issues constitutes the most significant issue or set of issues presented if, despite involving a lesser dollar amount in the proceeding than the other issue or issues, it objectively represents the most significant issue or set of issues for the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service. This may occur because of the effect of the issue or set of issues on other transactions or other taxable years of the taxpayer or related parties. (f) Net worth and size limitations _(1) Individuals and estates . An individual taxpayer or an estate meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if, on the administrative proceeding date, the taxpayer's net worth does not exceed two million dollars. For this purpose, individuals filing a joint return shall be treated as 1 taxpayer, except in the case of a spouse relieved of liability under section 6013(e). (2) Others . A taxpayer that is an owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization (other than an organization described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if, as of the administrative proceeding date_ (i) The taxpayer's net worth does not exceed seven million dollars; and (ii) The taxpayer does not have more than 500 employees. (3) Special rule for charitable organizations and certain cooperatives . An organization described in Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) exempt from taxation under Internal Revenue Code section 501(a), or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a) (as in effect on October 22, 1986), meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if, as of the administrative proceeding date, the organization or cooperative association does not have more than 500 employees. (g) Determination of prevailing party . If the final decision with respect to the tax, interest, or penalty is made at the administrative level, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a prevailing party shall be made by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by the Internal Revenue Service. See ยง301.7430&hyph;2(c)(7) regarding the right to appeal the decision of the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable administrative costs to the Tax Court. (h) Examples . The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1 . The Internal Revenue Service, in the conduct of a correspondence examination of taxpayer A's individual income tax return, requests substantiation from A of claimed medical expenses. A does not respond to the request and the Service Center issues a notice of deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A presents sufficient information and arguments to convince a revenue agent that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. The revenue agent then closes the case showing no deficiency. Although A incurred costs after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, A is unable to recover these costs because, as of the date these costs were incurred, A had not presented relevant information under A's control and relevant legal arguments supporting A's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel. Accordingly, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified at the time the costs were incurred. Example 2 . In the purchase of an ongoing business, taxpayer B obtains from the previous owner of the business a covenant not to compete for a period of five years. On audit of B's individual income tax return for the year in which the business is acquired, the Internal Revenue Service challenges the basis assigned to the covenant not to compete and a deduction taken as a business expense for a seminar attended by B. Both parties agree that the covenant not to compete is amortizable over a period of five years. However, the Internal Revenue Service asserts that the proper basis of the covenant is $2X while the taxpayer asserts the basis is $4X. Thus, under the Internal Revenue Service's position, B is entitled to a deduction of two-fifths $X in the year under audit and for each of the subsequent four years. B's position, however, would result in a deduction of four-fifths $X for the year under audit and each of the subsequent four years. The deduction for the seminar attended by B was reported on the return in question in the amount of $X. The Internal Revenue Service's position is that the deduction for the seminar should be disallowed entirely. In the notice of deficiency, the Internal Revenue Service determines adjustments of two-fifths $X (the difference between the Internal Revenue Service's position of two-fifths $X and the reported four-fifths $X) regarding the basis of the covenant not to compete, and $X resulting from the disallowance of the seminar expense. Thus, of the two adjustments determined for the year under audit, that attributable to the disallowance of the seminar is larger than that attributable to the covenant not to compete. However, due to the impact on the next succeeding four years, the covenant not to compete adjustment is objectively the most significant issue to both B and the Internal Revenue Service.
