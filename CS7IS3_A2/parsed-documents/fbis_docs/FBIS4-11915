FBIS4-11915 "drnes064_o_94008" FBIS-NES-94-064 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 SYRIA Press on Russian, U.S. Peace Roles, Hebron Accord Press on Russian, U.S. Peace Roles, Hebron Accord JN0304081994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 3 Apr 94 JN0304081994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] TISHRIN comments editorially on the Russian deputy foreign minister's visit to Damascus to convey a message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Hafiz al-Asad. The message deals with the peace talks, which have been broken off because of Israel's intransigence, maneuvering, and refusal to respond to the peace talks' most important requirement, which is withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. TISHRIN notes that the latest round of talks in Washington following the al-Asad-Clinton summit was disappointing because of Israel's continued policy of prevarication and procrastination. Once again raising its alleged security problems, Israel evaded discussions on withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Then, the paper says, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre took place, only to consolidate the conviction that Israel is not serious about peace and that it seeks to use the talks as a cover for its aggressive, expansionist actions. TISHRIN stresses that the recent events in the occupied territories have increased the conviction of Syria and other Arab parties that any peace in the region must be based on a just, comprehensive solution that meets Arab aspirations and restores the Arab rights and territories. The paper stresses that if the Washington talks are to be successful, there is no alternative to an effective U.S., Russian, and international role that pushes for the implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Implementation of these resolutions means Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and other occupied territories. Syria has repeatedly stressed that there will be no compromise over the Golan, that there will be no peace without full withdrawal, and that Syria will not relinquish an iota of territory or any national and pan-Arab right. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Syria wants peace, but Syria will never accept the partial and separate solutions demanded by Israel. Syria has the right to urge the cosponsors of the peace process to translate their assurances into a tangible solution that spreads justice and helps international law to prevail. AL-BA'TH notes that the suspension of the latest round of bilateral peace talks in Washington was because of the Zionist settlers' brutal massacre of our kinfolk in the Ibrahimi Mosque. AL-BA'TH adds that when the UN Security Council condemned the massacre and stressed the need to provide international protection for the people of Palestine, and when it emphasized the need to continue the peace process, which is viewed as an opportunity to achieve security and stability in the region, it became necessary to continue coordination among Arab parties in order to arrive at a common decision on the resumption of the peace negotiations. This has been explicitly stressed by Syria. The paper says that so far, Israel has not shown an explicit commitment to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Nor has it shown an equal readiness to implement Resolution 425 providing for immediate Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Moreover, Israel is continuing its daily crimes against our kinfolk throughout the occupied Arab territories. The paper continues: While the U.S. Administration, which has frequently stressed its commitment to advancing the peace process, is preparing for a renewed diplomatic move prior to the resumption of bilateral talks, Russia, as one of the two cosponsors, has reasserted its readiness to play its role in the peace process. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses the need for concerted international efforts, which can lead to tangible results if they focus on changing the intransigent Israeli position. The winning card is the UN resolutions, which must be implemented, and which must not be allowed to be hampered indefinitely by the Rabin government. In a comment, AL-THAWRAH writes on the recent agreement in Cairo between Israel and the PLO, providing for the deployment of international observers in Hebron. The paper refers to a statement by Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, in which he said that the agreement will change nothing in the current state of affairs, and that it has given Israel full control over all security affairs in this city. AL-THAWRAH says that such a statement shows that this agreement is ineffective, useless, and does not have a shred of credibility to give the Palestinians even a little sense of security and tranquility. Besides, it does not give any actual guarantees for preventing the recurrence of the Zionist settlers' massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The paper adds that the agreement does not provide any tangible solution to the volatile situation in the occupied territories, a situation which is deteriorating daily as a result of the repressive Israeli practices. Nor does the agreement provide an adequate method for preventing further bloodshed there. Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says that if the Rabin government continues its maneuvers and procrastination, and if it continues to raise security pretexts to justify the policy of occupation and expansion, then it will be fooling nobody but itself by this false and deceptive logic. This is because it has become common knowledge that only a just, comprehensive peace that is accompanied by full withdrawal from all the occupied territories can provide security for everyone.
