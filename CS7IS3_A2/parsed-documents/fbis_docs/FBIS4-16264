This was reported to an RIA correspondent by Vladimir Naumov, first deputy ataman of the cossacks' union. According to the information from him, mass arrests are being made among Cossacks in the Cossack villages of northern Kazakhstan. Even now the Cossack stanitsas [large Cossack villages] of Topolovka and Pokatilovo are completely blockaded by the local OMON [special purpose militia detachment]. The local authorities are also subjecting activists of the congress of Russian communities to arrest. In particular, Boris Soprunyuk, one of the heads of that organization in Kazakhstan, has been arrested. Standard accusations are made during the arrest -- either of attempts to disrupt the unity of the Republic or of a striving to whip up interethnic strife. The atamans of a number of the Cossack troops have sent a message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. They request him to use all of his influence to put an end to the lawlessness.
