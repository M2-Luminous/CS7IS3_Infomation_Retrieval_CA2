FR940819-2-00068 FR940819-2-00043 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM [Docket R&hyph;0846] Federal Reserve Bank Services: Imputed Income on Clearing Balances AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Request for comment. SUMMARY: The Board is requesting comment on a proposal to modify the methodology for imputing clearing balance income to more closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider. Specifically, the Board is requesting comment on a proposal to change the rate used to impute clearing balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning asset maturity structure of the largest bank holding companies (BHCs). The intended effect of the proposal is to promote competitive equity with private sector practices by matching the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed in bank holding company data on investments. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, which should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0846, may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20551. Comments also may be delivered to Room B&hyph;2222 of the Eccles Building between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. weekdays, or to the guard station in the Eccles Building courtyard on 20th Street NW. (between Constitution Avenue and C Street) at any time. Comments may be inspected in Room MP&hyph;500 of the Martin Building between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. weekdays, except as provided in 12 CFR 261.8 of the Board's rules regarding availability of information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Greg Evans, Manager (202/452&hyph;3945), or Gwen Mitchell, Senior Accounting Analyst (202/452&hyph;3841), Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. For the hearing impaired only: Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, Dorothea Thompson (202/452&hyph;3544). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Monetary Control Act (MCA) requires the Federal Reserve Banks to establish fees for their services on a basis similar to private sector service providers. In establishing fees, the Board considers objectives of fostering competition, improving the efficiency of the payments mechanism, and providing financial services nationwide. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve imputes costs in the private sector adjustment factor (PSAF) that are intended to mirror private sector sales taxes, income taxes, cost of funds, and FDIC assessments. Capital structure, equity and debt rates, and an income tax rate are derived from a model of the largest (in asset size) 50 bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve uses the bank holding company model to place Reserve Bank payment service costs on an equal footing with those costs incurred by the private sector. The banking industry has accepted the BHC model as a proxy for determining Federal Reserve imputed costs.
