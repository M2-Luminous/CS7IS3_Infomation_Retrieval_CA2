Integrated in the regiment of artillery three months ago, the missile was for the first time on display at the Republic Day parade here. Operational control of the Prithvi will be shared by the Army and the Air Force. Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in the teeth of Western opposition, this achievement is all the more striking. The United States has led the campaign against India's missile programme and its `concerns' on Indian missilery including the Prithvi were clearly stated during the visit to the United States in August by the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. With accuracy being one of its key features, the Prithvi can strike assigned targets deep inside enemy territory. The missile's range is restricted to 150 kms while carrying a heavier warhead. But, when the maximum load of one tonne is halved, it can strike at 250 km. With the minimum weight of a nuclear warhead estimated at 500 kg, India can thus, theoretically, deliver a nuclear strike. But with a national decision not to develop nuclear weapons, the missile is expected to be used only in a conventional conflict. The missile's high accuracy is meant to deliver conventional explosives effectively. However, the country is far from obtaining a permanent military edge over nations such as Pakistan. Without integrating other missile systems (it is now developing the 2,000 km Agni IRBM along with the Akash, Trishul, and Nag missiles), India will have to contend with a formidable Pakistani missile arsenal. Aided by China and France in the past, Pakistan is actively developing its own missile armoury. In the Hatf series of Pakistani missiles, the Hatf-2 is nearing completion. When deploying a conventional warhead, the missile has the capacity of reaching Delhi. Progress on the Hatf-3 adds to India's worry. Capable of reaching distances up to 800 km, it can deliver a nuclear warhead. Hatf-3 may be in Pakistani arsenals by 1995. The transfer of Chinese M-11 missiles to Pakistan reinforces India's apprehensions. With a range of 290 km the nuclear missile can release a 800 kg warhead. New technology: Developed by the Integrated Guided Missile Development Board since 1983, the Prithvi possesses important new technologies. The originality of the missile's design and packages are evident for there are few similarities with other contemporary delivery systems. Its success may help to finetune the Agni systems. Aimed at providing strength without making the missile heavy, the Prithvi's frame is made from locally developed light aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are used for the wings. Light aluminium alloys go into the making of the propellant tanks. Once the propellants are filled the tanks can be sealed. With focus initially on testing the reliability and guidance of the missile, the first trials began in 1988. An on-board computer carries out the task of the Prithvi's guidance and flight control. It also checks out sequences before and after the launch. Related to accuracy, the missiles guidance was continuously tested. But when the missile strayed from its flight path in one of the tests, its aerodynamic controls were critically reviewed. Later tests were carried out to ensure that the correction was made fool-proof. Powered by two rocket motors, the missile's engine also assist providing forward, lateral and roll motion to the missile. Hydraulic actuators provide the force to the engines and tail fins facilitating aerodynamic control. Developed and integrated by the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), the development of the software packages is considered a major national achievement. Proving its mobility, some of the later tests saw the missile being successfully fired from a eight-wheeled truck.
