The majority of our fellow citizens have already managed to work out who was the criminal during those days and who emerged as the fatherland's genuine defender. How would you assess these events against the backdrop of our country's history and how far, in your view, has the development of our civil society, and of democracy in Russia in general, been put back? [Rutskoy] First of all the events of those days are a disgrace for us all. A disgrace for the nation. When the people stop considering themselves a nation, they become a population, a large group of private individuals, a crowd which can be manipulated at will and tricked at every turn. On the other hand, when people live with self-respect, aware that each person is an individual representing a great nation and a citizen of a great state, they will never allow such a thing to happen. They will simply not permit anyone to exceed their authority or that of the Constitution. Unfortunately, this did happen here. The citizen's respect for his state was trampled on, shot to pieces. People were broken. Therefore, this was, alas, nothing but a tragedy for this great nation. [passage omitted] [PRAVDA] The idea of an accord is being discussed widely in society today. It is noticeable that a few people are attempting to use this exclusively for their own mercenary ends, and a section of the presidential team sees the signing of such an agreement more or less as an oath of loyalty to B. Yeltsin personally. Is there nevertheless any chance of some kind of national accord in society today? [Rutskoy] We have been talking about civil accord since February 1992, when the "Civic Union" was formed. Its original slogan was civil accord. In other words, the creation of conditions in which each citizen is clearly aware of the country's aims, which tasks will be carried out, and what each person will get from this. At that time this idea was not successfully implemented and we were in many regards not to blame for this. Now the president himself has begun to talk about accord. However, he is again basing it only on a small circle of politicians. But, you see, an accord signed by some leaders or other is not a people's accord, a civil accord. This is only possible when society is stable. When the people have food and housing, and when you and your property are protected. Whereas earlier the reforms could have been adjusted and channeled into performing vitally important priority tasks affecting the stability of society, now it is already too late. Everything which could have been destroyed has been; the country and people have been forced to protest. A new policy, a policy to extricate the country from this impasse, a policy of reforms for the people, is now essential to stop our chaotic state descending into criminality. How much longer can we play the fool by trifling with this discredited regime and government, surely we realize who these people are, what goals they are pursuing, and what they are capable of? Surely we realize that a government which brought the state and its economy to the point of absolute crisis is not capable of overcoming this crisis? For the reason that it not only does not know how to do this, but is also incapable of doing it. How can we talk about adjusting the reforms now? What kind of accord can there be and with whom? With those who plundered and ruined the country? With those who deprived children of the opportunity to have a vacation, who did away with young pioneer camps and sports schools, and who forced people to clamber over the rubbish heaps? With those who destroyed our science, Army, culture, education, and health service? With those who destroyed our entire state? [PRAVDA] But what way out of the current serious crisis is there then? [Rutskoy] There is much to discuss in this regard, but I will limit myself to this. In order to extricate our country from the current crisis, it is essential first and foremost to create a management system. To evaluate our resources (not the mythical aid and credits from foreign states which, incidentally, will have to be repaid), work out what are the priority tasks for the economy and the social sphere which affect society's stability, and develop new market economic relations and civilized entrepreneurship in this very direction, and not speculation calling it business. The following priorities are obvious to every citizen: food, housing, health, education, and spiritual and physical development. These issues will and can be resolved; no one will go to rallies or strikes, and it will not be necessary to indulge in demagoguery about an "accord." The execution of these seemingly narrow tasks will have extensive economic consequences which will allow us to rescue from the mire not only agriculture, the construction industry, medicine, education, and sport, but the economy as a whole. We will create new forms of management which will work for the individual. Therefore, whether we like it or not, a concentration of the state's strengths and assets is necessary, first and foremost to carry out these very priority tasks. Only then will the people feel that the state exists for them, that people have become individuals and not some gullible sheep; then labor discipline and responsibility to society and the state will appear in each person. You should not harbor any illusions that things may change for the better with this president and government. Therefore, it is essential to stop this pretense about consensuses and agreements and get on with things, having replaced the authorities by legal means. [PRAVDA] What lessons have you yourself learned from everything that has happened? [Rutskoy] The first lesson is that you should not have blind faith, especially in serious politics. Second, it is necessary to be more reserved, not to give vent to your emotions. Third, I had intended to quit politics, to give it all up. I do after all have civilian skills -- I am an artist, an aviation engineer, and pilot. I could also work as an entrepreneur. But to leave politics today would be treachery, primarily to those people who put their trust in me. I have never suffered from delusions of grandeur or striven to get into power, but I am sure that it is now simply immoral to quit and abandon everything and everybody. I will always remember those who performed their civil duty to the very end when they defended the Russian Constitution in September-October. I want the Russian people to know that there was not a single bandit, "red-brownshirt," or fascist among us. They were ordinary people, our fellow citizens, and fate will bring us together again on more than one occasion. I appeal to you, in honoring the memory of the fallen -- some people were also wounded, some survived -- whoever is not indifferent about our fatherland's fate, I want to assure you: We are all necessary to the homeland, to resurrect this great power, this great nation. With faith, hope, and love for the fatherland we will achieve happiness, the life we deserve, and greatness for our people and country.
