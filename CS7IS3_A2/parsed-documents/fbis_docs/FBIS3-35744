The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic notes that despite a number of measures which have been taken, a decline in the production and sales of produce in the agrarian sector is continuing. Correspondingly, the level of consumption of food products by the population is also decreasing. The processing industry produces less as well. Industrial enterprises are not sufficiently provided with raw material. According to preliminary data, in 1993 the gross output of production in all categories of farms decreased compared with 1992 by 8 percent in comparable prices. Last year the sowing area for cereals was enlarged by 64,000 hectares compared with 1992. Nevertheless, gross harvest figures, including corn, did not exceed the 1992 level and equaled 1,693,000 [metric] tonnes. The yield of cereals per hectare was 1.1 quintals less than planned. As a result of reducing the sowing area under corn for seed by 18,000 hectares, or 28 percent, and the decrease of its yield by 6.2 quintals a hactare, the output of corn decreased by 93,000 tonnes, or by 43 percent. Similarly poor results were obtained in 1993 in potato, vegetables, berry and fruit, and grape growing. About 290,000 tonnes of potatoes were produced, which is 20 percent less. Only 249,000 tonnes of vegetables were harvested, which is 1.4 times less than in 1992. Due to the decrease in yield and the slow rates of harvesting of some crops, certain loss of produce took place: 62,000 tonnes of cereals were not received nor 10,500 tonnes of beetroot; 1,200 tonnes of sunflower; 41,000 tonnes of vegetables and 22,000 tonnes of potatoes. As before, the situation in agriculture is complicated. The number of cattle in all categories of farms decreased by 8 percent compared with 1992, of sheep and goats by 12 percent; of hogs by 32 percent; of horses by 3 percent. The production of meat in live weight decreased by 2 percent, of milk by 2 percent; of wool by 9 percent. As a result of the decrease in the production of agricultural produce and disadvantages of the finance and crediting policy in the rural area, procuring organizations have decreased their volumes of procurement and failed to deliver the right amount for the needs of the state. In order to stimulate the production and sale of agricultural produce, the Kyrgyz Government resolves: First, to set a minimum volume of the procurement of agricultural produce by procurement organizations and processing industries for the needs of the state and the level of guaranteed procurement prices for these products, without value added tax, in line with appendix M1; Second, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Products of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production amalgamation, the Kyrgyztamakash state concern should, in two months, conclude agreements with producers in all forms of ownership for the procurement of agricultural produce. Oblast and rayon state administrations should urgently define the optimum structure of sowing areas and numbers of cattle for 1994 and provide assistance to procurement organizations and processing industries in concluding agreements for the procurement of produce; Third, to recommend that the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan and joint stock and commercial banks should, in one month, provide credit resources to procurement organizations and processing enterprises in order for them to be able to advance money to producers of agricultural goods in the amount of 25 percent of the minimum volume of procurement. Fourth, the Kyrgyzstan State Committee for Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production amalgamation and the Kyrgyztamakash state concern should introduce changes to levels of guaranteed procurement prices for agricultural products taking into account higher production costs proceeding from objective conditions of supply and demand; Fifth, to state that the agricultural produce excluded from the minimum volume of procurement will be sold by the producers by direct agreements for agreed prices, exports included, without licenses and exempt from customs duties.
