Beginning from this day, the renminbi's foreign exchange rates were reunified. The enterprises and residents would have to purchase foreign exchange from the banks at the unified rates. Thus, the situation of having both official list rates and the swapping rates ended. The ultimate objective of reunifying the renminbi foreign exchange rates is to realize free exchange of the currency. According to the experiences of other countries, there should at least be three conditions for the free exchange of a country's currency. First, an ample reserve of foreign exchange; second, devaluation or depreciation of the country's currency to a reasonable level and establishment of a foreign exchange market with banks as the main body; and third, an increase in the nation's economic strength. Reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates and promoting reform of the foreign exchange system are both aimed at creating better conditions for advancing toward this objective. Beginning this year, the system of retaining and handing in foreign exchange will be abolished and be replaced by a system of banks selling and converting foreign exchange. This means that conditions have been relaxed for the enterprises in using foreign exchange. In the past, a part of the foreign exchange earned by the enterprises should be turned over to the state, and for each portion of foreign exchange they wanted to retain, they had to ask for the approval of the higher authorities level by level. In order to import raw materials, the enterprises had to shuttle between various responsible departments, foreign exchange administrative departments, and banks. After reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, it is easy for the enterprises to convert their foreign exchange income into renminbi at the day's rates and decide how to use the foreign exchange. When they want to use foreign exchange, they can make the exchange with the renminbi by providing effective certificates to the banks, so long as the use of foreign exchange does not violate the state's industrial policy. This is conducive to mobilizing the initiative of enterprises in exporting their products to earn foreign exchange and increasing the competitiveness of Chinese products in international markets. The important measure of the Chinese Government on reunification of the renminbi's foreign exchange rates is also well-received by foreign businessmen. Under the dual exchange rates system, when the registered capital of a foreign firm in China was $1 million, it was equal to more than 5.7 million yuan according to the official list price. But when they earned a profit of more than 5.7 million yuan and wanted to remit it outside the border, it could only be converted into $650,000 according to the swap market price. Because of the two different exchange rates for the incoming and outgoing currencies, the profit of foreign firms was reduced. After reunification of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, the convertible amount of renminbi for the same amount of foreign exchange will increase and the foreign investors will have more profits. Naturally, their enthusiasm in reinvestment will be further kindled. After reunification of the renminbi exchange rates, export and foreign funds will increase and there will be a steady flow of foreign exchange to our country. This will lay a reliable foundation for the smooth progress of reform of the foreign exchange structure. What should be pointed out is that the abolishment of the dual exchange rates system indicates a stronger purchase power of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. As a result, the prices of some trades concerning foreign affairs or foreign nationals, such as hotels and civil aviation companies, which originally used the renminbi's foreign exchange coupons to settle their accounts, should be appropriately readjusted. For example, according to the new system, an air ticket for a flight from Beijing to Shanghai now costs 900 yuan (or $103 when converted into the dollar), which was 590 yuan of the foreign exchange coupon in the past. The common people, individually, are showing greater concerns for the possibility of a big rise in commodity prices after the renminbi's exchange rates are reunified. Apparently, because of the lower value of the renminbi after reunification of its exchange rates, commodity prices will go up. But after a careful analysis, we will find out that the reunification of the renminbi's exchange rates will only slightly affect the commodity prices. First, the original rate of $1 to 5.8 yuan could hardly be found in real practice. In the market, most import goods were purchased in accordance with the swapping rate. Some even cost higher than the current reunified rate (that is, $1 to 9 or 10 yuan). Second, beginning from 31 December, customs duties for some import commodities have been reduced. For example, those for refrigerators, microwave stoves, video game machines, recording tapes, and color television sets have been reduced from 100 to 50 percent. Thus, the costs for importing these products by enterprises have been relevantly reduced. Moreover, the readjustment of prices of hotels and air tickets for foreign nationals will mainly affect people outside rather than the great majority of domestic residents. This year the state has put forth various measures for promoting reform of the foreign exchange structure. In the course of the new structure replacing the old, there still may be unexpected problems and difficulties. But we can be sure that by reunifying the exchange rate, disorder, speculation, and unfairness under the dual exchange rates system will be eliminated and conditions for fair competition will be created for the enterprises. This is conducive to promoting the marketization, standardization, and internationalization of the Chinese economy.
