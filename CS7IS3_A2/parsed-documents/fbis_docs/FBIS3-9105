Regarding relations with neighboring countries, he said that he is not very optimistic about whether it will be possible for the government to comprehensively resolve relations with the Czech Republic and Hungary during its six months in office. A peaceful atmosphere, however, must be created first of all. As to the U.S. press, he noted that it views Slovakia as a naughty child. That is why it is the role of the new diplomacy to provide an objective picture of Slovakia.
