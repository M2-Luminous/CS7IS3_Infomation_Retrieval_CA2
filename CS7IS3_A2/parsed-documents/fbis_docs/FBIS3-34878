Under an agreement concluded between the two sides last week, the Palestinian team eventually agreed to jointly man with Israel border passages linking the autonomous regions with Egypt and Jordan. It has also consented to assign the security of Jewish townships and movement of their residents in the occupied Palestine to the Zionist army. Of course, conclusion of the agreement last week led to a series of protests and objections by various Palestinian parties and the Syrian press. According to those opposing the agreement, what has actually taken place is the transfer of total control of the border check posts to the Zionist regime. [Word indistinct] the Israeli troops will have veto power concerning movement in the autonomous regions. The Zionist regime has even opposed the hoisting of the Palestinian flag on the common border check posts. In fact, insistence of the Zionist regime and the United States on the conclusion of such an agreement has once again proved the reality to the world people that the Israeli claim on a just and broad-based peace is totally false. From the outset of the negotiations with the Arab delegation, the Zionist regime clearly proved the point that it wants peace outside the framework of the Security Council resolutions, and with minimum concessions to the Arabs. The obstacles which Israel has created in the negotiations from the very beginning, either during the rightist government's rule or the rule of the present leftist faction, clearly showed the point that in the deal what cannot be included is the restoration of the lost rights of the Arabs. The Zionist regime not only does not honor the agreement that it has itself signed, but its prime minister clearly announces that the timetable for the withdrawal was a mistake right from the beginning, and that at least one month is required to reach an agreement with the Palestinians. Set against this, the Palestinian nation, with no confidence in the Israeli promises and paying no attention to the U.S. support -- the main backer of the Zionist regime's attacks -- is continuing the struggle by hoisting the flag of the Palestinian nation's oppression and taking its just cry on the intifadah scene [as heard] to the world people.
