Inacker in Hamburg; date not given: "Naumann: Budget Cuts Endanger Operational Readiness of Troops"] [Text] [Inacker] In spring 1993 you stated that the "patient Bundeswehr" could handle another operation, but there must be an end to the financial cuts. Now another 1.25 billion German marks [DM] have to be saved. How many more "operations" can the armed forces really take on? [Naumann] What I described as an operation at the time was an attempt to make clear that we need planning security to be able to shape the structures of the Bundeswehr in the second half of this decade in accordance with its tasks. Thus, the operation refers to what the minister announced as conceptual considerations for April. What we are now doing is carrying out more cuts that will lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to achieve the degree of operational readiness that its mandate demands. This will also reduce the scope for action in German policy, because we will have to accept a temporary reduction concerning the operational readiness of the main defense forces. In addition, there will be delays in the restructuring of the Bundeswehr because it will probably not be possible before the end of this decade to provide a minimum contingent of crisis reaction forces. [Inacker] As Germany's most senior soldier, can you take responsibility for these cuts -- both regarding the troops and regarding the politicians who expect the armed forces to be ready for operations? [Naumann] I am telling the politicians in very plain terms what the Bundeswehr is no longer able to achieve. It is clear that we will not be able to cut expenditure by DM1.25 billion without major consequences, all the more so because the budget debate was characterized by the understanding that "further reductions to the Bundeswehr are no longer possible." What is often overlooked is that there is a correlation between mandate, structure, strength, equipment, training, operations, and finances. One can compare the situation with a system of communicating tubes. One cannot reduce the level in one tube and expect the level to remain the same in the others. [Inacker] What options of German security policy can no longer be ensured? [Naumann] The defense policy is oriented toward a country's interests and its international obligations. My task as military adviser of the defense minister and the Federal Government is to determine what we can and what we cannot achieve. We are currently in the middle of this evaluation process. My first conclusion is that we will no longer be able to achieve the current standard of operational readiness for many troops in 1994/95. Thus, we will lose options for German defense policy, and we will certainly not be able to correct that again overnight. There is no leeway within the defense budget, which, however would be necessary to complete the adaptation of the Bundeswehr to new and much broader tasks by the end of the decade. What makes the situation even worse is that opportunities to seek solutions together with our alliance partners in the spirit of task sharing cannot be taken as long as we do not know whether we will participate in operations such as the AWACS mission over Bosnia. The fact, for example, that, in a battalion of four companies, we will not be able to fill a quarter of one company because of the lack of soldiers reduces the operational readiness of the battalion for a year. This means that we need time or would have to call up reservists if this battalion were needed. At the moment, such a partly filled battalion is not required for Germany's defense. Thus, these cutbacks are acceptable this year. Yet this situation must change, and guidelines concerning the development of the Bundeswehr in the second half of this decade must be issued. [Inacker] Is it possible to provide the army with modern equipment on the basis of the investment funds available? How do you assess the loss of national defense capacities resulting from the austerity measures? [Naumann] I am clearly worried about our national defense capacities. We must preserve defense capacities in some areas. However, we must do that where this is possible from a technological viewpoint or where we have a lead, because this is also a criterion for our capacity for international cooperation and participation in systems. At an investment share of approximately 21 percent in the defense budget, it is not possible to maintain the innovative capacity of the Bundeswehr in the long run. Ultimately, this is the central planning problem that we have to resolve to prevent increased procurement after the year 2000. Thus, the investment share must be increased. Examinations concerning rationalization have been initiated to this end. [Inacker] You repeatedly referred to the new type of combat-ready and fighting soldier at the commanders' meeting. Is the required training possible with the funds available? [Naumann] If one views training in terms of immediate and fast operational readiness for all the troops of the Bundeswehr, this cannot be achieved with the funds available. Thus, one must consider carefully what training one demands for what kind of troops. Different training is required for the main defense forces and crisis reaction forces. This has nothing to do with the stupid talk about a "two-class army." The task of the main defense forces is relatively one-dimensional, aimed at the country's defense. In this respect, it has to be taken into consideration to a greater extent that there is a certain leeway that can be utilized for mobilization if a decision is made at an early stage of a crisis. The crisis reaction forces, however, have to be trained for rapid and immediate operations in unknown geographic areas and unknown scenarios. This has an impact on the training level. A great deal of imagination will be required to work out the details of this differentiation within the Bundeswehr. As far as troops are concerned, this means: We do not necessarily have to say that training is no longer practicable if we can no longer do everything that was considered mandatory in the past.
