(Part One of Three): The "Reflection" Report Used the Term, "Beijing Disturbance"; Jiang Zemin Wrote a Comment, Accusing Me of Right Deviation and Saying That I Should Be Transferred During the 4 June disturbance, many employees of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned institutions participated in activities in support of the students' patriotic activities at Tiananmen Square. After the 4 June Incident, the CPC Work Committee decided that "no punishment should be given to any of those who had committed mistakes" by participating in activities such as giving signatures, taking part in marches, or soliciting donations, and that they should learn lessons by themselves but should not be required to make oral or written self-examinations. The committee also decided to submit a report to the CPC Central Committee. Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] quickly notified us, indicating approval for the idea of the CPC Work Committee. During the Fourth Plenum, I reported to the new general secretary, Jiang Zemin, on the idea. With his approval, we transmitted the idea to all the units, thereby calming the employees who had been unsettled. However, when I was attending the Hong Kong and Macao work conference in Beijing presided over by Ji Pengfei in July, the conference demanded that all units supervised by the CPC Work Committee "reflect" on the "problems" which had occurred in Hong Kong during the 4 June Incident period. The so-called "reflecting" is a synonym of "making self-examinations regarding the mistakes committed." At that time, in Beijing institutions ranging from those at the municipal level to those at the central level and individuals as well as party committees at institutions were all engaged in "reflecting." In fact the practice of "having everyone go through the ordeal" was used, and activities of "account settling" were rampant. Ji Pengfei had notified us of the approval for the CPC Work Committee's idea of "no punishment for mistakes already committed," and Jiang Zemin had also expressed his approval. But now it was demanded that "reflecting" be conducted. In this way they went back on their words. I responded with silence, and did not indicate my attitude. Seeing this situation, Zhou Nan [0719 0589] tried to smooth things over: "Where is the harm in doing some reflecting? We at the CPC Foreign Ministry group have also reflected." I nodded, and indicated my compliance reluctantly. After returning to Hong Kong, I transmitted the instruction at a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, and then indicated my attitude: "Throughout the 4 June Incident period, I said more than once that if the CPC Work Committee should make any mistakes in handling the matter, you (referring to the other members of the CPC Work Committee) might shift the blame onto me when there should be efforts to find out who was responsible. In fact the decisions were made by me. We have already told our subordinates that there would be no punishment for the problems which occurred during the 4 June Incident period. Now the center demands that we reflect. I think that we have not made any mistakes, but on the other hand refusing to reflect will not be tolerated. I ask all of you to think about how to handle the matter. If there is to be reflecting, only the CPC Work Committee will reflect. Perhaps this instruction should not be transmitted to the subordinates, and it should not be demanded that they reflect. If any mistakes were made, I am responsible, and I do not want to have everyone be held responsible." Few people spoke at the meeting. The final conclusion was: "Write a reflection report!" The difficult task of "writing" it was given to She Mengxiao, deputy director of the branch and secretary general. I thought about the matter for several days, and then discussed with She Mengxiao the issue of how to "write" it. She had also prepared a preliminary draft. We agreed that we had not made any mistakes about which we should conduct self-examinations, and that we should "write" about the "understandings" achieved for the purpose of learning a lesson. How to describe the student's patriotic movement in Beijing and the support movement in Hong Kong and Macao? The most important issue was whether to use the term "disturbance" or "rebellion" to describe the nature of the movement in the written "reflection." After repeated considerations, the term, "Beijing disturbance," was used. Written in this way, the "reflection" passed the CPC Work Committee and was submitted to the center. During the Fifth Plenum in October, to my surprise, Ji Pengfei said, when talking about the CPC Work Committee's "reflection" report: "Your reflection report is very well-written!" I could not believe my ears. In July-August a cadre of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office told me privately that Jiang Zemin had written a comment on the CPC Work Committee's "reflection" report and that the gist was: "It seems that Xu Jiatun is suffering from right deviation and should be transferred from his post." The General Office of the CPC Central Committee had sent the "comment" to the secretariat of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and then had someone take it back before it had been delivered to the secretary general, Li Hou. The person who had come to take it back had not made any explanation. I believed what that cadre told me. For not long before, he had also told me another thing: Jiang Zemin had spent two days on listening to reports made by Li Hou [2621 0683] and Lu Ping [7627 1627]. He had not known what had been reported. Judging from the look on his face when he said those things, I understood that this was not good news for me. During the Fourth Plenum, Jiang Zemin had taken the initiative in having a talk with me after he had assumed the high office of general secretary. The two of us had talked in a harmonious manner. At that time, he had been in agreement with the CPC Work Committee's idea that whatever the situations involved, none of those employees of the Chinese institutions in Hong Kong and Macao who had participated in the support activities during the 4 June Incident period should be punished. He had been the party's general secretary, and thus he had in fact given approval to the CPC Work Committee's decision on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. He had changed his attitude after listening to the reports made by Li Hou and Lu Ping. I had been to Beijing several times. When I had been there I had asked my secretary to contact his secretary to request an opportunity to report to him. His secretary had been taken by him from Shanghai to Beijing, and had been friendly toward me. Once he had received a call from my secretary, things would be resolved. But now he had changed his tone, speaking in a "bureaucratic tone." First he would say that Jiang Zemin's schedule had been full and that he would notify me when time could be found. But nothing would happen afterwards. It would be all right if this had happened just once, but it had happened twice or even three times. Consequently I had not only felt that people would change after becoming high officials but also sensed that Jiang Zemin had changed his opinion of me. The message given by this cadre testified to what I had felt, that is, that Jiang Zemin had labelled me as a "right-deviationist" and was planning to carry out "settling of accounts." This would be the reason why during the Fifth Plenum I took the initiative in talking to Song Ping [1345 1627], head of the Central Organization Department, asking the center to approve my retirement. The details will be related later. (Installment No. 123) [5 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] Will There Be "Account Settling"? (Part Two of Three): Zeng Jianhui [2582 1696 1798] Criticized That WEN WEI PO's and TA KUNG PAO's Cursing the CPC Was Unthinkable; Chen Bojian Said That He Was Prepared To Be Transferred Back To Beijing and Put Into Prison at Any Time After the 4 June disturbance died down, the center, the CPC municipal committees, institutions, agencies, units of the armed forces, schools, organizations, leaders of units, and individuals all conducted self-examinations and "reflected," and there were large-scale activities of "account settling." Although the CPC approved the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee's practice of "imposing no punishment for mistakes already committed in all cases" in Hong Kong, in practice it applied pressure continuously in an effort to "settle accounts." The difference was that whereas there was across-the-board "account settling" in Beijing, there were only efforts to clean up individual spots in Hong Kong. Toward the end of June the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office specially notified the CPC Work Committee, asking me to go to Beijing and attend a meeting to discuss the problems in the reporting of newspapers in Hong Kong and Macao during the 4 June Incident period. I and Zhang Junsheng discussed the matter and decided that when reporting we should stress the situation in Hong Kong society at that time. We intended to argue that although the two newspapers had gone too far, we had declared that there would be no punishment for mistakes already committed in all cases. We also intended to argue that there should be no haste in terms of effecting "change" in the future, that a gradual approach should be adopted, and that the focus should be placed on making everyone learn a lesson. I and Zhang Junsheng attended the meeting together. Ji Pengfei presided over the meeting, and those several people from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Foreign Ministry also attended the meeting. Zhu Muzhi [2612 4476 0037], head of the central external propaganda task force, and Zeng Jianhui, deputy head of the Central Propaganda Department, specially attended the meeting. As soon as the meeting began, Zeng Jianhui asked in a reproachful manner: "What was the matter with WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO?" His tone was almost the same as the reproaching tone used by Li Peng when he had met with me on the 25th. Zhu Muzhi immediately joined the exercise, demanding that the CPC Work Committee report on the problems of WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO. Zhang Junsheng reported according to the prepared outline. Zeng Jianhui interrupted and criticized continually: "The CPC's own newspapers cursed the CPC; this is really unthinkable!" I guessed that they had come, with the imperial sword in their hands, and thus waited for them to issue "instructions." Zhang Junsheng reported on the CPC Work Committee's principle on handling the matter, that is, that it would be necessary to adopt a gradual approach in effecting change, that there should be no haste, that the employees of the two newspapers should be allowed to go through the process of accepting the change and learning the lessons because otherwise there could be problems, and that society should also be allowed to go through a process of coming to show acceptance. At that juncture I saw Zeng Jianhui shaking his head continuously. I still made some supplementary remarks. At first I still expressed the views that I had presented to Li Peng: It would be necessary not to apply the hinterland standards to the two newspapers, and it would be even more necessary not to use the hinterland's post-4 June way of handling things in handling the two newspapers. During the 4 June Incident period the two newspapers had been forced to do what they had done. At that time the masses in Hong Kong society and inside the newspapers had been so agitated that it had been very difficult for the leadership to keep control. Even we at the CPC Work Committee had encountered the same situation. The newspapers had adopted the contingency measures only for the purpose of preventing the newspapers from being brought down by the masses inside and outside and of preserving the battlefield position. We should imagine the circumstances confronting the newspaper leadership at that time. I emphasized that there should be no haste in handling the cases of WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO, especially WEN WEI PO, and that it would be even more necessary not to use the hinterland methods. (At that time the news organizations of the hinterland were carrying out large-scale activities of "account settling" and of "having everyone go through the ordeal." And a large number of reporters and editors who had supported the students' patriotic activities were transferred, dismissed, or even arrested.) Since the center-approved policy of "imposing no punishment for mistakes already committed in all cases" had already been declared, we could only enhance education on the existing basis, and effect change gradually, letting them go through a process of coming to learn the lessons. After hearing what I said, Zhu Muzhi and Zeng Jianhui looked at each other and indicated neither approval nor disapproval. It seemed that the other participants also did not want to say anything, and Ji Pengfei did not indicate his attitude either. As they did not openly express any disapproval, I thought that they approved of my views. Eventually Zhu Muzhi talked. He asked: "How about publishing a party organ, like RENMIN RIBAO, in Hong Kong?" Zeng Jianhui further asked: "How about turning either TA KUNG PAO or WEN WEI PO into a party organ?" Then Ji Pengfei also took part in the discussion. I expressed my unfavorable opinion of the idea. A RENMIN RIBAO-like party organ in Hong Kong would not be successful, as the experience of RENMIN RIBAO HAIWAI BAN would show. But, in view of atmosphere then, I could not show my opposition, and could only try to evade the issue: "We will study the issue when back in Hong Kong." They also expressed their consent. In this way the meeting ended. After we returned to Hong Kong, the CPC Work Committee held a discussion meeting, and invited the CPC-member president and vice president of the two newspapers, Yang Qi and Chen Bojian, to attend the meeting as non-voting participants. After the transmitting exercise, everyone felt that there were heavy pressures, but insisted that it was necessary to adhere to the principle that while the two newspapers should be "changed," there should be no haste nor the application of pressure. "Change" should be achieved through using the "dilution" method so that those inside and outside the newspapers might go through a process of coming to show their acceptance. Work within the party and work outside the party at the two newspapers should be carried out together. The CPC Work Committee decided to have Zhang Junsheng inform Li Tzu-sung, president of WEN WEI PO, of the relevant views of Beijing and the CPC Work Committee, asking for his understanding and support. The persuasion work proceeded very unsuccessfully. This was understandable. The problem was that Chen Bojian, vice president of WEN WEI PO, was overly hasty and tended to fail to use the right words, and that as a result the conflict could not be alleviated. He himself was in a very abnormal mood, and often clashed with Zhang Junsheng. Once he told others that he was prepared to be transferred back to Beijing and to be expelled from the party and put into prison at any time. I specially talked to Chen Bojian about the issue. I said: "Your problem related to the movement is not that serious. You are now of advanced age, and should already have retired. Don't take things too seriously. The worst that can happen would be that some disciplinary action is taken against you. This may be the last test that people like us have to face. Don't be too nervous. We still should do our job well now." I had been his old friend. When the XINHUA SHE headquarters had asked him to retire, it had been I who had kept him here and asked him to work at WEN WEI PO. I said half-jokingly: "We have done the same thing. If there should be any problem, let us advance and retreat together." Unexpectedly what I said came true later. After I came to the United States, he was also relieved of his duties and transferred back to the hinterland. Not long afterwards I saw the newspaper report of his death, and felt gloomy for quite some time. (Installment No. 124) [6 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] Will There Be "Account Settling"? (Part Three of Three): It Was Reported That Friends of WEN WEI PO Wanted To Make WEN WEI PO Independent; I Misjudged the Situation; I Felt Guilty With Regard To Li Tzu-sung. Relations between Chen Bojian and some colleagues on the one hand and President Li Tzu-sung on the other became very tense. Li Tzu-sung and some colleagues opposed the "change," and had not come around, while Chen Bojian was overly hasty. A newspaper would have to present itself to the readers every day. Especially some people in Beijing were watching very closely to see how this newspaper in which "Communists have cursed themselves" would "change." There were reports of clashes between Chen Bojian and other people almost every day. Finally the issue of Friends of WEN WEI PO exploded, causing an even more serious conflict. At the informal meeting (daily meeting) of the CPC Work Committee, Zhang Junsheng said that it had been reported that Li Tzu-sung had a dinner with Liu Binyan, Lu K'eng, and Chin Yao-ju the other day, discussing the organizing of Friends of WEN WEI PO and intending to make WEN WEI PO "independent" so as to take it out of the leftist camp. The background was not clear. It was estimated that it was perhaps Taiwan or another country which was involved, and that it was most likely Taiwan. He also said that Friends of WEN WEI PO had issued a public statement, asking WEN WEI PO to "rise up" and become "the bridgehead for the pen and the gun." The situation seemed very serious. After discussion it was decided that firstly Chen Bojian should gather a meeting on the newspaper's internal affairs, that efforts should be made to have Li Tzu-sung attend the meeting, and that if the report was found to be true, there should be a public statement to clarify the matter. It was also decided that secondly a report be submitted to Beijing for record-keeping purposes so as to prevent the difficulty in giving an account in case "independence" should really happen. Chen Bojian immediately went back to the newspaper to gather the meeting, and drafted a "statement." Li Tzu-sung had different views on the "statement." Chen Bojian thus gathered an enlarged emergency meeting of the newspaper's committee, and had the "statement" passed. Li Tzu-sung refused to attend the meeting, and issued a written announcement, dismissing Chen Bojian from the post of deputy president on the ground of Chen Bojian's overstepping his authority by unlawfully gathering the enlarged emergency meeting of the newspaper's committee (it had been President Li Tzu-sung who had issued the letter of appointment as deputy president to Chen Bojian). It was after 8:00 in the evening. Zhang Junsheng asked that the CPC Work Committee convene an emergency meeting to hear reports on developments at WEN WEI PO. He was of the view that Li Tzu-sung's sudden dismissal of Chen Bojian had proved the information on Friends of WEN WEI PO to be correct, and that if no countermeasures were taken, then WEN WEI PO might be "taken away." During the discussion it was proposed that WEN WEI PO's board of directors and committee be reorganized and that Li Tzu-sung be relieved of all his duties. The other people involved would also be dealt with properly. But WEN WEI PO was a united front newspaper. Furthermore such a method would not be in accord with the legal procedures in Hong Kong. For a time no appropriate methods could be formulated. On the other hand, there was the worry that if the matter was not disposed of, Li Tzu-sung might take further actions to change WEN WEI PO the next day, thereby resulting in an irreparable situation. I agreed to taking resolute measures, but did not approve of relieving Li of all his duties. Li Tzu-sung had been our party's old friend. He did not initiate the Friends of WEN WEI PO activities. But things had developed to such an extent that the problem could not be resolved without removing him from his post as president. But some room should be left. I proposed that he retain his post as chairman of the board of directors of WEN WEI PO, and continue to enjoy all the benefits (political and economic). Everyone expressed agreement. We went on to discuss several other issues, including the issue of how to announce the removal of Li Tzu-sung from his post as president. It was argued that the phrase, "discontinue employment," was comparatively mild; everyone agreed on it. The next issue was how to transfer the WEN WEI PO shares to agents appointed by the XINHUA SHE. As one-third of the Hong Kong WEN WEI PO shares were still owned by the Shanghai WEN WEI PO, it was necessary to contact the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, asking them to support transferring the shares here. Some were nominally owned by the former editor-in-chief Chin Yao-ju. Chin Yao-ju had now left. Those shares should also be transferred so as to ensure the shareholding on the part of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE. As Chin Yao-ju had participated in Friends of WEN WEI PO activities, it was proposed that Chin Yao-ju be removed from his post as director on the board of directors. I was not in favor of pursuing those implicated. Besides, in order to remove a director, it would be necessary to hold a meeting of the board of directors. XINHUA SHE could not act on its own with regard to this matter. Thus the proposal on punishing Chin Yao-ju was not accepted. It was proposed that Beijing's approval be sought. I understood that it was late into the night and that there should no further delay, and reasoned that if a report was submitted to Beijing, they might say that the CPC Work Committee was being "soft" and ask for more severe punishment. Therefore I said that we could not wait and that it would be all right if we should submit a report for record-keeping purposes. In the end the meeting decided that Zhang Junsheng go to WEN WEI PO that night and announce the decision on behalf of XINHUA SHE, and that the next morning I go to Li Tzu-sung's home to talk to Li himself. The next morning, I, while feeling guilty, went to Li Tzu-sung's home to "talk" to him. What could I say to this patriotic, righteous old man? At that time I could only ask for his understanding and advise him to take care of his own health. I suggested that he take a rest and do such things as visiting the hinterland. I indicated my willingness to make all the arrangements for him. I said sincerely: "Mr. Li, you are still a friend of the CPC." (At that time I was still the representative of the Communist Party of China in Hong Kong.) I felt guilty with regard to Li Tzu-sung. Especially, when I learned later the facts about the Friends of WEN WEI PO activities and realized that the report had been untrue, I became even more sorry. Now I would like to use the space here to say sorry to Mr. Li! (Installment No. 125)
