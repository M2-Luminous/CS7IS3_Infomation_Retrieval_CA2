He also pointed to recent military successes by Karabakh forces which regained control of the Omar Pass in the Azeri region of Kelbajar and to the tough stand taken by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during recent talks between the Armenian and Azeri defence chiefs. The official said Baku must have realized that if Grachev wound up his mediation, "its only hope will be a military option which leads nowhere". The Armenian official hopes the agreement will be implemented in stages. A permanent cease-fire must be followed by troop withdrawals, exchange of prisoners and negotiations on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the main thing now was to stop the bloodletting because negotiation was a lengthy process. The source expressed regret that the international community should proceed from the principle of territorial integrity on resolving the conflict. He described it as a superb principle unless applied to the Karabakh issue. "This is the internal issue of Azerbaijan of which Karabakh used to be part until recently but it declared its independence following the national-liberation struggle", the source said. Therefore, the principle of integrity should not be applied to the disputed territory, he said. In the meantime, head of the information and analysis center of Armenia's large opposition Dashnaktsutyun Party Bagrat Sadoian fears that any cease-fire will only play into the hands of Azerbaijan which ran out of its military resources after the failure of an offensive it began at the end of December. Sadoian thinks Baku cannot put up with the idea of losing Karabakh and is now trying to regain it.
