The baseness of the perpetrators, the excruciating pain of the victims -- they make the world succumb to enormous rage, but rage that is at the same time helpless. Helpless Rage? Yes, because the hope is deceptive that other states could and will put an end to this war from the outside and against the will of the three parties to the war -- the Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs in and around Bosnia. Who could not understand that, in view of the terrible massacres, more and more citizens and politicians demand action, at least air strikes at the Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo? If it was indeed the Serbs, who have those 68 dead and more than 200 injured on their conscience. However, retaliation -- no matter how vital and understandable the need for it is -- is no motive for responsible military action. Even in the storm of disgust and despair one cannot avoid the nagging questions that must be asked about the second and third step that will follow the first: Who is the opponent? What does one want and can one force him to do it definitely with military means? Is success likely? What effort and sacrifice would the fight cost? And can one politically expect one's own citizens to accept these sacrifices because they are in the interest of their state? Many who are now calling for "just" air strikes on Serb positions avoid these questions. Behind that there is the double illusion that one can certainly do some good -- and worse things will certainly not happen because of it. A few air strikes -- everybody admits that -- can neither end nor shorten, nor really influence the war in Bosnia. It will keep dragging on murderously, until one side wins, everybody is exhausted, or political insight gains ground among all three opponents at some time in the future. In the best case, the atrocities will be committed differently and in different places in Bosnia in the future, not so much in the limelight of the media. Is this a serious objective of a war? Everyone says that there is no real intention to wage war there. In reality, however, something like "a little bit of war" does not exist. The result that could be achieved at best with surgical air strikes, namely pushing certain combat actions out of the world's awareness, must be weighed against the danger of escalating and expanding the war. If the international community undertakes just one direct military intervention in the Bosnia war, it makes itself, the United Nations, or NATO a direct party to the war. The UN troops, who are stationed in the country without heavy weapons to provide humanitarian aid, would continue to be unprotected targets of the Serbs. And what then: withdrawal of the UN soldiers, an end to humanitarian aid, leaving the war to itself? Or more air strikes, or even ground forces sent to Bosnia? There is only one military action that rules out the risk of further escalation -- and that is victory. Whoever does not want to fight to win, should keep his finger off the trigger. Whoever wants to intervene in this war -- and be it only with "surgical" strikes, as some people imagine -- must be absolutely clear about the purpose and meaning of the entire operation. However, there is no clear goal of war. For what does Europe want to fight, for what should it fight in the Balkans? The noble phrase that the West will not recognize any borders that have been changed by force has long become an outdated, empty shell. No one is willing and able to reestablish the status quo ante, the starting position, by use of armed force and with acceptable casualties. Should the international community instead get entangled in fighting for some version of the plans for division, which are pointless anyway -- or for the difference between two of them? And with whom and whose behavior should it take sides -- with the Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs, every one of whom is tactically superior in another place and at another time? To all these questions there is no clear answer to justify a serious military intervention. Whoever, instead, starts some air strikes himself acts dangerously on the basis of that helplessness that he allegedly wants to fight. In this situation the West can have only three goals: First: Preserving its own security. It is not endangered by the war in Bosnia. It is also absurd to claim that NATO's credibility is at stake. As regards its actual purpose, self-defense in the alliance, Bosnia has never called it into question. If at all, Bosnia casts doubt on the credibility of new out-of-area goals. Second: Containing the Balkan conflict. This is difficult but possible. However, it would be made more difficult by direct intervention in Bosnia. It is very likely that the Russians would leave the coalition in the UN Security Council. Third: Continuation of humanitarian aid. This is possible only if the aid workers are not turned into combatants or hostages of the warring parties -- e.g. through pointless military actions by the West. This is truly no heroic program. However, it is much more realistic than the heroism of some tactical air strikes without a strategic goal. Such a concept cannot pacify Bosnia -- and cannot satisfy the world. After the peoples' spring of 1989 the world must again adjust to the terrible realization that peoples also wage war -- and to how horrible wars are in detail; to the fact that there are, by the way, conflicts where one can help and those where one cannot even act as a balancing influence; and, above all, to the fact that, before taking any action, it must be carefully determined what kind of conflict one is dealing with. A terrible war is raging in the Balkans -- one of many that we usually like to ignore. Europe is helpless. This is true -- and it is depressing. However, how helpless it is would become completely obviously only when it engaged in a military intervention in this war just for the sake of pretense. And then, only then, would Europe bear its own guilt -- for this helplessness and for this war.
