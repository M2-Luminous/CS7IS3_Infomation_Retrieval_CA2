As you know, thousands of enterprises, schools, universities, and private and state companies worked yesterday. Millions of Poles, to the best of their abilities and skills, were building our common life. Really a lot of good things happened yesterday. However, yesterday will remain the day of strikes and conflicts. I do not want to assess reasons for this strike because I was brought up in different conditions and with a different system of values. That is why agreement, cooperation, goodwill, and working together are closer to me then conflict. In my opinion, competition is not about putting each other down and destroying an opponent. Even during a time of conflict, it is possible to be partners and not opponents. Today's strikes are not only a political game. Behind the majority of strikes, even those of manipulation, there are difficult, often dramatic, situations of employees who participate in them, although they would rather not strike. There is a common opinion that strikes are organized in strategic industries because that is where their effects are the most visible and painful for the country. The fact is that employees in those industries are not paid badly today. But they think that the situation may change for the worse, they are afraid of restructuring and redundancies, and they are worried about the future. The government repeatedly stressed that our main concern was to secure jobs. If anyone was threatening redundancies, he was simply lying. May it please the House! Let us ask now what caused the current strikes. A complete presentation of the current situation of the state, of the reforms and plans for the coming years will be presented to the House after the first six months of 1994. Today, I would only remind you that results of the first quarter of this year could be described as very good. We have achieved the most dynamic growth in production in 20 years and the lowest inflation in the past seven years. Last year, after the introduction of preferences for enterprises, which demonstrate income figures and reinvest this income, we have the situation where it is profitable for enterprises to pay taxes. As a result of this and other changes, budget revenue went up 15 percent in comparison with the first quarter of last year. In February of this year, in accordance with the government's proexport policy, we had a surplus in foreign trade for the first time in 20 months. In the first quarter of 1994, the foreign currency reserves have increased. In connection with the government's debt-reduction policy and preferences for well-managed enterprises, a dramatic improvement in efficiency can be observed. We achieved those results by introducing and maintaining a certain financial regime. As you know, we did not immediately abolish the excess wage increase tax. We did not immediately implement other election promises. But we increased the lowest old age and disability pensions. We took care in securing budget revenue and, at the same time, creating opportunities for investments. On the other hand, decisions regulating custom duties and discouraging smuggling and other economic crimes were important for the government's economic policy. I hope the House will share the government's opinion that careful modification of policies without excluding the past positive trends, so modification without shocks and leaps, also contributed to positive economic results in the first quarter of 1994. May it please the House! If all trends from the first quarter proved to be permanent, it would mean that we are coming out of the recession faster then the developed West European countries. This would also mean that those people who up to now have not yet felt it in their homes will feel it in the second half of the year or next year. If one immediately adds that, over the past two months, among other things, in recognition of our economic achievements we have achieved a reduction of debts in the London Club and agreement to a second stage of reduction in the Paris Club, then probably no one will hold it against me for saying that a dozen or so days ago, we had the full right to be optimistic in looking at our future. But good economic results do not come of themselves, nor are they given once and for all. They can quickly be eaten away and, worse still, squandered through, for example, economic disorder. We have been brought face to face with just such a danger. Strikes, particularly in the brown-coal power industry, are today increasing the costs of using imported energy. Tomorrow they may lead to the return of economic crisis, the collapse of weaker enterprises, the squandering of what we are already achieving at such cost. Ladies and gentlemen deputies, may it please the House! Solidarity at the turn of 1980-81 bore our common dreams of democracy and a new system of government. Then came years of tough trials and many disappointments. There are also many things we cannot be satisfied with today, but times have changed and Solidarity is not the same as it was then. We have democratic institutions for resolving disputes and many legal forms of vindicating one's rights, or convincing other people of the legitimacy of one's own interests. Why, in this situation, is the harshest form of protest being used? Why is the blow aimed not where people have the most difficult lives but where it causes the greatest disorganization? Why do the Solidarity leaders not want negotiations as partners with the government? Why do they not want talks along with the other trade unions, but organize... [pauses] confine themselves mainly to drawing up sole legitimate demands, attempting to humiliate the government, and showing contempt for the remaining trade unions? For many months now, negotiation teams have been operating with the participation of the main trade unions, the employers, and the self-governments. A number of agreements have been signed--one can point, in particular, to housing construction and health care. The only trade union not taking part in this work is Solidarity, and maybe that is why there are such strong protests because the representatives of that trade union are simply not aware how far advanced the agreements and the search for solutions are. We do not want to present those solutions as the best and the only ones. We want to agree on them through consultations and, on this, we want to build our program for the next years, 1995-97. In the past few days, various emissaries are said to have gone to workforces that want to work, with the order: Tomorrow you go on strike. How are they so sure of their rights to decide for others? Those people who censor and shorten government communiques are behaving similarly, as if no room could be found for half a page, a page, or even two pages of text presenting the government's position, among so many pages undermining the government's position. You can read the details in one of today's newspapers who really would be hurt by that. It is a pity that the reality our government faces means that my statement today in the House will most probably not be published in full anywhere. In a television program a few days ago, one of the young strike organizers said that a change of the Sejm law was not a problem; it was just the matter of coming into agreement here. That was the case in Poland when the democratically elected Sejm and senate did not exist and when a lot had to be changed, although, even then, not everything had to be destroyed. Today we are wiser because of our experience, and we should protect democracy even before ourselves. We should defend Sejm powers that are undermined by those representatives of strike committees who think agreement between their committee and the government is enough to decide matters that are within the authority of the parliament. Ladies and gentlemen! Saying this as one of you I cannot help being under the impression that we are responsible. May it please the House! There are situations when it is difficult to find a good solution. One of them is the way wage increases should be controlled. We are looking for such a control system that does not hinder the dynamics of economic growth and improvement of the society's welfare and one that does not threaten a return of inflation and a wasted opportunity for coordinated development. We know the dispute surrounding these matters as the dispute about the "popiwek" and the "neopopiwek" [wage control] laws. The government's position on this matter is as follows: The government intended and still intends to abandon administrative forms of wage control in the state sector by the end of 1994, at the latest. During this period, we intended to bring in different, more flexible forms of wage control, of increasing the independence of enterprises in managing their own wage funds. After President Walesa questioned the wage control act, after my meeting with the leaders of 16 trade unions, and after serious discussion, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers we drew up the conditions under which the risk of managing [wage funds] already in 1994 without such a law could be taken. Here they are; the sequence is also a result of today's circumstances: First, it is a question of joint responsibility, including the trade unions, and a halt in particular to strike pressure for wage increases. Second, transferring wage negotiations to the work of the tripartite commission, invested with very firm powers by the Sejm law safeguarding the representative character of the trade unions and the agreement... [pauses] the implementation of these decisions through workplace collective agreements. Third, the commercialization of enterprises, and therefore a move to the formula of enterprises adapted to a market economy, on the basis of the commercial code. And even if there were strong arguments for taking the courageous risk of abandoning the "popiwek," today those arguments are overwhelmed by the situation we are dealing with because the fundamental fear that a lack of statutory wage control does not safeguard us from a spontaneous increase in wages becomes a particularly strong argument in these circumstances. There are various versions of the wage control law. There were, after all, very tough solutions, which led to a stratification of incomes because small enterprises could not afford to pay the "popiwek." There were those, too, that, despite the very difficult economic situation, simply did not pay the wage tax and increased wages. Today, we have to deal with the fruits of this law. And now, when the Sejm has introduced solutions wherein the law on the control of wages relates solely to those enterprises in which the state has 80 percent of the capital, more than 80 percent, the law does not relate to the cooperative movement, does not relate to enterprises in which the average wage is less than 75 percent of the national average. Very little is said of this. And today, those who so consistently struggle against this "popiwek" forget where they were during the time when the previous law was in force, and where they will be when the lack of this control brings about a still greater stratification of incomes. What will they use to explain themselves to all those who have maintained discipline, in many enterprises, so that enterprises could develop, that they again remain behind because the structure of the market quite simply does not allow them to so quickly increase incomes as in those that have a structurally good position on the market. In this situation, we acknowledge that a quick forsaking of the law on wages control is associated with a real return of, a real risk of a return of, inflation. A return to excessive imports and the possibility of the manifestation of other consequences that may disturb the rate of growth that has been attained this year. An unprepared forsaking of wage controls also threatens that which the trade union leaders are aware of, an increase in unemployment and a fall in real incomes. Will trade unionists today declare responsibility for what will happen later, or will it again be the case that the entire responsibility will fall solely and exclusively on the government? That, too, is why we accepted without opposition the initiative of a group of Polish Peasant Party deputies bringing under consideration of the Sejm the law on the control of wages. The Sejm speaker decided that it should be considered under an accelerated procedure. The government treats this law as a last resort that must be used if needed for defense against the threat of inflation. It is not appropriate to use it at a time when this threat does not exist. Nonetheless, in light of the recent strikes, the government does not intend to seek the suspension of the process of introduction of this law. As I have already said, for the period until the end of 1994--and I expect the acceptance of parliament and the president. In the system of democracy we are constructing, the government is responsible for the economic development of the country. May it please the House! One of the postulates is the demand for the immediate introduction of the enterprise pact. This is a demand addressed to the Sejm, which of course does not immediately introduce anything. Let me recall that it was as early as 4 November 1993 that the government submitted the first five laws on the enterprise pact. The two most important ones for employees generally have already been passed. On 29 December, the law on the protection of employees' claims in case of employer's insolvency was adopted. On 4 March, the law on the enterprise welfare fund was passed. Two other laws were considered by a Sejm extraordinary commission. They are: the law on the financial economy of a state enterprise and on the division of profit in certain state treasury companies. As regards the fifth submitted law, amendments to the labor code, the commission did not do any work on it after the first reading. The final law that belongs to the [enterprise] pact is the law on privatization. This bill is to be considered by the government in May of this year. In it, among other things, we envisage the transfer of the ownership transformation initiative to the enterprise bodies and administrative control over decisions made in this respect. We have also been considering the possibility of increasing the number of shares given free of charge to employees, farmers, and fishermen. Does the protest also concern these changes? Let us ask the employees directly. This bill will be submitted to the Sejm in May. Who, then, needs to be prompted out loud in the case of the enterprise pact, which is directed at the government? Probably only those who do not remember or do not wish to remember that, at the same time, the government proposed and the parliament passed the law on the indexation of old age and disability pensions, which raised the lowest benefits; the law on the determination of remuneration in the public sector; a number of financial laws that guaranteed income for the state budget as well as concessions to the investors. Generally, the coalition government submitted 68 and the Sejm passed 26 new laws. Each of these laws addresses certain needs; each of them is also a subject of social scrutiny. We are building the program for the years 1994-97 together with the trade unions, employers, local governments. We are also inviting solidarity to start our joint construction program. People have the right to demand that restrictions be abolished, but these very same people do not want to live on a volcano. They expect the government to provide peace and security and that tomorrow will be better than today. Our government is in a position to implement such a program. Consistency and prudence in the transformations are some of the conditions. Mr. Speaker, may it please the House! In a few days, we will have another 3 May anniversary, the anniversary of the great opportunity and the great tragedy. There is a great opportunity before Poland. I believe that we will not destroy it through unnecessary resistance and a lack of ability to compromise. I believe that common sense will prevail. I am convinced that the place of strikes and the philosophy of who does what to whom will be taken by talks, including talks at the tripartite commission, which are being continued at this moment by the trade unions and representatives of employers with the government. This is a commission we wish to put on a statutory basis, a commission that will function according to the principle of respect for partners and the principle of representativeness. Let us reject mutual reservations, and let us consider together what to do so as to strengthen our achievements hitherto and resolve those problems that still await resolution. Ladies and gentlemen, before us we have a few days off--not, fortunately, on account of the strikes. Before us we have anniversaries that are important for our country. Although I began my speech today with fear that yesterday was a day of conflicts, I hope that this will also be the start of their effective resolution. [applause]
