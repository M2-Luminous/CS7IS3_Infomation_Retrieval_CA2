FR940111-1-00021 FR940111-1-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud. This proposal is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which resulted in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. DATES: Comments must be received by February 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Ganley, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, ANE&hyph;142, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, New England Region, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7138; fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Discussion The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, attributed to excessive fan blade tip clearance. Engines without a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud, operate with relatively open stage one fan blade tip clearances. Increased fan rotor vibration occurs when the average tip clearance exceeds the maximum allowable clearance tolerances. This increased vibration increases stresses in the fan blade shank, which leads to cracking and subsequent blade failure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573, Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981, that describes procedures for the installation of the stiffening ring assembly and new stage one fan shroud. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist, or develop, on other engines of this same type design, the proposed AD would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and a new stage one fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses. The compliance end date of August 31, 1995, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware availability. The actions would be required to be accomplished, in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
