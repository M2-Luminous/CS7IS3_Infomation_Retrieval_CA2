At noon, Azeri President Geydar Aliyev met with the chairman of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh, Jan Eliasson, his deputy, Matthias Mosberg and plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president and special envoy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Kazimirov, who arrived in the region on a special mission late on 12 May. According to Aliyev, the current meeting in Baku means the beginning of a new stage in the Karabakh settlement. He believes that recently, the Minsk CSCE group has extended the framework of its activities and has taken a more realistic approach to the possibilities of the conflict settlement, relying on efforts made by all of its member-states. A positive assessment was given to its contacts with Russia and the Russian Foreign Ministry, in particular, for the purpose of the conflict settlement. According to the Azeri president, "this can be regarded as a new qualitative level in the peace-keeping process." Aliyev shares the opinion of Eliasson and Kazimirov about the importance of ceasefire as the necessary condition for the process of settlement. "I believe that the cease-fire should be followed by concrete practical steps, including immediate withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the occupied territories, strengthening measures of confidence and carrying out a programme envisaged by CSCE documents and Russia's proposals," Aliyev said. He is convinced that there should be no interval between these stages, since only on this condition real results in the settlement can be achieved. Aliyev pointed out that the signing of the Bishkek protocol by Azerbaijan, which was received in Azerbaijan not unequivocally, was a correct step leading to cease-fire and the creation of conditions for lasting and reliable peace in the region, saying that there are the necessary grounds for this process. It is calm today in the area of the conflict, he said. "Now we have to see to it that international observers make their contribution to what was achieved, taking under control the process of demilitarization and the withdrawal of occupying troops. This will inspire everyone with confidence that the peace-keeping process is irreversible," the Azeri president said.
