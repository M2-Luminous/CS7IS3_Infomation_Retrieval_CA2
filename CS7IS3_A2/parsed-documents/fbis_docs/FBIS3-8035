Responding to a question by our special correspondent Yeoryios Kharvalias, the Skopjean president explained his reservations about the name Slavomacedonia but left open the possibility of accepting a compound name. [Begin recording] [Gligorov] "I said that we are prepared to discuss all unresolved issues and I believe that the best solution will emerge as a result of such a dialogue. Let us examine all the arguments. Concerning the name Slavomacedonia, I must stress that we are a multinational state. A name that would define us nationally must be accepted by all the residents of the country and not intensify problems between the minorities. However, I repeat once again that everything must be put on the negotiating table." [Kharvalias] This important statement by Kiro Gligorov, which outlines his intention for a discussion of all the issues, including the name, was made to ET-1 and moves the stagnant waters after many months of Skopjean intransigence, which led the Greek Government to proceed with the blockade. Is this a tactical maneuver or a substantial turn in Gligorov's policy? Time will tell. However, it is interesting to hear what Mr. Gligorov said when we asked him what he expects from the meeting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will have with UN mediator Cyrus Vance in Geneva on 10 March. [Gligorov] "According to my information, the Vance-Papoulias meeting in Geneva is to make preparations for a bilateral meeting. I am not in a position to say when this meeting will take place. Everything will depend on what happens in Geneva. However, within the framework of protecting peace, a friendly settlement of the differences between Greece and Skopje depends on goodwill, and the resumption of talks under the UN auspices appears as the only reasonable solution. I think that it is time for the measures to be lifted and for us to proceed with open discussions on all issues. On our part, we have nothing but goodwill, and I hope that with mutual understanding the problems can be solved." [Kharvalias] The Skopjean president was for the first time relatively conciliatory when asked about the three Greek conditions for the resumption of the dialogue. He said: There is goodwill on our part to discuss all the pending issues including the three Greek prerequisites. He added: However, it is not right for these to be set as conditions. If we accept everything in advance what would be left to discuss? The Skopjean leader expressed his displeasure at the recent Greek measures. However, his statements were made in a relatively mild tone. Mr. Gligorov said indicatively: I believe this is not a creative approach for two neighboring countries such as Greece and Skopje that are not facing major problems. Instead of understanding, we have an embargo on a bilateral basis without a Security Council decision, as was the case with Serbia. Mr. Gligorov's position on relations with the neighboring countries was also important. He said: We must have friendly relations with states such as Albania, Bulgaria, and the Yugoslav Federation. As for Turkey, relations are good but nothing special, Mr. Gligorov added. The Skopjean president also commented on the aid granted to his country by neighboring Albania. He said: We were using and will continue to use Albanian routes to transport goods to our state, but I do not see the reason why preconditions should be set concerning the Albanian minority living in Skopje. Finally, we asked the Skopjean president about his country's relations with the United States in the light of U.S. recognition, which has not been accompanied by the establishment of diplomatic relations. [Kharvalias, in English] The United States recently recognized your country as FYROM but it has declined to establish diplomatic relations. Does Mr. President think that this is a matter of time? [Gligorov] "Usually, when a country recognizes another country it intends to establish diplomatic relations. So, I believe that the opening of an American embassy in Skopje is merely a matter of time." [end recording]
