FR940616-0-00065 FR940616-0-00009 (2) If one or more installment payments are untimely submitted or not submitted at all, the eligibility of the subject regulatee to submit installment payments may be cancelled and the regulatee required to pay its fee in a single annual payment. 16. Section 1.1157 is added to read as follows: §1.1157 Form of payment for regulatory fees. Any regulatory fee payment must be submitted in the form of a check, bank draft or money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications Commission or by Visa or Mastercard credit cards only. The Commission discourages applicants from submitting cash payments and will not be responsible for cash sent through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as deficient. (a) Upon authorization from the Commission following a written request, electronic payment of a regulatory fee may be made as follows: (1)(i) The payor may instruct its bank to make payment of the regulatory fee directly to the Commission's lockbox bank; or (ii) The payor may authorize the Commission to direct its lockbox bank to withdraw funds directly from the payor's bank account. (2) No electronic payment of a regulatory fee will be accepted unless the payor has obtained the written authorization of the Commission to submit regulatory fees electronically. Procedures for electronic payment of regulatory fees will be announced by Public Notice. It is the responsibility of the payor to insure that any electronic payment is made in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures for electronic fee payment will result in the return of the fee payment, and a penalty fee of 25 percent if the subsequent refiling of the fee payment is late. Failure to comply will also subject the payor to the penalties set forth in section 1.1163. (b) Multiple payment instruments for a single regulatory fee are not permitted, except that the Commission will accept multiple money orders in payment of any fee where the fee exceeds the maximum amount for a money order established by the issuing entity and the use of multiple money orders is the only practicable means available for payment. (c) Payment of multiple standard regulatory fees (including an installment payment) due on the same date, may be made with a single payment instrument and cover mass media, common carrier and cable service fee payments. Each regulatee is solely responsible for accurately accounting for and listing each license or authorization and the number of subscribers, access lines, or other relevant units on the accompanying FCC Form 159 and, if needed, FCC Form 159C and for making full payment for every regulatory fee listed on the accompanying form. Any omission or payment deficiency of a regulatory fee will result in a 25 percent penalty of the amount due and unpaid. (d) Any regulatory fee payment (including a regulatory fee payment submitted with an application in the private radio service) made by credit card or money order must be submitted with a completed FCC Form 159. Failure to accurately enter the credit card number and date of expiration and the payor's signature in blocks number 22 and 23 of FCC Form 159 will result in rejection of the credit card payment. 17. Section 1.1158 is added to read as follows: §1.1158 Filing locations and receipts for regulatory fees. (a) Regulatory fee payments must be directed to the location and address set forth in sections 1.1152 through 1.1155 for the specific category of fee involved. Any regulatory fee required to be submitted with an application must be filed as a part of the application package accompanying the application. The Commission will not take responsibility for matching fees, forms and applications submitted at different times or locations. (b) Petitions for reconsideration or applications for review of fee decisions submitted with a standard regulatory fee payment pursuant to §§1.1153 through 1.1155 are to be filed with the Commission's lockbox bank in the manner set forth in §§1.1153 through 1.1155 for payment of the fee subject to the petition for reconsideration or the application for review. Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review that are submitted with no accompanying payment should be filed with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: Managing Director, Washington, DC 20554. (c) Any request for exemption from a regulatory fee shall be filed with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: Managing Director, Washington, DC 20554, except that requests for exemption accompanied by a tentative fee payment shall be filed at the lockbox set forth for the appropriate service in §§1.1152 through 1.1155. (d) The Commission will furnish a receipt for a regulatory fee payment only upon request. In order to obtain a receipt for a regulatory fee payment, the package must include an extra copy of the Form FCC 159 or, if a Form 159 is not required with the payment, a copy of the first page of the application or other filing submitted with the regulatory fee payment, submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt for the regulatory fee payment and application fee payment, if required. The document should be clearly marked ``copy'' and should be the top document in the package. The copy will be date stamped immediately and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the receipt document. 18. Section 1.1159 is added to read as follows: §1.1159 Refunds of regulatory fees. (a) Regulatory fees will be refunded, upon request, only in the following instances: (1) When no regulatory fee is required or an excessive fee has been paid. In the case of an overpayment, the refund amount will be based on the applicants', permittees', or licensees' entire submission. All refunds will be issued to the payor named in Block Number 3 of the FCC Form 159. (2) In the case of advance payment of regulatory fees, subject to §1.1152, a refund will be issued based on unexpired full years: (i) When the Commission adopts new rules that nullify a license or other authorization, or a new law or treaty renders a license or other authorization useless; (ii) When a licensee in the private radio service surrenders the license or other authorization subject to a fee payment to the Commission; or (iii) When the Commission declines to grant an application submitted with a regulatory fee payment. (3) When a waiver is granted in accordance with §1.1165 of this subpart.
