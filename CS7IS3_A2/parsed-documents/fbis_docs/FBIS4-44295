The Twelve were unable to agree on a new president of the European Commission. Once again, it was the fault of John Major, for whom the 11:1 grouping is becoming a habit, just as it was for his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. On the surface it is a poker game with people, but there is much more to it than that: It is a question of what kind of Europe is to come out of the Twelve, or the Sixteen. John Major and his Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd twisted and turned like eels, first denouncing the disputed Franco-German approach for Dehaene's nomination, then criticizing his belated official candidature. They were unable to hide the fact that the real issue is something quite different: The development of the European Union into a federalist structure, which is what most of the member states want, or a Europe of nation states with all the risks and inadequacies that an excessively nationalistic orientation entail. Many things become clear both from statements by Major himself and by the British delegation: "Dehaene -- an interventionist," "It's a matter of a particular conception of Europe," and from their behaviour. Initially, Major supported his fellow countryman Sir Leon Brittan. Although this was legitimate, it suggested that London hoped for a British Europe. When Brittan's candidature was not supported by any other member, the Prime Minister switched to Lubbers' side. After the "Atlanticists" from The Hague eventually threw in the towel, Major became stubborn and used his veto. Dehaene was not acceptable, and it was a matter of principle. In other words, London was afraid of excessive interference by Brussels in national affairs, a continuation of the Delors course and the creation of a Europe on Maastricht lines. Maastricht Europe is not a negative concept. After all, it was drafted in 1991 under the Luxembourg presidency with constructive assistance mainly from the founding members of the EU. For the British, however, the term means the same as it does for the anti-Europeans here: Brussels centralism, federalism, industrial policy, in short, "socialism by the back door" which scares the British Tories stiff. Obviously, the nomination of the president of the Commission is connected with a certain direction. For this reason, Mitterrand and Kohl, both convinced Europeans, committed themselves to their much-criticized initiative for Dehaene and not for Lubbers who, as Council President, had already made too many concessions to Major in Maastricht in their opinion. This legitimate game has now been thwarted. Ought the British to have joined the initiative earlier? No, because there is nothing to suggest that there would have been agreement on a compromise candidate prior to the summit. Where do we go from here? The Twelve have an obligation to the citizens of Europe and their mouthpiece, the European Parliament. Any unfinished business will have to be completed on 15 July. Countries such as Luxembourg are still sticking to Dehaene's nomination. Major, however, is once again so far off course that any backing down on his part would probably put him out of 10 Downing Street for good this time. He has said he will never ever change his mind. These are the words of someone whose political fate is at stake if he makes a U-turn. As it is a matter of urgency that the European Parliament ratify the new Commission on time, the telephone lines between the capital cities will become hot in the next few days. There is probably little point if several candidates line up again at the special summit in Brussels, since Corfu has shown that even the very mother of parliaments can sweep away democratic conventions (respecting the principle of the majority) because its own requirements were not satisfied. The Eleven have no reason to go too far to meet the wishes of the British. The crisis would be the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, it is actually a question of what direction the European Union will take to overcome the division of our continent.
