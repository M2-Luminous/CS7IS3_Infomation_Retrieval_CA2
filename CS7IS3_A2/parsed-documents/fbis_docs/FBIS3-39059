Satisfaction of European Union Mediator David Owen"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Geneva, 9 Feb (ATS) -- Mediator David Owen said on Wednesday [9 February] evening that he is very satisfied with the meeting of the foreign ministers of the seven countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia. The participants think that a peaceful solution must be found to end the war in Bosnia, the co-chairman of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, said. On the other hand, Mr. Owen was very skeptical about the new agreement reached between Serbs and Muslims in Sarajevo on Wednesday. This agreement makes provision for a cease-fire from noon Thursday and the withdrawal of the Serbian batteries to positions on the hills which overlook the Bosnian capital. In this connection, the European Union mediator pointed out that numerous agreements had already been reached in the past, without ever being respected. He pointed out that the Geneva meeting was the first meeting around one table by all the foreign ministers of the Balkan states. The discussion related to the consequences of a possible lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. It also examined the effects of the economic embargo imposed by the United Nations on the new Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The Italian foreign minister explained that all the states present in Geneva had declared their agreement on maintaining the economic embargo. The states represented in Geneva were Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. Turkey was invited but was not present. It apparently decided not to attend at the last minute, arguing that the meeting had little chance of producing practical results, according to some diplomatic sources.
