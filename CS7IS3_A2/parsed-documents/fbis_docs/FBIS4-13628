In an article today entitled "The Downing of the U.S. Helicopters Is First Drops of Rain," the paper adds: Numerous facts will certainly be revealed about similar U.S. crimes which used to be kept secret or forgotten, now that, after the downing of the two U.S. helicopters, the White House can no longer conceal these cheap and lowly adventures after they have been exposed to the whole world. AL-QADISIYAH adds: Such mistakes will continue to be made without any justification apart from the U.S. grudge against peoples and the desire to control and dominate them. No wonder, therefore, that this topic has drawn the attention of the world media. The paper continues: Everyone is aware of the tragedies of wars and military interventions led by the United States in the world. Everyone recalls, in particular, the U.S. crimes in Vietnam, Panama, Nicaragua, Korea, and Iraq as well as the distress caused to both the American people and the world as a result of the reckless U.S. policy. The paper wonders how the American people feel regarding the many U.S. soldiers who died in the U.S. wars, and who are left with only memories. The paper concludes that history will uncover the folded pages even if they are concealed by the dust of years or the smoke of intelligence services and those revolving in their orbit.
