And even when it seemed as if all of the details had sorted themselves out (recall the well known statement by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahqthir bin Mohamad at the end of last year at the "Lima-93" International Naval and Aerospace Exhibition: "It's almost a done deal, and it's already time to order the champagne") suddenly some new sort of circumstances appeared, and signing of the contract was postponed indefinitely. Sad as it may be to say this, but not only American firms, which have offered Malaysia the latest F/A-18 airplanes almost at dumping prices, but also Russian firms and even private individuals, which have literally besieged this country's government and military structures with assurances to one and all that they in particular had been granted the right to sell the MiGs, made their contribution to causing this deal to occur as late as possible and at the least advantage for us. According to the journal BROOKINGS REVIEW around 20 such firms visited Malaysia over a short period of time. The newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI asserts that there were 50 of them. And in the meantime the exclusive right to conduct negotiations and sign a contract to deliver MiG-29 fighters to Malaysia was granted by a decision of the government of the Russian Federation to the Moscow Aviation Production Association. And it was precisely owing to the persistent and purposeful work by specialists of this association, as well as of the Rosvooruzheniye State Arms and Military Equipment Export and Import Company, with which the Moscow Aviation Production Association worked in close contact, that such a contract came into being. It is estimated at an amount on the order of $600 million U.S. The initial proposal was to pay half of the contract with deliveries of palm oil. But as a result of negotiations conducted by First Deputy Chairman of the Government Oleg Soskovets, who headed the Russian government delegation that was to sign the contract, and his Malaysian colleague Anwar ibn Ibrahim, only a fourth of the value of the contract will be compensated with palm oil. The first MiG-29 is to be delivered to Malaysia in April 1995. The issue of creating a special technical center to service our fighters is presently being considered. Malaysian Defense Minister Mohamed Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak called the MiG contract "the largest deal with Russia," and expressed interest in developing military and technical cooperation further.
