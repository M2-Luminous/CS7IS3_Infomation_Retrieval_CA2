By now, these documents are in the hands of the Russian prime minister, who is going to discuss them with a number of political factions in the State Duma of the Russian Federation. U. Zamyatalin said that, according to preliminary information, the majority of Duma deputies view the signing of the monetary union agreement between the two states with optimism. "Some disagreements over approaches to the creation of a single ruble zone are of more political, than economic character; they are artificially created by those experts who have been programmed to prevent, at any price, the establishment of a union of the two countries," said Kebich's press secretary. Speaking about the actual date of the monetary unification, Zamyatalin expressed hope that "it will most likely take place before the end of March."
