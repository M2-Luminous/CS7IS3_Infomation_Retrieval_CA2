As we hear from this dispatch by (Nublen Brewster), the arrival of this controversial leader has caused quite a stir. [Begin Brewster recording] Scores of journalists waited outside the [name indistinct] Civil Airport from as early as 1900. An hour and a half later, Cuba's President Fidel Castro, resplendent in his customary army green uniform, alighted from a Cubana airline. Flanked on either side by his personal interpreter and several [word indistinct] bodyguards, he greeted Cuba's resident ambassador, (Lazaro Cabeza), and Barbados Foreign Minister Bainford Taitt. Then he spoke to an anxious press corps who struggled with Cuban and U.S. security guards to capture his first words on tape. Some of us were shoved, even trampled, as the security officials tried to keep voracious journalists at bay. Speaking through his interpreter, [words indistinct], President Castro said he is pleased to be in Barbados again. He had stopped here more than 20 years ago while on his way to another [word indistinct] summit. He was then quickly escorted to a waiting Mercedes. We shadowed him and his interpreter to a plush [word indistinct] hotel. [end recording]
