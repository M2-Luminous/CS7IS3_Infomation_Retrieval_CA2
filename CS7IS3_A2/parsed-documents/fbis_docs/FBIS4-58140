Does that package contain anything that can bring about a breakthrough in the stalemate? [Rabinovich] We think so. The term package can arouse the wrong associations because it has a physical connotation. We should talk about a series of issues and positions which together constitute a whole. In our view, the parcel is such that if the Syrians respond to it as a whole and to its components adequately, there can be a breakthrough in the negotiations. [Kohen] In reference to the physics of the package, as you referred to it, what does it contain: maps and lines or just principles? [Rabinovich] The Americans are not carrying any map with delineated lines. Some of the things uttered are broad speculations. They went with ideas and impressions, and I think that these ideas are sufficient for a very interesting conversation to be conducted with President al-Asad in Damascus. [Kohen] To the best of your knowledge, did Rabin's public pronouncement about his readiness to evacuate settlements have an impact in Damascus? [Rabinovich] I think it must have strengthened among the Syrians the feeling that should have been aroused there a long time ago, that we are a serious partner, that we are interested in a settlement, that we give it serious thought, that we are prepared to pay a reasonable price for a good agreement. The other side, however, is very tough and does not always understand us fully. It he does not understand how an open, democratic, parliamentary system like ours operates. The fact that the direct contacts with the other side is very, very limited makes mutual revelation and understanding difficult. Therefore, the intensity of some of our moves, proposals, gestures, are not always sufficiently understood by the other side. [Kohen] Sir, we disclosed a formula under the headline "Majdal Shams First." What can you tell us about it? Is that the bridge that will permit us to cross the river? [Rabinovich] I said before that many of the speculations being heard in recent days are exaggerated, some speculative and some based on incorrect information. I think it is important right now not to focus on any detail, no matter piquant it is, but to think in more conceptual terms about the parcel with its ideas. We must perhaps stress one point: Majdal Shams is a village in which people live. [Kohen] No, we are talking about all the Druze villages, with Majdal Shams only serving as the headline. [Rabinovich] I do not want to focus on any village or area. I want to talk about the fact that when such negotiations are being conducted, we do not talk only in abstract terms. We should always remember that people and their fate are involved. We, as negotiators and anybody else involved, have to remember that such speculations involve the future of people. [Kohen] I understand, of course, Mr. Ambassador, that you cannot refer concretely to the package or Majdal Shams First, but in an academic analysis, can you see the advantages such a formula has for al-Asad, as well as for Rabin? [Rabinovich] I must temporarily forfeit the pleasure of an academic analysis because I am currently dealing with concrete negotiations and not academic life, but as I said previously, the package of ideas Secretary Christopher is carrying to Damascus is interesting and contains more than enough to permit the Syrians, if they wish to do so, to respond in an adequate fashion, and thereby to get the negotiating cart moving forward. [Kohen] Ambassador Rabinovich, what influence do you think the time element has on the negotiations with the Syrians? Is a situation of continued stalemate -- for instance until 1996, the date of the Israeli general elections -- possible? [Rabinovich] Of course, a deadlock and slow progress can go on without a time limit. In these negotiations we have never manifested to the Syrians a feeling that we are in a hurry. I think that from time to time the Syrians have learned that time is not a one-dimensional element and does not necessarily work against Israel or impose pressures on us. I think that last year the Syrians dragged their feet in the autumn and early summer and the outcome was that they found themselves facing the Oslo agreement with a different element. I think that was a bitter lesson for them, showing them that time does not necessarily move in one direction. From time to time we recall in a very relaxed way, without being pressured by time, that this window of opportunity is not unlimited time wise so that everybody involved in these negotiations remembers it. But, we do not have and do not transmit a feeling of concern or panic because of the passing of time. [Kohen] Within the framework of Christopher's demands from al-Asad is there a demand to hold a summit meeting with Prime Minister Rabin? [Rabinovich] There are no demands. The diplomatic and negotiating style of the Americans in general and Secretary Christopher in particular, is not one of making demands and applying pressures. He acts more like an attorney who transfers, not in a mechanical fashion, the positions of the sides, points to overlapping areas, and from time to time points to an interesting point where the sides meet, but he does not make demands or apply pressure. The Americans, like us, believe that more personal contact at the political echelon is good for the negotiations. This is for two reasons: First, meetings at the political level are part of the normalization process and evince a message to both societies -- Syrian and Israeli -- that their leaderships are in a process of conciliation, which is important. Second, in direct negotiations between leaders, who can make decisions, faster progress is sometimes possible since gaps can be closed by eliminating an emissary and transmittal time. That position is highly acceptable to us and I think is also acceptable to the Americans, and in fact, any objective observer of the negotiations. [Kohen] To conclude, Mr. Ambassador, in your view, is their any chance that Christopher will return to Jerusalem early in the week with an iota of good tidings from Damascus? [Rabinovich] I do not want to make forecasts, but if I look objectively at the package of ideas he took with him, then it would be very disappointing if the Syrians do not give him an adequate response in order to create an impetus in these negotiations.
