A high-level official of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, in quoting the statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said that if some circles of the IAEA declare that the possibility for the further measurement of the nuclear fuel rods has dissipated technically, or the UN Security Council pressures North Korea by imposing sanctions, North Korea will take a decisive step to deal with them, rather than suffer from their unreasonable steps. Therefore, he hinted at the possibility that North Korea would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Also, he admitted that North Korea accelerated the speed of the work to replace the nuclear fuel rods some time ago in order to test the maximum efficiency of the machine that carries out the work.
