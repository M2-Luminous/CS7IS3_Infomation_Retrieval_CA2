In a government meeting Tuesday, Seoul decided to withhold the announcement of suspending this year's South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" until it actually sits down for talks with North Korea, Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae said. Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Yong- tok coordinated the government position with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, National Security Planning Agency Director Kim Tok, and Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk after North Korea rejected Seoul's earlier proposal for inter-Korean dialogue on Tuesday and instead rescheduled the date for Thursday in a telephone message. The government decided to agree to the new date on an interpretation that the communist regime showed positive attitude toward exchange of special envoys despite its delay for talks. In its telephone message on Tuesday morning, North Korea said it will send officials to the southern side of Panmunjom at 10:00 a.m. Thursday. It added that it was happy that the South proposed working-level meeting to discuss exchange of special envoys.
