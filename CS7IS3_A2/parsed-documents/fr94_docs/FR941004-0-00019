FR941004-0-00019 FR941004-0-00007 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP San Francisco Bay 94&hyph;013] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; San Francisco Bay, CA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Navy and the City of San Francisco coordinate an annual ``Fleetweek'' event on San Francisco Bay featuring, in part, a Parade of Ships and a U.S. Navy Blue Angels Air Show on October 8, 1994. To ensure the safety of Fleetweek participants and spectators, the Coast Guard proposes to establish a Safety Zone on the waters of San Francisco Bay, California, encompassing the entire water area bounded by the following: Commencing at the point 37 ○^48 ’40 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^28 ’^38 ’ ’ W; thence to 37 ○^49 ’^10 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^28 ’41 ’ ’ W; thence to 37 ○^49 ’^31 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^25 ’^18 ’ ’ W; thence to 37 ○^49 ’^36 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^22 ’^44 ’ ’ W; thence to 37 ○^48 ’^28 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^22 ’02 ’ ’ W, thence to 37 ○^47 ’^21 ’ ’ N, 122 ○^23 ’^14 ’ ’ W; and thence returning along the shoreline to the point of origin. Entry into, transit through, or anchoring within this Safety Zone by deep draft vessels, 1600 gross tons or greater, and tug and barge combinations is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Safety Zone will be in effect on October 8, 1994 between 9 a.m. PDT and 4 p.m. PDT, unless canceled earlier by the Captain of the Port. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant (junior grade) Sean Regan, Coast Guard Marine Safety Office San Francisco Bay, California; (510) 437&hyph;3073. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being made effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since the scope of activities potentially attracting a number of spectator craft and thus requiring a safety zone was not finalized until a date fewer than 30 days prior to the event date. Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are Lieutenant (junior grade) Sean Regan, Project Officer for the Captain of the Port, and Lieutenant Commander C.M. Juckniess, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The event requiring this Safety Zone will begin on October 8, 1994 at 9 a.m. PDT and will conclude at 4 p.m. PDT, unless canceled earlier by the Captain of the Port. This Safety Zone is necessary to ensure the safety of pleasure boaters against injury from collision with deep draft vessels or tug and barge combinations during the Parade of Ships and U.S. Navy Blue Angels Air Show. Entry into this zone by deep draft vessels, 1600 gross tons or greater, or tug and barge combinations is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Collection of Information This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B it will have no significant environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
