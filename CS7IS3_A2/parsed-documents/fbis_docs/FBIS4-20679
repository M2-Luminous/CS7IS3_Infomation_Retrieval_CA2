In order to discuss feasibility on pervaporation as wastewater treatment process and influence of impurities in waste flow to membrane performance, sorption experiments and pervaporation experiments were carried out with phenol-water binary solution and real industrial wastewater. As the result of these investigations, PEBA membrane showed substantial potentiality for application of phenol contained wastewater treatment, subject that the wastewater should be purified to the required quality by vacuum distillation or other appropriate pretreatment. 1. Introduction Wastewater discharged from phenolic resin process contains 5-10 percent phenol and several substances. Removal of phenols, which is difficult to resolve by conventional biological water treatment process, is usually achieved by liquid-liquid extraction. In this method, use of extraction solvent, i.e., methylisobutylketone (MIBK) might be undesirable in respect to environmental pollution, energy saving, running cost, etc. An alternative way is dilution with water up to the concentration level enable to resolve phenols with biological treatment. This way is required for not only huge amount of water but also wide area for wastewater treatment system, i.e., activated sludge tank, sedimentation tank, etc. Pervaporation is known as effective process for separation of organic aqueous solution in chemical industry, for example, dehydration of organic solvent, particularly formed azeotropics, with hydrophilic membrane and recovery of organics from water with hydrophobic membrane. The latter case has proposed some possibilities for recovery of organics included in wastewater. It is reported by Boddeker et al. that polyether block amide (PEBA) offers significant potential for phenol selective membrane material. The property of membrane for real wastewater treatment is to keep high flux, high selectivity and durability for the time required. By utilizing pervaporation with PEBA membrane, depletion of phenol concentration in effluents from phenolic resin process, shown in Table 1, is discussed and compared with the case of binary solution. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Experimental Sorption Experiments In pervaporation process, separation factor is affected by preferential absorption of one of the components of feed liquid to the membrane. It seems that to investigate sorption of phenols and other components to PEBA membrane is instrumental in evaluating pervaporation performance. Small pieces of PEBA membrane (abt. 2 cm x 4 cm), which were dried in vacuum drier until no weight decrease was observed, were immersed in the sample liquid bottled in flask. After sorption equilibrium was achieved (abt. 72 hrs after immersion started) the membrane was picked up, blotted with tissues and putted in to vacuum evaporator. Weight and composition of liquid collected from membrane by vacuum evaporation were measured. Phenol-water binary solution and real wastewater were employed as sample liquid. Temperature was varied in binary solution experiment on 3 levels (30�C, 50�C and 70�C). In case of real wastewater, temperature was kept at 50�C. In order to observe transition of absorption volume, reiteration of above sorption procedure were executed both with binary solution and real wastewater respectively. Pervaporation Experiments Pervaporation experiments were conducted by batch type glass cell test apparatus shown in Figure 1. The effective membrane area was 21.05 cm[.sup]2[/]. The pressure at downstream side was kept below 1 torr and feed temperature was at 50�C. Composition of permeate and feed mixture were analyzed by gas chromatograph and absorptiometry. Figure 1. Pervaporation Celltest Unit Total flux, phenol flux and selectivity are measured with phenol-water binary and real wastewater. To investigate membrane durability, the time required for reduction of phenol concentration from 5 percent to 300 ppm were measured in reiterative trials. 3. Results and Discussions Sorption Experiments The results of sorption isotherms of phenol-water binary solution are given in Figure 2. In this figure, sorption quantity of phenol and water into the membrane was given as a function of the feed concentration. The sorption of phenols was proportionally linear up with increasing phenol concentration. In low phenol concentration range (below 1 percent), water sorption was constant. However in more than 1-2 percent phenol, water sorption was enhanced with increasing phenol concentration. With increasing temperature, increase in both water and phenol sorption were observed. This shows that with increasing phenol concentration in feed, PEBA membrane preferably adsorbed more phenol and became gradually swollen. In more than 1-2 percent phenol, the swelling of membrane made its structure loose enough to permeate water into it. Figure 2. Sorption Isotherms of Phenol and Water in PEBA Membrane The results of the sorption reiteration with wastewater and binary solution are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. Ratio of weight changes of dried membranes before and after immersion was defined as degree of swelling which was indicated by black circle in these figures. Sorbed phenol conc. symbolized X in these figures, means phenol concentration of the liquid collected from sorbed membrane. In spite of concentration of phenol sorption in wastewater was lower than that in binary solution, the degree of swelling in real wastewater was higher than that in binary solution. This may be attributed to several substances such as methanol and formaldehydes contained in wastewater. Figure 3. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From Waste Water by PEBA Membrane Figure 4. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From 5 wt% As far as two months' continuous experiments, it seemed that degree of swelling of membrane was stable for both solutions. Pervaporation Experiments The pervaporation results with real wastewater is shown in Figure 5, where phenol flux is symbolized as black circle, water flux as black square and separation factor as black triangle. Figure 5. PEBA Membrane Performance Compared with test results of binary solution, which are represented by the full lines in Figure 5, both flux and selectivity in wastewater are less than half. These data with consideration of sorption experiments, suggest that methanol, formaldehydes of other substances contained in wastewater might make membrane swollen. Furthermore, low phenol polymers included in wastewater accumulated on the membrane and hinder to pass through membrane. Thus, it resulted in lower membrane performance. Figure 6 shows results of reiteration test with same membrane. In twice trial with binary solution, about 120 hrs each were required for depletion of phenol concentration less than 300 ppm. Then, twice trial with real wastewater were made. In first trial, it took about 240 hrs and in second run, phenol concentration could not reach less than 1121 ppm even after 309 hrs operation. On the membrane surface used in this trial, reddish brown-color colloidal accumulates were observed. Therefore, we tried to devise appropriate pretreatment. As the most reliable way to remove these accumulative materials, vacuum distillation was adopted as pretreatment of wastewater. Condition of vacuum distillation were 100 Torr as operation pressure and at 50�C as feed temperature. Figure 6. Aging Test of PEBA Membrane With Real Feed Square marks in Figure 6 indicate pervaporation data with wastewater after vacuum distillation. Phenol concentration could be decreased from 5 percent to less than 300 ppm in about 200 hrs. Some results were obtained in successive eight runs. It shows that vacuum distillation would be effective as pretreatment. 4. Conclusions Through these experimental results, the following findings were obtained: 1) Using PEBA membrane, phenol concentration in water could be reduced from 5 percent up to less than 300 ppm, which was the concentration enable to resolve by conventional biological water treatment system. 2) Due to some substances contained in wastewater from industrial phenolic resin process, membrane performance was decreased. 3) According to sorption experiments, some substances in wastewater other than phenol caused swelling of membrane. 4) Vacuum distillation is effective as pretreatment for removal of harmful substances in wastewater. 5.
