Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa also attended the meeting. After the meeting, Musa said that the Yemeni minister conveyed to President Mubarak a message from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. They also discussed the Yemen situation as Basindwah reviewed the current situation. During the meeting, President Mubarak emphasized the importance and necessity for an immediate cease-fire and an end to all military operations in Yemen, both in the south and north. Musa noted that they also reviewed the current situation in the United Nations and the Security Council, which will meet Tuesday to discuss the situation in Yemen in an attempt to foster an atmosphere to resume dialogue and encourage stability inside this fraternal Arab country. Basindwah said that he conveyed an oral message from President Salih on the leadership's stance in Sanaa vis-a-vis the ongoing events in Yemen. He said that the Yemeni people greatly appreciate President Mubarak's deep concern to stop the bloodshed in Yemen. He said that a cease-fire must be reached within the framework of recognizing Yemen's unity and abolishing any resolution to secede because it is illegal and to have a recourse to the Yemeni Republic constitution. Basindwash said that any measure taken by the Security Council regarding the events in Yemen must emphasize the importance of safeguarding the Yemeni unity and decomcratic development, particularly because the general elections that were held in Yemen on 17 April were the object of world admiration. He stressed that Egypt is a big, leading, and pioneering country in the whole Arab region, noting that President Mubarak gave us advice and instructions that we appreciated and were eager to listen to. If we do not seek Egypt's help, whose else can we seek? Answering a question on imposing unity by force in Yemen, Basindwah said that unity had been established voluntarily in 1990, therefore unity already exists, so how we can impose a thing that already exists. He stressed that the party that resorted to force is the one who wants secession. Here Musa interrupted and stressed that regardless of who started the war the point on which we agree is that the continuing use of force is not in the interest of Yemen, its unity, or stability. Basindwah pointed out that they did not demand that all Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders surrender but some of them, especially 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because he is the person primarily responsible for current events in Yemen. He said: We still recognize the YSP and wish to continue the dialogue with the moderate leaders and those who believe in Yemeni unity. Responding to proposals put forward by certain parties to form a confederation as the best solution for the coming stage, Basindwah stressed that Yemen has never been two countries or two peoples. Proof of this is that when two states existed in Yemen, they were called the two parts of Yemen. Confederation, he said, is out of the question because there are no minorities in Yemen and but one Muslim Arab people. Musa stressed that Egypt demands first a cease-fire and from there things can proceed on a positive rather than negative course. He noted the role of the Security Council's proposed meeting on a cease-fire resolution, to which Sanaa has agreed. He pointed out that safeguarding unity through war is a losing game and that unity itself is a demand that cannot be criticized or assailed and must be preserved through the Yemeni people's freely accepting this unity. Musa said that the dialogue will take place among the parties of the crisis and if Egypt is asked to play a role, we will be ready but we will not impose it.
