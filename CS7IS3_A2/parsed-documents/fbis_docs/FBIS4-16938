NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma committee on the economic policy. He believes that "the president's new economic policy was left unnoticed by the government." He writes: "A draft agreement on the establishment of civil peace, submitted for discussion by the working group, does not contain any specific proposals in the economic sphere, which threatens to turn the crucially important process of achieving accord in society on the key directions of the country's home and foreign policy into another formal function, which can only discredit the idea of the establishment of civil peace in Russia, for which our society has suffered so much." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an article which explains to the readers such notions as the subsistence level, the poverty line and the minimal consumer breadbasket. "The cost of the consumer breadbasket in Russia was 40,000 roubles in March this year, while the per capita subsistence level was about 60,000 roubles in the same month. In January 1993 35.5 per cent of Russian citizens had money incomes below the subsistence level. The figure for December 1993 was 26.7 per cent, and for March 1994 -- 17.5 per cent. In 1993 13 per cent of the country's population had incomes, which were smaller than the cost of the minimal set of basic foodstuffs. The figure for the first quarter of 1994 was 6 per cent." The newspaper explains such a wide range of criteria for determining the living standards of Russians by the fact that at present there is no law on the subsistence level. "Four versions of the draft law on the subsistence level, which explain the term in this or that way, have been submitted for consideration to the State Duma committee on social issues. Meanwhile, our incomes are compared either with the subsistence level, or with the cost of the consumer breadbasket, when our living standards are determined," the newspaper writes. TRUD carries an article dealing with the economic reform in Russia, which is entitled "delayed-action mine". "The excessive stratification of society is creating a serious threat for the reform. When the difference in wages between the `upper' and `lower' groups reaches 40 times, it will mean the end to the Russian reform. The growing non-payment of wages is aggravating the situation. A total amount of the non-paid wages, which was increasing from one month to the next, reached two trillion 374 billion roubles by April 1. Some 20 million people have not received the wages that are due to them." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an article under the headline "How the Black Sea Fleet should be divided." It analyses the agreement on the stage-by-stage settlement of problems of the Black Sea Fleet, which was signed recently. "Will the agreement boost cooperation, or will it become a mine laid under Russian-Ukrainian relations? Ten days, set by the agreement which was signed on April 15, are expiring, but there is no mechanism of the division of the fleet in a new proportion. Dificulties are sure to emerge when the sides start to determine what part of the fleet will go to each of the sides. First, it is difficult to say how many of the fleet's ships will make 15-20 per cent. Second, Ukraine is not going to take into account in the negotiating process the part of the fleet, which it has already appropriated unilaterally and which includes several ships and about 60 units and facilities of the Black Sea Fleet." PRAVDA carries an article about the Bosnian crisis. It criticises Russian diplomacy in the Balkan peninsula and points out that "the proparanda uproar about the recent accomplishments of Moscow diplomats in the Bosnian conflict is intended for naive people. The game has long been played on a different field... Russia actually has no policy in the Balkan peninsula." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA frontpages an article about the birth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin. The newspaper writes that the Lenin mausoleum will be opened on April 22.
