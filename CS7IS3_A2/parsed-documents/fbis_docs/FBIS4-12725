FBIS4-12725 "drnes071__a94010" FBIS-NES-94-071-A Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 ANNEX Israel Sources Report `Sharp Increase' in Gaza Shootings Sources Report `Sharp Increase' in Gaza Shootings TA1104105994 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English 11 Apr 94 p 2 TA1104105994 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST English BFN [Report by Alon Pinkas] [Excerpt] "The war against terrorism will continue relentlessly, despite high hopes for change in Gaza, but it is important to stress that the total and indefinite closure of the territories could facilitate more incidents, said OC [Officer Commanding] Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Matan Vilna'i yesterday. Vilna'i, speaking to reporters in Gaza, stressed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] had successfully dealt with total closures of the Gaza Strip in the past, and is ready to do so now. "The burden of a total closure on the Palestinian population is heavy, because they are economically dependent on employment in Israel, and they are closely tied to Israel," said Vilna'i. Military sources in the Southern Command said there had been sharp increase in shooting attacks on the IDF in the Gaza Strip during the past three months. There were 78 shootings in the last three months, compared to a total of 40 for the whole of 1992, they said, adding that 48 incidents occurred in March alone. The sources estimated that with the establishment of Palestinian self-rule, local feuds and power struggles between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are to be expected.

The fatalities were made up of 43 civilians and 15 security personnel. Twenty-four were killed inside the Green Line. In the previous closure months -- March through September 1993 -- three Israelis were killed inside the Green Line. Over 90 percent of the perpetrators of attacks were under the age of 24, and all the perpetrators of attacks inside Israel were single men."]
