At the same time the head of the German Government stressed that Bonn is particularly "in favor of involving Russia as extensively as possible in the political section of the G-7 meeting" and is willing to hold appropriate talks with its partners on this. The FRG chancellor's words along with similar statements by other world leaders provide unequivocal evidence that, whereas the West can still do without Moscow economically, it simply cannot resolve many international political problems without it. That is why the first real step toward the transformation of this elite club has already been taken before our country formally accedes to the G-7. A Russian spokesman -- Sergey Lavrov, Russian deputy foreign minister -- took part in the recent consultations in Rome between the diplomatic departments of Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan on the preparations for the July summit-level meeting in Naples. Thus Moscow is for the first time a coauthor of the program of work for the world leaders' council and not just a "guest of honor." Our interest in participating in the elite club is justified. The regular G-7 meetings dating back to the mid-seventies constitute one of the most important forums for mutual consultation on pressing problems of international policy and the world economy. And it is quite natural that the former "seven plus one" formula, whereby the head of our state only joined in the debate at the end of the session once the Western countries' joint course had been formulated, could not be effective. Russia's participation at the stage where the agenda is drawn up is expected to be far more productive. Italy, which is to chair the coming session in Naples, has still not announced the range of problems scheduled for discussion. But it can be assumed that the question of settling the conflicts in Bosnia and the Near East, the role of the United Nations and its peacemaking forces in this process, the state of affairs in Africa, and the development of the political processes in South Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and other parts of the world will top the list. Discussion is also expected to turn to the situation in the CIS countries, primarily in the hot spots of Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Georgia, and Abkhazia. As for the meeting's economic program, that will still be discussed without Boris Yeltsin's involvement. Nevertheless the strategic problems involved in Russia's integration in the world economy which Chancellor Kohl mentioned in particular will obviously not be ignored. I hope that the Russian president's words are heeded when the prospect of affording aid for Russia's reforms is considered. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes, for instance, that the Naples meeting should discuss the question not so much of expanding this aid as of the West's meeting its prior commitments and observing the priorities formulated with the Russian president's participation at the previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo. These being support for reforms, the development of privatization and private business, an easing of the foreign debt burden, and improved terms for Russian goods' access to world markets. Needless to say, one meeting will not be able to drastically improve the situation for Russia. But it will reflect the trend within the world community and will thus be another "brick" in the edifice of good-neighborliness and mutual assistance on our planet.
