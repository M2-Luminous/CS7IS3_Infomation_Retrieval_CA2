At first glance the answer is no. There are several reasons for this. The SDS coalition is not in power and does have the necessary levers to directly affect official relations with the Kremlin. The natural anti-Soviet tendencies among the supporters of the blue [SDS] coalition are interpreted in Moscow by some "well-wishers" as hatred for the Russian people. The current government is the hostage of business groups that rely on the chaotic interstate relations and the paralysis of the Bulgarian Embassy in Moscow, in which there has been no ambassador for the last two years, in order to monopolize trade with the former USSR. The suspicion that KGB structures played an active role in toppling Filip Dimitrov's government is well-grounded. Recently, however, one could also observe different processes. They provide certain commentators sensitive to Bulgarian-Russian relations with an opportunity to assume that we could soon see a sharp change in those relations. It is not very plausible to assume that the Bulgarian neocommunists will play a fundamental role in this process. Russian President Boris Yeltsin clearly implied this last year, when he refused to receive Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. This was a diplomatic slap in the face not only for the government of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], but mainly for President Zhelev, who is Berov's patron. It was only the SDS that issued a fundamental position against the participants in the coup against Yeltsin, when the Russian Parliament was dissolved. This was done without waiting for a favorable outcome of the events. A bit later reports emerged about unofficial contacts between SDS figures and Yeltsin's advisers. Last week it became clear that the talks on Filip Dimitrov's visit to Russia have made progress. We also learned that intelligence chief Brigo Asparukhov visited Moscow with the purpose of foiling the contacts between the blue coalition and Russia's liberal circles. After the failure of this mission (General Asparukhov was recalled to Bulgaria on 21 January before the end of his visit), three other persons who are very close to President Zhelev -- Ivan Krustev, Deyan Kyuranov, and Evgeniy Daynov -- departed for Moscow. It is indicative that on this occasion the president sent more intelligent advisers who do not hide a certain sympathy for the SDS and its leader. Will Dimitrov succeed in making a new beginning in Bulgarian-Russian relations? One should first answer the main question: Is the "northern bear" prepared to seek friendship this time rather than control? For the time being everything is in the realm of initial positive signals. However, it is clear that the democrats in both countries already understand that the stagnation in the two countries' relations serves only the forces of restoration and organized crime.
