FR941220-2-00025 FR941220-2-00018 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and Hold Scoping Meetings for the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Water Reuse Project AGENCY: Central Utah Water Conservancy District (Interior). ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Hold Scoping Meetings on a Proposed Treated Effluent Water Reuse Project in Central Utah. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and PL 102&hyph;575, Section 205(b), which provides for the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District) to be considered a ``Federal Agency'' for the purposes of compliance with all federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws with respect to the use of funds authorized, the District, along with the Department of the Interior as joint lead, will be preparing an EIS on the impacts of the proposed Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Water Reuse Project. The project has been submitted to the District for consideration of funding under Section 207 (Water Management Improvement) of PL 102&hyph;575. DATES: Written comments will be accepted until February 20, 1995. Public scoping meetings will be held beginning at 7 p.m. on January 17, 1995 at the Utah Department of Natural Resources auditorium, 1636 W. North Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah; and at 7 p.m. on January 18, 1995 in the Board Room at the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, 355 West 1300 South, Orem, Utah. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Karen Ricks, Project Manager, Central Utah Water Conservancy District, 355 West 1300 South, Orem, Utah 84058. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Karen Ricks, Telephone 801&hyph;226&hyph;7226, 801&hyph;226&hyph;7271, or within Utah 800&hyph;281&hyph;7103, FAX 801&hyph;226&hyph;7150. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Central Valley Reuse Project (CVRP) will be owned and operated by the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Board (Board). Sponsoring agencies include Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake County Water Conservancy District. The Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility is currently discharging its effluent to the Jordan River. In October of 1991, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality notified the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Board that effluent discharged from their 62.5 million gallon per day (mgd) trickling filter/solids contact waste water reclamation facility did not comply with ammonia limits for discharge to the Jordan River. The Board subsequently contracted for the preparation of a feasibility study on ways to meet the discharge requirements. The proposed waste water reuse project would involve pumping effluent southward from the treatment facility located in Salt Lake County, Utah for direct irrigation season discharge into existing agricultural irrigation canals. An estimated 27,600 acre-feet per irrigation season may be delivered. These deliveries would serve to substitute for contractual Utah Lake irrigation releases, allowing the displaced water to be retained in Utah Lake for a variety of possible environmental enhancement projects. The EIS will analyze the impacts of several alternative locations of pipelines required to deliver the effluent, impact of use of the conserved water, and delivery points for the treated effluent. The impact of constructing a nitrification unit (no action alternative) at the treatment plant will also be analyzed. The public scoping process will be used to identify the significant issues to be addressed in the EIS, and identify any additional alternatives or uses of the conserved water that should be considered. A scoping information summary is available upon request. Dated: December 8, 1994. Ron Johnston, CUP Completion Act Program Director, Department of the Interior.
