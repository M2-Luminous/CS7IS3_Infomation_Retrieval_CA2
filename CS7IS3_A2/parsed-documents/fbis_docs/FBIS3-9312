The meeting at the Russian Embassy here, organised by Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly Churkin in coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its kind to be held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The two sides last year held several similar meetings in Norway and Austria, with the Serbs demanding neutral territory for the talks. But those talks failed because of Serb insistence on autonomy for the Krajina region which they have proclaimed an independent republic. The separatist Serbs seized the Krajina region in the war that broke out between Croatia and the Yugoslav army when Zagreb declared independence from the old Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation in 1991. John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and separation of forces" of the two factions. The Krajina Serbs occupy a quarter of Croatian territory, and Mills acknowledged that separating the two forces was a "very difficult problem." Shortly before the start of the talks, some 300 intellectuals gathered in the centre of the city to protest the start of dialogue with the separatists, whom they denounced as "war criminals." They accused Russia of making moves to "cement the Serb occupation" of Krajina, a UN-monitored area. Questioned on the demonstration, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who has ruled out any kind of "enlarged autonomy" for the separatists and is demanding the unconditional return of Krajina, told journalists that "not only Russian envoys but also those from the United States" had entered the talks with the "war criminals." He said the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, had joined the negotiations. Tudjman stressed the talks would continue for as long as was needed to reach a solution. "We are obliged to have discussions and we want to do so to ensure there are no more (war) victims. We will continue talking for as long as there is a chance" of a settlement, he said. Tudjman said he had received pledges of support for Zagreb's efforts to reassert its authority in Krajina from the United States and the UN Security Council, adding that this was an essential precondition should Croatia be forced into taking "extreme measures" in the event of the talks failing. Tudjman last week asked the Security Council to authorise the use of force to disarm the rebels. He is insisting that the UN peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up for renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of a demarcation line. Churkin has worked closely with his U.S. counterpart Charles Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on a federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday [18 March].
