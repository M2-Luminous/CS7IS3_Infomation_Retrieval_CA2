Tzou and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Geneva, March 26 (CNA) -- Australia Friday [25 March] asked Taiwan to allow imports of Australian rice in compliance with fair trade regulations laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). With unexpectedly friendly rapport, negotiators from Australia and Taiwan exchanged views on Taiwan's economic and industrial structures and possible tariff concessions during a series of ongoing bilateral tariff talks here. Chen Wu-hsiung, a Council of Agriculture official, told chief Australian negotiator Donald Kenyon and his party that Taiwan's rice market would be opened slowly to allow rice farmers time to adjust to foreign competition. Chen proposed that Taiwan adopt the "Korean formula" of allowing rice imports of one to two percent of domestic consumption in the first six years of Taiwan's GATT membership. Foreign rice imports would gradually increase to four percent by the 10th year, Huang said. Kenyon, however, suggested that the "Japanese formula" would be in Taiwan's best interests. Japan, at the end of last year, agreed to rice imports of between four and eight percent of domestic consumption for six years before moving to tariffication. The "Korean formula," according to Kenyon, will not necessarily be a better policy for Taiwan, as Korea, while winning key concessions on rice, was forced to give ground on other farm product markets. "Which may beget heavier losses for Taiwan," Kenyon said. Taiwan has held a series of bilateral tariff negotiations with Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey and Australia during the past week here. A total of 21 countries have requested tariff-reduction negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these talks will be key to Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade body before the end of this year, according to chief Taiwan negotiator Huang Yen-chao.
