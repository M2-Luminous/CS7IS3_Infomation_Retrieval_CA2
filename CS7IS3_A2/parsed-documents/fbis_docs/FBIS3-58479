The aim of the the meeting between the Socialists and the Left-Wing Platform was to extend political cooperation to the main PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] initiatives and challenges. It was also the first in a series of meetings following the local elections. The meetings will culminate in a new agreement protocol for the European elections, to be signed probably within two months. Barros Moura reaffirmed his willingness to be an independent candidate on the PSP lists, a euphemistic way of confirming his presence in an eligible position. The matter is uncontentious. It is more difficult for [PSP Secretary General] Antonio Guterres to succeed in placing all the available candidates in the first 10 places on the list. The placements are being left until after the congress. At the end of yesterday's meeting, Barros Moura and Guterres were in perfect harmony on the philosophy of the States General for a new majority. "It is not a left-wing majority. It has been proved that it is not sufficient to combine the left-wing votes in order to defeat the PSD [Social Democratic Party]," the Platform leader asserted. The PSP leader did not improve on that. Differences Between Congress and States General Guterres does not seem to be losing any sleep over the "Portugal: What Future?" congress, promoted by the president of the republic, being now more concerned about the convention and the placements on the list for the European Parliament. The PSP secretary general asserts that the congress and the "States General for a new majority" are initiatives of a different nature made at different times. The holding of the "Portugal: What Future?" congress in May could undermine one of the actions which the Socialists had planned in order to create a political dynamic following the European elections; that is, at the decisive starting point for the parliamentary elections. The timing would not be the only disruptive element. Mario Soares' stance in favor of a rapprochement between the PSP and the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party] in a left-wing front in order to defeat the PSD is well known. During the congress, the matter will still be on the agenda, and this will force Antonio Guterres to dot the i's and cross the t's. Yesterday, the PSP leader reaffirmed that the party will "discuss its own government blueprint as widely as possible. Hence to form an alliance with the PCP would be to cheat the electorate." These are statements which he will certainly have to reaffirm until May. The Socialist leader declined to comment on the presidential initiative's intentions, deemed it an important event involving civil society, but explained that "our concern is not just to unite the left; it is to find a coherent political majority for the country."
