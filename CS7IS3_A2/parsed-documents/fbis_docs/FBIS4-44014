[passage omitted] The deployment of the forces for the operation is going ahead as planned, the Defense Ministry states. A rapid intervention military medical unit will soon be brought near the action zone. This evening, nearly 500 men are in place in the Zaire border zone, the communique adds. Moreover, a first deployment of the Senegalese Army is preparing to join French forces. It is expected to arrive within 48 hours. Two French Government envoys today met the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is opposed to French intervention. Yannick Gerard, assistant director of African and Malagasy affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and Jean-Michel Marlaud, the ambassador in Rwanda, were received in Mulindi, the rebel stronghold in northern Rwanda. The meeting lasted two hours. The aim was to explain to the RPF leadership the substance of the French international humanitarian intervention initiative, and to answer questions, a communique from the French Embassy in Rwanda said. We do not know how the RPF reacted.
