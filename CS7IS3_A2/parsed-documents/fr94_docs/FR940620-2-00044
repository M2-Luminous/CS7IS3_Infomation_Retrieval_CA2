ACTION: Notice of extension of time for submission of applications. SUMMARY: On May 11, 1994, HUD published a Notice of Funding Availability for the Public and Indian Housing Youth Sports Program, requesting applications by June 20, 1994. The purpose of this Notice is to extend the time for submission of applications until July 20, 1994. DATES: The application due date originally announced for June 20, 1994 is extended by this notice to July 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robin Prichard, Drug-Free Neighborhoods Division, Office of Resident Initiatives, Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20410, telephone (202)708&hyph;1197. A telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD) is available at (202)708&hyph;0850. (These are not toll-free telephone numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This program is authorized by Section 520 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (approved November 28, 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;625). In general, Youth Sports Program funds may be used to assist in carrying out sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities for youth. A FY 1994 Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) for the above-described program was published on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24548). The original notice provided 41 days_until June 20, 1994_for applications in response to the NOFA. The Department has received numerous indications from prospective applicants that the allotted time for submitting applications is too short to permit the preparation and presentation of the necessary materials. In response to these concerns, the Department is extending the deadline for submission of applications for the FY 1994 funding round. It is hoped that this extension of time will expand the number and the quality of applications that HUD receives for funding. Applications will now be due on or before 4:30 PM local time, on Wednesday, July 20, 1994. An original and two copies of the application must be received by the deadline at the local HUD Field Office with jurisdiction over Public Housing Agency (PHA) applicants, Attention: Assisted Housing Management Branch Director (or, in the case of Indian Housing Authority (IHA) applicants, in the local HUD Office of Indian Programs, Attention: Office of Indian Programs Director). (A listing of the addresses of HUD Field Offices and Indian Field Offices is included as an appendix to the May 11, 1994 NOFA.) This application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. It is not sufficient for an application to bear a postage date within the submission time period. Applications submitted by facsimile are not acceptable. Applications received after the deadline will not be considered. Dated: June 14, 1994. Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
