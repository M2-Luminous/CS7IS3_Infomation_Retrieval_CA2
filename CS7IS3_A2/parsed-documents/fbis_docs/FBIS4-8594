There are tendencies toward improvement in the clinical and laboratory indices. The patient has slight hepatitis but with a tendency to heal within a brief period of time. There are two versions about the basic cause: Either a mechanical clogging of the gall bladder vessels, which occurred and passed rapidly, or a light form of an acute hepatitis virus. This was announced by gastroenterologist Professor Konstantin Chernev. A specific blood test of the patient will be carried out abroad. The result will be known within several days.
