However, at the same time, efforts have not been stepped up to explain and track what is happening in the securities market. Such efforts are especially needed, because the legislative tools of economic reform, or the improvement of the legal frameworks in which investment projects operate, will not realize the hopes pinned on them for an improvement in the national economy unless the Egyptian capital market and stock market resume operating efficiently, to take their place among international stock markets and capital markets. In this report, AKHIR SA'AH sheds light on the conditions and requirements which must be met to expedite the revival of Egypt's market. This revival is especially needed in order to move ahead with privatization through the offering of public companies' shares on the stock market. These offerings will achieve the desired goal of expanding the ownership base and promoting greater activity and vitality in the capital market and stock market. We spoke first with Dr. Muhammad Hasan Fajj al-Nur. He states that many entered the stock market for the first time after the promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992 (the Capital Market Law). This law is designed to expand the ownership base, develop and stimulate the capital market, and finance the market directly through the offering of securities after disclosure of the financial positions and distributed profits [of the companies whose shares are offered]. As of 7 January 1994, the General Capital Market Authority had authorized seven companies, with 76.5 million Egyptian pounds in capital, to engage in securities activity. The authority also authorized the issuance of: 248 original shares amounting to 765.8 million pounds or $101.9 million in capital, and 138 shares when capital is increased by 975 million pounds or $39.9 million; and financing instruments and bonds amounting to 60.5 million pounds in capital. The authority also issued seven licenses amounting to 30 million pounds in capital, and the establishment of 22 labor unions, bringing the total number of authorizations to 425 amounting to capital of 190.78 million pounds or $141.8 million. In addition, the Bank of Egypt was authorized to engage in investment fund activity and to issue 500 million pounds in investment certificates, and the National Bank was authorized to engage in investment fund activity and to issue 100 million pounds in investment certificates. According to Dr. Fajj al-Nur, final approval will be given after a board of directors for the authority is formed. Expansion of the Ownership Base [Mustafa] Although more than two years have passed since the Capital Market Law was promulgated, the market has still not achieved the desired activity level. Why is this so? Can it be attributed to reluctance among savings account holders to give up their desire for and choice of the safe route of saving in banks, especially after the painful experience of the investment companies? [Al-Nur] The investment companies affair undoubtedly casts a pall on the development of the capital market and on activity in the stock market. But an objective reading of the development of stock exchange activity over the past two years shows that there has been activity and trade. But more time and greater awareness, which is the media's role, are needed. Nonetheless, the stock market has undergone technological development. The Cairo and Alexandria stock markets have been linked, trading in shares and securities has been computerized, and operations and trading are monitored on screens. [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur stressed that Egypt's capital market will succeed only if the privatization program proceeds in tandem with it. Privatization requires an expansion of the ownership base through the stock market, not through the auctioning of public-sector assets. This is especially so given the privatization program's main aim, which is to expand the ownership base. The expansion of the ownership base differs from the concept of the expansion of the private ownership base. Expansion of the ownership base entails ownership on a wide scale, i.e., as many citizens and workers as possible owning the largest number possible of shares in the companies offered for sale. Expansion of the private ownership base means auctioning one or more assets of a company to one or more buyers. The state's goal at this stage is to deepen the sense of identification by expanding the ownership base on a wide scale, and to enable capital owners to obtain the financing they need to increase their investments. The state aims to achieve this through a strong market that is based on supervision which relies on transparency and openness. Development and Modernization of the Stock Market [Mustafa] Where does Egypt's capital market rank among international markets? [Al-Nur] Egypt's capital market, which has begun to attract attention worldwide, is ranked 20th among 50 recently established capital markets, according to a ranking of recently established stock markets performed by Euro Money to measure the maturity and efficiency of these markets. Taiwan's market is in first place. The Southeast Asian markets are also ranked highly. Most of them are in the top 20. [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur states that the following criteria were used to measure the capital markets' efficiency and ability to attract foreign investments: - Market size, which consists of the market's market value and the number of securities registered on its stock markets. - Liquidity, which is the ratio of the total value transacted during the past year to the market's total market value. - Number of weekly trading hours. - Strength of market concentration, which means the percentage of market value held by the 10 largest companies, in terms of the ratio of total market value to their shares traded, and the ratio of the total value traded to the value of their shares traded. - The cost of a transaction, which includes the broker's commission, stamp taxes, transaction expenses, and value-added taxes. - The duration of clearance and settlement arrangements. - Degree of reserve. - The market's ability to attract foreign investments. According to these criteria, Egypt's capital market is ranked 20th out of a total of 50 markets that have been developed over the past decade. This ranking is attributed to the development of the market which occurred in particular as a result of the promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992, which regulates the capital market. It is also attributed to the programs that were created to develop and modernize the stock markets, and the encouragement of the business sector to provide services in the securities area that had previously been lacking. All of these factors have done much to promote the attraction of foreign investments, especially investments by large financial organizations seeking new markets, especially markets in stable countries which pursue sound economic policies, in which to spread their investments. Dr. Fajj al-Nur emphasizes that the privatization of public-sector units through the stock market will advance the capital relative to international capital markets. This will draw attention to Egypt's capital market as an important, rising market in the world. The Shares of Public-Sector Companies Justice Mahmud Fahmi, the former head of the Capital Market Authority, believes that the liberalization of Egypt's economy, progress in the economic reform program, the giving of the lion's share of the leadership of economic activity to the private sector, and the success of the privatization policy all require a strong capital market. Hence, the General Capital Market Authority plays an essential, decisive role. One of its main tasks is to adopt all of the necessary means to consolidate national savings and channel them toward legitimate investment channels. This requires stimulating the issues market, i.e., establishing stock companies and joint stock companies that issue securities (stocks and bonds). It also requires measures to induce individuals to invest their savings in these securities. The authority is also tasked with supervising and controlling the secondary market, which is the securities exchange market. It performs this function on the stock exchange to protect securities transactors. A strong, regulated securities market with a high degree of efficiency, transparency, and absorptive capacity must be created if it is desired to channel national savings into investment in securities. This is especially essential in view of the decision to offer for sale, to the public and small savers, some shares that the public business sector owns in companies in the governorates or in public-sector companies. Thus, measures are needed to upgrade the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges and to establish essential financial organizations. This will strengthen both of these markets' capacity to absorb the shares of public-sector companies that will be offered for sale to the public. It should be noted that disposal through the sale of all or some of these shares will achieve privatization while allowing the relevant companies to continue enjoying their status as legal persons. The disposal will be limited to the transfer of the ownership of these companies' shares wholly or partially--49 percent or more--to the private sector by offering the shares for sale on the stock market and through securities brokers or brokerage companies to be established under the Capital Market Law No. 95 of 1992 and its implementing regulations. Justice Mahmud Fahmi concludes by saying that the liberalization of Egypt's economy and economic reform--through the use of a multiplicity of tools, whether legislative or the improvement of the legal frameworks in which investment projects of the private sector, investment sector, or public business sector operate--cannot succeed in improving national economic performance as hoped, unless they are accompanied by the strengthening of the capital market in its broad sense, i.e., in its capacity as a money market, capital market, and a securities market. Therefore, the government initiated measures to improve the performance of the money market and the capital market, and it issued Law No. 95 of 1992 on 22 June 1992. Numerous Types of Bonds Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, a former economic minister and the chairman of the Arab International Banking Corporation, believes that numerous factors play a role in stimulating the capital market. These factors relate to making investors aware of the benefit of investing through securities transactions. They also related to the securities themselves. There are more than 20 types of instruments, i.e., stocks and bonds, traded in the world's stock markets. There are nominal shares, fully-paid shares, preference shares, limited-term capital participation shares, bonds convertible into shares, and other types of stocks that are traded on international stock exchanges. Integrated Measures and Policies Dr. Hamdi 'Abd-al-'Azim, dean of al-Sadat Administrative Sciences Academy-Tanta Branch, believes that the stimulation of the capital market can be accomplished through a package of policies, which must be integrated. This depends on the seriousness of economic liberalization policies in terms of promoting the private sector, granting some advantages and tax exemptions to securities, liberalizing foreign trade and the export of basic commodities such as cotton far from compulsory delivery, reactivating the ready-made goods exchange that existed in Alexandria before the revolution, reactivating the future contracts exchange, and developing an international communications network. Attention should also be given to predictive studies and computer programs designed to generate forecasts and predictions, and to the gradual linkage of the stock market to international stock markets. Also, the issuance of modestly valued treasury notes for purchase by individuals should be expanded, and the number of moneychanging companies should be increased.
