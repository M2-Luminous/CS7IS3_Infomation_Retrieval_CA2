As a part of the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill and Criminal Procedures (Amendment) Bill 1992, the government proposed it be made an offence to disclose information likely to "prejudice" any investigation. The law would be restricted to an investigation which could lead to conviction resulting in a minimum fine of $20,000 and a year in jail. The deputy solicitor-general, Robert Allcock, told the Legislative Council group studying the amendment that the ban could help to avoid any tip-off to the person under investigation. Legislators feared that a new power prohibiting disclosure of investigation information would "go too far" against press freedom and public interest. A legislator, Emily Lau proposed that a separate clause should be put into the bill to state reasonable grounds for information disclosure if it was in the public interest. Group members had reservations about the proposal to abolish the requirement binding judges to warn juries to treat "uncorroborated" evidence given by an accomplice "with caution." Allcock said accomplices might have an interest of their own in giving evidence against the defendant. However, the government said the directions a judge would be compelled to make would be so confusing as to make the law unworkable.
