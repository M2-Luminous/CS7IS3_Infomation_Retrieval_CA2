The peaceful protest was called to express condemnation of Friday's massacre of more than 60 Palestinians by one or more Jewish settlers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron. But it turned to a highly politicised event to register what Islamist and leftist politicians as well as union leaders asserted was a popular rejection of any negotiated peace with Israel. "No to peace, yes to holy war," shouted the protesters, who began their march from the central bus station at al-'Abdali and dispersed at the al-Hashimiyah square in downtown Amman after brief speeches by leaders of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) and leftist organisations as well as heads of professional associations. The speakers severely assailed Mr. 'Arafat and his peacemaking strategy with Israel and demanded that all Arab parties, including Jordan and the PLO, withdraw immediately from the peace talks. Police kept a tight watch over the marchers, who included around 200 veiled women, but did not interfere. No violent incidents were reported. Banners wielded by the protesters, some of them masked and others holding aloft the Holy Koran, denounced the massacre and said: "No to surrender, no to negotiations," "Revenge, revenge," "armed struggle is our only choice," and "no for self-rule." The marchers condemned Mr. 'Arafat for accepting the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement with Israel and demanded that he be ousted from the chairmanship of the PLO. "Yes to the PLO, no to 'Arafat," said the protesters. Addressing the PLO chairman, they chanted: "Your day of judgement is coming." It was the latest rally to be held in Amman following the Hebron massacre, and was higher in political intensity than any other demonstration held since Friday, save another hardline protest march held in the al-Baq'ah camp Saturday. Earlier Sunday, a group of about 150 school students marched through the Jabal al-Husayn refugee camp to condemn the mosque massacre and vowing revenge. The centrist al-Mustaqbal party, led by Sulayman 'Arar, issued a statement on Sunday describing the Hebron killings as "a Ramadan gift by the Zionists to the Muslim and Arab people." The massacre should serve as a reminder to those who are engaged in peace talks with Israel that "there cannot be peace and security in the region as the racist state (Israel) exists among them." "Retribution in kind, not condemnation and statements, is the answer to this crime and other crimes committed by the Zionists against the Palestinians and Arabs... starting with (the 1948) Dayr Yasin massacre and (the 1982 killings at) Sabra and Shatilla and the (1968) burning of al-Aqsa Mosque," said the statement. Jordan is observing a three-day national mourning that ends Tuesday for the victims of the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the government is also raising funds to help the families of those killed and wounded in the attack.
