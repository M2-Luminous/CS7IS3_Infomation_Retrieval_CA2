Pu Sothirak, minister of industry, mines, and energy, together received H.E. Wolfgang Schallenberg, Austrian deputy foreign minister. The talks concerned the plan to repair the Kirirom hydropower network. H.E. Austrian Deputy Foreign Minister said that a plan to restore the Kirirom hydropower network, worth about $11 million, will be signed between Austria and Cambodia in the near future. Austria will dispatch technicians to carry out this plan. The Kirirom hydropwer station was built in 1965 by the former Yugoslavia and was operational in 1968. This station provided up to 10,000 kilowatts of power during the rainy season and about 5,000 kilowatt in the dry season. Many parts, however, have been damaged since 1970 when the hydropower station was abandoned. Austria and Sweden have been authorized by the Royal Government of Cambodia to study the plan to restore this hydropower network. Austria plans to provide about $11 million for the project and another $46,000 for protection and mine clearing in the Kirirom area.
