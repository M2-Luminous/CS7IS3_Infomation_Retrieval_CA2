In this document the candidates reaffirm their condemnation of the use of violence as a political weapon and urge their followers to behave peacefully. Signing the declaration were Armando Calderon Sol of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance], Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes of MAC [Authentic Christian Movement], Edgardo Rodriguez of Solidarity, Roberto Marchesini on behalf of Roberto Escobar Garcia of the PCN [National Conciliation Party], Jorge Martinez of the Unity Movement, Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democratic Party, and Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. The "Presidential Candidates Declaration," reads: 1. "We reiterate our firm condemnation of the use of violence, chiefly as a political weapon, and urge our supporters to behave peacefully and calmly during the few days remaining in the campaign. 2. "We reiterate our faith in democracy and, therefore, respect the sovereign decision of citizens freely expressed at the polls. 3. "We pledge to respect and enforce all the Peace Agreements, since they constitute a solid base for the future progress of our nation. 4. "We urge all Salvadoran citizens to participate in the 20 March elections by going to the polls and casting their ballots freely for the candidates of their choice. 5. "We ask for strict compliance with the commitments signed in El Salvador's 14 departments among the political parties' representatives to conduct a lofty and respectful campaign. We reaffirm our joint declaration of 5 November 1993. Afterward, Onusal chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said the latest incidents in the electoral campaign "are a normal thing as the electoral temperature rises." He urged the supporters of the different parties to remain calm. Arena candidate Calderon Sol hoped all the candidates who signed the pact would abide by it out of respect for the Salvadoran people. He indicated his party has kept all the other agreements they signed, although others have not respected them. "I commend Mr. Ramirez Ocampo's initiative, and we are prepared to abide by them, although it is unfortunate that the traditional parties do not abide by what they signed," Rodriguez indicated. Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora of the leftist coalition said he supported the pact. He also noted the campaign has been handled rather well, although he criticized some parties for conducting "a two-faced ad campaign, saying things they should not."
