They called on the electorate to vote for their two parties, which are still in the race for the second round of the 20 February legislative elections. In a joint communique sent to AFP, the eight parties, including the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), "exhort" voters who did not participate in the first round on 6 February to "realize the importance of what is at stake and turn out massively on 20 February to block the way to the forces that are hostile to change." According to the Togolese constitution, the head of state is bound to choose his prime minister from the parliamentary majority. Yesterday night the CAR and the UTD formed a "common front" for the second round for which they are the only two representing the opposition. After the 6 February voting General Eyadema's party members obtained 35 out of 81 seats, while the opposition obtained a total of 22 and was assured of winning 12 more on 20 February. Victory will depend on the results from 12 constituencies. In 11 of these constituencies pro-Eyadema candidates are facing opposition representatives, while Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh will fight it out in the last constituency with another pro-Eyadema candidate. In last Sunday's election, the participation rate was put at 65.12 percent, as against 39 percent during the presidential elections of last August, which was boycotted by all opposition parties.
