Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-11MAR94-GERMANY-FRANCE-CHINA Germany, France Push China Trade, Play Down Human Rights SUMMARY Apparently seeing little merit in a policy of open confrontation with the Chinese over human rights issues and at the same time eager to secure a share of China's burgeoning market, Germany and France have avoided all but the most muted public criticism of China's human rights record while steadily expanding diplomatic and trade contacts. German and French media, while supportive of improved relations with China, have expressed doubts about the wisdom of sof t-pedaling the human rights issue and yielding to China's demand to stop selling arms to Taiwan. END SUMMARY In marked contrast to recent U.S. policy, both Germany and France have chosen a low-key approach to the issue of Chinese human rights violations, arguing that it is more effective to promote democratic development through strengthened economic relations than through public admonitions. Germany's efforts, including lifting sanctions against China and yielding to China's insistence that it not sell submarines to Taiwan, culminated in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to China in November 1993 and the signing of several large contracts. Similarly, following months of diplomatic efforts to repair a rift in relations triggered by France's sale of Mirage airplanes to Taiwan in November 1992, France and China "normalized" relations on 12 January. In return for two key French concessions--recognition of the PRC Government as the "sole legal government of China" and Taiwan as an "integral part of Chinese territory" and agreement "not to authorize" any French enterprises to sell arms to Taiwan--China agreed to welcome participation by French firms in China "on an equal footing," according to a joint communique (Xinhua, 12 January). Germany's "Quiet Diplomacy" German leaders have repeatedly defended the government's policy of not pressuring the Chinese publicly on human rights and instead promoting change through economic relations and "behind- the-scenes" efforts. Both Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel have stressed that Germany's approach on Chinese human rights is to use quiet diplomacy and to promote progress on human rights and democracy in China through trade and economic reform: --Even after the recent roundup of Chinese dissidents, the German reaction was limited to an expression of "concern" over the arrests, and a caution issued by a foreign ministry spokesman that the arrests could "clearly disturb" German-Chinese relations. Indicating that even in this case the usual German nonpublic diplomacy was being followed, the spokesman said Berlin had "approached" Beijing on this matter the previous week (DPA, 8 March). --Explaining Germany's approach to the human rights issue, Kinkel told German ambassadors to Asia on 26 January that "wagging an admonishing finger" at the Chinese would not be productive, because Europeans cannot "impose" their cultural principles on the Asian countries. "Dignity," so important in Asia, he said, had to be respected. He argued that instead of public confrontation, it would be more effective to be "secretly active" to help in concrete cases of human rights violations (Frankfurter Rundschau, 27 January). Apparently with the United States in mind, Kinkel contrasted Germany's approach to those who "bang their fists on the table," and declared that the West "cannot enforce everything" with pressure on the leadership (Das Parlament, 24-31 December 1993). --During his trip to China, Kohl defended his approach on human rights, saying that he had had an "intensive talk on human rights" with China's leaders but that it was "not a subject" for public discussion (N-TV, 19 November 1993). "History has shown," he argued in another interview, that "freedom leads to more freedom" and that free economic development "has an impact on human rights and the freedom of the citizens" (ARD, 19 November 1993). German Press Questions Policy Until the arrest of Chinese dissidents in early March, media reaction had been largely supportive of the Government's trade initiatives in China and its low-key approach to the human rights issue. The Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung even said in a 25 January commentary that Kohl and Kinkel's efforts on human rights could "serve as a model" for dealing with China, because they demonstrated that "value-oriented" foreign policy does "not have to be an exercise in finger-pointing." Since the largescale arrests, however, the press has questioned this policy, criticizing both Germany and the United States for acceding to China's demands and suggesting that the West's approach is giving Beijing every reason to believe that the West will do nothing to jeopardize trade relations: --Following the arrest of prominent Chinese dissidents in early March, the influential daily Frankfurter Allgemeine on 5 March said the Chinese Government had shown what it thought of Western criticism: namely, "nothing." "For the sake of economic interests" the West will continue to turn a "blind eye" to the political suppression in China and even more so in Tibet, because the Chinese market is "too enticing." Europe's argument that the "closer the economic ties," the greater the chances for "political loosening up," has proved "illusionary." --On 17 February, Frankfurter Allgemeine chastized the German Government for the "shameful" way in which the city of Frankfurt had officially "invited and then uninvited" the Tibetan Dalai Lama to a celebration of Frankfurt's 1,200th anniversary, calling the move an "unnecessary kowtow" and an "undignified retreat" in the face of China's unreasonable demands. --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 5 March said that "just as during Kohl's trip" to China, Beijing seems to have come to the conclusion that "all western admonitions" on human rights are meant "halfheartedly." France Pleased In announcing renewed relations with China, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe avoided any mention of human rights issues, while saying that the "political weight of China and its economic power" justified France's decision to "resume the ties of trust." He expressed hope that this could be brought about through an "intense political dialogue with Beijing" and "strengthening of economic relations" (France-Inter Radio, 12 January). Although they avoided pressing the Chinese on the issue, French leaders apparently did mention human rights in subsequent meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Following a meeting with Qian in Paris on 22 January, Juppe spoke of a "new departure" in relations with China, saying that he had addressed the issue of human rights with Qian and that "a lot must still be done" by China in that area (AFP, 22 January). France's special envoy to China Alain Peyrefitte addressed the issue "with great subtlety" according to Le Figaro of 31 January, when he said at dinner with Qian in China that France, while it was unwilling to "impinge on a sovereign state's internal affairs," could "not be insensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and group freedoms." Skeptical French Press The French press has criticized the government's failure to press the human rights issue, and has largely been skeptical of prospects for significantly improved trade relations. Several commentaries attacked the government for yielding to China's demands on Taiwan and expressed pique at what they viewed as China's favoritism toward the United States, which they saw as having maintained relations with Taiwan without incurring Chinese retribution. --The influential daily Le Monde was particularly skeptical. An editorial on 14 January expressed doubt about the terms of the joint communique, saying that the Chinese have shown "how little regard" they attach to their promises of trade advantages. As for human rights, it charged, Beijing is "convinced that 'hypocritical' Western concerns for human rights" will eventually be superseded by greed. On 25 January, Le Monde wrote sardonically that normalization of relations with China indeed represented a "new departure," since "commercial interests" had now "displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre," which the French government at the time had denounced with a determination "unmatched throughout the world." --A commentary published in Liberation of 16 February charged the French Government with "obsequiousness" and "grovelling" toward Beijing in pledging not to sell weapons to Taiwan. China's rulers "do not respect the rules" accepted by the international community with regard to human rights, weapons sales, or external trade, the commentary said, noting that the United States remained the "only country that still dares to say no to China" (Liberation, 16 February).
