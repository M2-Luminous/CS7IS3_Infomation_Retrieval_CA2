I MAKHI has learned that the government and the political leadership are furious with the U.S. role and its persistence in not briefing the Greek Cypriot side on the contents of the Vienna talks. Political circles in Nicosia are strongly concerned that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas may "conditionally accept" the confidence-building measures. They stressed that one consequence of such a negative and dangerous development would be to shake Cyprus-U.S. relations. In any case, yesterday the government explicitly reiterated its opposition to the current delay and warned harshly about the repercussions from any amendment to the 21 March UN document. In a meeting yesterday between Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher which could be described as a protest move, the government tried to find out whether Lamb had actually submitted proposals (as mentioned in the Turkish Cypriot press) that approximate the negative Turkish positions. According to I MAKHI's information, Boucher explicitly denied that any assurances or promises were made to the Turkish Cypriot leader during the Vienna talks. The Cypriot Government does not appear to have much faith in the U.S. assurances, because reports from New York speak about a further delay in the submission of the report (until the end of May, early June). After meeting the U.S. ambassador, Mikhailidhis stressed that "the impression that is created by the delay in submitting the report is that this is designed to serve the Turkish positions and maneuvers." He added that the United Nations has described the 21 March document as final, and that is how our side accepted it. Despite relevant assurances, Boucher's remarks yesterday intensify concerns about U.S. activity. Asked whether Washington had promised anything to the Turkish side, Boucher specifically said: "The entire procedure for implementing the confidence-building measures depends on promises made to both sides." He added that the basic point is "to find an operational settlement that will enable both sides to use the basic changes (from the confidence-building meausres) to find a new way of approaching the Cyprus issue." Boucher said there is still a chance, stressing that the United States continues to support the measures. The preparation of the UN secretary general's report has already begun. The foreign minister and Tom Richardson, British deputy foreign secretary, exchanged views on current developments at their meeting yesterday. The British official, who had earlier met Denktas, said he did not get the impression that the Turkish Cypriot leader is trying to buy time. Richardson denied that the United States and Britain are involved in behind-the-scenes activities. Kasoulidhis' Statement Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis reiterated that if there are any attempts to change the 21 March UN document, the Cypriot Government will cease to abide by it. He also said the Cypriot Government is angry because of the repeated delays in submitting Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council. Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis intends to hold a referendum so the Cypriot people can decide if they want the confidence-building measures, Kasoulidhis said the president has not yet decided on what he will do if he is forced to pull out of the 21 March document. Asked if the Cypriot Government will lodge a demarche with the U.S. about reports that during the Vienna talks Lamb submitted proposals for amending the 21 March document, Kasoulidhis said this is under consideration.
