During a press conference, Lacalle denied that there are two integration systems, a slow one and a fast one, "because we are not like the European Community [EC], which has 12 members; we are only four countries." This idea was conveyed to observers by the speech by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who demanded sincerity and who reported the series of problems that Mercosur is confronting. Lacalle, who supported Wasmosy's speech because of its "frankness," explained that three years ago, when the Treaty of Asuncion was signed with short terms for implementation, "we all knew it would not be easy, because there are differences of opinion in all systems, even in NAFTA or in the EC." He said Mercosur is moving forward "with urgent preestablished deadlines" that help expedite the process. "One should be optimistic in all activities, and I am optimistic about the possibility of achieving integration, but I am also pragmatic, because we base our action on actual facts," Lacalle stressed. Asked about what would happen if no agreement is reached over the single external tariff, which was not announced today -- especially because of the discrepancies between Brazil, which strongly protects its industry, and the other countries, which demand a low tariff to ensure the system's efficiency -- Lacalle replied with doubts, saying that "a solution may or may not be reached in June." "We began a path toward integration which has gone through various phases. It is a dynamic process with different steps and stages, either under the name of common market or customs union," he said in order to minimize the cricism over the failure to reach an agreement to fully implement the system next year. Lacalle also addressed the labor centrals, which are controlled by leftist groups, which were not granted an audience at the summit, and which released a communique in Montevideo. "This is a meeting of nations. We are not a corporation. The presidents, who were democratically elected, represent their countries," Lacalle said. "We are ready to listen to all the proposals that are consistent with the course that was agreed upon, and that are submitted to the Mercosur secretariat, which should then formulate them to be submitted to the presidents. We cannot transform these meetings into sessions for sectorial demands," he added. He lamented that the labor centrals of Mercosur countries "do no want to use this system, preferring public demonstrations." He emphasized the presidential declaration's point on the importance that matters dealing with employment, migration, the protection of workers, and the coordination of the labor legislation of member countries have for building the common market. "They are difficult matters that we have not yet formalized but that we will jointly address in work groups," Lacalle said.
