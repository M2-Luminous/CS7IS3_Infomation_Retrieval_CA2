Akhba said the commission which would be composed of four members from each side will start its work in Sochi on 1 June. Akhba said he was confident the talks would produce an agreement to establish a cease-fire and troop separation on 12 May. The final variant of the agreement had already been prepared, he said. The document provides for the deployment of peacekeeping forces along the river Inguri, the line of confrontation between Georgian and Abkhazian troops. Before the deployment, the two sides are to separate their troops each by 12 km from the river. According to Akhba, it was decided that the CIS peacekeeping forces would be deployed in the area. "It is more likely that it will be a Russian contingent," he said. U.N. officials will act as observers. Akhba pointed out that the decision to deploy CIS peacekeepers in Abkhazia should be taken by CIS states in response to an appeal by the participants of the talks. If the agreement is signed, such an appeal may be sent as early as Thursday. Akhba did not preclude that in this case the decision to deploy the peacekeepers in the conflict area might be made within the next five days.
