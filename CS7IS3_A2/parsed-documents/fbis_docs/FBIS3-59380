It should be realized that there is a difference in principle between the "fair trade" promoted by the Clinton administration and trade protectionism. They are absolutely not the same. "Trade protectionism" is to erect tariff or nontariff barriers on the U.S. market to prevent foreign goods from entering the market to achieve the goal of protecting the American domestic market. To promote "fair trade" is to ask U.S. trade partners to open up their markets to U.S. goods and provide U.S. goods with an equal opportunity to enter foreign markets while keeping the U.S. market open for merchandise from other countries. It seeks to open up the closed markets of other countries and expand the scope of free trade instead of sealing up the U.S. market. Therefore, "fair trade," the purpose of the trade policy of the Clinton administration, is definitely not a facade of trade protectionism just like what some people believe. In essence, it is even closer to the principle of free trade instead of the principle of trade protectionism. When we talk about "fair trade," one of the questions that we have to answer is: Does the principle of reciprocity demanded by those who promote "fair trade" run counter to the basic principle of free trade? Another question is: Since the United States promotes free trade, should it still follow the principle of reciprocity? Many theoreticians believe that the principle of reciprocity is incompatible with the principle of free trade. Since the Clinton administration emphasizes the principle of reciprocity (I open up my market to you, you should also open up your market to me), it has given up the principle of free trade. I think that this kind of inference is over-simplified. In general, the principle of reciprocity emphasized by the Clinton administration in its "fair trade" policy has not violated the basic principle of free trade. It is perhaps better to say that this is precisely what free trade is about. In essence, the principle of reciprocity is the principle of equality and mutual benefits. It demands that trade partners on both sides enjoy equal status and equal rights in their trade activities, and that both sides reap benefits. This is precisely what free trade demands and stands for. Trade activities cannot last very long, if they are not built on the basis of equality and mutual benefits. It is reasonable for a sovereign state such as the United States to demand that trade partners should share equal benefits and obligations in doing international trading. This is not an excessive demand. As far as the contents of its demands are concerned, they are also not something of a protectionist nature. Naturally, they also differ from the completely unconditional free trade policy which the United States had promoted for a considerably long period after the War. Relying on its absolutely predominant economic position in the world between the end of the War and the 1970s, the United States had implemented an unconditional policy for free trade, and set the example for other nations in taking the road of free trade. During this period, the speed and extent of the U.S. open market had greatly exceeded other nations. The United States had not strongly demanded that other nations open their markets the way the United States did, because its products which were extremely competitive could easily enter and seize the markets of other nations. What the United States promoted during that period was a one-way unconditional free trade policy. It is somewhat of a "preferential" nature. To a considerably great extent, the United States "tolerated" the unfair trade which foreign nations imposed on the United States. After the 1970s, Europe and Japan have rapidly caught up. The U.S. absolute predominance no longer exists. The United States has lost its position of strength in carrying out one-way unconditional free trade policy. Therefore, beginning from the 1980s, it has called for "free and fair trade," keeping the U.S. market open, while asking other nations to open up their markets in the same way. In despite of the fact that the proposal of "fair trade" signifies the relatively weak U.S. economic position in the world, it has not weakened to the extent of erecting a trade barrier and practicing protectionism in an overall manner. The United States still has the strength to uphold free and open trade policy. The principle of "reciprocity" stressed by the Clinton administration means to eliminate, not erect trade barriers. It is aimed at mutually opening, not closing markets to each other. What the Clinton administration demands does not run counter to the principle of free trade. It is a two-way, conditional free trade policy. In despite of the fact that it is no longer a totally unconditional free trade policy, it still falls within the major scope of doing free trade. We should not brand such policy as protectionist. The major trend of the trade policy of the Clinton administration is free trade, not protectionism. Nevertheless, it is not because Clinton favors free trade, while detesting protectionism. The objective situation has made him do so. The objective conditions at home and abroad which have made the Clinton administration oppose trade protectionism and uphold free trade are as follows: I. Demand for Global Economic Integration Right now, global economic integration has reached a high degree. The world economy has become an entity of interrelation, interaction and mutual reliance. A single country cannot possibly separate itself from the world economy and operate on its own. A free, open international trading system is an indispensable condition for the smooth economic operation of the United States. This is precisely why the United States must implement a free, open trade policy. The Clinton administration also clearly understands that trade protectionism is a double-edged sword, which may harm its trade partners and finally hurt itself. Protectionism will only escalate the trade war. As the largest trading nation, the United States will bear the brunt and suffer the greatest damage when a global trade war breaks out. II. United States Still Has Economic Strength in Carrying Out Open Trade Policy Under the new world economic situation, the United States still has the economic strength needed to implement an open trade policy, despite the rise of Japan and Germany, which has weakened the U.S. economic position in the world. The U.S. leading role in world economy and its potential to maintain this leading role in the foreseeable future constitute the foundation of the Clinton administration in upholding free trade policy. In particular, we must point out that the United States possesses the greatest ability in carrying out scientific research, developing technology, and blazing new trails in the field of economy. This is of great significance in an era in which science and technology constitute the primary productive force. It is the basic advantage of U.S. economy. It is closely related with the unique U.S. social and historic conditions (social diversity, compatibility, openness and mobility). No other nation has this kind advantage. Right now, the United States is way ahead of other nations in the world in terms of labor productivity, which plays an important role in becoming competitive in world economy. In the global competition for high technology which affects the future of the world economy, the United States is also predominant. We should also realize that the advent of the information society and the post industrial era has further strengthened, not weakened, the dominant position of the United States. It has provided the United States with even more favorable conditions than other nations, because the present economic competition in the world is one of science and technology, one of blazing new trails, one of intellectual resources and qualified and trained personnel. The United States is strong in all these realms. From the development of an international trade point of view, the share of the trade of products (visible trade) drops, while the trade of services (invisible trade) is rapidly rising. This situation is compatible with the development of the information society. The dominant position of the United States in international competition is more distinct in those fields which are closely connected with the new technological revolution, such as the realms of intellectual property rights, service trades, technical transfer and international investments. This predominance has demonstrated tremendous potentials in the 1990s when the era of information society and soft economy is rapidly approaching. This is precisely what the Clinton administration keeps in mind and expects in upholding its free trade policy. III. The United States Has Improved Its Situation in Foreign Trade; It Is Not Weak or Uncompetitive. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |U.S. Foreign Trade Situation in Past Decade | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Items |Total Volume |Total Volume |Deficit in Fo-|Share Deficit | | |of Imports |of Exports |reign Trade |in GDP | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1983 |2017 |2689 |671 |1.9 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1984 |2199 |3324 |1142 |3 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1985 |2159 |3380 |1221 |3 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1986 |2233 |3684 |1450 |3.4 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1987 |2502 |4097 |1596 |3.5 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1988 |3202 |4471 |1270 |2.6 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |3617 |4774 |1157 |2.2 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |3887 |4976 |1089 |2 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |4160 |4897 |734 |1.3 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |5325 |4482 |843 |1.3 percent | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source of reference: Economic Indicators January 1993 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many theoreticians regard the tremendous amount of trade deficit that the United States had since the 1980s as important evidence for the inevitable protectionist trend in formulating its foreign trade policy. Their deduction is that the tremendous amount of trade deficit totaling tens or hundreds of billion U.S. dollars shows the increasingly deteriorating U.S. situation in foreign trade and its weakness in meeting world competition and that only by relying on this "straw" of protectionism, will it be possible to reverse this trend. Is this deduction correct? It will be very clear if we earnestly and realistically analyze the actual situation in U.S. foreign trade during the past decade. From the aforementioned reference material, we realize that in the mid-1980's the U.S. foreign trade situation had seriously deteriorated with the trade deficit rapidly increasing. The trade deficit reached a peak of $159.6 billion in 1987. The U.S. foreign trade situation has improved since 1988 with its rate of growth in exports increasing, the rate of growth in imports decreasing, and its trade deficit continuously dropping with the exception of one single year. (The trade deficit in 1992 was greater than that in 1991, mainly because the economic depression in Japan and Germany had affected U.S. exports.) The share of its trade deficit in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased every year. The actual situation indicates that the U.S. foreign trade situation has improved, not deteriorated, since the late 1980s. Despite the fact that its trade deficit still amounts to tens of billions of U.S. dollars in recent years, it only accounts for 1.3 percent of its GDP. With its huge GDP which exceeds $6,000 billion, the United States is still able to withstand such a trade deficit. From this, we can see the kind of arguments saying that the situation in U.S. trade is deteriorating in each passing day, that the United States is too weak in foreign trade to meet world competition and that only by relying on protectionism can it manage to support itself, are unrealistic. In fact, the U.S. situation in foreign trade confronting the Clinton administration is less grim than that during the days of the Reagan and Bush administrations. Therefore, there is no need to risk everything and implement the extreme policy of trade protectionism which may play the role of a double-edged sword. It is precisely this kind of objective economic situation that decides the orientation of the foreign trade policy of the Clinton administration, makes the administration follow general trends of free trade, and prevents it from taking the wrong road of trade protectionism in despite of the fact that the Clinton administration exhibits a more distinctive protectionist color than the Bush administration. By analyzing all aspects in breadth and depth, we have studied the nature and the basic trend of the trade policy of the Clinton administration. Our conclusion is that instead of being protectionist, the trade policy of the Clinton administration closely follows the basic principle of free trade. There is a difference in principle between protectionism and the "fair trade" which is the purpose of the trade policy of the Clinton administration. The trade policy of the Clinton administration is closer to the principle of free trade than that of protectionism. We like to point out that we are only talking about the basic nature and the major trend of the trade policy of the Clinton administration. We do not want to deny the fact that such trade policy is imbued with protectionist ingredients. In fact, the trade policy of the Clinton administration is tainted with a deep protectionist color and composed of many protectionist components. These protectionist components are mainly manifested as follows: The Clinton administration seems to make more direct protectionist means to deal with the "unfair trade actions" of its trade partners. For example, its "war of steel" with Japan and the European Community was an action it took to greatly increase its import duties to sanction their dumping activities. It also tried to increase its government subsidy to wage an "aircraft war" with the European Economic Community. Particularly it had time and again talked about its intention to even more strictly implement its "quota system for imports," asked its trade partners to exercise "self-restraint" and imposed excessively high sanitary and environmental standards on them. All these are typical trade protectionist measures, because all of them are used to prevent and restrict foreign goods from entering the U.S. market. Therefore, when we say that the major trend of Clinton's trade policy upholds free trade, we absolutely do not imply that it has no protectionist ingredients at all. To deny or cover up this "negative" aspect of the trade policy of the Clinton administration is an equally unrealistic analysis. In short, we must, on the one hand, understand that the basic nature and major trend of the trade policy of the Clinton administration follows the principle of free trade, while on the other hand we must also realize that such policy of the Clinton administration is tainted with more protectionist color and composed of more protectionist ingredients, and that it adopts an even more uncompromising stand in foreign trade. From an overall point of view, the Clinton administration may uphold the free trade policy under general conditions. In certain realms (such as automobile, textile and steel industries) and under certain conditions (especially conditions which will deeply affect labor employment), it may also adopt some protectionist measures. Only by seeing these two aspects of the trade policy of the Clinton administration and realizing that such policy has dual characteristics (naturally one is primary, while the other secondary), will it be possible for us to completely and accurately understand the trend of U.S. trade policy in the 1990s.
