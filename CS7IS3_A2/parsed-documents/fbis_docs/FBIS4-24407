"it is critically important to Asia -- the most dynamic and vital region on the face of the globe -- that our two countries have a relationship that works," the chamber said in a news release issued here this evening. It noted that the president's statement of his intention to delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN signals a firm commitment on the part of the American Government to rebuild a "functional, effective and wide-ranging bilateral relationship." "The long and bitter debate over MFN is over at last," said Gerald Murdock, chairman of the chamber. This is a time for "moderation and optimism," he said, adding "both the United States and China must seize the moment to build new ties, based on broader engagement and dialog."
