FBIS4-58030 "drnes084_k_94002" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 IRAQ Addresses Officials, Residents Addresses Officials, Residents JN0105074994 JN0105074994 BFN [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic at 2000 GMT on 30 April carries a "recording" of a 28-minute off-the-cuff address delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to al-Anbar officials and residents during his visit to al-Anbar Governorate on 30 April. Reception ranges from fair to poor, with a number of indistinct passages. Saddam begin his address by commenting on the speeches made by the al-Anbar dignitaries. He observes that, in their speeches, they began with history. This shows that the Iraqis and Arabs care about history and the past, just as they care about their future. He adds that the Arabs always stress the nonmaterial meanings of the past, citing a speaker who highlighted the historical status of al-Anbar in the past, rather than its material possessions. Saddam adds that the most important thing he wishes for the people of al-Anbar is for history to record their positions so that their grandchildren may take pride in them. He tells them that every position has its rewards and consequences. Saddam then recalls his previous visits to al-Anbar. Saddam continues to elaborate on the link between the past and the present, noting that the Arab nation is capable of making great achievements when it relies on God and gathers the necessary elements for success. He then talks about anti-Arab trends in the Arab world that have cast doubts on the Arab nation's present capabilities and argue that the past glory of the Arabs is over. Addressing people of al-Anbar on this point, Saddam adds: "Your great role and the role of your people is that they have created a vital link between the present and the past." He then refutes charges that the Arabs do not know how to use their minds or how to utilize science. Saddam says science emerged first from Baghdad and then developed in other nations later when Baghdad retreated for reasons familiar to all historians. Saddam says this link between the past and the present is important because it enables the people to look toward the future with confidence. The present shows that the Arabs know how to respond to the scientific age in a balanced, correct fashion, because the Arabs have faith that puts science on its proper track. Saddam tells the people of al-Anbar that their sacrifices provide strength to remedy the weakness on the part of certain Arabs and Arab officials who, wittingly or unwittingly, have taken a wrong course of action. Saddam then recalls a conversation he had with an "Arab official" during the war with Iran. He says he had told the official that the Arabs should thank Iraq, not for the obvious reasons -- that Iraq is the eastern gate of the Arab nation and that it protects the nation, enabling many people to sleep peacefully when they could not before -- but because Iraq upholds the banner of the Arab nation and has given all Arabs a chance to demonstrate an honorable position, whether in words or by contributing money or troops. Saddam says that a right is not lost if someone continues to claim this right and fights to regain it. He recalls in this connection some battles fought in al-Anbar to regain its lost territory, thus showing the Arabs their history in the making. Saddam concludes his speech by thanking God for everything that has happened and praising God for everything that is yet to come. The recording of the address ends at 2028 GMT.
