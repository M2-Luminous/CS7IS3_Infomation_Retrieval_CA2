In response to an April 7 letter from the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ARATS said that Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council had already made clear its stand on the matter and on the handling of the boat fire tragedy. The boat disaster claimed 32 lives, including 24 Taiwanese tourists, on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31. ARATS said in its letter of reply that Taiwan compatriots coming to the Mainland to visit relatives, travel, for investment or other activities, have their personal safety and property protected by the law. The Mainland departments concerned are doing all they can to find out the cause of the incident, according to the letter. It urged SEF to handle the matter in a rational and cool-minded manner, so as to avoid a setback in relations between the two associations and the two sides of the straits. It said that there had been several incidents involving the loss of lives and property of Mainland compatriots and Taiwan compatriots contemporaneous with past contacts between Taiwan and the Mainland. ARATS has been following the matter closely and is prepared for talks on the matter after necessary preparations. ARATS said it was willing to listen to the opinions of SEF and will forward them to the Mainland departments concerned.
