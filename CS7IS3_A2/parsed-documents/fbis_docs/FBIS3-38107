The Walloon Socialist senator Guy Mathot, who was one of the three ministers accused of being involved in the bribery, has revealed a document in which the present foreign affairs minister, Willy Claes, was mentioned. At the time of the Agusta deal Claes was minister of economic affairs. The document says that five years ago the minister had a meeting with the dismissed Agusta manager, Rafael Otetti. The meeting is said to have taken place in January 1989. On that date, Otteti had just been removed as president of the board of directors of Agusta. Meanwile, the man is on the run in South America. One day after the meeting with Minister Claes a new Agusta president was appointed. Senator Guy Mathot also denies the incriminating statement of the former Liege (?unionist) [name indistinct]. A few days ago [name indistinct] said the relationship between Guy Mathot and the murdered Walloon Socialist leader Andre Cools had reached an absolute low after the controversial Agusta contract was signed. Mathot now says this is untrue. The murder of Andre Cools is said to be linked to the Agusta bribery scandal. Meanwhile, the commission of the Walloon region, in its turn, has proposed to lift partially the parliamentary immunity of Guy Mathot, Guy Spitaels, and Alain Von den Beest. The Senate has already done so for Mathot and Spitaels.
