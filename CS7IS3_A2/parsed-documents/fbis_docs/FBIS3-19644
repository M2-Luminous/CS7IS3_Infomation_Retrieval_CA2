This was announced by Horst Waffenschmidt, the Federal Government's resettler commissioner, upon inquiry on Friday [18 March]. The parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry summarized the results of the meeting of the German-Russian government Committee that recently took place in Bonn, chaired by himself and by Russian Nationalities Policy Minister Shakhray. The Committee set down the direction of future activities. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politician noted that it is primarily important to "create a stable and generally favorable sociopolitical situation in their compact settlement areas and places for resettlement in Russia" for Russian Germans who want to stay in Russia. A first step toward fulfilling President Yeltsin's decree "on immediate measures to rehabilitate the Russian Germans," has been made by establishing national local councils and self-administration organs in the Kamyshin rayon (Volgograd area) and in the Engels rayon (Saratov area). It is a step on the path toward the goal of 10 July 1992 of implementing the "protocol on cooperation between the government of the Russian Federation and the government of the FRG with the aim of gradually reestablishing the Russian Germans' state." According to Waffenschmidt, it was helpful that the Russian Government has now put together a "package of juridical documents" about the legal status of a national okrug, rayon, and national local councils and presented it to the Russian Federation Assembly ("Upper House"). The Russian nationalities policy minister explained his "concept of a bilateral program for the development of the Russian Germans' culture" as well as a draft of the "federal program for the reestablishment and development of the system of steady national formation of Russian Germans and the first steps for its implementation by the year 2000." Agreement has been achieved on discussing the proposals of the Russian Nationalities Policy Ministry at a special meeting of the German-Russian Cultural Cooperation Committee in Bonn on 20 and 21 April, with the participation of representatives of the Russian Germans' organizations. Waffenschmidt added that both partners welcomed ideas for the Russian Germans' self-organization, which are aimed at the confirmation and official Russian recognition of their national and cultural character. This applies, above all, to the "German People's Assembly," some kind of Russian-German parliament. The People's Assembly should participate in specifying forms of national-cultural autonomy and the development of the Russian Germans' self-administration organs. Bonn will give priority support to a Russian-German administration college, which is on the point of being established. Focus Western Siberia Waffenschmidt said that it was noted with satisfaction that Moscow registers positive investment results for Russian-German joint ventures, expressed in a clear increase in the financing volume. For 1994 the Russian budget allocates 39 billion rubles (39 billion marks) to projects for the benefit of Russian Germans; the budget of the German Interior Ministry allocates 65 million marks to this purpose. The regional development societies in the German national rayon of Asovo (Omsk area) and in the German national rayon of Halberstadt in the Altai area have proved their worth. Bonn and Moscow agreed to examine the resettlement project in Nashchokovo (Tomsk area) with the aim of implementing it as soon as possible if the result of the study is positive. Russia's federal immigration authority wants to provide financial means for this purpose. In addition, it is useful to intensify measures that promote the Russian Germans' own initiative. This is to be achieved by granting low interest loans for the construction of owner-occupied houses and for the establishment of small and medium-sized companies (loans for setting up new business). Waffenschmidt also stated that for him the promotion of church centers is an important element in the work of Russian Germans. In Omsk the Hannover Evangelical-Lutheran Land Church and the FRG Interior Ministry are supporting the construction of an Evangelical church center. In addition to church rooms, meeting places for young people and senior citizens as well as rooms for charitable work are being built. The church center in Omsk will become a cultural center for the 500,000 Russian Germans in western Siberia. Together with Land Bishop Hirschler from Hannover, he, Waffenschmidt, will inaugurate the center in the summer. In Marx (formerly Katharinenstadt) on the Volga, Cardinal Sterzinsky, the bishop of Berlin, inaugurated the Catholic church center last year. Many descendants of the Volga Germans, who settled in the area of Saratov, have found a new spiritual home in this church center. Upon the request of the Russian Lutheran Church and the FRG government, the city has once again made St. Peter's Church in St. Petersburg available to the Evangelical church. In communist times a swimming pool had been built there. Waffenschmidt said that gradually "St. Peter's church is to be expanded into a church center and a cultural center, in cooperation between the Evangelical church and the FRG government." In the view of the CDU politician, the meeting of Russian Germans and their non-German neighbors is to be particularly promoted in the above-mentioned church centers. Upon his urging, three church centers have already held ecumenical services with Evangelical, Catholic, and Russian Orthodox clergy.
