FR940826-2-00005 FR940826-2-00004 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;827] Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Critical Circumstances; Certain Cased Pencils From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kristin Heim or Thomas McGinty, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3798 or (202) 482&hyph;5055, respectively. PRELIMINARY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINATION: The Department of Commerce (the Department) published its preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value in this investigation on June 16, 1994 (54 FR 30911). On July 22, 1994, petitioner in this investigation alleged that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain cased pencils from the People's Republic of China (PRC). On August 1, 1994, petitioner amended the original allegation, submitting additional information regarding the existence of critical circumstances in this investigation. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2)(ii), since this allegation was filed later than 20 days before the scheduled date of the preliminary determination, we must issue our preliminary critical circumstances determination not later than 30 days after the allegation was submitted. Section 733(e)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), provides that the Department will determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist if: (A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, or (ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than is fair value, and (B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period. History of Dumping In this investigation, the first criterion of analysis is addressed in petitioner's July 22, 1994, submission. This submission provides documentation indicating that in April 1994 the government of Mexico published an antidumping duty order of 451 percent on certain cased pencils produced and exported from the PRC. Therefore, petitioner has established that there is a history of dumping elsewhere of such pencils by PRC producers/exporters. Importer Knowledge With respect to the alternative first criterion, we have consistently determined that preliminary antidumping duty margins in excess of 25 percent on U.S. purchase price sales are sufficient to impute importer knowledge of sales at less than fair value. See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Metal from China (56 FR 18570, April 23, 1991) and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia (57 FR 38465, August 25, 1992). In this investigation, all responding and non-responding companies received preliminary antidumping duty margins in excess of 25 percent. Therefore, we determine that importers either knew or should have known that the exporter was selling certain cased pencils at less than fair value. Massive Imports Because we have preliminarily found that the first statutory criterion is met for finding critical circumstances in that there is a history of dumping of the subject merchandise and, alternatively, there is actual or imputed importer knowledge of sales at less than fair value, we must consider the second statutory criterion: whether imports of the merchandise have been massive over a relatively short period. According to 19 CFR 353.16(f) and 353.16(g), we consider the following to determine whether imports have been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) Volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. When examining volume and value data, the Department typically compares the export volume for equal periods immediately preceding and following the filing of the petition. Under 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), unless the imports in the comparison period have increased by at least 15 percent over the imports during the base period, we will not consider the imports to have been ``massive.'' To determine whether there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time, the Department examines shipment information submitted by the respondent or import statistics, when respondent-specific shipment information is not available. On August 4, 1994, the Department sent letters to respondents requesting information regarding shipments of certain cased pencils for the period January 1992 to May 1994. On August 16, 1994, we received the requested information filed in proper form for each of the four responding companies. Because company-specific shipment data was provided by the four responding companies in this investigation, we have used this data for our analysis.
