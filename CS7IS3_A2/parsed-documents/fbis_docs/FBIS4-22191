In January the financial requirements of the Fleet were met only to the level of 25.3 percent, in February only by 36.5 percent, and at the end of March, only by 18 percent. As was noted by the Chief of the Financial and Economic Directorate of the Pacific Fleet, Colonel N. Sheremetyev, the Fleet cannot even pay for bread for the table of compulsory-service seamen, not to mention paying plants for ship repairs. In the near future complete disconnection of naval forces from energy supplies is expected.
