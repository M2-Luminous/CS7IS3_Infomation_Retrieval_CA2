This part is determined by the high sorption capability and rates in mass exchange and low hydro- and aerodynamic resistance of these materials. Graft polymerization of ionogenic monomers and chemical conversion of functional groups in grafted chains are the most common methods for preparing chemosorbing fibers. To prepare various types of such fibrous materials, graft polymerization of radicals to fibers having various chemical structures have been developed--hydrocellulose, polycaproamide with redox systems as ionogenic, and non-ionogenic (acrylonitrile, glycidyl methacrylate). These methods make it possible to conduct graft polymerization with practically no homopolymer formation at high process rates and under ecologically clean conditions. Chemo-sorbing fibrous materials having ion exchange and complex forming properties were prepared by chemical conversion of functional groups (epoxy, nitrile) on grafted copolymers. In the present work a brief characterization of the results of using these fibers and fabrics made from them to resolve ecological problems in various areas is presented. Covered are fibers made from grafted cellulose and polycaproamide fibers containing hydrazide groups to adsorb heavy metal ions, the sorption activities of fabrics in respect to sulfur dioxide, sorbents for radionucleides, and sorption-active carbon fiber materials. The latter may be used to adsorb petroleum products from water. Figures 3; references 12: 11 Russian, 1 Western.
