Opening the meeting, a few verses were read out by one of the ulema and then esteemed Mawlawi Ataurrahman introduced members of the decision-making council to the esteemed president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Then, Hojjat ol-Eslam Walmoslemin Khodadad Erfani spoke about the coup attempt by a group of criminals and said: Criminal communists once again, in collaboration with the hypocrite Golboddin, soiled their hands with the blood of the innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar is a hypocrite element of our era who destroyed Kabul due to the existence of militia in the past. Distinction between the militia and Golboddin is now difficult to make. Hojjat ol-Eslam Erfani also said that the Sunni and Shi'ia ulema of Afghanistan have expressed support for the declared jihad by the president of Afghanistan. He considered jihad against militia and communists as the duty of every Muslim. Then esteemed Mawlawi Ruhani and Mawlawi Kefayatollah spoke in turn and considered jihad against the militia as a duty to God. The esteemed president then praised the role of ulema during the era of jihad and said: It is without any doubt that, under the present conditions, the faithful ulema have taken their resolute stand. This means that the conscience of our nation is awake and your meeting is indicative of the national and religious unity of our country.
