Bashir made these remarks during an interview with Chinese journalists at the Friendship Hall of the capital Khartoum this afternoon. He said: Sudan and China support and respect each other in political issues. With China's support, Sudan has constructed a number of projects and the Chinese people offer their support to Sudan without attaching any conditions. China has never interfered in Sudan's internal affairs; the recent friendly visit of Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, has promoted bilateral relations to a new stage. Bashir noted: Sudan has drawn up a long-term program for economic development and it will face the Orient and open up to Asian countries to develop its economy and overcome current difficulties. Sudan welcomes investment from Chinese entrepreneurs and hopes to expand its cooperation with China in the economic field. Speaking on Sudan's southern problem, Bashir stressed: The southern problem is a political issue, which can only be solved through political negotiations. As soon as the National Salvation Revolution Command Council took power, it convened a national meeting with participation of people from various parties, seeking appropriate ways to solve the southern problem. Following this meeting, it held peace talks with the opposition forces of the south in Addis Ababa, Nairobi, and Abuja. The protracted civil war in the south has harmed the interests of the Sudanese people. The Sudanese Government has paid great attention to the settlement of this problem through peaceful means and has made unremitting efforts toward this.
