FR940825-1-00042 FR940825-1-00008 6. The SAVE System A few commenters claimed that the 1988 proposed rule's provisions on the SAVE verification procedures seemed premature, since it appeared that the necessary coordination with the INS had not yet been completed. They asked HUD to make clear that a rule would not take effect until the SAVE process is fully operational. HUD has been working closely with the INS to implement the SAVE system for its covered programs, and fully expects to have all of the necessary coordination completed before the effective date of a final rule implementing section 214. In addition, HUD plans a delayed effective date for its final rule. The delay will provide for a period that is sufficient for project owners and HAs to undergo training on the SAVE system and become proficient in its use. As a result, HUD fully expects all necessary coordination with the INS on the use of the SAVE system to be completed before the effective date of the final rule implementing section 214. Other commenters claimed that the 1988 proposed rule failed to provide the detailed information necessary to implement SAVE such as how requests for verification would be transmitted to the INS, who would bear responsibility for lost INS documents, or what line item of the ``statement of profit or loss'' in HUD Form 92410 should include the relevant administrative costs. The procedures for the SAVE system are established by the INS, and HUD is required to use these procedures. Therefore, elaboration of the SAVE procedures is not a matter to be established by HUD through rulemaking. The INS has a handbook governing the procedure, and HUD will develop supplementary instructions that will assist responsible entities in following the SAVE procedures. HUD expects to issue detailed guidance well in advance of the effective date of a final rule. F. Reasonable Opportunity to Establish Eligible Status_No Denial or Termination of Assistance during Reasonable Opportunity Period Several commenters strongly objected to HUD's interpretation in the 1988 proposed rule of 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii) and (d)(4)(B)(ii). These statutory sections state that HUD must provide individuals with ``a reasonable opportunity'' to submit immigration documents for verification with the INS, and that pending this period HUD may not ``delay, deny, reduce, or terminate (an) individual's eligibility for financial assistance on the basis of the individual's immigration status.'' In the 1988 proposed rule, HUD maintained that so long as the responsible entity continued to process an applicant for purposes of establishing eligibility for financial assistance, and placed the applicant's name on a waiting list once eligibility (aside from eligible immigration status) was established, it was complying with the requirements of IRCA. HUD reasoned that under this procedure the applicant's ``eligibility for financial assistance'' would not be delayed pending the secondary verification, even though assistance would not actually be provided until eligible immigration status was verified with the INS. The commenters argued that delaying assistance because of immigration verification violates IRCA's prohibition against delaying assistance during the reasonable opportunity to submit immigration documents, or pending the INS verification or INS appeal. They further claimed that the distinction drawn by HUD in the preamble to the 1988 proposed rule between delaying eligibility and delaying financial assistance violates IRCA as soon as an applicant reaches the top of the waiting list. The commenters instead advocated admitting applicants based upon their written declarations of eligibility, and later evicting them if secondary verification establishes that the tenant is an ineligible alien.
