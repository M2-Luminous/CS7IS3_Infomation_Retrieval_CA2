The government is composed of nine ministers of the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development Party. They are the same as in the preceding government. They are in their previous posts. All the Republican Democratic Movement ministers are new. They include: the minister for foreign affairs and cooperation, Jerome Bicamumpaka; the minister of primary and secondary education, Dr. Andre Rwamakuba, and the minister of information, Eliezer Nitegeka. For the Social Democratic Party, there are also three new ministers: the minister of agriculture and livestock, Straton Nsambumukunzi, and the minister of public works and energy, Yacinthe Nsengiyumva. For the Christian Democratic Party, there is one minister who has kept his post. He is Gaspard Ruhumuliza. For the Liberal Party [PL], there are two ministers who have kept their portfolio: Justin Mugenzi, who remains at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Agnes Ntamabyaliro, who keeps her Ministry of Justice. A new minister of the PL is Jean de Dieu Habineza, who has been appointed as minister of works and social affairs. It seems that ministers whose whereabouts were unknown were replaced. Others are those who were replaced for political reasons. The government was set up by the five political parties which make up the government. The president of the Republic, as you know, is Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, former president of the National Development Council [parliament]. Three ministers were not sworn in. These are the minister of interior and communal development, Justin Munyazesa, who is on a mission. The same applies to the minister of defense, Augustin Bizimana, who is also on a mission. Minister Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of agriculture and livestock, was also not sworn in. He was in Butare at the time of the swearing in. The government has a six-week term. That is, it should carry out necessary negotiations for setting up the broad based transitional government in cooperation with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] in six weeks, as requested by the UN Security Council. The government therefore has a precise role: to manage the crisis situation, to continue negotiations with the RPF and to assist the people who are threatened by hunger and famine, in some prefectures such as Gikongoro and Butare or in the camps of displaced people.
