He predicted "consequences that are difficult to foresee" if Riga does not change its policy vis-a-vis the Russian minority in the country. Kozyrev's intervention was caused by a new election law in Latvia that deprives the strong Russian minority of its right to vote in local elections. According to Kozyrev, about a third of Latvia's population is affected by this rule. "Thus, political rightlessness is turned into law," Kozyrev complained. He warned against the "fatal consequences of aggressive nationalism." Strong warnings were expressed in several passages: Political extremism might lead "to a confrontation between Latvia and its neighboring states." Russia is Latvia's neighbor. Within the framework of international law, Russia will do "everything possible to ensure the protection of the rights of ethnic Russians in Latvia," the minister stressed. Latvia is to blame for the difficulties. Its policy aimed at driving out the country's population that belongs to another ethnic group and its efforts to create a state with a single ethnic group may lead to "consequences that are difficult to foresee." Kozyrev demands -- he apparently considers this the last opportunity -- that the international organizations raise their voices. The "mechanism of preventive democracy" must be initiated. The majority of the Russian minority moved to Latvia in the past 50 years where living conditions were more agreeable than in the rest of the Soviet Union. In the period between the wars, the Baltic states were independent. Before that, they had been part of the Tsarist realm for a long time. Russian troops continue to be deployed in Latvia.
