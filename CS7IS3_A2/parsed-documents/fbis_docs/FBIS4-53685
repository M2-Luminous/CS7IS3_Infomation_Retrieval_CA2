Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency, told a press conference that the freeze also will bring about other favorable effects on the economy, by prompting public utility companies which had planned to raise their charges to undergo further restructuring measures. The government announced last Wednesday that public fees would not be increased this year, including those for telephone services, taxis and national highway tolls. Tanaka said he had been informed of the announcement the night before. Asked why Jiro Saito, vice finance minister, was not informed of the announcement until the next day, as he later complained, Tanaka said that he himself was only informed apparently because he was due to leave Japan on Wednesday for an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meeting in Paris.
