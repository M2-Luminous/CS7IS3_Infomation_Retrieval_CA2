Addressing a rally at Mothibistad near Kuruman, Mr. Modise said the target was not homeland government's but the government in Pretoria. He said victory would be claimed after President F.W. de Klerk had been removed from power. The office of the kwaZulu chief minister says the ANC alliance and certain trade unions will not succeed in sowing distrust between kwaZulu public servants and the kwaZulu government. The kwaZulu government said allegations of misuse of pension funds were untrue as it paid the pension contributions of kwaZulu public servants to the South African Government on a monthly basis for investment.
