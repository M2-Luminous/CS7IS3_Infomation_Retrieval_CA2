According to Interfax sources, the party's message to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev points to the necessity "to resume the dialogue and restore the ruptured links." Without mutual understanding with Chechnya, there will be neither peace nor tranquility in the south of Russia. Neither can the future of the Chechen people be based on constant confrontation with Russia or on isolation from the world community, says the message.
