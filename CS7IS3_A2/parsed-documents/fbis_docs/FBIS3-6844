Hosokawa delivered the message by videotape since he cannot attend the Defense Academy graduation ceremony on Sunday due to his visit to China which started Saturday. "We must lead disarmament...in the world," Hosokawa said. It is unusual for a prime minister to stress disarmament in a message to graduates of the Defense Academy, defense sources said. Hosokawa, pointing out drastic changes in the international situation following the end of the Cold War, also called for fresh ideas regarding the nation's defense program. It is the first time that a prime minister will not attend a Defense Academy graduation since 1978, when then prime Minister Takeo Fukuda failed to attend because of illness.
