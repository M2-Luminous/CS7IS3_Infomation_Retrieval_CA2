"We have heard of it but we do not have details", a police spokesman told AFP on telephone. Police said that the rebels, estimated at 20, attacked the dispensary, taking patients and medical staff unaware, fired in the air to disperse patients and medical personnel and then looted all drugs available. The attack was the latest on civilian targets by the rebels, who have defied an ultimatum by President Yoweri Museveni on February 13 to surrender. On the day the ultimatum was supposed to expire -- February 20 -- the rebels led by Joseph Kony, a man in his late twenties, attacked an army unit at Tegot-Pawel, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Gulu town, during which four army soldiers and 14 rebels were reported killed. On Monday the rebels ambushed a police vehicle near Ayugi river, 11 kms (seven miles) along the Atiak-Moyo road in northwest Uganda, killing 11 people, including two soldiers.
