The document demands to make Russian an official language together with the Kirghiz language in areas predominantly populated by Russian-speaking people. According to the head of state's instructions, it is necessary to do it in all vital branches of the country's economy, where the use of achievements of science and technology is linked with the use of the Russian language, such as public health, mathematics and technical sciences. The decree instructs the government to extend the transition timetable set for the use of the national language in business correspondence, and secure a just representation of the Russian-speaking population in state structures from the highest to the lowest rung. The Foreign Ministry has been instructed to coordinate a simplified procedure of receiving the Russian and regaining the Kirgiz citizenship with corresponding departments of the Russian federation. This document concludes with a decisive demand from the law enforcement bodies to intensify combatting all kinds of manifestations of nationalism. Among noteworthy "achievements" of documents, decisions and decrees issued during the past few years are either their slow implementation or their existence only on paper. For example, the preceding decree on the change over to the use of the Kirghiz language in business correspondence has almost been neglected. The latest decree, which runs counter to the Constitution adopted on 5 May 1993, might become a restraining factor for the migration, and unite the opposition. More so, because almost all structures of power have become multi-national during the past three years. Decisive reshuffles of the personnel, as demanded by the presidential decree, may be sabotaged and eventually undermine Kirghizia's economy which is already living through a deep crisis.
