He emphasized that Syria "did not ask Christopher not to come to the region" and that it was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin who did that. The same official told AL-HAYAH that "there is not a single Syrian who would accept, would be able, or would be authorized to forfeit even a single grain of the homeland's soil. President Hafiz al-Asad said that, and it applies to all times, conditions, and circumstances." He reaffirmed that "there is a big gap between the positions of Syria and Israel" and that last time Secretary Christopher came to Damascus he did not bring "a satisfactory Israeli reply" to Syria. He emphasized that "no power on earth can force Syria to accept what it does not want.... We take a long view and we known that a conflict like the Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be settled justly and comprehensively under the pressure of any time element or any other element." The same source said that "the right thing in the peace process on the Syrian track would be for Israel to accept the essence of the peace process, namely land for peace -- the occupied territory in return for Arab peace for Israel. When Christopher last came to Damascus it was clear that Israel wanted to discuss details and secondary issues before beginning to lay down the foundations of peace on the basis of the principles agreed between the United States and the parties to the peace process. If the occupied territory -- all the territory occupied during the 1967 aggression -- is not returned, there can be no real and true initiation of the establishment of peace in the region or on the Syrian-Israeli track." He said that "Israel did not give the United States its acceptance of the land-for-peace principle but played around with phrases and words to mislead world public opinion. Rabin spoke of withdrawal from the Golan and he also spoke demonstratively saying that he would opt for the dismantling of the settlements in the Golan if he had to choose between peace with Syria or the settlements in the Golan. It was clear that Rabin was working more for misinformation than for real peace in the region." In reply to a question, he said that what Syria "wanted and still wants is a just and comprehensive peace in the region based and founded on the principles of international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. There is nothing in these principles and resolutions that gives the condemned aggressor Israel the right to keep even one single inch of the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 aggression. That is why Syria told Christopher and world public opinion that there was a big gap between the positions of Syria and Israel. Syria really and seriously wants to proceed toward the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace but Israel, through verbal and diplomatic games, wants to fulfill its aims and ambitions in the region, something it could not fulfill through its numerous wars and aggressions." The senior Syrian official added that, in Syria's view, "the letter A of the alphabet which must be uttered before the rest of the letters of the peace alphabet can be pronounced is a declaration of Israel's agreement to fully withdraw from all the territories it occupied during the 1967 aggression, in implementation of the UN resolutions and the peace process principles. When Israel pledges full withdrawal, and in so doing opens the way for the fulfillment of the aim of the peace process, we can then move on to the question of security arrangements and then to the rest of the relevant issues to establish a full peace between Syria and Israel." He said that President al-Asad had declared at his joint press conference with President Bill Clinton in Geneva that Syria "is prepared to sign an agreement with Israel if it accepts the equation of full peace in return for full withdrawal. Syria cannot put the cart before the horse and engage in discussions about peace and details of peace relations before the cornerstone is laid down for ending the state of war which has existed between Syria and Israel since 1948. The horse must come before the cart, and that horse is full withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967." In reply to a question, he pointed out that "Syria has cooperated with the United States in the peace process since the letter sent by President al-Asad to former U.S. President Geroge Bush accepting the U.S. initiative which launched the peace process on the basis agreed by the United States and the rest of the parties concerned with the target set for that process, namely just and comprehensive peace. Damascus had repeatedly received former Secretary of State James Baker and also received Secretary Christopher, and never said that it would reject a U.S. secretary of state's visit or that it was severing contacts with Washington. What Syria wants is a peace process based on the principles agreed upon for that process leading also to the target set for that process." In reply to another question, he said that "to this moment and to this day, Washington has not said that it has abandoned the principles agreed upon for the peace process nor the set target which is just and comprehensive peace. U.S. President Clinton has reaffirmed his adherence to the peace process and the basis and objective agreed upon. There has been nothing from the American side to indicate that it wishes to abandon that position. When Washington announced that it would play the role of full partner, that meant that it felt the process, which Israel was delaying, required more efforts in order to proceed and continue."
