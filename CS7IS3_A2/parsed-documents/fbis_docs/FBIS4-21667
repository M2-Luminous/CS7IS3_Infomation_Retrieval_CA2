The Russian diplomat, who requested anonymity, said this in an interview with CHUNGANG ILBO that day. He made it clear that if North Korean development of nuclear weapons is confirmed, Russia will not give assistance to North Korea even if North Korea is attacked militarily because such an attack on North Korea will not fall under the provisions of the military alliance treaty signed between North Korea and the former Soviet Union in 1961. The Russian diplomat explained that although the military alliance treaty the former Soviet Union signed with North Korea is still valid with Russia's succession to the Soviet Union, Russia is not required to provide military assistance to North Korea when North Korea provokes a war ahead of the other side. Thus, Russia will regard confirmation that North Korea has developed nuclear weapons as provocation by North Korea, he said.
