In an editorial today, the paper says the stance adopted by the UN officials since the crisis began has been one designed to demonstrate neutrality and ignore responsibility to preserve peace and stability in member states. The newspaper adds that the international organization has left the Bosnian people easy prey for extremist ethnic gangs, which get the most modern weapons anywhere, while it has barred the victimized people's access to weapons to defend themselves. The paper describes the world's position on the massacre as "loose and feeble," although the world claims it has reached the peak of civilization.
