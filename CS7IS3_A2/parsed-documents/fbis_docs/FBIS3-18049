According to calculations of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research (Munich), however, the rate of growth is slowing down: In 1992 investments (including state funds) in the new laender increased by about one-third to 119 billion German marks [DM] and in 1993 by just under 20 percent to DM142 billion, while economic researchers predict a 15-percent increase to DM162 billion for 1994. The impetus is now increasingly coming from the services sector, above all apartment rentals and other services, while there is a slowdown in the industrial sector, it was stated. The development of investment, which, compared with western Germany, is far more expansive in the new laender, resulted in investments per inhabitant in eastern Germany that for the first time were higher than in the old laender. According to Ifo calculations, the difference between approximately DM9,100 per inhabitant in the east and DM9,000 in the west in 1993 will probably further increase to the advantage of the new laender (DM10,350 compared with DM9,300). Divided into sectors, it is shown that investments in the sectors of transportation, communications, the state, and industry in particular are clearly higher than in the west. According to Ifo calculations, it is safe to assume that west German and foreign enterprises alone invested DM50.5 (last year DM42) billion in the new laender in 1993; DM57 billion are expected for 1994. In the processing trade the level of the previous year will probably not be reached for the first time in 1994. A relatively vigorous restriction of west German investments, which is expected to be partly balanced by the increase in foreign commitments, is hidden beneath the slight decrease.
