Narasimha Rao, by accepting the World trade pact at the behest of America and other industrialized nations, has mortgaged India's sovereignty, and therefore, he should resign his position, so demanded the Janata Dal [JD] on Thursday last. One hundred and seventeen nations have agreed to the world trade pact. This accord will adversely affect India's industries, including agriculture and textiles. This will pave the way for foreign domination in Indian industries. Therefore, India should get out of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade [GATT]--said 26 members of parliament belonging to the Janata Dal in a petition presented to the President of India. This information was given by one of the Janata leaders, Ram Vilas Baswan. BJP's criticism: The Bharatiya Janata Party vehemently criticized the government for accepting the Dunkel draft for the world trade pact. "Dunkel's suggestions have been widely criticized by various sectors, yet the Rao Government accepted them and this deserves to be condemned," said BJP's spokesman, Krishna Lal Sharma. He said they will present a petition to the President on Thursday. Congress Party responds: The Congress Party has claimed that it is the right decision to accept the Dunkel draft. The party spokesman, V.N. Gadgil, said that the suggestions were considered fully by the party and only those that demand to be in the best interests of the country were accepted. What Is the Dunkel Draft? The General Agreement on Tariff and Trade is an institution intended to coordinate and promote trade among the nations of the world. This is an international organization just like the World Bank. It was started in 1948, after World War II with 117 member nations. In 1986 September, a GATT conference was held in Uruguay in South America. GATT's secretary, Arthur Dunkel, presented a 600-page report at the conference. The report carries various suggestions to promote world trade. It was stipulated that only those nations that agreed to these suggestions could be members of the GATT. Those countries who agreed to the draft could not formulate or discover new kinds of highly potential seeds and hybrid seeds in agriculture. They can use only seeds that have been patented internationally. In the matter of agricultural production, no more than 10 percent could be given as subsidy for manure, insecticides, electricity and irrigation. December 15 was the last day for the acceptance of the Dunkel draft. In the meanwhile, news was out that the central government has accepted the suggestions. The opposition parties feel that the interest of Indian farmers will be adversely affected.
