[Kozlov] Right from the first day, all signs point to a struggle between Gaydar's "Russian Choice" favoring the government and the president, and an intransigent opposition, represented primarily by you and your supporters. [Zyuganov] As I see it, "Russian Choice" does not seem capable of fully appreciating the results of the 12 December elections. That grouping did not win 60 percent of the votes, it only collected 15 percent, and it does not control the political process. It can block no constitutional decision on its own, so it will have to work with other groups, and it has no internal homogeneity: There are elements that fully appreciate that the bombing of the White House put an end to democracy in Russia, and there are those who are ready to launch the country once and for all along the road to dictatorship. No group is homogeneous, and in a short time we shall see the formation of the classic pattern of left wing, right wing, and center. [Kozlov] Will this parliament be even more critical of the executive of the disbanded Supreme Soviet? [Zyuganov] The tone adopted by any parliament depends on what is happening in the streets and the mood of the electorate. The worse the situation in the country, the more critical and rigid will be not only the parliament, but the social, and even governmental, structures as well. [Kozlov] Do you intend to bring the issue of a revision of the Constitution up in the Duma? [Zyuganov] Our experts are busy studying the text of the Constitution. In accordance with our election manifesto, we insist that the Constitution be approved by a two-thirds majority, otherwise it will not be the law of consensus but the law of division and deterioration. [Kozlov] Who is your candidate for the position of speaker? [Zyuganov] The idea is to appoint the speaker of the Duma from one of the minor parliamentary parties, a widely respected figure but one without extreme ideological beliefs, while each of the larger parties would delegate a deputy speaker and a committee chairman to satisfy the interests of the political forces. [Kozlov] What is your view of the forthcoming Yeltsin-Clinton summit? [Zyuganov] It will be an important meeting because it involves a visit by the president of a major power. After the downfall of the USSR, the field of geopolitical forces has shifted in favor of the United States and NATO, so these talks have great significance for Russia, especially in view of the state that we are in.
