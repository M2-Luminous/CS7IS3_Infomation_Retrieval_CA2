Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted, subject to final approval, an Agreement Containing Consent Order from Adobe Systems, Inc., (``Adobe'') and Aldus Corporation (``Aldus'') (collectively, the ``Respondents'') in resolution of antitrust concerns arising from Adobe's proposed acquisition of Aldus (the ``Acquisition''). The proposed Consent Order (Order) has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the Agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the Agreement or make final the Agreement's proposed Order. Respondents Adobe and Aldus, which market, respectively, Adobe Illustrator and Aldus FreeHand, are direct and substantial competitors with respect to professional illustration software. The Commission has reason to believe that Adobe's acquisition of Aldus would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง18 and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง45. The proposed Order if issued by the Commission, would settle the allegations of the Complaint. The proposed complaint in this matter alleges that Adobe Illustrator and Aldus FreeHand are the only illustration software programs which offer features and performance characteristics enabling graphics professionals efficiently and reliably to create and print high-quality illustrations. It alleges that the proposed acquisition would result in a monopoly in the market for professional illustration software for use on Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh computers. It further alleges that even if the relevant market is broadened to include the development and sale of all illustration software for use on Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh computers, or is broadened even further to include the development and sale of illustration software for use on IBM-compatible computers with the Windows operating environment, the relevant market is highly concentrated and Adobe and Aldus have a combined share of more than 35% of sales. The products in the broader markets are differentiated and a significant share of sales in the broader markets is accounted for by customers who regard Illustrator and FreeHand as their first and second choices. The complaint further alleges that entry into the market for professional illustration software would not be timely, likely, or sufficient in its magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition because developing a professional illustration program is difficult and time consuming, and marketing a technically comparable or even an improved illustration program would be difficult and time consuming because of network externalities associated with Illustrator's and FreeHand's extensive installed user bases. Repositioning of other programs to compete with Illustrator and FreeHand would also be difficult, time consuming and unlikely.
