"Violent crimes" are what worry the police most because although there has been a decrease in the political violence generated by the war, the crime rate is swelling, Caldera stressed to AFP. According to the officer, the growing crime rate is a result of "political violence, economic crisis, and the culture of violence" so entrenched in this country, which was at war throughout the entire past decade. The war between the contras and Sandinists left more than 50,000 victims, including dead, injured, crippled, as well as material losses amounting to the millions across the entire country. According to a study carried out by the National Police, the public order situation changed "substantially" in 1990, both in magnitude and type, to include takeover of lands and institutions and public demonstrations and protests over government policies. In 1990, when Violeta de Chamorro assumed control of the government, replacing the Sandinists and ending the war, there were 28,005 crimes. That number increased to 30,896 in 1991, 35,924 in 1992, and 42,394 in 1993. In 1990, the police dismantled 125 criminal bands. However, in 1991 they dismantled 189; in 1992, 288; and in 1993, 363. In addition to the criminals in the cities, there are 500 armed men in the mountains who ravage the peasant population. In the first three months of 1994, the police have reported dismantling 98 bands; a rate 31 percent higher than last year. During those four years, authorities solved 3,320 crimes and arrested a total of 3,946 criminals, many who are repeat offenders. Furthermore, in 1990, among other reasons because controls were reduced, drug crimes increased a substantial 120 percent, according to the National Police. In 1991, authorities seized 730 kg of cocaine, 155 kg in 1992, 97 kg in 1993, and up to now in 1994, 1,100 kg of the drug have been seized. Murders have also increased since 1990 when 202 people were slain. In 1991, the number was 259; in 1992, 325; and in 1993, 331.
