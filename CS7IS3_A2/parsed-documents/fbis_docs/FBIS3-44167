"We in Azapo will intensify the struggle in all forms and all the components of the black consciousness movement, including the Azanian Liberation Army [Azanla], are urged to fight to the bitter end," Azapo Natal Chairman Patrick Mkhize told a press conference. Blacks had been sold out by deals struck at the Kempton Park negotiating forum and Azapo was distributing more than 10 million pamphlets advising blacks not to participate in the "sham elections", he said. Azapo would also prevent the National Party and the Democratic Party from recruiting black support in townships, he added. Mr Mkhize said the black consciousness army, the Azanian Liberation Army, would intensify its military campaign although there was no specific programme of action against the April poll. "Azanla will continue to fight until people are free," he said. Only when land "stolen from black people by settlers" had been returned would there be true liberation. Voting in the April elections would be tantamount to blacks "rubber stamping the selling of their land for life", he maintained. Mr Mkhize said he could not elaborate on Azanla's military agenda as "it has its own programme of action". He stressed, however, that Azanla would never become part of the national peace keeping force but would become "the army of the people when South Africa is free". Asked whether Azanla would continue armed action after the elections, he replied: "As long as the aspirations of black people have not been met the struggle continues." He said the questions of homelessness, landlessness, poverty and hunger had not been addressed by Kempton Park negotiators. Mr Mkhize claimed Azapo was daily gaining support and had more than 20,000 members in Natal.
