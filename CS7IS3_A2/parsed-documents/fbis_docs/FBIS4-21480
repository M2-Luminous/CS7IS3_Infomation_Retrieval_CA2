Appointed by the Environment Ministry, the Second Carbon Dioxide Committee regards energy conservation, reduction in the use of fossil fuels, and taking good care of our forests as the most important ways of slowing down the greenhouse effect. In the committee's opinion, parliament may very well ratify the agreement, which it is at present discussing, which over 50 countries have already approved, and which is to go into effect internationally next month. Parliament must act quickly so that Finland does not lag behind in what may be the most extensive and most important implementation of the Rio agreement. The committee calls for versatile solutions that will be effective for a long time so that carbon dioxide emissions can be stabilized by the turn of the century and gotten back down to the 1990 figures. A more effective technology than before must be developed for the production and use of energy. We must switch to fuels that produce few emissions and gradually to clean alternatives despite the fact that nuclear power has been ruled out -- to the regret of the committee. We are already on the right track in Finland, but development must be accelerated with economic and administrative control measures. Used with care, the proposed limits on concentrations and taxes on energy will be good alternatives, as long as they do not interfere with trade or weaken our ability to compete. One would not think that this danger is hard to ward off since the other industrial countries will also have to meet the same challenges and the climate agreement will have to be observed in international trade. The forests offer Finland both leeway and an incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and stimulate other countries to do the same. Woodlands will increase and bind much more carbon than is logged in them. A significant absorption of carbon will also be obtained by planting trees on hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land to be taken out of agricultural use, whereupon the energy production, industry, and traffic sectors will manage to better implement their own reductions. While it is impossible to stop the greenhouse effect, the climate must not be allowed to warm up any more than one degree in a century so that conifers, which grow for a long time, can adapt to the new living conditions. Consequently, a country that lives off of the lumber industry has a quite special need for effectively enough slowing down the change. From Finland's standpoint, interesting as well is the possibility of perhaps counting in its favor reductions in greenhouse gases that we would achieve by modernizing outdated technology for dealing with an abundance of emissions in cooperation with Estonia and Russia or by reforesting desertified developing countries. The Rio agreement calls for major changes in the climate policies of first the industrial countries and then the developing countries as well. The immediate goal for the turn of the century is only the first stage, after which the process will have to be continued for several more decades.
