He said: We are used to Sanaa's going back on its approval of previous initiatives. He added: There is no going back on the decision to separate Democratic Yemen. Al-Asnaj described the presence of northern forces in the South as occupation. Al-Asnaj revealed some aspects of the initiative proposed by the southern leadership to resolve the Yemeni crisis. In an exclusive statement to AL-ITTIHAD AL-USBU'I, al-Asnaj said: The southern initiative was an integrated plan that came in harmony with Security Council Resolution 924. The plan, he added, took into consideration the idea of setting up a military committee in which the two sides are represented, in addition to the parties that were represented in the previous military committee before the outbreak of the military operations such as the Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, as well as the U.S. and French military attaches. He said that the Russian Federation also asked to participate in this committee, adding that the southern plan called for expanding international participation to include the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council. Al-Asnaj said the southern party also proposed expanding the work of the committee to guarantee its success in entrenching a cease-fire by adding some sisterly Arab countries and representatives of the Arab League and some Asian and African countries to monitor cease-fire violations and the party that causes these violations, to ensure the arrival of humanitarian aid, and to achieve disengagement between the forces in light of the military situation, which is completely different from the picture drawn by news agencies. Al-Asnaj said he considered the presences of northern forces in the south an occupation, noting that the removal of these forces is only a matter of time. The deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Aden government stressed that there will be no retreat from the declaration on the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen following the southerner's suffering from, and contempt for, a unity that was based on hegemony, tyranny, and annexation. He said the assessment of unity in the future must be left for the future generations after people recover from this painful experience to realize a more stable and untroubled unity that agrees with Yemeni realities. Al-Asnaj revealed why the meeting between President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and UN Envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was delayed. He said: When we were in al-Mukalla, President al-Bid insisted we all must go to Aden so that the UN envoy can see for himself the extent of damage in the city and the deteriorating health and human conditions there. Ibrahimi, however, said he could not make the trip because UN regulations forbid its envoys from going into war zones and putting their lives in danger. Al-Asnaj expected the UN secretary general to receive the report of his envoy soon and to present the report, after completing it, to the UN Security Council to take the necessary steps to implement Resolution 924. Al-Asnaj explained that the southerners will call for an emergency UN Security Council session to discuss the northern violations that prevented the implementation of the UN resolution. The southern foreign minister underlined his accusations that foreign hands are prolonging the Yemeni war by providing military and political support to Northern Yemen, referring, particularly, to Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, and Iran. He said the prolongation of this war will have serious consequences on security and stability in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, especially in view of the important world interests in this region.
