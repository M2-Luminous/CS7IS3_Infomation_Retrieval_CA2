[Kuncheva] Prime Minister Berov kept his promise and addressed the National Assembly. However, he did not present a draft of structural changes but instead read a declaration on the future intentions of the government. The declaration contained promises on updating the government's program and adopting measures aimed at stabilizing the country in the economic and social spheres, and also something that resembled an explanation of the need to effect changes in the posts of deputy prime ministers and in the leaderships of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Trade. An urgent meeting of the National Assembly Council is discussing at present whether it is admissible to open a parliamentary debate on the prime minister's declaration and whether this conforms to National Assembly regulations.
