Chapter 3 Memorandum of Agreement between the African National Congress and the Afrikaner Volksfront (unsigned - 21 December 1993) The delegations of the African National Congress and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF] have met on numerous occasions to discuss matters arising from the political transition in South Africa. 1. These discussions have resulted in the following agreements of understanding: 1.1 Both parties are committed to the development of a non-racial democracy. They both accept that many Afrikaners also have a commitment to the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat and that this ideal should be addressed expeditiously, without delaying the current process of transition. Both parties reject any political suggestions which would embody racism and failed apartheid policies. Proceeding from its perception of the balance of political forces, the AVF has been unambiguous in its rejection of communism as an acceptable political system. 1.2 Both parties believe that the objectives stated above are attainable, and that a suitable political solution can be found through a process of negotiations. The formulation of this solution demands commitment founded on a new vision for the future South Africa, supported by its leadership. Both parties seek constructive engagement in the constitutional process. This is a crucial commitment which will help in addressing the entrenched mistrust and antagonism which exists between the supporters of the Afrikaner Volksfont and the African National Congress. 1.3 Both parties recognise the danger of serious conflict between members of their respective constituencies, and the destructive impact such conflict would have on the future development and property of South Africa. Furthermore, both parties have expressed their concern about the unstable social and political environment in the country, the unacceptable levels of political violence in particular regions, and the levels of crime and general crisis in the maintenance of law and order. All these matters, including the continuing spate of murders of farmers in rural areas, must be addressed collectively as a matter of urgency. 1.4 Though the two parties do not share a common position on the proposed schedule for the transitional process they have agreed that a strategic agreement, addressing matters of mutual concern, ought to be entered into. This will facilitate the implementation of the transitional process and the conduct of the elections on 27 April 1994. 2. Therefore, given the above mentioned concerns and considerations, the following agreements are now registered: 2.1 South Africa should be the home to all its inhabitants who share a common future, based on peaceful coexistence, economic interdependence and constitutional governance. 2.2 The two parties are determined to find an acceptable and sustainable accommodation for all In South africa, bearing in mind the aspirations of the two parties, their constituencies, and other political formations in the country. 2.3 Recognising the role both parties can play in restoring peace and stability, they have agreed on the need to establish an inclusive security system as determined by the working group. The purpose of this will be to address all matters of security and stability. They further agree that similar structures could be established for agriculture and other relevant groupings. 2.4 They agree that the aspirations of many Afrikaners to govern themselves in their own territory should be addressed. Accordingly they agreed that a joint working group be established for this purpose, bearing in mind the call made by Dr Mandela, Dr Hartzenberg and General Viljoen for a solution which entrenches reconciliation, prevents conflict, and facilitates co-operation among all people. This working group should complete its task and report back to its principals by 20 January 1994. The working group should examine, among others, the following issues: - financial and economic viability of such a region and its monitory and fiscal relationship to the rest of the country; - civil rights of Afrikaners outside the volkstaat; - civil rights of non-Afrikaners inside the volkstaat; - the nature of the relationship between the volkstaat and other local, regional and central government/administrative structures; - the timetable and process of establishing such a volkstaat in the light of the existing transitional process; and - the method of determining support on a geographical basis for the idea of a volkstaat. Matters of mutual concern should be discussed and addressed in detail for the purpose of formulating recommendations and solutions. 2.5 The parties agreed, as part of this process, to send a joint delegation to Switzerland and Belgium to study how the political systems of these two countries work, and to determine whether aspects of these systems may be helpful in the resolution of the South African conflict. 2.6 The AVF, having accepted the ANC's good faith, has undertaken to actively discourage any action calculated to destabilise the transitional process. The culmination of this strategic agreement into a final settlement before the end of January 1994 will enable the AVF and its affiliates to consider participation in the transitional structures and process, as well as in the elections as scheduled to be held on 17 April 1994. 2.7 The ANC, having accepted the bona fides of the AVF, gives its commitment to promote agreements entered into with the AVF, including such constitutional and legislative agreements which may be required for their implementation. 2.8 Should any party to this agreement at any stage consider the whole or the specifics of the agreement to have been violated, an attempt at mutual conciliation will be made through the facilitators of the process before any unilateral action is taken. 2.9 It was decided that a meeting at leadership level will be convened as soon as possible with the view to: - ratification of this agreement; - deciding on the time frame for the above proposed actions, and on a way of achieving legitimacy; - mandating and monitoring the task of the proposed working committee; - public release of the strategic agreement; and - deciding on ways of marketing these agreements, and publicly confirming all undertakings. Chapter 4 Guidelines for the deliberations of the Volkstaat Council The following guidelines for the deliberations of the Volkstaat Council were discussed by the delegations: self-determination: The investigation of the different modes of self-determination and the concept of a volkstaat. This investigation will be reported to the constitutional assembly and the Commission on Provincial Government, including manners in which effect can be given to the different modes of self-determination. The accommodation of demands for self-determination on a provincial basis, through sub-regional structures within a province as now sanctioned by the amendments to Section 160(3) of the constitution, should also be explored. Proposals for self-determination of local communities through community councils or structures modelled along the lines of similar structures and processes in other parts of the world could be considered. Citizenship: Any form of derived citizenship intended for persons residing in a possible volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be compatible with internationally accepted norms. Advisory bodies: A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established. In the event of the realisation of a concept of the volkstaat, this body will represent the respective communities within the volksraad of such a volkstaat. Chapter 5 Unmandated defining statement on the principle of self-determination with reference to the central concept of self-determination used in the Memorandum of Agreements Constitutional Principle XXXIV and the accord. The delegations at this stage suffice with the following defining statement, although unmandated: 1. The concept shall in no way be construed as to give support to those fatal racist ideologies of the Twentieth Century that was based on chauvinistic excessive escalation of identities or even ethnocentrism which bred discrimination, racism and prejudices which on their part brought war, misery and death to many. Legitimate self-determination instead should be consonant with and indeed flows from the concept of fundamental rights and the constitutional state. 2. The concept of self-determination we therefore could endorse is the universally accepted one that has been expressed in the Charter of the United Nations which serves the purpose of peaceful co-operation between peoples on the basis of mutual respect and recognition of fundamental freedom and basic human rights for all. 3. The legitimate concept of self-determination to us relates to the expressed desire of a substantial community or a people, who has attained through the prolonged experience of a common history, language, culture and often also of land, a sense of cohesion and belonging that universally constitutes the sense of nationhood. The concept therefore relates to the need expressed by such a community or people to determine its own destiny and to excercise the right to decide policy and practise with regard to political, constitutional, economic, social, religious and educational matters in a way that is consistent with the peculiar expectations and value systems of such people. 4. We have assumed that the desire for the exercise of self-determination with such a people must be a popular demand beyond reasonable doubt, a fact which may require substantial proven support through an agreed democratic process. 5. Self-determination within a complex pluralistic society based on inclusive democracy has to be negotiated and implemented with due regard to the rights of other citizens sharing the same territory on a permanent basis. Wider democratic processes must also be recognised. A balance should be negotiated between the desire of such a people for self-determination and the ideal of peaceful wellbeing of the larger whole of society. Self-determination will serve the purpose of building the state and not cause the dislocation of the state. It should facilitate peace and not cause conflict. 6. At the same time self-determination for a people constituting a minority should be considered with due regard to and in full recognition of the legitimate expressed expectations of such a people so as to avoid a type of majority domination that may in itself cause conflict or even the disintegration of the state. 7. In our considerations we have recognised various modes of self-determination. It may involve the negotiation of a territorial entity which may have various degrees of autonomy. This may be augmented by constitutional devices securing various degrees of autonomy over the specific affairs of that community at one or more of the levels of government. We have agreed that the principle of self-determination could be negotiated and applied to suit the demands of each unique situation. 8. The introduction of any form of self-determination through negotiations will need to be accompanied by extensive public information and a raised level of trust.
