After this incident, the regime's officials immediately blamed one of the antiregime organizations for this explosion. Naturally, assassinations, murders, and the planting of bombs are considered by each and every free-thinking person and organization that respects human rights and the lives of human beings to be terrorist acts, irrespective of who perpetrates such terrorist acts and who the targets are. Therefore, the Democratic Party of Kordestan condemns this act and considers it to be extremely ugly and inappropriate. The question that arises in this connection is: Who perpetrated this terrorist act and what were its purposes and objectives? In order to answer this question there are some issues that can clarify the situation to a certain extent and to show why this inappropriate and antihuman act was perpetrated. First of all, if we try to track down the engineers and perpetrators of this terrorist act and to search for the person or direction whence such acts emanate -- and these are people who are very skillful in perpetrating such acts -- we should, first and foremost, point an accusatory finger at the clerical regime. This is because this regime is basically a terrorist and terrorist- nurturing regime and has perpetrated dozens and even hundreds of terrorist acts at home and abroad against its opponents, so much so that in the world today and in the eyes of the world the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran and of the clerical regime is tantamount to terror and terrorism; and it is such characteristics and such acts that have made the regime a topic of discussion by everyone. But there is a specific reason why this criminal act was perpetrated at the place it was and against the lives of defenseless people, and a partial examination of this reason will help us to solve the riddle. It is a definite and indubitable fact and not a secret to anyone that the antipopular clergymen are the enemies of all the Iranian people and that this regime has no qualms about massacring or killing anyone in this country. Moreover, the past has shown that in order to achieve its objectives, the clerical regime resorts to any incorrect act and to any antipopular plot and machination and that it does not spare any crime in order to achieve its ends. Thus, in the chaotic situation that the regime is facing at home, and since it cannot answer the people, it is a simple matter for it to engineer such plots, to perpetrate such incidents so that it can distract the public from major problems and focus the people's attention on other issues such as this, to further pave the way for more suppression and pressure at a time when the people's voice of protests and aversion has intensified, and to thus impose a more stifling condition on the people. Meanwhile, we see that in order to show that, contrary to what is said against it, the clerical regime--which is regarded as a terrorist regime by the public because of its continued terrorist acts and the violation of human rights and is condemned by humanitarian circles and forums and by human rights supporters at least twice a year--is itself the target of terror and terrorism and that if it sometimes adopts suppressive measures, its only objective is to fight terrorism and subversion. Thus, it further paves the way for the suppression and assassination of its opponents at home and abroad. The time and place of the bomb explosion shows how the regime perpetrated this plan through careful planning so that it could rouse the religious sentiments of simple-minded people. Thus, the Emam Reza Shrine was chosen--and that, in the month of Muharram and during the Tas'ua and 'Ashura ceremonies. Otherwise, if it was any other person or persons apart from the regime--that is, if the said person or persons believe in terrorism and in planting bombs--there are better places and better objectives that can inflict damage and blows on the regime and its officials and not on ordinary and defenseless people. We do not rule out the fact that after the explosion of this bomb by the regime's men and on orders of the regime's intelligence and terrorist networks, a new wave of suppression will be started by the regime and for this to be transformed into a pretext for the compilation and implementation of a new program of pressures on the people of our country in general and on members of opposition organizations in particular. For this purpose, each and every one of us should reveal such plots and vile machinations by the regime and further inform the public of the regime's plots and ploys as much as possible.
