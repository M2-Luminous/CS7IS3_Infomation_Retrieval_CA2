Defendants Adil Carcani and Manush Myftiu did not appear in the court because of their serious health problems and they were defended by their attorneys. Nine intellectuals, called the group of Ballsh, were arrested on September 21, 1982. On September 23 and 27 of the same year they were tried by Fehmi Abdiu (now a Socialist Party deputy) and they were sentenced with 69 years of imprisonment, 35 years in concentration camps, and 35 years of denial of the right to take part in elections. Five out of the nine intellectuals, Muhamet Xhaferri, Selfo Pasha, Vullnet Arabicka, Musa Begaj, and Spiro Sofroni were witnesses in the yesterday's session. The witnesses responded questions by the defence attorneys and explained the circumstances of their detention, sentencing and internment, underlining the negative role of Defendant Zylyftar Ramizi in the trial. The families of the witnesses had been sent to concentration camps upon a decision of the commission of concentration camps three days before the present witnesses were tried. Seven other witnesses, members of the formerly persecuted families under the motivation "persons of great danger for the society," witnessed as well. Other witnesses were Fatbardh and Riza Caniku, expelled for an unlimited term for having a bad biography; Sutkie Konica expelled because her mother was a Yugoslav national; Saryhan Merdani, interned together with her relatives for bad biography; Mimoza Sherifi, Perparim Skendo, and Pertef Gega, also sent to concentration camps for the same reason. The next session opens on June 8, at 1600.
