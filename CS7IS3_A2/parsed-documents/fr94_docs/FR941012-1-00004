Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the requirements of this proposed rule are directed toward applicants and participants in federally assisted housing programs. It effects no significant changes in the current relationships between the federal government, the states and their political subdivisions in connection with these programs. C. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. Under the proposed rule, applicants and participants, and adult members of their families, are required to sign and submit consent forms authorizing the verification or collection of certain information necessary for determining eligibility for or level of assistance under the covered programs. Consent forms to permit verification of information provided by the family are already required. This proposed rule would prohibit the collection of information which is not necessary to verify the income of an applicant or participant, and makes the consent form valid for 15 months. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule relates to applicants and participants in federally assisted housing projects but should not have a meaningful economic impact on these entities. E.
