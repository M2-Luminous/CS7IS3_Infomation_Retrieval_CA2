He says more or less the following. Privatization and combating inflation are all in vain. Nothing will come out of it. Why? Because we have excessive military expenditure. Because in the economic respect we are in a state of war. A country can afford such an amount on military expenditure only when it is in a state of war. Indeed, more than 40 trillion rubles. [passage omitted] The question arises: what does the government think? [Chubays] Let us look at the factual side of what you have just said. Indeed, the share of the military expenditure in the budget which has been approved is very high. The figure you have just mentioned is correct--more than 40 trillion rubles. With the budget's revenue of 120 trillion rubles, this is indeed a huge portion. Nevertheless, one should understand where it comes from. Where does our present army and our gigantic expenditure on it come from? In fact, we have inherited almost all of the former Soviet army of the Soviet Union that, as one knows, was in confrontation with nearly the whole world. [Correspondent] It seems we have inherited the Brezhnev stagnation. [Chubays] Exactly. It is the case when we have to finance the army we had in the past although today we simply do not need such a big army either from the political, economic, or financial viewpoint. But can one resolve this problem just like that, in one go? Can one half the expenditure on the army as soon as from tomorrow? What is the army? The army consists of human beings, soldiers and officers who are returning from Germany and the Baltic's. They are returning to Russia where they do not have either accommodation or work, or real income, or savings they can live on. [Correspondent] But under the present state of the economy, I mean the present military expenditure, they will never have highly-paid jobs or accommodation? [Chubays] Are you suggesting that we should tell them to leave the army, that we should say goodbye to them for the time being while we are improving the economy. Perhaps in two or three years we would succeed and then they could have a good life. No, this is not the way. Here, indeed, I agree with Belkin that the situation must be radically changed. It's the simple truth. But one cannot change the situation simply by reducing the expenditure, that's the point. The situation could be changed through a very profound reform in the army. We should reform the mechanism itself. Yegor Gaydar said very well at the recent congress of Russia's Choice that one cannot bring down the number of soldiers to the number of generals. The number of generals should be brought in accordance with the number of soldiers. This means that a profound army reform is needed which would essentially mean a reduction in the numerical strength and an improvement in the financing of those who are in the army. [Savchenko] But that is as far as the army is concerned. After all, our legendary military spending is the legacy, among other things, of our famous military industry, which in peace time was 70 percent of our whole industry. Now it constitutes perhaps 60 or 65 percent? [Chubays] You are wrong. It comprise just about 15 percent of all industry. Here are some concrete figures for you. In the first six months of 1994 spending on the purchase of military hardware for our military and industrial complex has been cut by 60 percent. Incidentally, we say today that 1994 is marked by decline. I can assure you that nearly 50 percent of this decline can be accounted for directly by the cuts in government spending on the purchase of equipment and military hardware. That is the most that one could have done in that respect. That this process cannot be continued on the same scale is another matter because a living enterprise, millions of people working there, and a whole range of social problems are at stake. This aspect of the problem can be resolved not just through paying less but through profound reform of the actual economic mechanism. Then a tank factory will not have to close down but will be able to change over to the production of things which people need. [Savchenko] Incidentally, has privatization helped this process? [Chubays] Undoubtedly. Here is a living example. Take for instance my native St. Petersburg and its LOMO enterprise, the Leningrad Lenin optico-mechanical association. This is a very famous company. Its output used to be solely military. It is now in a most difficult situation because of spending cuts in the military industry. Fourteen thousand people used to work there. Now just 11,000 are employed there. No doubt there will be further cuts. This very plant, having carried out privatization--not without its own battles incidentally--certain structures put up very tough resistance. Nevertheless, it was privatized with our support, and it became a joint stock company. It has begun the process we have just been talking about. It was not just a matter of becoming a joint stock company. The organization had to elaborate an in-depth plan for the restructuring of all production relations. It had to provide for a change in the nature of the output, and carry out a study of the existing market, a transition to the production of a new type of output, a restructuring of the internal production structure, a change in the structure of the administration of the enterprise, and finally staff cuts. So, what is now happening at the LOMO. Two figures can characterize it: the LOMO share price--that is the price written on the share certificate--is 500 rubles, yet the market price of the LOMO shares is now 75,000 rubles. Among the LOMO's share holders are the world's major companies with names known worldwide, such as Credit Suisse [word indistinct] Boston and others which can see that following the restructuring, the LOMO has an enormous potential in the next tens and even hundreds of years. That is thanks only to the fact that a little while back, the LOMO opted for privatization which opened up all these opportunities. [Savchenko] Anatoliy Borisovich, will we be able to hope that next year military spending will be reduced. [Chubays] I think that the volume of military spending will be cut next year, but the beginning of a real army reform--it cannot be postponed for years any longer--is a prerequisite for this. The reform must be started this year so that we could make our army cuts next year.
