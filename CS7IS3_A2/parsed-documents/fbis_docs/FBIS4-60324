Today, the combat operations of our forces were marked not only by firm and strong defense but by inflicting crushing blows against the hostile forces on all the battlefronts. Today, our forces inflicted killing blows against the invading forces in Abyan, where our fighter planes piloted by the courageous Air Eagles, defenders of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, successfully attacked the positions of the hostile forces and inflicted crushing blows against their supply lines.
