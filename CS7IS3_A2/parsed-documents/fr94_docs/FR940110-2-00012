FR940110-2-00012 FR940110-2-00010 Department's Position: Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act requires us to use BIA ``whenever a party or any other person refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation.'' In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide information requested (19 CFR 353.37(b)). MBL's contention that the Department should use the information obtained in the 1989&hyph;90 administrative review is contrary to Department policy. When a respondent refuses to cooperate with the Department, it is our policy to assign as a dumping margin to that respondent, as BIA, the higher of: (1) The highest rate found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation or previous administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review (Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France et al, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, 57 FR 28360, 28379 (June 24, 1992)). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the CAFC (see Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States , 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993), Krupp Stahl AG et al. v. United States , 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). Because MBL refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire, it was reasonable for the Department to assign to MBL, as BIA, a rate of 93.16 percent, the highest rate found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation. Furthermore, because the law does not provide for extensions of deadlines pending the outcome of court decisions in other proceedings, we have not delayed our final results. Final Results of the Review As a result of these administrative reviews, the Department determines that a dumping margin of 93.16 percent exists for MBL for the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) For subject merchandise exported by Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd., a cash deposit of 93.16 percent; (2) For subject merchandise exported by manufacturers not covered in these reviews but covered in previous reviews or in the original LTFV investigation, a cash deposit based on the most recently published rate in a final result or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in these or any previous reviews conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be 93.16 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation, as discussed below. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT) in Floral Trade Council v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. These administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: December 23, 1993. Barbara R. Stafford, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;516 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
