FR940203-2-00141 FR940203-2-00068 Selection Criteria_Comprehensive Statewide System Comment: In making choices among standards and assessments for occupational skills, one commenter suggested that States be required to consider whether the standards and assessments chosen reflect the needs of high-performance workplaces, whether they are benchmarked to the highest international standards, and whether they reflect requirements of clusters of occupations requiring similar skills, rather than individual jobs or occupations. The commenter suggested that among the needs of high performance work organizations are the acquisition of skills required to be an effective member of a work group, the capacity to learn new skills quickly, broad analytical and systems thinking skills, and specific skill sets that facilitate high mobility among a wide variety of related jobs and occupations within an industry and among different industries. Discussion: The Secretaries agree that State skill standards and methods of skill assessment must be benchmarked to high quality standards in order to ensure, to the extent possible, that students receiving portable skill certificates under the School-to-Work Opportunities program will have the opportunity to enter high-skill, high-wage, employment. Therefore, the clause ``benchmarked to high quality standards'' is added to the definition of the term ``Skill certificate.'' Similarly, a question has been added to the ``Comprehensive Statewide Systems'' selection criterion requiring States to indicate in their applications whether their processes for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces as well as meeting the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations. The Secretaries generally agree with the commenter that, in making their choices among standards and assessments for occupational skills, States should choose standards and assessments that build upon available standards and assessments; incorporate those skills that are necessary for employees to participate as active members of a work group and serve as team leaders; utilize high standards in an industry, occupation or profession; include measures of broad analytical and thinking skills; and reflect the requirements of clusters of occupations, requiring similar skills, rather than narrowly-defined individual jobs or occupations. Changes: In response to the commenter, the definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' has been revised to require that skills be benchmarked to high quality standards. In addition, the following question has been added to the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' criterion: ``Does the State's process for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces as well as meet the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations?'' Comment: One commenter suggested that the selection criterion ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' include a question asking applicants to describe how their School-to-Work Opportunities system is a part of school-wide restructuring that provides every student in each school with experimental learning programs_hands-on learning, students' demonstration of skills through projects, mentoring and coaching relationships, and increased student self-esteem and motivation that are linked with academic education. Discussion: School-to-Work Opportunities systems under the priority established in this notice must integrate work-based learning and school-based learning. School-to-Work Opportunities programs must incorporate a planned program of job training and experiences, paid work experience, workplace mentoring, and a program of study designed to meet the same challenging academic standards developed for all students. The criterion ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' is intended to encourage applicants to describe how their proposed School-to-Work Opportunities systems will produce systemic statewide change that will have a substantial beneficial impact on the preparation of youth for either a first job or further training or education.
