The world is moving toward peace; if Pakistan's intentions are really peaceful, it should not have rejected India's six proposals without any contemplation or reflection. Although no official response has been received from Pakistan, the way and the impetuousness with which Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan rejected the proposals -- telling the press they said nothing about the important and key issue of Kashmir -- shows that Pakistan's claim that it does not assist terrorists in India is a white lie. At least two of India's proposals are historic. First, India said that peace should be maintained at the Kashmir line of control. Without relinquishing their claims, both sides should -- as an interim measure -- accept it as the genuine line of control. India's second historic proposal was that neither country should be the first to use nuclear weapons. Pakistan argues that recognizing the line of control as the genuine line of control would be tantamount to accepting the status quo ante, which runs counter to Benazir Bhutto's pronouncement in a recent address to the nation that Kashmir will one day be a part of Pakistan. Obviously, if Pakistan does not accept this proposal, it means that it considers Kashmir to be its own. To realize this aim, Pakistan is assisting terrorists in Kashmir and sending in infiltrators and mercenaries. India should understand the implications of this and expose Pakistan at the international level. Pakistan objects to the proposal rejecting first use of the nuclear bomb because it wants to keep this option open in the context of Kashmir. Now, when you have reached an accord on not attacking each other's nuclear installations, why should this proposal rejecting the first use of nuclear weapons pose a predicament? Pakistan's intentions are definitely dubious, and it wants to intimidate India. It is with the aim of intimidating India that repeated disclosures have been made that Pakistan has already manufactured a nuclear device. Now why would India -- which carried out a nuclear explosion in Pokharan in 1974 -- be intimidated by such threats? The best scenario would be for good sense to prevail in Pakistan and for it to accept India's revolutionary proposals. Otherwise, the United States will become active again and harass both countries. It is said that India and Pakistan were on the verge of a nuclear war in 1990, which the United States averted through its able diplomacy. The United States will not repeat this action in the name of charity. This time it will want to exercise control over both countries. Pakistan is not stopping its mischief in Kashmir. Fresh evidence has come from what happened yesterday. Pakistan carried out a rocket attack on civilian areas in the Punch sector, injuring 27 people. Similar attacks have been carried out for three days in a row. A bomb was found near the line of control that exploded when touched, injuring many school children. The time has come for a limited response to the Pakistani attacks. On 1 February, Benazir Bhutto is going to make venomous statements at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva about so-called human rights violations in Kashmir. All of this means that Pakistan is engaged in a campaign to destroy India by all three means -- intentions, words, and deeds -- and does not want a dialogue. Therefore, we should be able to say: "So be it." *
