The Chinese Association for the Promotion of International Technological and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia is the first of its kind. "The focus of the world economy is moving from the West to the Asia-Pacific region, in which Northeast Asia boasts great potential for development," said Yang Shouzheng, president of the association. The detente after 40 years of "Cold War" provides the region with a stable climate for technological and economic cooperation. With their rich resources and a huge market, Northeast Asian countries have placed market economy as the priority in their economic development. The founding of the association is to meet the needs of the region by providing consultancy services and promoting exchange and co-operation. "Trade between China and Northeast Asia has been growing steadily over the past few years," said Pi Shenghao, deputy director with China International Trust and Investment Corporation Research International. Bilateral trade has been active. Trade between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) reached $8.9 billion last year and that with Russia amounted to $7.2 billion, a 24 percent increase over the previous year. Trade with Japan, China's biggest trade partner after Hong Kong, reached $39 billion last year, a 30 percent increase over 1992. Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia, and between ROK and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has also seen steady growth. Besides trade links, Pi said, the neighbouring countries are working together under a United Nations programme to develop the Tumen River Development Zone, which borders China, Russia, and the DPRK. The United Nations Development Programme will invest $30 billion in the massive project over the next 20 years. "The project will boost relations among Northeast Asian countries," said Pi. In the three northeastern provinces in China, Harbin has established itself as the conduit for commerce with Russia. Since 1990, an annual border trade fair has been organized in Harbin, attracting businessmen from nearby regions and other parts of the world. Tianjin and Dalian have also held such fairs. To expand international cooperation and investment, the new association will hold an international academic symposium and a trade fair with the theme, "Northeast Asia looking to the 21st Century," in April next year.
