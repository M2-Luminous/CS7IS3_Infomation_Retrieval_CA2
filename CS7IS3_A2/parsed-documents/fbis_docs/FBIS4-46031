Dzhokhar Dudayev has stated that the Russian special services are drawing up a plan to organize an underground nuclear explosion on the republic's territory. Speaking on Groznyy television, Dudayev claimed that the special services may well implement this plan since their previously prepared attempt to physically remove the Chechen president ended in failure. During his appearance on television Dudayev expressed the opinion that if this plan for a localized nuclear explosion in Chechnya is carried out then the Russian special services will blame the republic's leadership for it, basing their statements on previously disseminated disinformation that Chechnya supposedly has components for nuclear weapons. The Russian foreign intelligence service has already categorically denied Dudayev's claims. Incidentally, President Dudayev issued a decree today introducing a curfew throughout the territory of the republic from 2200 local time.
