FR940106-1-00064 FR940106-1-00011 EPA believes that the State should continue to work on developing scientifically-defensible long-term temperature criteria sufficient to protect cold-water habitat for salmon migrating through the estuary. Temperature has been consistently used nationwide as a basis for water quality criteria, and there is strong scientific evidence that temperature affects survival of salmon smolts as they move through the Delta (Kjelson, et al., 1989; USFWS 1992a, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7, USFWS 1992b and USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). However, EPA acknowledges that specific temperature criteria are difficult to establish and implement presently in the Delta because historic temperature levels have been highly variable and respond quickly to ambient air temperatures, and because there is insufficient information on the effectiveness and feasibility of various methods of lowering temperature. It is likely that there are short time periods (on the order of days to a few weeks) during which efforts at temperature control could be successful and provide increased smolt survival. However, existing models predicting changes in temperature in response to water project operations use a monthly temporal structure and only provide results as monthly means. Thus, these models cannot be used to analyze measures that could provide improved conditions over shorter periods of time. In addition, management of reservoir releases to provide benefits to salmon both in the Delta and in the upstream reaches has not been thoroughly assessed (Kelley, et al. 1991; Mann and Abbott 1992). Studies to develop improved reservoir and river temperature models with a shorter time-step and improved predictive capability for the entire Sacramento system are just beginning under the auspices of Trinity County, the University of California at Davis, and the California DFG. These studies will also include a direct analysis of the effect of temperature management alternatives on salmon populations. Additional work to develop effective temperature models has been mandated by section 3406(g) of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act. It should be possible to use information from these studies to set temperature criteria in the near future, and EPA will continue to work with the State to develop specific temperature criteria for the Delta. However, at this time, EPA is not proposing temperature criteria to replace those criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, and is instead proposing the salmon smolt survival criteria described below. c. Proposed Smolt Survival Criteria Because at this time EPA has not developed an adequate scientific basis for precise temperature criteria, EPA is proposing ``smolt survival criteria'' to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the Bay/Delta estuary. These criteria are based on a smolt survival index that quantifies and predicts the survival of salmon migrating through the Delta. The index can be used to determine whether the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat uses are impaired in the Bay/Delta. When applied in criteria, the index measures and can control the condition of the resource at risk by directly assessing and limiting the loss of salmon smolts within the Delta due to a variety of impaired water quality conditions. The use of this index is consistent with the integrated approach envisioned by the National Program Guidance for Biological Criteria for Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). (1) Smolt Survival Models. The smolt survival indices are based on USFWS models described in Kjelson et al. (1989), USFWS (1992a) (WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7) and USFWS (1992b). These models are summarized more fully in Appendix III. The models are empirical; that is, they are in large part based on the results of experiments measuring and comparing smolt survival under a number of different physical conditions of varying migration pathways, water temperatures, flow rates, and rates of exports from the Delta. The models underlying the salmon smolt survival criteria are complex; additional information about the methods used in constructing the Sacramento and San Joaquin indices is contained in Appendix III and the administrative record to the proposal. For the Sacramento River system, the proposed salmon smolt survival criteria are based on the most recent model (USFWS 1992b) for predicting migration success for the Sacramento River fall-run population, and rely on the relationship between smolt survival and three factors: temperature, diversion out of the mainstem Sacramento River, and export rates. The San Joaquin model is based on experimental data, and relies on the relationship between salmon smolt survival and river flows, diversion into Old River, and export rates. Consistent with the implementation recommendations of USFWS, NMFS, and California DFG, the San Joaquin model assumes that a barrier will be in place at the head of Old River during the peak migration season. Verifying the models used to generate the salmon smolt criteria is a continuing process using code-wire tagged smolt studies conducted by the USFWS (USFWS 1992b, 1993). Although these models represent the present state-of-the-art in Bay/Delta salmon fisheries management, EPA anticipates that the models will continue to be verified, updated and refined each year by USFWS to reflect additional data collection results, and believes that continuing verification is necessary to assure that outmigrating smolts are protected. In the event that USFWS modifies its models, recommended index values, or recommended implementation measures, EPA intends that the criteria will be amended accordingly in the next triennial review. (2) Proposed Criteria. In developing the goals or target index values for its proposal, EPA is relying primarily on the goal of restoring habitat conditions to those existing in the late 1960's and early 1970's, as recommended in the Interagency Statement of Principles. Strict adherence to this recommendation would suggest using the index values associated with that historical period as the target index values. These values are included in Table 2, which provides estimated index values for different historical periods. As part of their recent expert testimony to the State Board, USFWS estimated these historical survival indices under different conditions (USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). The Sacramento River historical values are based on an early version of the Sacramento River model (Kjelson et al. 1989). There would be minor changes in the estimates using the most up-to-date model (USFWS 1992b). For example, recalculating the Sacramento River value for the 1956&hyph;1970 historical period yields a mean of the five-year types of .37, compared to the .36 indicated in Table 2.
