Order No. 1852&hyph;94] ARCHITECTURAL AND TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS COMPLIANCE BOARD 36 CFR Part 1191 [Docket 93&hyph;3] RIN 3014&hyph;AA15 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of the Secretary 49 CFR Part 37 Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines; Detectable Warnings AGENCIES: Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, Department of Justice and Department of Transportation. ACTION: Joint final rule. SUMMARY: The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board is conducting research during fiscal year 1994 on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. Depending on the results of this research, the Access Board may conduct additional research during fiscal year 1995 to refine the scoping provisions and technical specifications for detectable warnings at these locations. Because of the issues that have been raised about the use of detectable warnings at curb ramps and curbless entranceways to retail stores and other places of public accommodation, the Access Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation are suspending temporarily until July 26, 1996 the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools in the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) so that the agencies can consider the results of the research and determine whether any changes in the requirements are warranted. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Access Board: James J. Raggio, General Counsel, Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1331 F Street NW., suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004&hyph;1111.
