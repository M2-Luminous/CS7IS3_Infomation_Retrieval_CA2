Three statements were adopted at the session. The statement regarding terrorist acts against People's Movement of Ukraine activists names numerous events, which have occurred in many oblasts of Ukraine, in particular the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of the Rukh secretariat, without a trace on the night of 15 January, and the reflection is expressed that "certain circles in the state are endeavoring to demoralize the democratic forces on the eve of elections and frighten their adherents by means of terror." The central leadership of Rukh evaluates the tripartite statement on eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine as "capitulation by Ukrainian state officials to gross external pressure," which became possible as a result of the lack of a clear and consistent foreign policy by the government. The leadership of Rukh believes that Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, took a capitulatory step. Evaluating the results of the presidential elections in the Crimea, the central leadership of Rukh stated that the president's policy, aimed at pacifying the separatist forces, failed totally. The leadership of Rukh believes that a further delay of resolute actions by the president and Supreme Council of Ukraine regarding the stirring up of separatism in the Crimea could lead to armed conflict and irremediable consequences for the citizens of Ukraine and peace in Europe.
