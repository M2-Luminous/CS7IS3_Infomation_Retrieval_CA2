In 1993 the center launched a series of debates on these topics and held one of the summer courses offered by the University of the Black Sea, a course entitled "Crisis Management During the Transition Process." Recently the center compiled and presented to public opinion the basic list of the significant problems for Romanian society which have remained unresolved during the period of 1990-93. Called residual problems, they constitute the object of a research program initiated by CSPAC and carried out by a multidisciplinary team made up of Dorel Sandor, Varujan Vosganian, Ulm Spineanu, Ilie Serbanescu, Lucian Mihai, Victor Ciorbea, Gabriel Ivan, Andrei Musetescu, Costea Munteanu, Mariana Celac, Denisa Ionete, and Horia Murgu. The study's objective consisted in the systematic analysis of the SYNDROME OF PROCRASTINATION. This term means above all the ignoring of real needs, delays, half-measures, and failures through which COUNTER-REFORM acts as a parasite on the national effort to transform our society. The accumulation of these problems constitutes a dominant characteristic of the transition period in Romania. Last week at GDS [Group for Social Dialogue] headquarters, a discussion took place with representatives of the CSPAC. We have selected several excerpts from that discussion. Among the participants we will mention: Magda Carneci, Mariana Celac, Andrei Cornea, Gabriel Andreescu, Mircea Diaconu, Ioan Popa, Victor Babiuc, and representatives of CSPAC--Dorel Sandor, Varujan Vosganian, Ilie Serbanescu, Ulm Spineanu, and Costea Munteanu. We have also included in these pages part of the list of residual problems which CSPAC inventoried. We should mention that the entire text appeared in this year's 5 October issue of ROMANIA LIBERA and in this year's 8 October issue of TINERETUL LIBER. [See box at end of article.] * * * An Analysis Which Describes the Current Stage of the Reform Process [Dorel Sandor] Our project starts from the common-sense observation that everyone wants reform in Romania, but, at the same time, anyone can see that obstructions have accumulated over the last four years; these obstructions are a result of problems which have been either ignored for a long time, or which, over the process of being resolved, have acquired a handicap in relation to the demands of reality. Recently, we compiled this list of problems, a list which remains open-ended. We started from the following hypotheses: 1) The problems are ones of public interest; 2) They are tied to the process of transition imposing conditions on the advance of Romanian society toward a democratic society; 3) They are found in the sphere of action of state institutions (the governing party and the political coalition which supports it, and the legislative and executive branches with the group of "technocrats of transition") which have prerogatives and competencies, and therefore resources, and which should take on the task of achieving institutionalized reform. The performance of the government is a problem for political analysis everywhere, but for Romania, unfortunately, it is easily marked by subjective, personalized, and somewhat caricatured approaches. One of the objectives of this project is to remove this analysis of government performance from under the sphere of influence of petty passions, from under the incidence of approaches characterized by petty ambition, and from under the perspective of a deadline arising out of the circumstances of the moment. After four years, the quantitative dimension of these problems (the list contains 103 points, but it remains open-ended) has already reached a critical threshold, which necessitates a special approach. Many of these problems together form structures of procrastination, structures of bundles of residual problems which already tend to dominate the complex process of transition. Procrastination, the accumulation of or the blocking of the resolution of problems of this kind, has appeared during the past year, after the September 1992 elections, to be an obvious characteristic of the government. Therefore, our analysis assumes these three characteristics: the quantitative dimension, the structural dimension, and the characteristic of the transitional processes at the level of the macroeconomic and macropolitical decisionmaking process. Another reason/motive which we considered made this analysis necessary is the fact that, in our estimation, the coming year, 1994, will be a year when we reach a crossroads: The residual problems can engender a crisis of procrastination capable of provoking instability and social convulsions (I believe that the latter alternative has no more than a 15-percent chance of coming about, but that percentage is already a troublesome one). Or, on the contrary, these problems can become a kind of normality of Romanian reality; they can impose a long-term--10-15 years--pace on the course of transition in Romania by becoming a political practice which could legitimize institutions and a political style of this type. Because of this, Romanian society will become marginalized in the overall regional competition of transition. We do not wish to call for the government's resignation; our objective is to track down what the resources are which Romania is wasting by maintaining these problems in a residual state. And then we need to find out who is paying the price of these examples of procrastination, and whether the current mechanisms of the state structure and of the opposition's alternative structures are in a position to tackle the problems in a pragmatic and positive way, and what the alternative solutions would actually be. I would like to say a little bit about the list of problems itself, which, I repeat, remains open-ended: It contains several layers, several fields of facts. A first layer refers to the (relative) tearing away from the system of real socialism with a centralized economy, a tearing away which came about in our country through convulsive events. Even the confusion, the fact that very important areas connected to December 1989 are still enigmatic, shows the way in which Romania entered into the process of transition. A second layer of problems refers to the way in which what is called postrevolutionary institutional construction took place: the state institutions, the machinery of decisionmaking, the machinery which creates the institutional balances in Romania. After that, we are interested in several fields connected with local government and urban planning, and then the situation of the communities and of the human factor in the various aspects of the process of transition--from tensions between ethnic groups to tensions between religious groups, and up to the reactions of the citizens to the new challenges of transition. An important area refers to social protection, not just as a protection vis-a-vis economic problems proper, but even more as the balance between change and the costs of change experienced by the populace. It seemed to us that the problems which are appearing in the fields of health and education, in the cultural milieu, and in the field of training are symptomatic. We are also very much interested in the structural rift in the framework of the Romanian economy, where privatization and decentralization represent two major and mutually very intertwined processes. It is in the area of economic reform that the most important rifts have been engendered, but also that the most significant obstacles have appeared. Also, in closing, we proposed to link together several of the topics of international interest with a direct impact domestically, topics connected with foreign aid; with relations with international economic institutions (the IMF, and so forth); and relations with Bessarabia, with Russia, and with Eastern Europe--all of these things with a view to an opening toward the international economic environment. A (Desired?) Tool in the Hands of the Political Element [Ilie Serbanescu] The finalization of this synthesis holds a completely special importance, because it brings to our attention, in a concentrated form, everything that has been started--as far as reform is concerned--and not finished. Out of these 103 points, 80 percent represent, in fact, things which have not even been started. If we take an inventory of these problems, we see that, out of everything that should have been done, some things never were in the plans of anyone with the power to make decisions; they are at most in the mind of those people with common sense. The team that drew up this synthesis did nothing more than give an expression to common sense. In fact, it is not an analysis, it is a finding, an instrument which is available to the political element. I do not know if it also suits the political element. But if the political element (particularly the parliament and the executive) would happen to set to work, that element would have something to do. [Andrei Cornea] I would like to know if these points of procrastination can be reduced to a sufficiently small number of fundamental points from which the others would follow, especially since I believe that the procrastination is self-reproducing. Therefore, the first question would be to what extent these problems can be condensed and how a certain system can be devised which would say something about our society. In the second place, it would be interesting to know what the explanation for the procrastination would be. Are we witnessing a lack of political will--that is to say, an incapacity to remove the points of procrastination--or are we in fact witnessing a political will pulling in the opposite direction--that is, a will to procrastinate? This question should be posed, even if it is not always a matter of either/or but can sometimes be both. Finally, there would also be the matter of the consequences: To what extent can interventions from certain points be productive and create once again snowballing effects in other fields? [Dorel Sandor] Costea Munteanu will answer your first question. Regarding the causes of the procrastination, we have established 15 levels of analysis. Among these I would call to mind the institutional obstacles, the critical points, and the stage which each problem is in, the interest groups favored by the procrastination, the costs, the resources wasted due to the procrastination, and a whole series of errors or failures which have obstructed or favored a certain hijacking of the process of change. We can also make it obvious exactly what is the mechanism or the institution which is being aimed at or is the most active in obstructing some matters, elements of management, of resources. As for the consequences, I think that the following is one of the chief reasons why we did the analysis: to see whether the costs of reform in Romania have not somehow exceeded the benefits of reform, and whether these costs could not--as in other Eastern European countries--reorient the overall national interest toward transition, to influence it, or to lead it in a totally unexpected direction. [Ulm Spineanu] In putting this study together, we did not propose to analyze any particular program of governance. We started from the effects and in that way saw that some problems had not been tackled at all. On the other hand, these problems tend at a certain point--through circumstances which are very hard to appraise in the way they work together in the social spectrum--to have both institutional influence and influence in the legislative process, given the reform process itself as lived from day to day. As they are posed there, these problems represent clear points which can create elements of a great range in the fields with which they can be correlated. The option of boiling these problems down in some way to a few essential ones--which would mean that we would, however, lose precisely the image and definition of each consequence of the various problems--would mean that we would make the mistake which everyone who has put forward ideas of governance has made: They have proposed programs as such, programs which do not factor in these consequences, which, as we can see, are now becoming factors stifling people's enthusiasm for reform. On the other hand, if up to around six months ago people were working with half-measures, now we are in a system of quarter-measures. We can observe completely undefined measures everywhere, including in political discourse, not to mention in economic or social discourse. Everything that is being done appears as if it were seen through a smoke screen: Behind the smoke screen are those who are proffering the measures, while in front of it are those who are at the receiving end of those measures, but who cannot understand them or explain them. And through this smoke screen the germs of social instabilities are already starting to appear. It is even within the realm of possibility that we will get to the point where certain claims are forcefully imposed, if we take account of the government desire to preserve itself. Transition in Romania Up To Now--a Failed Process [Costea Munteanu] In the economic area, we have identified a total of 39 residual problems--put another way, of unresolved aspects in the process of transition. In the final analysis, they can be considered as forms of manifestation of two fundamental structural distortions of the Romanian economy: the first is the imbalance between consumption and resources (the synthetic form of expressing the latter is the fact that imports for the daily consumption by the economy and by the population surpass the resources which can be procured through exports), and the second distortion is the vicious circle between domestic inflation and foreign depreciation. These two fundamental structural distortions are, in origin, of different kinds: the imbalance between consumption and resources is an inherited structural distortion; the deficiency of the post-Decembrist policy of reform is that it has not even attacked this problem. On the other hand, the vicious circle between domestic inflation and foreign depreciation is a product exclusively of policy after December, a policy of half-measures which is called pathological gradualism. As we know, there are two ways of approaching reform: shock therapy, in which the authorities take the measures completely and implement them all at once in order to carry out reform, or gradualism--in other words, they divide the implementation of the particular measure into successive phases. Pathological gradualism is the one which loses the needed sequence along the way and ends up where it started from. In the case of the applying of normal gradualism, adverse reactions appear in the environment in which it is operating, until complementary measures are applied. When these adverse reactions appear, instead of considering them a signal that the transformations should be speeded up, our own governmental teams have done the very opposite: They have accentuated administrative intervention. Practically, in the final analysis, this has in fact meant that there is an orientation which is counter to reform, because the result has been something other than the one they had counted on. The field of price liberalization, and especially of the mechanisms of formation, is illustrative in this regard. I am trying to answer Mr. Cornea regarding the causes of these instances of procrastination--whether they are in the sphere of the lack of political will, or whether they spring from incompetence. My feeling (from the experience which I had when I spent a short period of time in the government) is that we are dealing with a combination of the two. For example, in the area of prices one can consider that there were also premeditated elements which had the effect of ensuring that not even up to the present time, after the four successive phases of liberalization, has the mechanism of formation been completely liberalized. In this case we are dealing with premeditation but also with incompetence. And when I refer to incompetence, I refer also to the lack of courage to apply a measure which introduces effects of shock into the economic and social system. If the people in our government have sinned in any way, it is through fear that they have sinned; and if they can be characterized in any way, again it is by their fear. The reformist type of person must, in my opinion, be the decisive type. But here the dilemma appears between maintaining your position high official and not making allowances for this personal career objective, regardless of what happens with your position. Due to this pathological gradualism, the transition in Romania up to now is a failed process; it has involved high social and economic costs, while the results do not justify these costs. From the Government's Standpoint, the Reform Process Is a Success [Valeria Pascariu] We see a list of problems which we consider failures of the present government. But what categories of interests does the government express? Because the essence of a government always lies in the protection of a category of interests. It seems to me that this category of interests protected by the present government is the category of interests of part of the state industry--that is, the industry which formerly represented the ideological obsession of the communist regimes: the petrochemical industry, the iron and steel industry, and so forth. Faced with the choice between unemployment and inflation, the populace has chosen the alternative of inflation and has rejected that of unemployment; through this choice, it has given its stamp of approval to this variant. If we look at things from the viewpoint of the government (which deliberately planned not to carry out reform and planned to protect the interests of this industry), we see that the government is, in fact, a success. All the other things are concessions or secondary problems; privatization is clearly a secondary objective. When the government reaches the point where it may run into a crisis in ensuring foreign financial resources for this industry, due to its failure to sign the stand-by accord with the IMF, then it will begin to make concessions on the plane of reform. [Dorel Sandor] There are five reasons why we chose a problem here: The first reason is so that some of these problems might be tackled in a program of governance or in a political position of a programmatic nature (we did not refer solely to the Vacaroiu government, but to all of the governments which have entered into the process of transition during the past three years). The second reason is represented by certain political relations with alternative political structures (because however much it might be based on a program, governance is carried on in a political context of balance). The third reason consists of the social reactions, the expectations of the populace, and the characteristic feature at the level of current interests on the local level, on the macro level, and on the intermediate level. A fourth reason is represented by structural challenges, such as inflation, prices, unemployment, resources, and the relations between consumption and production. The fifth reason is represented by the exigencies of the foreign factor, on which depend foreign financing, regional equilibrium, national security in relation to spheres of influence, and so forth. The fact that these problems are seen as secondary by the present government is of less importance to us; they are important to the public interest, for Romania now and in the years to come. [Varujan Vosganian] To return to Mr. A. Cornea's first question: There really is a nucleus, but we cannot bring it into the debate to the public at large, because that nucleus cannot be perceived merely by means of the common sense that Ilie Serbanescu was talking about. So, there is also a deeper level of theoretical approach which does not appear in our analysis. Here, however, we can see the first intermediate level--that is to say, the centers of obstruction, the centers of disruption, which owe their existence to procrastination. We are trying to create an economic theory of transition, to discover concepts, to apply the concepts, and to create some general laws of transition. We have found pathological gradualism, we have found the allocation of resources to the necessities of transition, we have found the vicious circles of transition, and so forth. [Dorel Sandor] Certainly, if we will acquire knowledge about these deep matters, it is not absolutely necessary that political options be modified as such. But here I would connect two planes: the evolution of political will during transition and the evolution of deep, systematic knowledge about transition. These are two planes which do not meet for the time being, and this is also the difficulty which I see as obvious in sending a particular message. I believe that one of the linchpins of political demagogy is truly the lack of political knowledge; nevertheless, I think that the chief moral support of the lack of political will is not necessarily the lack of knowledge, but rather a certain set of very active and very explicit interests. The Government's Political Will Is To Maintain a Certain Kind of Electorate [Varujan Vosganian] State industry did not appear for state industry, but rather for the electoral support of those who work in state industry. What the present government wants (as did the previous governments) is to maintain a certain kind of electorate, the one tied to state industry, to state agriculture, and a part of the pensioners who are imbued with all sorts of nationalism, with "the young people of today," and so forth. This is an electorate which does not hold property, which cannot oppose the state and the arbitrariness of the state--in other words, a permeable electorate. It is precisely in this that the political will and the subversive and intentionally deceptive character of the government's actions consist. [Valeria Pascariu] In what we theoretical economists are doing, let us not forget that reality is one step ahead of us; therefore, we should not fall into the sin of arrogance and imagine that the managing directors of private enterprises, or even of state enterprises, are people who, if we do not write down for them how to do marketing, do not know how to do it. [Ioan Popa] The problem is that, in the reform strategy, many times people have made their choice of priorities because of the immediate circumstances, under the pressure of events; for this reason, certain instances of a lack of correlation have appeared in the creation and the putting into operation of the institutions and the mechanisms of the market economy. And I will give you an example from the field of finance and banking: A reform was carried out--I would say a radical one--as regards the banking system, without there being undertaken at the same time measures in the field of the capital market. This happened not because such measures would not have been provided for in the reform programs, but rather simply because they were delayed endlessly under the pressure of other measures. If the law of privatization would have been respected, we would have had a stock exchange by now, and we would have been present in Business Central Europe with quotes from the Bucharest Stock Exchange; but we have no such thing. And that is not even on your list. The securities exchange is the central institution of the capital market, just as the National Bank, the Bank, are the central institutions of the credit market, of the banking market. If people are not concerned with developing the capital market, then, inevitably, the entire financial and banking system will rely on the banks. The banks are thus put in a monopoly position. At least two reasons show how urgent it is to create a securities exchange: first off, the one that refers to the well-known problem of privatization, which is intimately tied to the existence of a capital market. And then, a securities market has here also the extraordinary ability to lend credibility to the reform measures. What Laws the Government Is Sending Parliament [Victor Babiuc] I would like us to return to the causes of procrastination. It is certain that the idea of reform was not well received in all of the circles of power in Romania, neither in 1990, nor in 1991, nor in 1992, nor in 1993. But the obstacle was not localized in one place; one met with the obstacle in various places, because both in Romania and in other countries, there are several centers of power. And given that, up to September 1991, laws of a reformist nature (I will not comment on whether they were irreproachable or not) were sent over from the government to the Parliament, from September 1991 on these laws have been fewer and fewer in number. On the other hand, even up to September 1991, laws forwarded by the government were not entered into the parliamentary agenda, and this was not because of the government. I will illustrate this with my personal situation: During the spring of 1991, I prepared all of the laws at the Ministry of Justice for the reform of Justice, and for the judges, and for the prosecutors, and for the notaries, and for jurisconsults, and for the carrying out of sentences and for other things; only the lawyers opposed my dealing with them. But out of all these laws, how many got onto the parliamentary agenda? One single law. And when? The moment the meeting of the ministers of justice of Europe and North America was being announced. Mr. Dan Martian realized, on my insistence, that it just would not do for me to go without any kind of bill having been put on the parliamentary agenda. And this bill concerning the reorganization of Justice passed through the Chamber of Deputies. If we look at what has happened from then on, things are partially different: In the first place, the present government has sent Parliament the old laws, but those have also sometimes been changed for the worse. If we look at the period from November of last year through today, we see that very few important laws have made it onto the agenda. The state budget has gotten onto the agenda--it would not have been possible for it not to--and so did the laws about the reorganization of Justice, which had a certain deadline and which enjoyed a certain importance. The rest have been trivial matters. Decentralization Without Denationalization and Vice Versa [Varujan Vosganian] Mrs. Pascariu brought up the problem of large industry, in favor of which there is an extraordinarily powerful lobby, whether at the governmental level, or at the level of parliamentary committees, or at the level of the politicians. Two things which come from socialism are being exploited, things which Romanian citizens are used to: the repeated nature and preservation of income, on the one hand, and the preservation of jobs, on the other hand. There are two distinct processes: One is decentralization, and the other is denationalization. We have done something very strange in Romania: We have carried out decentralization without denationalization, and we have carried out denationalization without decentralization. One time we carried out decentralization unaccompanied by privatization, and we carried out a privatization unaccompanied by decentralization. [Calin Anastasiu] As Ilie Serbanescu was also saying, your list is at the common-sense level. It is probably somewhat above the level of common sense--it is a simple diagnosis, a census of problems. The question for you, for the group which has worked in this area, is: What do you have in mind as a follow-up to this? There should be a second step, an analytical step, which seems to me to be essential. [Dorel Sandor] Our design is the following: In the first place, we have avoided mixing up the diagnosis with the solutions, because I have observed, after three years of activity in the structures of the executive branch, that there are many times when pseudo-solutions or modest solutions have inhibited a thorough analysis of the problems. So we wanted to establish a pertinent diagnosis which would be as objective as possible; we will probably wrap up this stage by the end of the year. At the same time, we believe that the problem of solutions is not merely of a technocratic nature. We want to throw into the political market several programs of political proposals which are now being redone, are being rearranged, in the structure of Authority as well as elsewhere. As regards solutions, I believe that we could put together a collection of alternative solutions from three sources--first of all, at the local level. There is also an experience of tradition in East Europe with which we are already familiar to a great extent and which we could orient toward these problems; there is this permanently failed transfer of international experience--or diminished [as published]; and there is finally the great problem of the domestic political will to take on certain solutions. One lesson of the technocrats of the past four years is that you can give very good advice to people who make decisions of a political nature, but it is not taken into consideration even the slightest bit. However, I do not believe and I will not fall into the trap of thinking that we must rush to hand out solutions in the sense of botching things up, because the great danger after a long period of waiting is for you to rush in to provide other unworkable solutions. Why We Have Not Held a Dialogue Until Now [Mircea Diaconu] I am glad to hear that over there, high up, someone is really doing some thinking. However, I want to ask: When you were in the government and we were out shouting in the streets, why did you not tell us, too, that you were thinking so well? I did some little experiments at my own expense: I went to the first bank that I came across and I asked for 200,000, not more, and this was when another government was in power, not this one. As I was saying, I asked for 200,000 and that was enough for me; I could not pay the first installment, because my first installment was greater than the amount of the whole loan. And then, to keep using the example of this same loan, I and my brother had put down as collateral everything we had in the house, everything we had accumulated over a lifetime. Shaken, I gave up, and I ceased any attempt to privatize myself or to do something myself. We talk about the attempt to privatize yourself and, it is true, no one stops you. You are allowed to do this. You can do it in a field, at the entrance to the subway, wherever you want-- just so long as it is not in the great industrial strongholds. You cannot talk about privatization while thinking about some poor little kiosks. I am not thinking at all of selling off the "23 August" complex. It can stay there as a stronghold, for the kids to visit later on, as they would a Doftana. But the individual, the one who can start a business at a very small level, needs to be given an incentive, while the peasant has to have a scrap of paper which will make him feel that he is a landowner. And this is precisely what has not been done. And it is not only this government that has failed to do it; no one at all has done it. And now I will come back with my question: Dorel Sandor, you were there in the government, you were important, you were powerful. What did you do there? [Dorel Sandor] I would like to give three answers which will not agree with you very much. The first answer is that, in truth, I did work for two and a half years in the Victory Palace, as did, moreover, several other people here, and I want to say that our job there was to do these kinds of analyses of government. They were not disseminated because there is nowhere in the world where such analyses are made public. However, the second reason that we did not carry on a dialogue such as we are now is the fact that we came into this building for the first time on 29-30 September 1991, invited by the GDS. Up until then, we were on your blacklist. Even though we remained friends all along, institutionally speaking we had no reason to be here until the Roman government fell. And at this point I want to touch on a certain sore spot of post-Decembrist Romania: The lack of professional solidarity among intellectuals after December is one of Romania's great tragedies; it is the fault neither of those of us who worked in the government, nor of those who did not work in the government, or who got there only recently. The third answer is that, in truth, one of the great errors of the reform process in Romania is that it was done from the top down. Only now at the ground level have there appeared the true states of ferment of spontaneous reform, in which I believe very strongly. [Andrei Cornea] I want to return to the subject of the position of the government towards the truth. I believe that the Authorities simply do not want to know the truth. It may well be that these technocrats never had political freedom of choice, as people say, but it is assumed that they know some things very well, that they understand them and can make a quasi-correct expert appraisal. Up until now, people have also said--and this is very well known--that many technocrats, experts, have made plans, have designed things, have made expert appraisals, but they have been disregarded, or they have been given very little weight. This is already a symptom which could be included in your list. It shows that the Authorities need a facade of expertise in certain fields, but that they do not intend to heed that expertise, and that finally this process ends with the gradual expulsion of these undesirables. The Experience of a Team Made Up of People Who Have Been in the Government and People Who Have Been in the Opposition [Dorel Sandor] I would like to say one thing in order to prevent any confusion at this moment. We do not want to produce a bundle of stresses so that we will be called in after that to the Victory Palace and set to work, especially since many of us have been through that experience and have cured ourselves. Perhaps this makes the group "A future for Romania." And I want to draw a clear distinction between a political and ideological approach which tempts the Authorities with certain options, and a cool, systematic approach, from the perspective of the public interest. What is very much missing in Romania now is not whether or not the Authorities want to carry out reform; Romanian society needs to tackle its problems in a relevant way, as if it were something normal. And Romanians are not to blame for not knowing still what is meant by the market economy. However, we, as experts, should very seriously pose ourselves this problem: that we should be able to offer Romanian society the common-sense facts in order for it to understand the real problems. We have made this list so that Romanian society will realize that these are its problems; this is our main objective, without any particular political orientation. [Gabriel Andreescu] I would like to tell Mr. Sandor why our dialogue came later. In 1990, the newspaper AZI, which was under the leadership of the Front, was publishing attacks directed at the GDS and its members, in a kind of language that made it difficult to imagine any dialogue. Now I would like to ask: In your analysis, what is the part with the description of phenomena, and what is the part setting out standards? A second point: From the concrete experience which you have had during the time of this analysis, please assess the margin between what is desired and what is happening by virtue of an internal dynamic. [Dorel Sandor] I tried earlier to explain the five benchmarks which we take into consideration. What you say about their dynamic is interesting; in one of the preliminary propositions of this structure of scoring which we introduce into the database are earlier critical moments, a kind of case history of each problem. For example, this problem of the leu/dollar exchange rate, of the liberalization of the exchange rate, is a typical case in which we tried several times, we paid the price, we created the mechanism, up to a point. But after that we compromised that mechanism and we went, if not from zero, then perhaps even from before zero, through the damage we created. Also, I agree, and it is a matter which concerns us, too: to what extent a problem is procrastinated on into a network of interests, of influences, of machinery of decision-making, and to what extent we are not talking about merely the quality of an individual, of his personal tendencies, but rather we are talking about a domestic political environment which has taken on shape and substance over four years in Romania. We have to take that environment into account, just as we should also take into account the determining influences of the industrial environment over the political environment, the commercial environment, and the environment which is tied to information and to culture. However, I want you to observe that in this team, there are some people who have worked for four years in the structures of the executive branch, and there are others who have worked and continue to work in the structures of the opposition--true, all of them as technocrats. Thus, this team contains within it people who have experienced the problems from both directions, and this is, in my opinion, a precious thing. [Mariana Celac] I would like to stick to the inertial part of the processes we are dealing with and the part exposed to the decisionmaking process, or political will, which is somewhat blurred in this first offering of the study. At least at the semantic level, the feeling is that all forms in which procrastination is manifested are exposed to a corrective decisionmaking which could eliminate this procrastination. I believe that here we are confronting an illusion in which both the Authorities and the journalism which writes "Authorities" with a capital "P" participate in equal measure. In truth, the force of decisionmaking and of the will on which it is based works very efficiently when you are close to moments of disturbance with an extremely wide range, when you are close to catastrophes. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are approaching a moment when the inertia of long-term and very long-term processes is becoming extremely important. I believe that whoever will be confronted in the future with the exercise of decisionmaking will have to deal with a phenomenon which is more and more dramatic--that is, that you may shoot at one target, but you may hit a completely different one. At that point you have to shoot in another direction, but you need to know where to aim. The secret "arrogance" of this enterprise is that of decanting acts of solidarity, of differentiating between that which is long-term inertia, of perceiving what is becoming regional in our economic reality, and of defining, finally, what could be the area of decisionmaking, with all of those ricochets which a clearheaded Authority will need to handle so that, when it takes aim, it will hit the intended target. [Traian Andronic (vice president, National Union Bloc)] I would like to refer to the moral aspect which you dispatched into an area having to do with corruption, with cover-ups, and so forth. I think that you should have taken this moral aspect somewhat more into account. You have two points there: One refers to the reform of Justice, and the other to labor legislation. To be concrete, one of the points refers to the existence of ambiguities in the resolution of labor conflicts through the law. Thus, this group of laws with a social character suffers from the very start from certain ambiguities which, practically speaking, make it impossible for the unions, for instance, to exercise the right to contest, to negotiate, and to strike. How do morals function in this whole story, morals which have but one purpose--to ensure an ethical comfort which would lead to hope? Such an approach would relieve you, too, of the burden of a presumed inkling of populism in the statement which you made to the effect that reform has to start from the ground up (thus, with a moral earthquake) and not from above, the way it has happened.
