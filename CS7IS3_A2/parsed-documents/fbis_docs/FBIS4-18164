The surplus is expected to grow from today's 1 million tonnes a year to 1.5 million tonnes. When we join the EU, farmers will again be able to cultivate areas of land that are currently undergoing so-called conversion. These are fields for which farmers have received compensation from the state to remove from production. But once inside the EU these fields could again be used for grain production under EU rules. The surplus could be sold to other countries using the EU's export subsides. However, the EU will also demand that a certain percentage of farm land be allowed to lie fallow. Nevertheless the net increase in land used for growing grain could be 130,000 hectares, with the increased harvest around 500,000 tonnes. This emerged at a farmers' day hosted by Agriculture Minister Karl Erik Olsson in Katrineholm yesterday. Olsson's message to the farmers present was twofold: On the one hand the Swedish conversion system was useful and would continue to be needed in the future. It was a good thing that fields have been taken out of food production. On the other hand farmers should be actively involved and compete within the EU -- that is, increase their production once again. The agriculture minister also expressed the hope that the increased grain harvest can be used to feed even more hogs and chickens. Here too production could be increased. The agriculture minister is very satisfied with the results of the negotiations in Brussels. However, the Skane farmers complained that they did not get the increased sugar quota they had wanted. "But once they have received payment for their beets they will be happy," Olsson said, as the price of sugar will rise dramatically when we join the EU. "I am sufficiently satisfied with the negotiations to recommend membership in the EU," the agriculture minister said. "And there are 10 million farmers in the EU. There is therefore no need to fear any shortsighted or abrupt changes in the EU's agricultural policy." Olsson praised the results of the negotiations and said that they are economically advantageous for Swedish agriculture: We have not sought membership in the EU to become poor, but to do well economically. He also defended the favorable economic package against the Social Democratic criticism of the past few days. "It is unfair, as Goran Persson has proposed, to target punitive measures on Swedish agriculture. The results of the negotiations are not that good. It is only fair that Swedish farmers should be allowed to produce on the same terms as the EU's farmers," Olsson said. [passage omitted]
