In order to seek such an exemption, the refiner shall submit a petition to EPA, such petition to include: (A) A description of the refiner's computer-controlled in-line blending operation, including a description of: (1) The location of the operation; (2) The length of time the refiner has used the operation; (3) The volumes of gasoline produced using the operation since the refiner began the operation or during the previous three years, whichever is shorter, by grade;
