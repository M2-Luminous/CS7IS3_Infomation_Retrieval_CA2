What can you achieve there in political terms? [Yavlinskiy] We have no election law, no civil code, no economic law, and no penal code. We have to create all this. This has the utmost priority. And as long as this is the case, work is very difficult. Sometimes this looks a bit wild and exotic to the West. [Poerzgen] In what respect is the new parliament different from the old Supreme Soviet? [Yavlinskiy] It has greater legitimacy. However, it is nevertheless a transition parliament, rather a constitutional assembly. Its role primarily is to amend the Constitution. In short, our Duma must solve a number of basic tasks. [Poerzgen] You are in Germany for a week to present your book "Reform From Below -- Russia's New Future," which has now also been published in German. In this book you write that an era of reform has come to an end in Russia. The reform from above must not be followed by reconstruction from below. What does this mean specifically? [Yavlinskiy] Reform begins only when the people's lives are changing. The economic system, which we created 80 years ago, is rooted very deeply. Thus, if we really want to change this system, we must begin at the roots. If we bring about changes there, we can also solve the bigger tasks. Russia is an enormous country, where very different people live, and they have very different ideas of success and of how one should live. If we really want to achieve something, these people must be permitted to act as they consider right. Moscow cannot answer all these questions. [Poerzgen] This means that the Russian Federation needs stronger decentralization and regionalization? [Yavlinskiy] Moscow must look to the regions and listen what the people there want and help them to do what they want. If one region wants to implement reform in this own way, it must be supported in this. And if other regions take different paths, Moscow must help there, too. This is very important regarding the entire legislation, for instance. It is impossible that someone in the capital city thinks up the laws. They should be shaped in such a way that they take the interests of those people who have to live with these laws into consideration. The central power is needed to implement the laws as soon as they have grown from below. It must take care that they are indeed observed. This would then be a rule- of-law state with a reform from below and control from above. [Poerzgen] Another point that clearly distinguishes from other reformers is the importance that you attribute to social security. [Yavlinskiy] As long as the people do not have the possibility to earn their living themselves, this is unavoidable. We can take a more liberal economic course only to the extent to which we manage to give the people the opportunity to earn their living. Just imagine for a moment what would have happened if eastern Germany had not had western Germany. The government would have been deposed and it would have been said: Do what you want: laissez faire. And what would have happened? No system can work in this way. Liberalism must include the people are able to earn their living. If a country has been structured like one big single enterprise for 80 years, one cannot turn it into a market economy overnight. [Poerzgen] Now you are trying to implement your approach of a different reform policy in the region of Nishniy Novgorod? [Yavlinksiy] In Nishniy Novgorod we have set ourselves a very specific task. We have changed the system of social safeguards and, at the same time, we have begun with privatization. Thus, in Russia there are, for instance, a large number of apartments that are administered by the enterprises. The enterprises must use 90 percent of their profits to maintain the apartments, for kindergartens, and for other social tasks. Such an enterprise cannot develop, no one is going to invest in it. If such a company is closed down, the entire town is closed down. In Nizhniy Novgorod we take the money that has so far been used to maintain the apartments and channel it into the people's income. At the same time, we give them housing. Interestingly enough, the costs immediately go down to one-third. And therefore one must not frighten the people. One must not tell them that the apartments are privatized, but it is better that one calls them housing cooperatives. That is something that the people understand. As soon as the cooperative has been established, the people find it possible to rent certain rooms and can afford craftsmen for repairs. And this continues to develop. If many of these cooperatives develop, they can become shareholders, for instance in the gas sector or waste disposal. In this way it is possible, bit by bit, to take social services out of the enterprises. This is what I call the conversion of social infrastructure. [Poerzgen] Do you find support for your ideas in the government? [Yavlinskiy] Somehow, no one is really against it. But no one does anything for it, either. Everyone talks more about how high the dollar exchange rate is than about the budget deficit. Of course, this is very important, but we will never achieve a normal dollar exchange rate and an acceptable budget deficit as long as we do not put the institutional framework of our national economy in order. [Poerzgen] What kind of support do you expect from the West? [Yavlinskiy] The most important thing is intellectual and moral support. For us it is primarily important that the West understands the problems that we have to solve. [Poerzgen] Do you find this understanding? [Yavlinskiy] Unfortunately no. First, it is probably not easy. Second, politics in the West has long become a show in many respects. Fortunately, most people in the West live and work far removed from politics. However, the principles of this show are also applied in the relationship with our country. Therefore, times of ardent love for Russia are again and again replaced by times of hysterical cooling down. Perhaps this is good for Western policy. We, on the other hand, need a calm and sober look at what we are doing. We do not want do be praised to high heaven, nor do we want to be damned. We need calm and sober cooperation that remains independent of personal political ambitions. We would want the West not so much to be oriented toward individual persons, but to look more at the processes. Then our cooperation would be more solid. Regarding financial aid, I am, first, of the opinion that we must repay our debts. Second, it is not the scope of aid that is most important but specific projects. For instance, I would prefer seeing $100 million spent on providing farmers with technical equipment, for instance mini-transporters. This is better than getting billions of dollars so that the government uses them for stabilizing the ruble. I think that it is more important for the stabilization of the ruble that the farmer is able to take his potatoes to the shops. [Poerzgen] How do you assess the work of Western advisers in this connection? [Yavlinskiy] First of all, I am grateful to all who help Russia. However, I would like to recall that, in pre-revolutionary Russia, engineers who built bridges stood under them when the first train went across. After all, the lives of many people are involved. One must be aware of this responsibility.
