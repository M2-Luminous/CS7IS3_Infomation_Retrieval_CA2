FBIS4-12513 "drnes069yy_94007" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Palestinian-Israeli Talks Resume in Cairo Palestinian-Israeli Talks Resume in Cairo `Progress' Reported in Talks TA1104053794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0400 GMT 11 Apr 94 TA1104053794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Progress was made in the Cairo negotiations with the Palestinians, which continued until very late last night, although there is doubt the talks will be concluded by 13 April. Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus reports that the Palestinians are making efforts to reach an agreement by that date. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 11 April adds that "from Tunis we have word that chances are slim for a meeting in Bucharest this week between Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir 'Arafat."] In the discussions of the civilian affairs committee, agreement was reached on archaeology, fuel, and environment issues. The team is to discuss the water problems today. There is still dispute regarding jurisdiction over temporary residents and tourists. The military committee resumed discussions on the deployment of the Palestinian police, the foreign observers, and the joint patrols. The Palestinians demanded that the closure be lifted and that prisoners be released. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 11 April adds in a related report from Cairo by Udi Segal: "The PLO has asked that Israel set a date for signing the Gaza and Jericho agreement. The Palestinian delegates in Cairo made it clear that until such a date is set, they will not begin the deployment of the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho, but the Israelis refused to set such a date. Furthermore, they made it absolutely clear to the Palestinians that 13 April is no longer a target date of any kind. ["The Palestinians tried to apply pressure last night and force Israel to make some gesture or symbolic move on 13 April, but the Israelis stood firm, explaining that no move will be made because the PLO has not taken even a single step to show it is willing to implement the agreement. Had the Palestinians started to deploy their police force and assume some control of the territory, we could have considered such a move, an Israeli delegate told us late last night. In the meantime, they have done nothing of the sort. ["Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the delegation, told his Palestinian counterparts last night that the time when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will complete its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho depends only on them. Shahaq said: on an operational level, we are able to complete the withdrawal, but until you take up your positions, we remain in charge."]
