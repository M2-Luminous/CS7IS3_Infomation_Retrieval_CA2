FR940214-1-00044 FR940214-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 48 CFR Part 871 RIN&hyph;2900&hyph;AG65 VA Acquisition Regulation: Loan Guaranty and Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Programs AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) to increase the amount which property holders and management brokers may spend for emergency property repairs. Advance blanket authorization to management brokers is also being increased. Additionally, the dollar amount that Regional Office Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve for the repair of VA property, acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, United States Code, is being increased to conform with the current statutory authority. DATES: Comments must be received by April 15, 1994. All comments received will be available for public inspection until April 25, 1994. This amendment is proposed to be effective on the date of publication of the Final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington DC 20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia Viverette, Acquisition Policy Division (95A), Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;5001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Purchase of supplies and services for the repair to any VA property is authorized by Chapter 37, Title 38, United States Code (U.S.C.). The dollar limit for management brokers' blanket advance authority to incur routine charges in connection with the management of properties acquired by VA under Chapter 37, Title 38, U.S.C., was increased from $75 to $200 in 1981. Since that time, costs associated with services for which management brokers routinely incur expenses have increased. Because of this, an increase to $500 is being implemented for both the management brokers' blanket authority to incur expenses and the property holders' emergency repair threshold. Also, because of the increased costs of repairs, Regional Office Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve repair programs, (i.e., the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts to purchase supplies and services as contemplated in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity), where the estimated cost does not exceed $25,000. These changes will further promote the efficient management of VA's acquired property inventory. Additionally, VAAR Sections 871.103 and 871.106 are being removed because they are duplicative of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Technical amendments are being made to reflect the current organizational titles. II. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) The Secretary certifies that this change will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The increase in the amount for routine charges or emergency repairs in connection with the management of properties will reduce the economic burden placed on management brokers or property holders by reducing the administrative approval process. The remaining proposed changes are VA internal procedures and will not directly affect any small entity. III. Paperwork Reduction Act This amendment does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements on the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subject in 48 CFR Part 871 Government procurement. Approved: December 10, 1993. Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
