The deputy head ofthe organizational department of the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee, Mr. Lu Feng, said that such practice would be promoted across the municipality. There are to date 56,400 industrial and commerical individual entities as well as privately owned enterprises in the municipality included in the taxation bracket. Privately run enterprises account for some 3,000 with 6,000 workers employed. Statistics showed that the number of individual business entities each with a registered capital of RMB 100,000 [renminbi] was over 200. Some privately owned enterprises possessed registered capital of RMB 20 million with employment of 400 workers. Taxes paid by those individual business entities were up to RMB 736 million last year, ranking Shenzhen second only after Shanghai in terms of amount of taxes paid to the state. Individual entrepreneurs vary as far as morals are concerned. However, most of them are honest and abide by law in running their business. Some individuals, however, are profit minded and seek benefit at the expense of others. They usually resort to tricks to do harm to consumers' interests. The Yuanling market Party branch, first of such grassroots group of CPC set up in Shenzhen, has seven party members who are model individual entrepreneurs running business in the market. They observed professional ethical codes and abided by law during the past several years. They also did a lot for public welfare. Establishment of such a CPC grassroots organization for individual entrepreneurs was of great significance to the strengthened leadership of the economic groups of nonpublic ownership, to the development of the special economic zone, to the proper market management and to social stability.
