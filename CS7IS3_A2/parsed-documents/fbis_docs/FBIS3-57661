Additional personnel and arms are already been sent to the Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo. Despite the considerable losses sustained by the battalion while carrying out its peacekeeping mission -- six servicemen have been killed and about 30 wounded over a period of 18 months -- there is no shortage of volunteers. This is the only Ukrainian Army military unit in which three to four candidates are competing for each post. Indeed, many parents are asking commanders to send their sons to serve precisely in this subunit. The reason is simple: Each man here gets about 10 times more than the Ukrainian defense minister. For the first time, servicewomen have been included in the new personnel of the battalion. These Ukrainian Amazons will be able, where necessary in combat conditions, render first aid to their male colleagues.
