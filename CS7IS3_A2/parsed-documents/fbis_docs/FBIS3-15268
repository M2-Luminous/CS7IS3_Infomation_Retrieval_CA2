He said that the government totally shares the provisions of the message from President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly: [Begin Chernomyrdin recording] The crisis has affected not only those sectors which were forecast to suffer the greatest reduction in production but also those which produce products which are, in principle, competitive and consumer goods which are in demand. In these conditions it is evident that the question can no longer be put simply in terms of more money or less money. It is clear that without a sufficiently tough financial and monetary policy it will not be possible to achieve anything, just as it has not been possible in other countries. But it seems that it will hardly be possible to radically improve the state of affairs in the country using only this means. The government today has great responsibility for the course of the reforms, for what they will cost millions of people, for the political temperature of the young Russian democracy which is undergoing a complicated time of its self-determination both in the country and in the world as a whole. I cannot today avoid mentioning a problem which is extremely important for me, personally and for the government which I head. What is at issue is that of late in some of the mass media a noisy campaign has been unleashed with the aim of proving that the chairman of the government is allegedly concentrating power, that he is taking too much onto himself in order to get himself onto the presidential chair. Even some polls have begun to be held on this theme. Let me say honestly and frankly that I am not one of those clever people who can do everything who are prepared to ascend in one leap from being head of a laboratory to being a minister, deputy minister or premier or even at times president. I must say in the first place that Russia is not a racing car, which you can get into, go for a spin and get out of again; and after this the whole country trembles like in a fever. Second, I consider that it is impermissible and simply idiotic to have any discussion about the presidency while we have an existing president. We have one nationwide leader, elected by the whole people and I do not intend to intrigue against him. I am not like that. Third, some people, including some of you, are making vain attempts to drive a wedge between the president and the chairman of the government, trying to cause trouble between us, and this will not succeed. It is futile to try. Today, accord is needed by all of us, by all branches of power, by all leaders, no matter what posts they occupy. Accord is needed by the whole people. [end recording]
