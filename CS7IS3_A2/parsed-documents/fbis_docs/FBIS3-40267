The draft law by which the government seeks the authority to adopt ordinances during parliamentary recesses has been the occasion for a new conflict. -- Representatives of the opposition have withdrawn from the Chamber of Deputies. The opposition does not think that this authority should be given and has proposed that Parliament meet in extraordinary session, as soon as 3 January 1994, to discuss, in plenary session, all the regulations which the government seeks the authority to issue. Nevertheless, the parliamentary majority (based on the support of the forces on the left) really wants a parliamentary recess. The real reason is not fatigue and stress but a hidden reason, which our newspaper exposed long ago: It wants the "approval" of the IMF agreement without going through Parliament, even though the international organization called for parliamentary approval. The political undertone is very clear -- it is trying to avoid a strong "yes" or "no" from the leftist forces. If they were to say "yes," then they could be accused of being turncoats because the measures stipulated in the IMF agreement are right-wing measures. This would mean an ideological movement to the side of the opposition, despite the fact that they "blew it" just this month in the vote on the motion of censure against the government. If they say "no," this means that they really do not support the government, which has already signed the IMF agreement. It is impossible to resolve this dilemma so the only solution is a "welcome Parliamentary recess," during which all the responsibilities will rest with the government, thereby absolving from responsibility the political forces which support it.... This is only one problem. More dangerous is the fact that it also affects things which have nothing to do with the memorandum signed with the IMF. And even things which are in conflict with this memorandum! For example, the government wants to have the authority to: -- modify the budget by sidestepping Parliament, which is inadmissible; -- carry out an operation (with tragic results for the economy!) of total compensation for so-called arrears, without the approval of Parliament. Thus, a concealed assumption by the state of debts of bankrupt state enterprises which never could be repaid. "By the state" actually means on the backs of the people. -- resume, through the back door, without transparency (a study in opportuneness made available to Parliament), investments in the nickel and cobalt combine in Cuba and a thermoelectric power plant in the PRC; -- attempt to provide legal basis for maintaining the difference between wage increases and price increases; -- contract for foreign credits, without mentioning the sources (!), which, in the case of approval by Parliament, would not be possible. If some of these things are necessary, it is all right, but we should know about them also!
