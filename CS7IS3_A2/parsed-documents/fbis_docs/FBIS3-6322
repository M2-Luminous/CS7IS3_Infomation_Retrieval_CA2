Japanese Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma and Peruvian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Efrain Gordenberg Schreiber exchanged documents on the Japanese loan in Lima. Azuma told Gordenberg the Japanese Government will provide emergency relief materials worth 19 million yen to help the victims of heavy rains, which have killed more than 71 people in Peru. The loan, to be extended in coordination with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), will be used for Peru's program to improve and modernize the basic equipment in public medical organizations which offer medical services to people on low incomes, the officials said. Because of the lack of basic medical equipment and funds, there are insufficient medical services for such people in Peru, and epidemics such as cholera and malaria are common in the country. The 30-year loan, with a 10-year grace period, carries an annual interest rate of 3 percent. It brings the total amount of Japanese loans extended to the Latin American nation to 153.87 billion yen, the officials said. The emergency relief materials from Japan include blankets, tents and medical goods, they said. According to the officials, heavy rains have been falling on the mountainous regions of Peru since mid-January. As of March 1, the subsequent floods and landslides had killed 71 people and affected another 70,000. The officials said the Peruvian Government has requested emergency relief goods from Japan.
