After visiting the buildings gutted by a bomb on May 27 last year with the death of five, Scalfaro attended a rally this afternoon in Piazza della Signoria, the city's main square since its birth and rise to celebrity as the capital of the Renaissance, telling a crowd of thousands that historical truth must not be tampered with. "In this case, the truth is history, and we can't make history as we would have liked it to be," he said. "We must learn our lesson from history, which cannot be changed, from sacrifice for the Liberation...." His remarks fell at a time of great debate about the continued significance of the struggle against the Fascist regime as the source of the values on which the Italian republic is founded and proposals from the new conservative majority in parliament for reforming the republic's foundations. "We therefore appeal to history and our memories in order not to forget since the testimony of those who died for liberty must also be the commitment of each of us," Scalfaro added. According to some analysts, foremost in his mind may have been on the documentary footage of Italy's Liberation during World War II shown recently on RAI's [Italian State-Owned Broadcasting Company] flagship First Channel. The screenings of mostly new material shot by U.S. film crews was accompanied by a commentary and debate in the studio in which many people saw a neofascist spokesman as being allowed to whitewash the historical truth of dictator Benito Mussolini's regime. The footage was aired just as the conservative coalition of the federalist Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia with the neofascist National Alliance took a parliamentary majority in the March 27-28 election. At the same time, National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini claimed in an interview that Mussolini was the "greatest statesman of the century." According to some analysts, Scalfaro may decide to delay naming a premier-designate, presumably Berlusconi, until after the annual celebrations for the Liberation on April 25, to avoid what promises, this year, to be a massive and highly committed turnout becoming a demonstration against the media mogul-turned-politician's nomination to lead the new government. "Unity, harmony, and concord must be achieved," urged Scalfaro, "because a people can only move if it is capable of drawing from history lessons of peace and justice, not lessons of hate and revenge." Opening his speech, Scalfaro also said he had nothing to add to what had already been said by Florence Mayor Giorgio Morales, who asserted that no question-marks could be raised over values such as "Italian unity, liberty, and democracy, asserted by the struggle for Liberation from Nazi-Fascism."
