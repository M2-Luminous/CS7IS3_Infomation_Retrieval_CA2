It discussed the legal situation in Lithuania in 1993 and the Procuracy's future work. [passage omitted] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made some remarks at the meeting. In his opinion, the investigation in the cases of corruption and in other cases which cause great anxiety to the people are being excessively delayed and thus unnecessary tension is preserved in society. [passage omitted] The president urged the officials to take all the necessary steps envisaged in the law to ensure that the cases of corruption and other cases are not delayed. The President again explained his motives for rejecting the law on the declaration of income and property. According to Algirdas Brazauskas, there are no doubts about the necessity of such a law, but a system of its practical implementation should be created. The president stressed that the law must defend the interests of the state but not (?persecute) certain groups of people. In the opinion of Algirdas Brazauskas, a corrected law on the declaration of income and property should be implemented in several stages. At the beginning, high-ranking officials should be the first to declare their property -- the president, members of the Seimas and government. In the future, all residents of the country should declare their income. Algirdas Brazauskas stressed the importance of cooperation of all law-and-order institutions in combating criminals and in maintaining state law and order. [passage omitted]
