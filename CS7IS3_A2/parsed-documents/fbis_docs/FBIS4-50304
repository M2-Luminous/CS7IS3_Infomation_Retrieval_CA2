Delivering a statement at the session, Zhang Kunmin, head of the Chinese delegation, said that in order to protect the ecological environment and consumers' health and safety, it is necessary to formulate appropriate environmental regulations and standards in international trade. But he said environmental protection should not be an excuse for new protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers. Otherwise, he warned, they would only further limit the export of developing countries, which would lead to the aggravation of poverty and the weakening of their power in environmental protection. Zhang pointed out that when establishing environmental regulations and standards, the international community should also take into consideration the situation and requirements of developing countries. The developed countries should help the developing countries to "improve their capability in the compliance of environmental regulations and standards through such forms as technology transfer," Zhang said. In short, he added, the principle of "prompting the economic growth of trade partners and the development of developing countries," which was brought forth in the declaration of Uruguay Round, should be substantively adhered to. In recent years, the question of relations between trade and environment has become one of the hot issues, which have attracted much attention from the international community.
