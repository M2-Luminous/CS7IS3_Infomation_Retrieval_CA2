Now for another rally held today: [Correspondent Nikolay Ivanov] A rally by the so-called Russian All-People's Union was held not far from the White House near the stadium at Krasnaya Presnya. The assembled did not exceed 2,000 in number. Although the rally was devoted officially to the memory of those who died during the defense of the White House in October last year, those gathered and the speakers easily extended the limits of their speeches. These ranged from expressions of dissatisfaction with the Russian president and Government to displeasure at the forthcoming visit by the U.S. President. Mikhail Astafyev, the well-known opposition leader, pointed toward the U.S. Embassy, saying that, according to anonymous witnesses, in October the White House defenders were fired at from the buildings of the Embassy. In addition, he called on those assembled to remind people of the Russian All-People's Union through gatherings outside the buildings of the Federation Council and State Duma while they are in session. The notorious Sazhi Umalatova and Viktor Alksnis also spoke, attempting to draw a parallel between Bloody Sunday, 9 January 1905, and today. Given that the small number of militiamen did not even try to influence those at the rally in any way, this kind of association did not really seem relevant. Donations were collected during the rally to help those wounded during the events at the White House and to help those imprisoned in Lefortovo.
