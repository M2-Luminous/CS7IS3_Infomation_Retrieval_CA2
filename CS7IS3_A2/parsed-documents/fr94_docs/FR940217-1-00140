FR940217-1-00140 FR940217-1-00017 (1) The price of the EPIRB and the ability of the EPIRB to operate in the marine environment: The cost of the 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB has been dropping steadily since its introduction. The current advertised price of Satellite EPIRBs averages around $1350. This is one-half the estimated cost used in the NPRM dated April 19, 1990, and confirms the prediction stated in the NPRM that prices would fall. The Coast Guard expects that the cost of the EPIRBs will continue to fall as a result of the combination of bulk purchase orders through associations and marketplace response to keener competition. The Coast Guard recognizes that exposure to the marine environment can be extremely detrimental, especially to electronic equipment. With this in mind, the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) developed a standard for the manufacture of the 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB. This standard incorporates rigorous environmental tests that include long term exposure to salt, fog, and extreme vibrations. These tests were developed to ensure that the 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB will provide successful service throughout its expected life. The Federal Communications Center requires U.S. type accepted 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs to meet the RTCM standards. (2) The actual need for an EPIRB: In response to the comments that EPIRBs were not needed on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels, the Coast Guard conducted a detailed study of the available casualty record for uninspected passenger vessels. A copy of this study entitled ``Uninspected Passenger Vessel Casualties'' is available for review and copying in the docket at the location identified in the ADDRESSES section near the beginning of this notice. The casualty study revealed that although there are a significant number of accidents involving charterboats with deaths resulting, only a few lives would have been saved if these vessels were required to carry EPIRBs. This is because help usually came in one of two ways. One source of assistance has come from other nearby vessels which saw that a vessel was in distress. The other frequent means of obtaining assistance came from the use of a radio, used either to summon the Coast Guard or a nearby vessel. The Coast Guard disagrees that EPIRBs are not needed on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels. However, as a result of the study, the Coast Guard believes that the uninspected passenger vessels in need of EPIRBs are primarily those that operate: (1) At night; (2) out of sight of other vessels; or (3) out of radio range to call for assistance. (3) The type of EPIRB: The comments to the NPRM suggested allowing the carriage of a Category 2, 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB for a boat manufactured under the level flotation requirements of 33 CFR Part 183. The comment expressed an opinion that the construction of a vessel with level flotation defeats the design operation of the Category 1 EPIRB. The Coast Guard is proposing to adopt the recommendation made in these comments. The Category 1, 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB is a fully automatic, float-free device. It is mounted on the outside of a vessel in a manner so that if a vessel sinks quickly, or unexpectedly, the device will float free, activate, and alert authorities of the distress. The Category 2 406 MHz Satellite EPIRB is manually operated, manually launched, and depends upon a person on the vessel to launch the device. â€™The Coast Guard requirement for level flotation construction in 33 CFR Part 183 applies only to recreational vessels 6.06 meters (20 ft) in length and under. When a vessel of greater than 6.06 meters (20 ft) in length is manufactured with enough flotation material to keep the boat afloat, this must be substantiated by a certification by the manufacturer that the construction of the vessel includes inherently buoyant material which will prevent the vessel from sinking. Discussion of Proposed Amendments Due to information obtained from the casualty study and comments received from the NPRM, the Coast Guard reconsidered the EPIRB proposals for uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels. The uninspected passenger vessels that are affected by this proposed rule are mostly charterboats. These boats typically make day fishing trips with six or fewer paying passengers on board. The statutory language requires manned uninspected vessels to carry an EPIRB. The legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended the EPIRB requirement to apply to manned uninspected vessels including tug boats, towing vessels, offshore supply vessels, oceanographic research vessels, and passenger vessels carrying 6 or less passengers. Consistent with the legislative history, the Coast Guard believes that applying the EPIRB requirement to manned barges is unnecessary since these vessels can not operate without the assistance of another vessel required to carry an EPIRB. Therefore, the Coast Guard proposes that this rule apply to self-propelled uninspected vessels. The proposed rules would make 406 MHz satellite EPIRBs generally required on uninspected passenger vessels and vessel assistance towing vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 4.8 km (3 statute miles) from the coastline of the Great Lakes, subject to the exceptions discussed below. These are the same areas in which EPIRBs are required on other uninspected commercial vessels. However, the Coast Guard believes that virtually all uninspected passenger vessels operating on these waters are charterboats, and that the proposed exemption conditions would probably exempt most charterboats from the EPIRB requirement.
