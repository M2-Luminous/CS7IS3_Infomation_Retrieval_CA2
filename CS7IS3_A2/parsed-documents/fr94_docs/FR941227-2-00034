FR941227-2-00034 FR941227-2-00027 [Project No. 11285&hyph;001 California] Lake Casitas Municipal Water District; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment December 20, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a original, minor license for the Lake Casitas Power Recovery Facility (project), and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. The project is located on the Bureau of Reclamation's existing pipeline between its Casitas dam and its water treatment plant, near the City of San Buena Ventura, in Ventura County, California. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. All comments should clearly show the following caption on the first page: LAKE CASITAS POWER RECOVERY FACILITY, FERC NO. 11285&hyph;001. For further information, contact Surender M. Yepuri, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219&hyph;2847. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31696 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
