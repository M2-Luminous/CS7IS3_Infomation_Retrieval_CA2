Representatives from member countries of the alliance of small insular states are expected to participate in this summit. Parallel to the world summit on small insular states that will take place in Barbados, a forum on nongovernment organizations will also take place in the capital, at which Cuban youth will be present. (Damodar Pena), one of the Cuban representatives to that forum, outlines some of the subjects that will be discussed in that forum. [Begin recording] [(Pena)] One of the subjects is social and environmental policies on sustainable development, the work that youth can do in this regard, and some action plans concerning what can be done in countries such as ours, taking into account the fact that this is essentially a meeting of developing nations and of small islands. This forum will discuss what can be done in these islands in the quest for sustainable development. [Unidentified reporter] What is the Cuban youth experience in this context? [(Pena)] The Cuban youth have actively participated in all discussions on the development of ecology in Cuba for a long time. I can tell you that the national bureau [not further identified] discussed this subject in January 1992 and again in December of the same year, and it was agreed that the youth should be charged with these issues and that a national ecology group should be created. In May 1993, the ecology issue was discussed in the Isle of Youth when a set of guidelines was established, especially for those issues having to do with youth, such as environmental education of the new generation. I think this is a very important aspect in which the youth, together with several social organizations such as the Ministries of Educatio and Culture and the communities can do much to teach the people to take care of the environment, love it, and use it for their own benefit without harming its stability. These are the essential things carried out by the youth in this regard. [end recording]
