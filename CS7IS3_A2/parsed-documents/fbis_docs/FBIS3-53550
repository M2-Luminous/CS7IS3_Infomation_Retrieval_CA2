President Ali Aballah Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) and his Vice President's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) are accusing each other of massing troops at the old border dividing the country, which was united in 1990. GPC sources interviewed by telephone from Dubayy, told AFP that the YSP which ruled the former South Yemen had deployed its 20th brigade at the border at dawn on Friday. The brigade, positioned across from the northern province of al-Baydha, had been based further inland in the south. The GPC sources said the southern forces were bolstered opposite the border town of Ta'izz and that armoured vehicles were sent to the airport of the southern port of Aden. On Thursday, the sources said that the YSP had redeployed four army units previously on the borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia to the oil region of Shabwa in the south. Socialist South Yemen and the more prosperous conservative North united in May 1990 after three centuries of separation. But their armies have not yet been merged and the two leaders, Salih and Vice President Ali Salem al-Bid, have been locked in a dispute since August over how to rule the country. Al-Bid, the president of the former south, left the capital to his home in Aden, demanding political and economic reforms. He refused to attend a reconciliation meeting with Salih last Sunday. The sources contacted from Dubayy accused al-Bid's party of "recently using the country's oil revenues to conclude arms deals, notably with Bulgaria and Russia." A YSP official however denied the charge and held the rival party responsible for the military "escalation." "The GPC deployed Friday several units on the old border, mainly the first armoured unit and the Amaliqa brigade, opposite the northern provinces of al-Baydha and Dhamar," the YSP source said. In a statement Thursday, the GPC slammed the mobilisation and reinforcement of troops by the socialist party, saying it was against "the spirit of national unity and risked a breakout of a civil war." The GPC sources accused the socialists of lacking interest in implementation of a plan, approved by a military committee headed by the deputy chief of staff, Colonel Ali Mohammad Salah, to withdraw both parties' forces from the old border line. Jordan had accepted the committee's proposal to send an intervention force to Yemen to supervise the withdrawal, they said, but the YSP asked Amman to postpone the deployment. Tension has been rising in the country since the failure of last Sunday's reconciliation attempt by religious mediators. The Yemeni president said Wednesday he was prepared to step down and hand the job over to his southern rival to "safeguard Yemen's unity." He urged his countrymen to avoid a conflict and organise a peaceful march from the northern town of Ta'izz to Aden, the capital of the former south.
