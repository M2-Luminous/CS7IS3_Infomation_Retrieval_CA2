Mr Mongkhon said before leaving for his home province in the morning that he would study what legal aspects could be used against those who damaged his reputation. He and other Opposition MP's have been angered by reports that Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong told last week's Cabinet meeting that 17 Opposition MP's were suspected by the U.S. of involvement in illicit drug businesses and that three of them were denied entry visas to the US. A Cabinet source quoted Sqn Ldr Prasong as naming Mr Mongkhon as one of the three MP's whose visa applications were rejected. The foreign minister, however, denied that at the Cabinet meeting he had identified any drug suspects or those whose U.S. visas were refused. Mr Mongkhon tearfully told the House on Thursday that he had never been involved in drug trafficking and had never been told by the United States Embassy that a visa which was issued to him in 1991 could not be used now. The United States Information Services on Friday issued a statement saying there was "reason to believe" that Mr Mongkhon was involved in the drugs trade, therefore his visa was denied under the Immigration and Nationality Act. According to the statement, the Chiang Rai MP had been told in writing why he was ineligible for a visa. Mr Mongkhon, however, repeatedly denied yesterday that he or anyone at his house had ever received such a letter from the embassy. There was no evidence to prove the letter had been sent to his house. "I was surprised why that letter never reached me although I have my address here." He asked the news media to help trace that letter for him. "The news media should ask for proof (that the letter was sent to Mr Mongkhon) from the embassy." According to Mr Mongkhon, the embassy told him the visa could not be issued because it needed a few more documents but did not say anything about suspected drug involvement. Mr Mongkhon said he could not say whether the embassy was giving false evidence but wondered why the news had just been revealed during a time of rising conflict between the Government and the Opposition. He said he believed the drug allegations against him were politically motivated, accusing the Government of trying to get the upper hand on the Opposition after senators and Opposition parties turned down its draft constitution amendment bills last month. "The embassy should have informed me in February or March when the visa application was rejected. I do not understand why everything has just happened now," Mr Mongkhon said. The Chiang Rai MP said he would hold a press conference after meeting party leader Chatchai Chunhawan today. He would also ask the U.S. embassy why it did not send a letter to him to advise that his entry visa was denied. Mr Mongkhon said the fact that he used to be the secretary of former agriculture and cooperatives minister Narong Wongwan, who was alleged to be on the U.S. blacklist of drug suspects should not be relevant to the drug allegations against him. He challenged the Government to take legal action against him so he could prove he was innocent. The MP, who happened to take the same flight to the northern province with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, said he might ask the premier for just treatment. The Chat Phatthana Party issued a statement saying it would certainly take tough action against Mr Mongkhon if any criminal charge filed against him was proven. The party said that at this stage Mr Mongkhon had not been charged in the U.S. or Thailand. The visa was denied on suspicion only.
