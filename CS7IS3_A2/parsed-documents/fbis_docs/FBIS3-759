Dr van der Walt, addressing a media conference at the South African Embassy said he had held meetings with community leaders while one of his colleagues had spoken to public service heads of departments. Both had emphasised the need for the homeland, wracked by violence for days, to return to normal. Starting off the conference by saying "the past days have been horrendous," he went on to say he as administrator would "leave no stone unturned until justice has been done". Dr van der Walt said he had been the one to contact South African Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha to send SA [South African] Defence Force troops to the embassy in Bophuthatswana "to protect South African lives". "After that it was up to other negotiators to take decisions to move out of the embassy. What we desperately need to achieve is law and order, peace and quiet. We wanted Bophuthatswana's participation in free and fair elections." Dr van der Walt appealed to the press "not to crucify anybody at this stage" as there were many reasons for the collapse of law in the homeland. The decision was taken to strip the cabinet of its powers and to remove the former president, Lucas Mangope, from power as time was running out for the homeland to participate in the elections. "I tried to convince Mr Mangope of the urgency of the matter often," he said. "The political government is no longer in place -- Mr Mangope and the cabinet have no power ... but the government's executive departments will continue to function." Mr van der Walt reiterated Mr Botha's statement of early Sunday that civil servants, including those fired by strike action, would be employed. This included staff at the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] who were fired on Wednesday after occupying the building on Tuesday. Mr van der Walt emphasised the urgent need to reopen the BBC to establish communication with the people. The SA Police had to start taking over in the now incorporated homeland so rule of law could be maintained. Regarding the removal of Mr Mangope from power, Dr van der Walt said: "I can't say he accepted it, but he complied." He added after the conference, in reply to a question, that Mr Mangope "had lost touch with reality and the will of his people." Dr van de Walt also appealed to the civil servants not to demand their pensions be paid out now that they had the assurance of both the Bophuthatswana and South African Governments that their funds were safe. He added that a number of cabinet ministers had resigned and cite? the example of Health Minister Ned Khaole "who resigned sometime last week but was seen at the Victoria Hospital helping out with their heavy workload after this had taken place." Head of the police force Gen P J Seleke had also been removed from his post, Dr van der Walt confirmed.
