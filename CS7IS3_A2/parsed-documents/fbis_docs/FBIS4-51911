About 2,000 activist students from Seoul National University and 39 other universities and colleges in the Seoul area attended the rally. A student manifesto read at the rally claimed that "the government has one-sidedly yielded to market-opening pressures from world capitalist countries, causing threat to the very survival of workers let alone 10 million farmers." It also asserted that "the United States continues to pose a nuclear war threat to North Korea to build up the danger of war on the whole area of the Korean peninsula." Yi Chong-uk, a Hanyang University senior, was chosen as new Sochongnyon chairman at the rally which also set "resistance to rice market opening" and "anti-U.S. struggles" as Sochongnyon's major tasks of the year. Prior to the rally, participating students staged a demonstration along a 2-km street from the Sinchon intersection to the Hongik campus, shouting "no war on the Korean peninsula" and "no market opening." Large police forces were mobilized in the Sinchon area but no clashes were reported during the demonstration.
