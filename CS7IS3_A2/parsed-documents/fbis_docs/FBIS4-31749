The report on budget implementation presented by the Finance Ministry states that after five months, 38.3 percent of planned revenue expenditures has been implemented, which is more than last year (37.5 percent). Budget expenditures are also higher than last year -- 36.2 and 35.6 percent, respectively. The ministry reports that there were no problems in financing the budget deficit. The "Open Sky" treaty was signed by the foreign ministers of 25 countries as early as March 1992. It pertains to the issue of permission for mutual observation of terrain by aircraft of countries which are parties to the treaty. The convention will take effect after it is ratified by 20 countries. Up to now, only 16 countries have done so. At the beginning of each year, countries which want to conduct aerial observations, present the numbers of their planned flights. Countries over which the observations will be conducted (these are military and economic observations), will be notified 24 hours before the set date. The authorities of the countries, however, will not know the exact route of the flight until the very last moment.
