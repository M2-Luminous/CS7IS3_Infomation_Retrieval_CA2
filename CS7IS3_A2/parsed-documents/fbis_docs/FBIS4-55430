This was the first time that a Serbian warship so decidedly faced the blockade action of the international peace forces. There have been many instances of ships being detained or taken away, but there has never been an action of such marked confrontation. After a crew of allied commandos disembarked on the Lido, the Serbian gun-boat appeared -- all this was happening some 40 miles away from the shore, which means deep in the blockade zone. The gun-boat did not make any provocation, but it tried to interfere with taking the tanker to Brindisi by its very presence. The incident itself may seem a crazy, thoughtless act, inappropriate soldiers' behavior, but I believe it is not so. I believe that, too, was part of the general idea of military pressure and intentional provocation of tense actions, with fierce confrontation as their aim, in which firmness and military persistence in the defense of their aims would be displayed. All this has been seen many times before, lately especially around Gorazde, in the constant bombing of Croatian territory from Bosnia, in the accumulation of troops around Brcko, in the inflexibility at the demarcation lines. In the so-called UNPA's there regularly appears an odd gun or a tank, and armed group raids and other attempts to keep the occupied territory continue. Many incidents involving UNPROFOR also show that this policy has intensified. An Increasing Number of Incidents Now it has started happening at sea, too. The purpose of such provocations is not to scare the allied frigate or seize a tanker, but to show that Serbia is prepared to defend the positions it has occupied, including those at sea, despite the powerful allied fleet, and to oppose the blockade. This could also be a form of additional pressure on the allies to stir up disorder, and perhaps even disunity among them. Although we do not have the information that would account for the entire action, we can assume, judging by the logic and what followed, that other Serbian forces were also on the alert. For instance, we know that they have a certain number of warships, including submarines, in operational use. There was probably another boat ready to sail out, or else there was a submarine somewhere nearby, its task being to support the gun-boat. I believe that one of these submarines is constantly on patrol a certain distance away from their coast. Naturally, the blockade forces are doing everything necessary in anti-submarine protection. However, despite this protection, submarines are dangerous, and their aim is not only to cause unrest. We must reckon on the fact that the air forces could have appeared above the site of the incident in only a few minutes. A factor that could have added to the complexity of the situation could have been coast missile divisions. The incident occurred outside the range of tactical systems, but we know that Serbia has received extended range anti-ship missiles. At a certain time Italy was threatened by land-to-land missiles, with the range of about 1,000 km. These are unconvincing things, but they do function psychologically, within the strategy of provoking incidents. On the basis of the aforementioned, we can see that the operation was quite complex, although it seems simple and short-term. Frustration, anger, or some other emotional outburst of a commander of the Serbian fleet or some other individual in the military hierarchy should therefore be ruled out. Although individuals or navy commanders can incite such actions, this incident should also be viewed in the context of events in the air and on land. Tension Stretched to Extremes The same things are happening there -- the tension between the Serb army and the "blue helmets" is intentionally stretched to extremes, to playing on the edge of the sword. It is a very risky game, but Serbia has decided that it has turned out to be profitable so far, as so far Serbia has been left unpunished. The Serbs have damaged several planes, downed one, killed several members of the peace forces; they arrest them, hold them hostages -- about a hundred at a time -- and they are not punished for it. They are, therefore, making use of the basic principles of the United Nations actions: no revenge, but prevention of great destruction, inhumane actions, and so on. This is deliberate misuse of the UN policies, which are very considerate, peaceful, and humanitarian, and highly restrained in resorting to force. The long-announced political resolution is probably being prepared. The great powers have completed the final preparations for the final negotiations, but Serbia, with such incidents, shows a decisiveness not to withdraw from the occupied positions, that is, not to return the occupied territory. This incident shows that Serbia wants to achieve more at sea, too. The sanctions and the naval blockade have badly damaged Serbia, so it is looking for ways out at sea, too. This blockade also has to be broken, the allied fleet made to go as far away from the shore as possible. It wants to show the allied forces that this blockade does not mean much either, although this is not true, but certain negotiating positions are thus displayed. While positions are being taken, we should not be surprised if there is another such incident at sea. The threats will probably recur. This can have negative consequences for Croatia, too. The issue of lack of safety of both cargo and tourist traffic in the Adriatic can be raised again. More such incidents would bring about, for instance, the raising of the insurance charges for ships and cargoes, and our waters would be proclaimed an unsafe zone, which means that there would be a decrease in profit from tourism and traffic. There have been no open attacks in our seas, but there is a constant danger of naval terrorist actions. The fact that there have not been any does not mean that we are not prepared to protect our sea. On the contrary!
