Maslennikov: "Economy Taken Hostage By a Shortsighted Policy"] [Text] Simferopol -- And so Crimea has made its choice. At his first press conference, Republic of Crimea President Yu.A. Meshkov named three basic causes of our problems and anxieties today: the collapse of the economy, paralysis of authority, and rampant crime. Indeed, the "market" we have allegedly built more closely resembles a wild flea market. This is happening because our economy has fallen victim to the shortsighted decisions and actions of woeful politicians who have ruined a unified country and a unified national economic complex built over decades. After all, it is absolutely essential that political concepts coincide with the functioning of objective economic laws. The introduction of Ukraine's own currency--the karbovanets--has resulted in nothing but chaos for the financial system and has sharply undermined the standard of living of the populace, putting many of us on the edge of extinction. Only the various kinds of profiteers and bureaucrats can feel free under the new conditions as they line their pockets with the distribution of all the people's assets. Task number one for the first president of Crimea is to put a tight lid on profiteering and so-called "grab-it-ization." The new Government of the Republic of Crimea must draw conclusions from the negative experience of "the Bagrov team" and further to the greatest possible extent restoration of the economic ties with Russia and other CIS countries which were destroyed. And in order to diminish at least in some way the grave consequences of the current collapse of ties, we must utilize local conditions and resources more fully. We might consider as an example in this regard the reforms of the Vrangel government, and indeed--NEP. A proper resolution to issues in the development of agriculture and sectors of the processing industry would not only help resolve the food problem which is so painful for us, but would also enable us to accumulate funds to treat social needs. But it is my deep conviction that our most important source of wealth--the land-- cannot constitute the object of buying and selling. It must belong to those who will cultivate it conscientiously. It is also necessary at the state level to examine questions pertaining to increased housing construction (last year only 8,600 apartments were built in Crimea) and assistance to Crimean resort areas. Of course, these tasks will not be accomplished while proceeding along the path of Kiev's current isolationist policy. We need decisive steps to be taken towards economic sovereignty, especially in the conduct of Crimea's financial (budgetary and tax) policy. We must reform our tax system, especially since Crimea will henceforth be conducting a tax policy independent of that of Ukraine. Taxes must be levied for the budget based on one indicator of production or production realization. This will lead to improved accounting and control, and will downsize financial organs. In such event, it would be advantageous to unite the finance and tax departments of Crimea into one institution. In order to overcome the current paralysis of power and the rampant crime related to it, we must elect to the Supreme Council of Crimea and to local organs of authority as many honest and decent people as possible, true professionals who have not sullied themselves either in shady dealings in the sphere of "grab-it-ization" or links with our state-trade mafia, in other words--with that very environment that engenders crime on the state scale.
