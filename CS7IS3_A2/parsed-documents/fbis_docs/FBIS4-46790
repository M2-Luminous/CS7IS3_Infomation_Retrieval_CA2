The time has come to make generalizations that will give us the capability of understanding the nature of the present macroeconomic phenomona and consciously choosing the way toward revival. The Sources of Crisis The economic crisis in Ukraine has lasted a long time. It began in 1980-81, when the average annual growth of the gross social product fell from more than 3% during the preceding two years to 1.5-1.8%. The causes of the crisis lie in the ineffectiveness of the old cost-based, wasteful, planning-subjectivist system of economic management. As we know, this system was incapable of promoting the distribution of goods, capital, and manpower resources according to the real needs of society. As a result, the structure of social capital, its division among the different sectors, as well as the quality of capital projects in terms of technological levels, physical conditions, and cost recovery, were in conflict with the structure and quality requirements of social consumption. It should be noted that in the case of Ukraine, as in the case of other non-Russian states that made up the Soviet Union, the structure of capital distribution by sectors and the distribution of manpower resources was further distorted by an artificially created demand on the part of enterprises and residents of Russia and other former republics (demand for output to meet defense needs, cultivating the boundless northern and far-eastern territories, ambitious projects in space and in the pro-Communist Afro-Asian countries, etc.). As a result, the deformation of the structure of the economy went further in Ukraine than in Russia, Poland, or Bulgaria, and, thus, the decline in production may be greater. Not only must Ukraine reorient her production to meet real domestic demand, but she must find new foreign markets, abandoning those she had developed in the past. This requires technological adjustments, additional spending on marketing, standardization, and ensuring that products are competitive in terms of both cost and price. The crisis that began 12 years ago began to display more clearly distinguishable features at the beginning of 1992. The liberalization from state control of the overwhelming majority of prices and the self-collapse of the system of state-planned distribution of production exposed the crisis that existing enterprises were in and the fact that many of the goods they produced were unneeded. A tectonic rupture took place in the planning stream of the economic crisis. Simultaneously (although this occurred over a certain period of time), thousands of former economic ties were broken. The explosive transition to a new price level did not give enterprises enough time to accumulate working capital without interrupting the production process. The economy went into shock and remains in this condition to this day. The rate of production decline over two years has surpassed 35.0% (the first year in which the national product fell was 1991, when the decrease reached 4.0%), and there are no signs of stabilization in sight. The long duration of the crisis stems from the fact that the contradictions created in the national economic system run very deep (they are, of course, also present in other states of the former Soviet Union). Until the structure and nature of social capital are strengthened (by changing the specialization of existing enterprises and modernizing their manufacturing processes, building new production and infrastructure facilities which would make it possible to meet the unsatisfied demand for goods and services, retraining and shifting manpower resources from certain sectors into others, reconstructing obsolete transportation and communication systems), there can be no real revival of production growth. The Characteristic Features and Course of the Crisis So far, the crisis has not engendered any factors to produce structural and technological revival. While during the first years, until the beginning of 1993, the crisis caused economic losses to enterprises by making it impossible for them to work at full capacity, for the past year and more, the crisis has been creating conditions in which these capacities are being physically destroyed. The cause is inflation, which in December 1992 surpassed the 50% mark, in July 1993, the 60% mark, and in December 1993, the 90% mark. As we can see, inflation is steadily rising (let us recall that in June 1992, before the beginning of the state "financial and credit narcotization" of enterprises, price growth amounted to only 20%). Inflation, which exceeds 40-50% per month, prevents enterprises from replacing their fixed capital. New construction is completely out of the question. Thus inflation sharply accelerates the rate of production decline, and hyperinflation completely halts structural changes in the economy. A second distinguishing feature of the economic crisis is a step-like [stupenepodibnyy] movement of price levels. These price levels are not rising according to plan; they change at given intervals (every two to three months), increasing each time by a factor of two to three or four to five. We have already experienced seven such increases. This is happening due to the permissive administrative price review procedure, which, in fact, consists of the state establishing prices for most products (officially, two-thirds of all prices). After each price review, business entities and ordinary consumers experience inflationary shock: Their profits, incomes, or earnings prove insufficient to allow them to buy materials and goods as well as services in the same volumes as they were able to afford earlier. This leads to sociopolitical explosions and conflicts, strikes, meetings, hunger strikes, etc., that take place in the same sequence as the price hikes. [Boxed item: - The budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be higher than in the first half of 1993 and will amount to 35-40\ - of total expenditures. - Within half a year, the exchange rate of the karbovanets will fall to 180,000-190,000 to the U.S. dollar. - Production decreases will result in mass unemployment in the first half of 1994. An increase in emigration should be expected.] On the one hand, this phasal inflation disturbs the financial proportions that have formed since the preceding price increase and strips enterprises of their working capital and banks of adequate amounts of credit resources. This leads to mass nonpayments and blockages in goods turnover. On the other hand, it is impossible to achieve a balance between the money supply and the supply of goods: after the new prices are set, the total value of goods exceeds the amount of available means of payment. After a while, when enterprise and personal incomes are compensated by government emission and the fixed prices lag behind the growth of the money supply, the supply of goods becomes insufficient. From that moment on, both producer and consumer goods become scarce and disappear from the state trade network. The third "national" feature of the economic crisis in Ukraine is the unwarranted falling of the living standard, which has now lasted more than three years. During this period, average real incomes have decreased nearly 45% (at a time when earnings have been growing in many neighboring countries -- Russia, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). As a result of this trend, economic sectors that serve the consumer are collapsing. Thus, according to our estimates, consumer services have shrunk by 70%, the physical volume of state trade -- by 45%, the food industry -- by 40%, the output of milk products -- by 50%, and the output of clothing and footwear -- by 55%. The falling living standard leads directly to the shrinking of the domestic market and a further recession among goods-manufacturing enterprises due to a reduced demand for their products. If we take into account that personal savings have virtually melted away (the amount remaining in banks, calculated in real terms, has decreased ten-twelvefold), then effective consumer demand has decreased more than 2.2-2.4-fold. There are two main reasons why the living standard is falling: a) the large-scale redistribution of monetary revenues through budgetary and banking mechanisms to benefit the raw-materials branches of industry and the military-industrial complex, and b) the large, disproportionate export of capital abroad (both to the West and to Russia) by export enterprises, which then conceal their foreign currency earnings abroad (only some 20% of this sum returned to Ukraine in 1993). These are the "national" characteristics of the methods of financial and currency regulation used by our government. This three-sided financial background of the economic crisis in Ukraine (hyperinflation, step-like [stupenepodibni] changes in price levels, and decreasing consumer purchasing power) not only blocks the action of internal stimuli and economic growth, but increasingly undermines the economy and causes the level of production to decline even further. We can predict that in the next few months hyperinflation will also accelerate the drop in the production of goods for domestic consumption. In addition, the vigorous outflow of foreign currency will continue (as a result of the import restrictions introduced by the Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government and the worsening domestic economic conditions). Consequently, personal incomes in Ukraine will continue to drop in 1994. The Nature of the Course of the Crisis Today's production decline in Ukraine is not accompanied by positive structural changes -- in other words, the crisis is producing no healing effects. What is more, the impact of the principal tendencies of the crisis is destructive to the economy. First, the decline of obsolete traditional industries is not taking place at an accelerated rate; the output volumes of these industries are falling at the same rate as the rate for industry as a whole. Modern industries and technologies are either not being widely introduced, or the scale on which they are being assimilated and are functioning is not expanding. This is blocking the structural changes that could vitalize the rate of growth of the economy as a whole and ultimately reduce the energy- and material-output ratio in industry, agriculture, and transport. Second, the functioning national capital is not being transformed from production into financial form: enterprises and private citizens are not placing their money in bank deposits or investing it in securities, but are rushing to exchange it for goods. In addition, there is an increased demand for money, above all, bank credits (which, as a rule, is a characteristic feature of the stage in which an economy is growing and not of the stage in which it is declining). A financial system in this condition means that existing production is conserved rather than modernized. No sources of investment into new branches and kinds of activity emerge in society. Third, there is no growth in output in those branches of the economy which produce goods and services for the population -- in other words, in the sphere in which the socialist system continually recreated a supply deficit. Instead, these are the very sectors in which production decline is greatest. As long as this trend continues, Ukraine is doomed to high inflation due to a chronic shortage of goods and to a continued decline in the gross domestic product (because of the reduced capacity of the domestic market). At the same time, it should be noted that certain structural changes are taking place, even though these changes are not yet positive. The greatest structural changes are occurring in branches that export most of their products and services and in branches that are geared towards internal Ukrainian consumption. Those in the first category quite naturally enjoy greater opportunities and strive to make the most of them. There is almost no production decline in these branches (primarily oil refining, metallurgy, the chemical industry, shipbuilding, and sea, aviation, and motor vehicle transport), and they pay the highest wages. However, so far, this trend is not promoting economic stabilization, because there is no return of income from exports. In fact, capital is being exported at the same time that there is an acute shortage of domestic investments. Only if the recovery of funds from exports is ensured (by increasing or at least maintaining the present levels of exports) will these structural changes promote stabilization of both finances and domestic production as a whole. If this does not happen, the domestic market will soon become so denuded that virtually all branches involving investment or consumer specialization will come to a halt. A second, rather significant structural change stems from the process of a partial reorientation on the part of exporters away from the east and towards the west. This has happened, primarily, because of a reduced demand among Russian buyers (as a result of the same kind of crisis as ours and the beginning of a structural reorganization of the Russian economy, and its demilitarization in particular), and, secondly, because of the growing attraction of selling in countries with a stable and convertible currency and stable and predictable sociopolitical conditions. The consequences of this reorientation must not be assessed one-sidedly. From the standpoint of current benefits and conditions of domestic economic stabilization, this reorientation must be regarded as positive, but in terms of the long-range interests of Ukrainian enterprises, such excessive turning to new markets can lead to negative consequences because of territorial remoteness, an already satisfied demand, or smaller arket capacities in other regions. The third and most important structural change is taking place along the line that divides the dynamics of output volumes in the state and private sectors of the national economy. As we know, the former is experiencing an absolute decrease, while the latter is experiencing an absolute increase. This might lead one to conclude that the revival of the national economy can only be achieved through the efforts of the new, nonstate enterprises. But this conclusion is premature. Today's private sector is made up primarily of nonindustrial capital, and growth in this sector does not result in the overall improvement of the economy and a rise in personal incomes. Only after financial stabilization is achieved will the ctive investment of private capital in industry, agriculture, and the building industry become possible. If inflation is not curbed, the outstripping growth of turnover in the private sector and the increasingly higher income levels of employees in private enterprises will create an ever widening gap between people employed in the private sector and the incomes of those working at state enterprises. This is a detonator for future social disaffection. Moreover, the structural reorganization of the economy solely on the new private sector is possible only if a large number of state-owned enterprises proclaim bankruptcy. On the one hand, this would cause huge economic losses, and on the other hand, it would prolong the period of transformation by many decades. Neither society nor the state would survive this. From a long-range standpoint, the current crisis is also dangerous in that it threatens to worsen the quality of manpower resources by greatly reducing financing of the humanitarian fields -- education, health care, culture, science, and environmental protection. The objective conditions causing this decrease in financing (reduced budget revenues due to a drop in profitability of enterprises and in personal incomes) is multiplied by subjective factors (an ineffective taxation system, the distribution of budget funds to benefit other sectors, discrimination of the nonstate humanitarian sector, etc.). If the future brings with it a deficit of skills, morality, and professionalism, it will be more difficult to revive and rearm the economy and enable it to become more competitive. A Look into the Near Future The disastrous hyperinflationary background and the falling living standard in Ukraine are hindering forces capable of halting the production decline. As a result, the ruination of the economy will continue and the point at which a reversal of the crisis can occur will become increasingly lower. This will last as long as the described destructive processes are not overcome. Taking into account what has been said above, we should examine the opportunities that will emerge in 1994. The country's main tasks are to reduce the budget deficit and to end unproductive state spending and financing of losses and mismanagement. In addition, one of the most urgent goals is to expand exports and increase hard currency earnings. Unfortunately, the plan and budget documents of the Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government put in doubt the prospects for a successful accomplishment of the listed tasks. We can assume that the budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be higher than in the first half of 1993 and ill amount to 35-40% of total expenditures. This assumption is based on the fact that budget revenues will decrease due to tax increases, as well as due to declining production volume and profitability. The acting government's regulation for the administrative confiscation from enterprises of their foreign currency earnings at an artificially low rate of exchange will further weaken Ukraine's export potential. This will substantially reduce the volume of raw materials and goods bought from Russia and increase the trade balance deficit with Russia to approximately three billion dollars. The administrative confiscation of foreign currency, along with artificial bureaucratic restrictions (licensing, higher tariffs) on imports, will force the holders of foreign currency to evade bringing these funds back to Ukraine. Obviously, the amount kept out of the country will grow by another two to three billion dollars. This will lower the exchange rate of the karbovanets even further: in a half year's time it will fall to 180,000-190,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar. One can therefore conclude that in the next few months of 1994, the rate of inflation will not fall below the 65% mark per month. This will prevent the emergence of conditions conducive to technological modernization and to positive structural changes. Now should we expect the current Cabinet of Ministers to make any large-scale attempts to introduce new organizational forms of managing enterprises, including privatization. Given these conditions, the rate of production decline cannot be slowed in 1994. It can be stated with certainty that during the first six months of this year, the decline of the gross domestic product will remain at 15-20%. Inflation will take the form of continually repeated -- every two to three months -- one-time administrative prices increases by 300-400% each time. At the same time, we should expect an increase in emissions by the National Bank, which in the first half of 1994 will cumulatively increase nearly tenfold. This situation will further destabilize the system of payments and settlement of accounts between enterprises. In light of an even greater drop in production, many enterprises will be forced to shut down. In the first half of 1994 alone, these closures will make mass unemployment a reality. Workers will be deprived of the opportunity to receive even a minimum wage. We can also expect an increase in emigration. The further disparity between the rise in the prices of goods and services and increases in wages, pensions, and financial aid will substantially lower the living standard of the people. There will be an especially sharp drop in the real incomes of those who are paid from the budget and the pension fund, because contributions to these will decrease. The level of financing of defense, the state administration, and institutions in the social sphere will drop. If we do not manage to halt these processes in the second half of 1994, the very statehood of Ukraine will be threatened.
