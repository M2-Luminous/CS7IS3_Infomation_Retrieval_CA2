On a public occasion the other day, when asked by the press to confirm the rumor, Cui Songming [1508 7313 2494], deputy chief of the culture and sports department of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: The mainland has not at any stage implemented a restrictive policy on filmmaking, but has merely reiterated the original rules that Hong Kong and Taiwan filmmakers must abide by the mainland's code of practice if they are to make films on the mainland and refrain from cheating the censor by submitting scripts that are different from those that are really to be used; and that all films must pass the censors of the Film Industry Administration [FIA] before being shown publicly or entered in international film festivals. But Cui Songming also admitted that the mainland should work out explicit regulations for film and television circles to go by, so as to avoid confusion. It has been learned that the rumor about the mainland authorities "tightening control on filmmaking" first came from a report in Beijing's ZHONGGUO WENHUA BAO [CHINA CULTURE POST]. The paper quoted an official source as saying that, because some Hong Kong and Taiwan film companies had not honored the mainland's rules while making films on the mainland and caused many problems last year, the control on joint production will be tightened this year, including reducing the number of films produced in conjunction with overseas film companies and banning the establishment of joint-venture institutions and independent film production companies run by Chinese. According to the paper, the mainland authorities set the quantity of films to be produced nationwide this year at 150, of which the number of jointly produced ones will be kept under 30 (54 for last year), and the productions must pass censorship by the FIA before public showing. Afterward, a number of newspapers and journals in Hong Kong published the "FIA Provisional Regulations on Strengthening the Joint Production of Films," which the mainland had not officially promulgated. They revealed the following information: The ceiling on jointly produced films set by the mainland authorities for this year is 30, with large, medium, and small film studios nationwide receiving quotas of three, two, or one. The FIA is demanding that each studio follow the principle of "mainly relying on ourselves" and that all projects of Chinese-foreign cooperation must be carried out by the procedure of "application," "listing," and "examination and approval" and must be subjected to the control of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television [MORFT]. The film authorities should establish a strict and tight contract management system. The shooting and last-phase production of a jointly produced film must be consistent with the approved script. Last-phase production must be conducted on the territory of China. The authority of final judgment on Chinese-foreign jointly produced films lies with the MORFT. Films that have not passed censorship may not be shown in the territory or be entered in any film festival or exhibition. In the production team of each Chinese-foreign jointly produced film, leading members from the mainland side must make up a certain percentage, below which the film shall be considered a foreign production with Chinese assistance (i.e., a film mainly produced by an overseas studio, assisted by a mainland studio). Around this time, FIA Director Teng Jinxian made this remark: "Our principle has not changed. Films may take various artistic forms, but they must emphasize the theme." The "theme" refers to "patriotism, heroism, and collectivism." The mainland authorities have always emphasized the ideological and didactic value of films, so it is not strange that they have specified the above-mentioned requirements. The recent ban on "Beijing Bastard [bei jing za zhong 0554 0079 7177 4429]," "Blue Kite," "Soul of Painting [hua hun 3973 7609]," and "Farewell to My Concubine" and the ban on "Judou" and "Raise the Red Lantern" of two years ago probably were imposed because the authorities thought these films did not meet those requirements. However, for various reasons, the box office returns for mainland films has been steadily deteriorating in recent years, which has spurred the interest of film studios in joining hands with film companies outside China, with a view to improving their performance at the box office. In 1982, China had only two Chinese-foreign jointly produced films. The number rose to six in 1986 and then jumped ahead by a large margin to over 30 in 1992. In 1993, the number of jointly produced films reached 54. Joint production has become very popular because studios have no financial risks. They have a saying: "We spend no money during production; we make money after production -- even if we do not make money, at least we do not lose money ." However, because the production process and guiding ideology of Hong Kong films are very different from mainland films, many problems have emerged. For example, the mainland attaches great importance to the script, and a director must strictly follow the censored script, while Hong Kong directors and producers do not pay much attention to the script and often revise it as they move on in the process of shooting, changing the content of the completed production beyond recognition. Another example is that nudity and sex scenes may not appear in a mainland film, but Hong Kong films often use them as a "commercial factor" to improve box office returns. Hence, there are two version of each film, a chaste one which is handed in to the mainland censors and another with additional sequences which will be shown in Hong Kong and overseas. "Li Lianying the Eunuch" and "Temptation of a Monk" belong in this category. Another film, "Dragon Out of the Sea [jiao long chu hai 5754 7893 0427 3189]," even contained additional anti-communist lines when shown abroad. This is where the criticism of "not abiding by the mainland regulations" came from. "To Live," a Chinese-foreign jointly produced film which has recently become a topic of discussion, was also entered in the Cannes Film Festival without being censored by the mainland authorities, thus causing dispute between the two sides.
