FBIS3-14012 "drnes055__s94062" FBIS-NES-94-055-S Document Type:Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 INDIAN VIEWS Kashmiri Refugees Claim Government Ignorant of Plight 94AS0221D Calcutta THE STATESMAN in English 3 Mar 94 p 6 94AS0221D Calcutta THE STATESMAN Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Bombay, March 2--Panun Kashmir, an organization of refugee Kashmiri Hindus, has criticized India's defence of the Kashmir issue at international forums, saying it was from "a very low level of moral credibility" as the country has been continuously changing its perception and projection of the problem. Demanding that India cut off diplomatic relations with Pakistan, the organization suggested that the Union Home Ministry entertain human rights bodies other than Amnesty International and Asia Watch which, they claim, are biased. Following their return from the UN Human Rights Conference in Geneva, leaders of the organization addressed a press conference here today. The spokesman, Mr. Ajay Chungroo, claimed there was evidence to suggest that Pakistan and the ISI [Inter-Service Intelligence of Pakistan] were involved in terrorist activities in this country. Even the Home Ministry, he claimed, had admitted as much. Mr. Chungroo had presented a paper--on behalf of the Indian Institute for Non-Aligned Studies--on the minority and refugee status of Kashmiri Hindus at the conference, the first time the issue had been discussed at this level. Another member of the delegation, Mr. Moti Kaul, said the overall impression was that most delegates were ignorant of the real issues in Kashmir and he blamed the Indian Government for this. He claimed that Panun Kashmir was doing the job of the Government but added, "We are not stooges." Mr. Kaul claimed that Pandits were victims of the Government's policy on Kashmir. "Even today, between 250,000 and 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits forced to flee the State are living in sub-human conditions, refugees in their own homeland. And we thought it was time the international community was made aware of this," Mr. Kaul said. While stating that they did not want to be "hostages of Indian secularism in Kashmir," Mr. Chungroo said that the fundamentalist-terrorist problem was spreading to Jammu. He criticized the Prime Minister for not visiting any of the refugee camps, not even those in New Delhi. "We are asking for our own territory, yes, but in such a way that we have greater integration with the country. We went to Geneva because we have India's interests at heart." The members felt that India should not wait for the United States to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. The United States, they said, had its own agenda and sought "more direct involvement in the territorial problem for its own reasons." Criticizing the Government's inconsistent stand on Pakistan, Mr. Chungroo said: "It just can't go on. Instead of waiting for the United States we must demonstrate our firmness and cut off diplomatic ties." Both Mr. Chungroo and Mr. Kaul were critical of the "excessive importance given by India to the Amnesty International and Asia Watch reports on human rights abuses. They questioned the reports that the abuses began in 1989 and pointed out that these organizations admitted that the scope of their investigations was limited. Amnesty, they said, had stated that it examined human rights violations by the state, but they wondered who examined those committed by terrorists. "When we asked why they did not visit the refugee camps in Delhi even after they were provided the addresses last year, they said `No time,'" Mr. Chungroo said. The organization expressed disappointment that the resolution adopted by Parliament recently did not mention the refugee problem of Kashmiri Pandits and blamed all political parties for their perception of and approach to the problem. "Even the BJP because it is unable to go beyond the Article 370 issue," Mr. Chungroo said. They were confident, however, that the Centre's attempts to encourage Dr Farooq Abdullah's participation would backfire as "he is one of those who advocates autonomy" for Kashmir. *
