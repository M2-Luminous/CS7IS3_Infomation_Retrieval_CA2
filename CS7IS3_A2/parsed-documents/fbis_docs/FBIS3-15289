Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Committee for Defense, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] [Text] [Correspondent] Your committee is composed of representatives from various factions; do you think that you will be successful in coming to positive decisions with such a mix? [Yushenkov] We all have one aim -- legislative support of reliable Russian defense. In this sense, I think that by building on reality and Russian practices and traditions we will be able to work out mutually acceptable decisions. We must realistically address the situation which has developed. The situation is such that troops, the army in general, [pauses, changes thought] many army units are stationed outside the borders of the Russian Federation and are participating in such things as peacekeeping duties. Whether I, or others, like it or not, it is a fact. Servicemen serving abroad need legislation to feel that they are really protected in the social and legal sense. [Correspondent] Will you comment on the work of the commission appointed to investigate the events of 3-4 October, 1993. [Yushenkov] As a former member of a similar commission appointed to investigate the events of 19-21 August, I remember its activities well. Regardless of the fact the Supreme Soviet in the past had more authority and opportunity than the present State Duma, the decisions of that commission did not have any significant influence on the processes going on in society. In fact, they did not avert the repeat of the putsch. I am coming to believe that these types of commissions -- when there is an investigation and the State Duma has no clearly prescribed role in the investigation -- cannot undertake, adopt, or in any way influence what happens in society. [Correspondent] Sergey Nikolayevich, the former Supreme Soviet and old committees, such as the one you served on, adopted quite a number of good laws in principle. Officers are still writing to us about the law on the status of servicemen, in particular, but the problem lies in the fact that these rather good laws are not being implemented. [Yushenkov] If they are not being implemented that means they are not very good. There are two reasons why laws do not work: Either they do not conform to the existing realities in society -- the real state of affairs -- or they lack a mechanism for their implementation. We have already started a careful inventory of all ineffectual laws, separate clauses, and statutes to determine the reason why such regulations do not work. We will strive to either abolish the regulation, make it conform to reality, or structure a mechanism for its implementation. [Correspondent] I understand. [Yushenkov] The issue which you raised earlier even now has great significance, the essence of which is that we need to clearly define the type of army we want to build.
