Noting that the New Year address powerfully inspired the party members and other officials of the commission responsible for the development of the nation's light industry, he said: "We will conduct the party work in a fresh and ambitious manner as demanded by the chuche-based theory and method of party work so as to make a positive contribution to carrying into a brilliant reality the far-reaching plans and intentions of President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il."

"Our county will produce 50,000 more tons of grain than last year by cultivating crops as required by the chuche farming method." Han Chang-kon, vice-chairman of the State Commission of the Electric Power Industry, said: "It is a task before the officials and working people of our electric power industry to strongly support the party's strategic agriculture-first, light-industry-first and foreign trade-first policy with an increased production of power. "We officials of power industry will launch a powerful production drive, giving precedence to the political work in accordance with the requirements of the Taean work system and thus make a better contribution to making the party's revolutionary economic strategy bear fine fruits."
