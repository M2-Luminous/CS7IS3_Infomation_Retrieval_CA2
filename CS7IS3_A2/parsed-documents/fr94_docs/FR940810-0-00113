FR940810-0-00113 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA believes the Wickman report is the most complete study available concerning custodial exposures. Because the study was submitted into the record after the close of the post-hearing comment periods, OSHA is not relying on it to prove the extent of exposures anticipated in most custodial work. Rather, OSHA views the Wickman study as confirming its view that Class IV activities result in reduced exposure and thus, reduced risk compared to activities of other classes. Because maintenance work involving active ``disturbances'' is Class III work, the ``contact'' with ACM which constitutes Class IV work will be either with intact materials, or in cleaning-up debris from friable material or from material which has been disturbed. The latter activities present the higher risk potential. OSHA acknowledges that evidence of asbestos disease among school custodians and maintenance workers has been submitted to this record (See e.g., references cited in SEIU's post hearing brief, Ex. 144). The Agency believes that significant exposures to custodians result from Class III work or when they clean up accumulations of friable material. Therefore, these revisions contain several requirements aimed at reducing custodial exposures when cleaning up asbestos debris and waste material. OSHA believes that the work practices and precautions prescribed in these regulations will virtually eliminate significant health risks for custodial workers, and will cure any confusion about which protections and which standards will apply to custodial worker (see submission of SEIU, Ex. 144). Custodial work is covered in all three standards. Housekeeping provisions in the general industry standard, paragraph (k), cover custodians in public and commercial buildings, in manufacturing and other industrial facilities, where construction activity is not taking place. To avoid confusion, and to cover clean-up, and other housekeeping on construction sites, which properly is covered under the construction standard, similar ``housekeeping'' provisions are included in the construction and shipyard standards as well (Paragraph (1). These housekeeping provisions are discussed separately. The specific provisions in paragraph (g), relating to Class IV work in the construction standard relate to construction work only, and are not necessarily limited to housekeeping. Like all other construction work, competent person supervision of Class IV work is required, exposure assessments of clean-up of waste and debris, and use of HEPA filtered vacuums, in paragraph (g)(1) apply. Particular requirements were adopted in response to concerns of some participants. These are paragraph (g)(9) which requires specific awareness training for Class IV workers. Under the 1986 standard, training was not required unless employees were exposed above the action level, then 0.1 f/cc. Two labor organizations representing employees who perform Class IV work, SEIU and AFSCME, and other participants, (see e.g., Ex. 141, 144), noted that custodial workers needed training, separate from other building service workers, such as maintenance workers (Ex. 141 at 49), generally referred to as ``awareness training.'' The record shows the lack of awareness that material contained asbestos contributed to asbestosis (Tr. 959 ff). Paragraph (g)(9) of the construction and shipyard standards requires that Class IV asbestos jobs be performed by employees trained according to the awareness training set out in the training section, (k)(8). The general industry standard, also requires that employees who work in areas where ACM or PACM is present, also be so trained, in paragraph (j). In addition, paragraph (g) requires employees cleaning up waste and debris in a regulated area where respirators are required to be worn to also wear respirators. This restatement of the provision in paragraph (e)(4) relating to regulated areas emphasizes that clean-up workers in large-scale jobs must wear respirators, even though the actual removal is completed. Paragraph (g)(g)(iv) offers significant protection to custodians. As pointed out by participants, custodians have swept up ``insulation debris which had fallen to the floor because it was so badly deteriorated *␣*␣* with no knowledge or concern about asbestos hazards *␣*␣*'' (see testimony of Ervin Arp at Tr. 962&hyph;969). This new provision requires that ``(e)mployees cleaning up waste and debris in an area where friable TSI and surfacing ACM is accessible, shall assume that such waste and debris contains high-risk ACM. Since paragraph (k) requires that such ACM and PACM be visibly labelled, OSHA believes that custodial workers will be spared the consequences of being required to clean-up unidentified materials, which in fact contain asbestos.
