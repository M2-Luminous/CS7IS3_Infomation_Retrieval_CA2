In the opinion of Russian diplomats, a turning point in Pyongyang's policy emerged during the talks at deputy foreign minister level held in Moscow. Dialogue between Moscow and Pyongyang came to a standstill in 1990, when diplomatic relations were established between the USSR and South Korea -- a state which is still not recognized in the North. The DPRK accused Mikhail Gorbachev of "selling out to the puppets in Seoul for $3 billion and betraying true friends." Since the collapse of the Union and the appearance of new leaders in Moscow the North Korean leadership has maintained the utmost coldness in relations with Russia. Nina Andreyeva and Lyudmila Zykina have become the most cherished visitors in Pyongyang. Now, when North Korea is under pressure from the United States and its allies, who are demanding that nuclear programs be brought out into the open, Pyongyang is solely reliant on the support of China, its traditional ally. Moscow's attempts to act as mediator in the nuclear dispute had so far been rejected by the North Koreans. However, at these recent talks there was a shift in Pyongyang's stance. As IZVESTIYA was informed by Valentin Moiseyev, department leader in the Russian Foreign Ministry, for the first time the North Korean side made a positive assessment of Moscow's initiative to hold an international conference on questions of the security and nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula with the participation of Russia, the United States, China, Japan, the DPRK, South Korea, and representatives of the UN secretary general and of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Moscow diplomats want to ensure that Russia has the opportunity to influence the situation. Moscow is very concerned by the fact that the United States is threatening the DPRK with international economic sanctions. It will be Russia, which maintains trading and economic links with North Korea, which will have to pay the price here, and not the United States, which has no such links. It is important, according to our diplomats, to maintain balanced, friendly relations with both North and South Korea. A clear tilt toward Seoul has now emerged. The talks did not touch on questions of military-technical cooperation. However, according to available information, Russian Defense Ministry circles do not rule out the possibility in the first instance of supplying the North Korean Army with spare parts for its military hardware: The bulk of the equipment in the DPRK is Soviet-made. Our military experts think that it will thereby be possible to obtain additional levers of influence on the North Korean leadership. Meanwhile Russian diplomats continue trying to persuade the North Koreans of the need to observe the requirements stemming from the Treaty on the Nonproliferetion of Nuclear Weapons. The latest attempts were made during the last consultations. They were unsuccessful.
