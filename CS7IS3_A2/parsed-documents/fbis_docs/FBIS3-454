This meant Gen Constand Viljoen's registration of the Freedom Front would lapse if no list of candidates was submitted by Wednesday, and the AVF would continue to set up democratic alternative structures to secure a volkstaat [homeland], he said. But reports and AVF sources said there was agitation for rightwing participation in the elections. Reacting to the Bophuthatswana cabinet's decision to follow the AVF's example and boycott the election, Mr Jacobs said: "I am not surprised." The AVF's transitional representative council would meet soon to adopt the AVF's constitution and finalise the volkstaat's borders, he said. AVF Directorate member Gen Tienie Groenewald on Monday ruled out participation in the elections "at this stage". He told Radio 702 that due to Saturday's majority decision to boycott the elections: "There is no doubt that the AVF will at this stage not participate in the elections." He rejected talk of AVF participation in the polls as speculation and issued a statement saying suggestions to this effect were aimed at driving a wedge in rightwing ranks. There was lively debate in the AVF on the strategy to attain an Afrikaner volkstaat, he conceded. In spite of differences on how to attain a volkstaat, he said, unity among Afrikaners was paramount. "If there is a split in our basis then our aim (of a volkstaat) is not attainable." "We must find a way to prove our support. We'd hoped for a plebiscite or a referendum (to determine support and establish the borders of a volkstaat) but that had not been agreed to by the government," Gen Groenewald told the radio station. The AVF sources said on Monday that pro-election elements in the rightwing front argued that participation in the polls would not constitute an endorsement of the interim constitution or that they wanted to become part of the new South Africa. "Participation would merely be to determine support and the borders for a volkstaat and to show the world that we have broad support for an Afrikaner homeland." Emerging from Saturday's transitional assembly meeting Gen Viljoen, defeated by hardliners, told a news conference that "absolutely nothing would change the AVF's mind not to participate in the elections unless there was finality on the volkstaat itself". AVF spokesman Stephen Maninger on Monday said he was not aware of an alleged plot to assassinate Gen Viljoen. Mr Maninger said the AVF's standpoint remained that people should boycott the election, but should people insist on voting, they should not support the National Party, which, he said, was trying to gain rightwing votes through scare tactics.
