FR940314-2-00121 FR940314-2-00064 PTC continued its efforts over the past year to implement operational and procedural changes in connection with PTC's temporary registration. 10 For example, PTC acquired rights to the SPEED source code, thereby facilitating the process of enhancing the SPEED system to suit PTC's needs. PTC also initiated a program to distribute to participants a portion of GNMA I principal and interest (``P&I'') earlier in the day, 11 and in December 1993, introduced a new P&I processing system, PRISM, that further automates P&I data processing. PTC was able to reduce its fees to participants further, effective January 1, 1994, 12 and declared a dividend of $.525 per share to stockholders of record on December 31, 1993. 13 10 In connection with PTC's original temporary registration, PTC committed to the Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make a number of operational and procedural changes, which include: (1) Eliminating trade reversals from PTC's procedures to cover a participant default; (2) Phasing out the aggregate excess net debit limitation for extensions under the net debit monitoring level procedures; (3) Making principal and interest advances, now mandatory, optional; (4) Allowing participants to retrieve securities in the abeyance account and not allowing participants to reverse a transfer because its customer may not be able to fulfill its financial obligations to the participant. (5) Eliminating the deliverer's security interest and replacing it with a substitute; (6) Reexamining PTC's account structure rules to make them consistent with PTC's lien procedures; (7) Expanding and diversifying PTC's lines of credit; (8) Assuring operational integrity by developing and constructing a back-up facility; and (9) Reviewing PTC rules and procedures for consistency with current operations. Supra note 4. 11 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33132 (November 2, 1993), 58 FR 59501. 12 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33362 (December 21, 1993), 58 FR 69433. 13 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33487 (January 18, 1994), 59 FR 3900. Although PTC has made considerable progress toward complying with the undertakings set out above, PTC needs more time to implement fully the changes necessary for compliance. Accordingly, PTC has requested that the Commission extend PTC's registration as a clearing agency until March 31, 1995, to permit PTC to gain experience and stability as a fully operative depository and to comply fully with the undertakings made in connection with PTC's registration. 14 14 Supra note 2. The Commission believes that PTC continues to meet the determinations enumerated in section 17A(b)(3). PTC has facilitated the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of mortgage-backed securities. PTC has functioned as a clearing agency for the past four years in compliance with the Act. It is therefore ordered, that PTC's temporary registration as a clearing agency be, and hereby is, extended until March 31, 1995, subject to the terms, undertakings, and conditions specified in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26671. 15 15 Supra note 4. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegated authority. 16 16 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(50) (1992). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
