The conference is scheduled for April 2 to coincide with a city conference of the Russian Communist Party. According to Chernyakhovsky, the initiative was supported by representatives of the Union of Communists, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Lenin Opposition in the Russian Communist Party (Richard Kosolapov). "The separation from the Russian Communist Party is final," he said. Meanwhile the Russian Communist Party headed by Gennadiy Zyuganov gained 12 per cent of votes at the recent elections and formed a major parliament faction, more orthodox parties and organizations who called for boycotting the elections are fighting for survival. In the words of Chernyakhovskiy, there are two reasons for differences between the Communist Party leadership and "other Communists". Firstly, in the opinion of orthodox communists, Zyuganov and his associates "have taken a conciliatory stand, abandoned communist principles and turned nationalistic". Secondly, the Russian Communist Party does not want to be "part of the Soviet Communist Party" and refuses to encourage double membership of Communists in the two organizations. Chernyakhovsky said the organizational committee will be supported by no less than one fourth of Moscow rank-and-file communists as well as many Communists in Russian regions. He thinks it may become the basis for a single Communist organization, an alternative to the Russian Communist Party. "It is the apogee mutation of the left-wing communists," member of the Russian Communist Party's Central Executive Committee Grigory Rebrov told ITAR-TASS today, commenting on the organizational committee. "It is a sectarian, left-wing force that has failed to unite with the Communist movement and made the last step towards a split. They have no future," he added.
