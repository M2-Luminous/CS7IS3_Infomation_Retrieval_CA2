A survey conducted by the Regional Health Administration between 1989 and 1993 indicates that 32 percent of ward admissions are due to malaria infection while the Out-Patient Department (OPD) admissions account for 52.3 percent. This was made known by Dr. Sylvester Anemana, acting Regional Director of Health Services at the launching of the Regional Malaria Control Programme at Tamale yesterday. He said inadequate medical staff is a major constraint in the control of malaria. He explained that the cash and carry system is also making some districts not to sustain regular drug supply while there is irrational drug prescription resulting in drug abuse by chemical sellers. Dr. Anemana said a regional plan of action to address the situation would include in-service training for staff towards proper diagnosis and treatment of malaria, provision of equipment and raising of the capital base of districts for more effective drug supply. Dr. Anemana said public health education is to be intensified and under a pilot project, impregnated bed-nets are to be used as a measure to protect the individual from mosquito bites. If it proves successful, it would be extended to other districts. Mr. Gilbert Iddi, Deputy Regional Minister of Agriculture who was the guest speaker expressed regret that health care delivery only reaches about 30 percent of the population in the Northern Region. Mr. Baba Ibrahima, Tamale Municipal Secretary, urged the health staff to devote time and energy in educating the people to adopt preventive measures against malaria attacks.
