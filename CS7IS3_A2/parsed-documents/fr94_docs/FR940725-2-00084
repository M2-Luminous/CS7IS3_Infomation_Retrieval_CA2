FR940725-2-00084 FR940725-2-00053 [Docket No. 92&hyph;86] Harold S. Stinson, D.O.; Grant of Restricted Registration On August 18, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Harold S. Stinson, D.O. (Respondent), of Key Largo, Florida, proposing to deny his pending application for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for reason that his registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4). Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Miami, Florida on March 11, 1993. On January 25, 1994, in her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision, the administrative law judge recommended that the Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration be granted, subject to certain restrictions. No exceptions were filed by either party. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent received his doctor of osteopathy degree from Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1957 and following a one-year internship, went into practice with another physician in Eureka, Missouri. Five years later, Respondent established a solo practice which he maintained until about 1985, and was board certified in family practice in 1974. On May 2, 1985, a DEA Special Agent along with local police officers, arrested an individual on an outstanding warrant following her indictment for forging prescriptions for Dilaudid, a Schedule II controlled substance. The individual later informed the Special Agent that between 1979 and 1982, she purchased Dilaudid from the Respondent approximately 50 times; that between 150 and 200 people received drugs illegally from the Respondent; and that she owed Respondent $2,000 for the drugs that she had purchased. Following her arrest, the individual agreed to attempt to make a controlled purchase of Dilaudid from the Respondent. On June 7, 1985, the individual attempted without success to purchase Dilaudid from the Respondent. During the visit, the individual offered to pay Respondent $500 on her outstanding debt, however, Respondent indicated that he did not want to have any further dealings with the individual. Nevertheless, he agreed to meet with her at a future date, and the individual assured the Respondent that she would pay back the $2,000 debt that she owed him in installments. On June 15, 1985, the individual met with Respondent in his car at a restaurant, where Respondent sold the individual 100 Dilaudid for $2,000. The individual also paid the Respondent an additional $1,000 as payment on her prior debt. During the meeting, Respondent admitted to the individual that after being audited with respect to his dispensing of Dilaudid, he was able to falsify his dispensing records because one of his patients failed to keep records of how much Dilaudid she received or purchased from Respondent, and therefore, Respondent could ascribe drugs to her that he in fact provided to others. On June 17, 1985, the individual met Respondent at his office where she purchased 100 Dilaudid for $2,000, and paid the final $1,000 of her debt. During this meeting, the individual informed the Respondent of a friend from Philadelphia that could help make the Respondent's drug transactions more profitable. On August 2, 1985, the individual again met the Respondent at a restaurant where she purchased 80 Dilaudid for $2,000. The individual again mentioned her friend from Philadelphia, and Respondent agreed to contact the individual the following week. On August 27, 1985, the individual and a DEA Special Agent, posing as her friend from Philadelphia, purchased 98 Dilaudid from the Respondent for $2,940. During the conversation, Respondent mentioned that police officers had come to his house in response to a burglary alarm and had seen a military rifle equipped with a silencer. In September 1985 a search warrant was executed at Respondent's office, in which his records were seized, as well as, a silencer in a desk drawer. On January 23, 1986, the Respondent was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on four counts of unlawful distribution of Dilaudid, three counts of making false statements on Federal income tax returns, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Following a jury trial, Respondent was convicted of the counts pertaining to distribution of Dilaudid and possession of an illegal firearm, and was acquitted on the tax counts. On October 3, 1986, Respondent was sentenced to six years incarceration on each of the drug charges to run concurrently, and two years on the firearm charge to run consecutively, for a total of eight years. Respondent was further sentenced to serve a special parole term of five years and to pay a $40,000 fine, and two of his vehicles were forfeited. On December 9, 1986, Respondent surrendered his DEA registration.
