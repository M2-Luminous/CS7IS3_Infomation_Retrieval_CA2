FR940324-0-00036 FR940324-0-00016 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265 [FRL&hyph;4852&hyph;9] Recordkeeping Instructions Agency: Environmental Protection Agency. Action: Technical amendment. Summary: EPA is amending recordkeeping instructions in order to match those unit of measurement codes and handling codes used by hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities to report to EPA on the Part A Permit Application Form with the codes used to maintain records on-site by these facilities. This technical amendment also adds additional handling codes to allow for the proper recording of those processes relating to Boilers and Industrial Furnaces and Miscellaneous Units (subpart X) facilities. This amendment will encourage the consistent recordkeeping and reporting of information by hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Effective Date: March 24, 1994. Addresses: All comments concerning this technical amendment should be addressed to Jeffrey Gaines, Assistance Branch, Permits and State Program Division (5303W), Office of Solid Waste, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. For Further Information Contact: Liza Hearns, (202) 260&hyph;3393. Supplementary Information: For several years, the disposal process codes listed in Appendix I of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 have been different from those listed on the Part A Permit Application form. In consultation with State, Regional and Headquarters personnel, it was determined that changing the CFR to match the forms was the appropriate step to take. Therefore, the Office of Solid Waste has prepared this technical amendment to appendix I of 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 to modify those process codes (also referred to as handling codes) listed in the CFR so that they match those codes used on the Part A Permit Application form.
