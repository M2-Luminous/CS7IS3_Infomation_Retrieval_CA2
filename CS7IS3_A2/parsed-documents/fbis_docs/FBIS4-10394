Rothschild Francois filed a report: [Begin Francois recording] By deciding on 10 April to vote for implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Sansaricq intends to implement the closing of the Aristide file and a new beginning; endowing the country with a provisional president chosen from the Court of Cassation; the ratification of a new government; the holding of elections; and the assumption of office by an elected president on 7 February 1995. Long before he became involved in voting for this resolution during the session attended by some political leaders, the president of this Senate office, which is not recognized by the lower chamber, pointed out that he did not expect the sanctions to be lifted this way. Sen. Sansaricq asserts, however, that it is necessary for the country to be led by a conscious, responsible team that could manage the embargo. His colleagues also recommended a serious government capable of assuring the management of the heavy burden of Haiti's economic sanctions. This session on 10 April in the Senate brought together eight senators elected on 18 January and five from the normal office. Four hours of discussion were necessary for the legislators to reach a vote on this resolution leading to Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution. Osny Eugene, elected on 18 January, is the author of this document. In the 10 April resolution, senators from the Alliance and from 18 January equate the refusal of President Aristide to choose a prime minister with his resignation. These senators also decided to revoke the June 1993 decree that restored President Aristide to his functions and to declare and acknowledge the presidential vacuum. For them, Article 149 was unavoidable. [passage omitted] It should be recalled that the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize this office of the Senate of the Republic. [end recording]
