The agreement however, did not include the 60 per cent salary increase demanded by the striking police. The parties agreed most of the allowances would be doubled. The risk allowance had been doubled from R50 [rand] to R100, special duty and plainclothes allowance from R25 to R50, and mountain allowance from R17 to R25. It believed that the leaders of the police strike will reach a compromise agreement with the government following the increased allowances, which will also affect the same categories of officers in the army,. It has been announced that an independent salary commission will be established to review the salary structure for all civil servants. Meanwhile, Lesotho's natural resources minister, Mr Monyane Moleleki, has resigned, according to an announcement broadcast by Radio Lesotho on Thursday. Mr Moleleki's department was responsible for the implementation of the Lesotho Highlands water scheme which will provide water to South Africa. Mr Moleleki fled into neighbouring Orange Free State last week and is now believed to have travelled to Johannesburg.
