In immediate response to the accusations made by the CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] on the Budget, Brazilians are demanding honesty. To offset Itamar Franco's "vacillating" image, the voters want confidence and authority. Tired and frustrated by the failure of the economic plans, they are dreaming of someone capable of applying immediate solutions to the country's crisis. But is there room for surprises? Yes. A military candidate might be able to make the voters' fingers itch on election day. A profile of the new president of the republic--in the minds of voters--was put together last November and defined by political analysts for the Center for Research, Analysis, and Communication (Cepac) in Sao Paulo on the basis of various opinion polls. It has every chance of actually corresponding to the expectations that will greet the candidates who begin their race for Planalto Palace this coming April. In the files of political scientist Rubens Figueiredo of Cepac, who coordinated the project, is an almost prophetic makeup of the profile of the winner in the presidential election of 1989. It was put together four months before Fernando Collor appeared on the scene as a dark horse. At the time--in January 1989--Figueiredo drew the profile of a candidate who was young, identified with the future, free of any ties with old politicians, spoke the people's language, and conveyed an image of honesty and competence. Demanding--In April of that year, the beneficiary of that movement was candidate Fernando Collor de Mello, the former governor of Alagoas. He was young, spoke the language of modernity, was nicknamed "hunter of the high and mighty" by the media, was a relentless accuser of the Sarney administration, and addressed himself to the least privileged class with the expression "my people." He made a qualitative leap in the polls, and his popularity rose steadily. "But voters now are more vigilant and demanding," Figueiredo says. He believes that the purge now under way in Congress as the result of charges of corruption will lead to a high turnover in Congress. "In the last election, only one-third of Congress was reelected," he recalls. He believes that the same thing will happen again. It is also possible that someone unexpected will be reelected, seeing that age, color, and political party will not be essential for winning the election, in the opinion of Paulo Tafner of the Databrasil Research Institute in Rio de Janeiro. He also feels that campaigning on such major issues as the fight against inflation, the creation of jobs, and a more flexible economy will make a bigger impression than minor issues. "If inflation remains high, the scapegoats will be the speculators and the bankers," says Tafner. Tafner also believes that the voters want their elected president to be someone who is balanced, firm, courageous, and willing to "pick fights" on important issues, chiefly with the firmly entrenched politico-economic structures that are preventing real changes in the country. "However, what the voters want is not a troublemaker who will pick fights unnecessarily--someone controversial--but someone decisive who will state the names of those he is accusing." The analysis made by statistician Marco Antonio de Souza Aguiar, director of the Methods Consulting firm in Rio de Janeiro, reaffirms the conclusions drawn by the professionals in the other two firms. He points out that certain qualities may become more important, depending on the political situation. "Honesty has always been a basic characteristic, but because of the scandals, it is being given even more weight today." Corruption Engenders Wave of Morality Brasilia--The CPI looking into budget corruption--established following the wave of morality brought on by the CPI on P.C. Farias--is going to cause a change in the behavior of voters and candidates in the October 1994 elections. That is the opinion of experienced politicians in Congress, where it is widely believed that the voters, immunized by so many scandals since Collor's impeachment, are going to vote with an eye on the candidates' biographies and favor those who have a clean record and are known to the public. "Moralistic talk alone is not going to help; the memory of Collor is still very alive," says Senator Jose Fogaca (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Rio Grande do Sul). "The candidate will have to convey the certainty that he is not a thief and neither are his friends," agrees Senator Mario Covas (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Sao Paulo). Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL [Liberal Front Party], Espirito Santo) says: "The voters will choose those whose public life is almost spotless." Congressmen expect the clamor for morality to result in less campaign spending as well. "There will be more caution in spending money; the current law does not deter the abuse of economic power, but events will prevent excesses," says Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB, Federal District). Deputy Nelson Trad (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], Mato Grosso do Sul) says sarcastically: "The CPI will make politicians look for ways to propagate ideas rather than bank accounts." The discoveries by the CPI on the Budget have created fear that even the innocent will wind up ruined. In the opinion of Senator Elcio Alvares, the people will make a collective condemnation: "There is a burning desire for justice; the people will want to punish, not acquit." Senator Ney Maranhao (PRN [National Reconstruction Party], Pernambuco) agrees with that assessment: "Anyone who sits in the dock is going to take a beating even if he is declared innocent." But there is not unanimous agreement on that point. Senator Fogaca feels that the usual "voter roundups" will occur in the country's backward interior: "It is very possible that Joao Alves' voters are not at all unhappy with the work he has done." Congressmen also feel that the voters will be split between those voting for new congressmen and those casting protest ballots. The vice president of the CPI, Deputy Odacir Klein (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), supports the protest thesis and predicts an increase in the number of blank and void ballots. Robson Tuma (PL [Liberal Party], Sao Paulo) disagrees, saying: "The impetus is in the direction of a general rout of the current Congress." Senator Francisco Rolemberg (PFL, Sergipe) feels that the percentage of new congressmen will be high, as in previous elections, but that this time voters will favor candidates who prove their credibility. He adds that the voters will also choose candidates who are able to sell hope: "Lindberg (former president of the UNE [National Union of Students]) has a message of hope." New Faces May Be Slightly Delayed Belo Horizonte--Historian and political scientist Lucilia de Almeida Neves, the niece of former President Tancredo Neves, does not think there will be an immediate replacement of congressmen in political terms. "The trend is toward morality, toward electing more ethical people, but that by itself is not enough to result in a new Congress," she says, emphasizing that higher moral standards in party politics are what may lead to a new profile for Brazilian politicians. Lucilia Neves points out that politics is more than just ethics: it is also a matter of intention: "What is taking place is a leap in quality: the leap toward transparency," she claims. But on the other hand, she says the switching between parties that we have seen recently, as the deadline for changing parties arrived, shows that there is still plenty of room for personalism. "I feel that the election of new congressmen ought to be more institutional in form," she adds. The historian explains that what seems to signify major chaos may actually signify a major advance. "Clearly stating the problems is a big step forward in itself," she says. In Lucilia's opinion, such things as ethics and honesty will be influential factors for some voters, but they will be especially important to the middle-class voter, who has been looking for a new kind of politician longer than anyone else. One Cycle Follows Another Sao Paulo--The profile of the new politician who will probably emerge from the ballot box in the upcoming elections, as drawn by Gaudencio Torquato, professor of political marketing at the Sao Paulo University School of Communication and Arts (ECA-USP), combines authority, honesty, and other condiments such as culture, administrative ability, and modernity. While admitting that that is the profile of the ideal politician, not of most of them, the professor is optimistic about the new crop that will come out of the upcoming elections. "We are reaching the end of one cycle and starting another," he explains. "The co-opting cycle, based on patronage and cronyism, is fading away because of the wave of morality that is sweeping through society." In Torquato's opinion, the phenomenon in question will occur not only in the big cities but also in the country's interior. "Thanks to television, the moral sweep is also reaching the deep hinterland," he says. Torquato, who is also a political consultant, does not put much faith in polls indicating that 80 percent of the present Congress will be swept out of office. "I feel that it will not be that high," he says. "Probably about 60 percent will lose their seats." Most of the new faces will fit the profile of the politician who is more directly involved in his region's problems, free of ties with past political formulas, ethical, transparent, clean-living, and experienced in administration. He will not be just a man making promises on the stump. While Torquato is somewhat optimistic about the changes in the profile of Brazilian politicians that will emerge from the upcoming elections, the same cannot be said of another expert in political marketing, Carlos Brickmann. The coordinator of Paulo Maluf's campaign, Brickmann does not think that Brazilian politicians are all that bad. "The pattern among Brazil's prominent politicians is good," he says. "Most of those involved in corruption are completely insignificant people." Reflections--Brickmann does not think that far-reaching changes will result from the elections. "Politicians reflect the country," he explains. "They are the result of the country and its legislation, which makes unacceptable things such as campaign contributions in the millions completely acceptable because they are necessary. The politicians will change only when the country and its legislation change." More hopeful than Brickmann is advertising man Mauro Salles, who coordinated Tancredo Neves' campaign in the Electoral College. He believes that the wave of morality sweeping the country will bring to the fore many honest politicians who already exist. "The increased emphasis on ethical principles is going to cast the spotlight on a number of competent politicians who at some point became ashamed of being honest," he says. Honesty and Machismo Porto Alegre--Like all Brazilians, the 56,000 voters in the border town of Santana do Livramento in Rio Grande do Sul are concerned to elect honest politicians, but they also take into account a cultural trait that is still extremely strong when it comes to election campaigns: that represented by the macho gaucho. For example, lawyer and former Mayor Glenio Lemos (PDT [Democratic Labor Party]) will probably be elected state deputy because he combines the image of a good and honest administrator with a fiery temperament that gets him into violent scrapes with rivals and makes him take action with the help of a .765 or 9mm pistol that sends his opponents scurrying for cover. Lemos is expected to pull in a big vote in this town, which is unique in Brazil because of its geography: it adjoins the Uruguayan town of Rivera, and the two of them form a single city with a population of 200,000. With about 100,000 residents on the Brazilian side and a budget of $9 million, Santana do Livramento is currently dominated by the PDT, thanks in particular to Glenio Lemos. Hang the municipal councilors--Glenio was elected mayor as an aftereffect of the shots which, as lawyer for the mayor of neighboring Quarai, he had fired in the Municipal Chamber. The bullets did not hit anyone, but they earned him the 17,000 votes that made him mayor. He used the budget of $13 million--made fatter by the Collor Plan, which gave money to the municipal governments--for hundreds of public works. He earned the image of an effective administrator--he got his successor elected with 63 percent of the vote--without abandoning his penchant for valorous deeds. The public loved it when, during a political squabble with the Municipal Chamber, Lemos suggested hanging the municipal councilors from the tree on the main square. And when, being ecological, he demanded that an individual get down out of a tree and, upon being ignored, drew his revolver out of his belt, sending the person scurrying for cover. Even after completing his term as mayor and returning to his law practice, he has continued to attract attention. Once, while representing a woman whose small farm had been invaded by landless settlers, he set fire to their tents. The settlers continued to hold out, but they finally left when Glenio returned to the site on horseback with a court order in one hand and his revolver in the other.
