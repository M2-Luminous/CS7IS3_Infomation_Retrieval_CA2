For almost three years now the nuclear reactor rods have been deposited at the SevMash [Severodvinsk Machine-building] enterprise in Severodvinsk at which redundant nuclear submarines are being dismantled. Nearly 40 submarines are waiting today for their nuclear fuel waste to be disposed. For the past three years Severodvinsk has been under a threat of ecological catastrophe. A slightest error in handling nuclear fuel could lead to irreversible consequences. The volume of radioactive waste exceeded all accepted norms. The reasons for this pileup was the fact that previously nuclear waste was shipped by sea to a place near Murmansk where it was loaded onto railway cars and transported to Chelyabinsk-65 for disposal. This was too expensive and the North Fleet command suggested the waste should be transported directly from Severodvinsk and Archangelsk. The State ecological expert commission was examining this proposal for several years, which resulted in a pileup of nuclear waste waiting to be transported. Nevertheless, the first trainload has now been dispatched. The railway lines had to be repaired urgently for this occasion. The safety of the load was ensured by introduction of new specially designed containers. [Video shows train with special containers]
