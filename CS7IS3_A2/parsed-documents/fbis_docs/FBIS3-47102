This trip by the two heads of the royal government of Cambodia [RGC] is made at the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Li Peng, PRC prime minister. It is also their first joint visit since the official establishment of the royal government on 29 September 1993. It ought to be specified that during this trip to China, the two RGC heads will probably inform King Norodom Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment in Beijing, of the royal government's major plans, projects, and principles for 1994. Political analysts on the Cambodia issue have affirmed that during this visit to Beijing by the two RGC heads -- made after the attack by Khmer Rouge troops on Romchang village in the liberated zone of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] on 1 January -- discussion and consultation with the king will probably be held concerning the Khmer Rouge, who also want a role in the royal government, because China in the past was a major supporter of the Khmer Rouge.
