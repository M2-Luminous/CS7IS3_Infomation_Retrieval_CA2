A spokesman of the DPRK Institute of Disarmament and Peace made the remarks in an interview with KCNA today concerning the Clinton administration's declaration that nuclear non-proliferation is the "basis of its state diplomacy." He told KCNA: The United States developed nuclear weapons before any other country and was the first to use them in World War II. With the beginning of the cold war between the bipolar blocs, the number of the recognised nuclear-weapon states grew to five. Each time agreements on limited abolition of nuclear weapons were signed, mankind watched them with hopes for the future of nuclear disarmament. However, the status of the nuclear-weapon states is still maintained and public concern is growing over nuclear arms development in other countries. International studies estimate that most of the Western countries have experience in nearly completing the development of nuclear weapons after World War II and have material and technological foundations to manufacture nuclear weapons without much difficulty, once determined. Especially, the development of nuclear weapons in Japan and South Korea has gone beyond the limit of international apprehension and Israel is known to have produced and possess nuclear weapons. The United States and some Western countries suspect that certain countries in the Middle East and South Asia, South Africa and some countries of South America are engaged in nuclear development for military purposes, though the suspected countries contend that their nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes. With the emergence of nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States possessing nuclear weapons after the collapse of the Soviet Union in recent years, the problem of nuclear weapons involves many more countries worldwide. As seen above, the nuclear problem assumes a very wide and complicated international character. Therefore, international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation must be directed to reducing and abolishing the existing nuclear weapons in keeping with the post-cold war trend, and must be concentrated on preventing the nuclear activities of those countries that actually intend to develop nuclear weapons and have enough potentials for this. On the contrary, the United States is continuously promoting the modernisation of its own nuclear weapons and conniving at the dangerous nuclear gamble of its allies or some other countries, while throwing doubt upon the peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK and other countries that go against the grain with it and even calling for "sanctions" against them. At the meeting of the disarmament commission of the United Nations which ended on May 7, many developing countries charged that the nuclear-weapon states had not stopped the production and modernisation of nuclear weapons while paying attention only to nuclear non-proliferation rather than to nuclear arms cutback. On the other hand, the United States and other Western countries busied themselves laying stress on strengthening the "nuclear non- proliferation system" and enhancing the "role of the U.N. Security Council" in such a manner as to increase pressure and sanctions. This shows the unfair attitude of the United States toward nuclear disarmament. The United States' double standard regarding the nuclear issue and its sinister political intention result in concealing and encouraging the nuclear ambitions of many countries. While the United States is resorting to a fruitless campaign over the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities, the development of nuclear weapons in some countries has reached a more dangerous line under its shade. This will have a grave irrevocable impact on the international nuclear non- proliferation system in the future. If the United States renounces its hostile policy toward the DPRK and takes the position of respecting its independence and carrying out the steps of joint action, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will be settled smoothly and equitably. This will mean a contribution to international nuclear non-proliferation.
