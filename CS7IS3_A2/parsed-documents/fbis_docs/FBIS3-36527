The friendship and fraternity between our peoples have a long and rich history and these ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan have been considerably broadened and developed. However, this does not mean that the level of relations completely satisfies Turkey and Azerbaijan. There is a great potential to deepen and further develop our relations. I believe that these potentials have thus far not been used to the desired extent. Therefore, many tasks await us now and in the future. I repeat that our relations are ones of friendship and fraternity. Our peoples are friends and bothers. However, such ties are given concrete shape by economic, trade, cultural, social, and other cooperation. We have great potential for extensive cooperation in all these fields. I am sure that during my visit to Turkey we will conclude relevant agreements to activate this potential and to better use it in the future, and that such agreements will be reflected in relevant documents and treaties to be signed. I will visit Turkey at the invitation of my very close friend esteemed Suleyman Demirel, whom we highly respect here. Undoubtedly, I will meet with all the Turkish leaders there. I am also ready to meet with the Turkish people, businessmen, scientists, and those who have an influence on Turkish life. The program of my visit has still to be finalized, but I am ready to accede to other requests outside the program. I also want to note that I am personally giving great importance to this visit and getting ready for my visit to Turkey with great expectations. I hope that this visit will produce very positive results, and will open a new phase in the development of ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey. [Reporter Murat] I want to ask a few questions on the situation at the front. You have recently scored some victories. The people mostly ascribe these successes to you. They say that after taking office Geydar Aliyev put things aright. What do you think is behind these successes? And my second question: The Turkic summit has been postponed; will it be held sometime in the future or has it been abandoned completely? [Aliyev] The victories achieved in recent months in the struggle being waged by the Azerbaijani Army against Armenia's aggression are first of all the victories of the Azerbaijani people and the Azerbaijani Army, which is an inseparable part of the Azerbaijani people. The Azerbaijani people have always been brave and powerful. They have a history of great heroism. The Azerbaijani people fought for their freedom, independence, and the defense of their lands for centuries and have emerged victorious. There have been moments of defeats too. But, history saw the Azerbaijani people survive and has now has seen them emerge as an independent state. All these things were achieved due to the strength, effort, courage, and heroism found in the Azerbaijani people. It could be asked why high spirits exist now and was absent in the past. It is simply that people should have been persuaded to trust their own strength. [Unidentified reporter] Could we say that they now trust their leaders? [Aliyev] You know peoples' history. Turkey's history too confirms that a people must have faith in something. Just like faith in God and religion, there should be faith in the people. Now this faith has been forged in our Azerbaijani people. They now believe in their own strength. And, undoubtedly, there is also trust in the leadership of Azerbaijan. You yourselves can see this. My task has been to make people aware of their own strength and believe in it. We have achieved this aim, and I believe that we will continue to do so. The successes are the result of the heroism of the Azerbaijani people and the heroic struggle being waged by the Azerbaijani sons fighting in the army ranks. My task as the president and commander in chief has been to guide and shape these efforts, to mobilize the people, to rise the people up, to make them trust their own strength. You are aware that I have been active in this direction in recent months. And, the results are obvious. As for the summit, it has not been abandoned; it has only been postponed to a later date. The summit will take place. [Second unidentified reporter] It is being said that in view of the Azerbaijani successes at the fronts and the continued Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, a summit in Baku would have been construed as support for Azerbaijan, and that is why it was postponed. [Aliyev] Hmmm. I do not know. There might be something to it, but I am not aware of it. [Third unidentified reporter] Why has the military cooperation agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan not been signed yet? Will you take initiatives during your visit to Turkey to sign the military cooperation agreement? [Aliyev] I do not know why it was not signed. However, we have no such plan. [First unidentified reporter] The Turkish press reports that PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] terrorists are going from Syria to Armenia by various routes and then are fighting against Azerbaijan. Do you have information to this effect? That is, do you have information proving that PKK terrorists are fighting against you in the Armenian ranks? [Aliyev] As you know, many join the Armenian ranks in the war against us. There are people from many countries. It could be that they [PKK] too are taking part. But, I have no definite information on this. However, I know that there are soldiers from Russia, European countries, and other countries fighting against us on the Armenian side. We have documents proving this, the prisoners confirm this. As for the PKK members' participation in the fighting, that too might be possible; after all, the PKK has close ties with Armenia. It could well be. [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports that this terror organization is trying to establish bases in Sharur, Dashan,and Devekoy in Nakhichevan. Mustafayev, the former police chief of Devekoy, has declared himself president of a self-styled [Kurdish] region in Shushinskiy and Lachinskiy rayons. [Aliyev] In whose name has he done that? [Fourth unidentified reporter] In the name of PKK. [Aliyev] I see. [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports to this effect. What measures are you thinking of taking against the PKK in Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan? [Aliyev] As you know, we have not made any decisions against the PKK. When I was in power in Nakhichevan there was no overt [PKK] activity, though they might have carried out secret work in the villages you mentioned. Therefore, I cannot say anything on this subject at this time. However I do know that there is a power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan and they have sabotaged that line two or three times and they have again sabotaged it. Turkey informed us that the lines were damaged by PKK members or by people who had come from Armenia. They cross the border with PKK assistance and carry out sabotage on the lines. At present the power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan is not working. It has been damaged. Of this I am aware. [Fifth unidentified reporter] You recently met Boris Yeltsin's representative on Karabakh. You had already met with Vladimir Kazimirov twice in Baku. The Turkish press reported that the Russian plan envisages the deployment of [Russian] peace troops on Azerbaijan's borders with Iran and Turkey and in Karabakh. Did you receive such a proposal from Kazmirov? [Aliyev] I met Kazimirov here. We held lengthy consultations. They put forward proposals for ending the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We too want this war to end. However, we did not agree with the conditions put forward. I told Kazimirov that, as we have often reiterated, we favor the ending of the war and implementation of a cease-fire, with the sole condition that the Armenian armed forces immediately withdraw from Azerbaijani territory. Their proposals and our proposals on conditions for the withdrawal of the Armenians do not coincide; therefore, we could not reach an agreement. However, our contacts are continuing and will continue. And if conditions suitable to us are put forward we might accept them. After all, we do not want war. Blood is being shed and people are getting killed every day. Recently, the Armenian side suffered enormous losses. Armenia was trying to convince the world that the war was not between Armenia and Azerbaijan but between Karabakh and Azerbaijan, but now we have lots of proof that it is Armenia that is fighting and many of its troops were killed while trying to enter Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and some were captured. The same thing happened in Fizulinskiy and Agdamskiy Rayons. Armenian citizens are engaged in war there. We told all this to Kazimirov and we said that we favor peace and the ending of war provided that our condition is accepted. [Fifth unidentified reporter] What was your condition: Was it the Armenian withdrawal from the occupied Azerbaijani lands... [Aliyev, interrupting] Yes, their withdrawal. [Fifth unidentified reporter]... and that there cannot be a question of a cease-fire as long as they do not withdraw? [Aliyev] Hmm. There might be a question of it, but what we want is that for them to withdraw. There are also conditions for the withdrawal. They cannot anyway withdraw within a day. There are details as to when, on which day, under which conditions they could withdraw. [Fifth unidentified reporter] Was there a discussion of the deployment of a Russian peace force? [Aliyev] There are such ideas. However, we did not accept this condition. [First unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] could Turkey take part in a international (?peace force)? [Aliyev] We think that Turkey could take part in it; and Turkey should take part. Turkey must definitely take part, especially when the CSCE observers are deployed here. However, Armenia opposes Turkey's participation, it objects to it. [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Russia send a peace force here by itself alone? [Aliyev] Russia wants this and is trying do it. [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Azerbaijani alone [words indistinct] [Aliyev] As I told you, these are big issues, talks are needed. [Sixth unidentified reporter] Yesterday the Turkish parliament speaker, the esteemed Husamettin Cindoruk, speaking on Turkish television in connection with your visit, underlined that only democracy befits the Turkish people and Azerbaijan. People from Nakhichevan are being invited to Turkey to hold news conferences on human rights violations. It is being said that you are oppressing the opposition and some political figures are being held in prison, and that there is not much information about their fate. These claims are being published in the Turkish press and the Turkish Government is also talking about the need for democracy in Azerbaijan. What is your approach to democracy and opposition? Second, Abulfaz Elchibey is living in a mountain village. In Turkey, too, such internal troubles occurred in the past but none of our politicians or elected officials have been forced to return to their villages. That is, one cannot engage in politics in a village; after all, Baku is the political capital. Is there room for some flexibility. It is being claimed that if Elchibey returns here there will be internal turmoil. But, this does not sound realistic. Do you agree that all the opposition parties should freely work in the parliament on a democratic platform? And to what extent are these rumors correct? [Aliyev] As you know, democracy is not the monopoly of one single person or a group of individuals. Democracy is a global value -- Do you understand me, I am speaking in Azeri? [Reporters] Yes, yes... [Aliyev] So, you do. I am speaking in Azeri. Democracy is a global value. It does not belong to one or two persons. Therefore, you should not be carried away by wrong information. Yet, unfortunately, here and in Turkey they divide people into groups. Allegedly, a certain group is prodemocracy and the other is not. This is not correct. Democracy has already made its own niche in Azerbaijan. That is, it has established itself. As for my position, I have always been in favor of democracy. Regrettably, even some people in Turkey disseminate negative reports about my person. They say that in the past Geydar Aliyev was a great communist leader and headed the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani Communist Party, and that he was a general, and therefore he cannot be a democrat. Starting with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, almost all the presidents of the Turkish Republic were generals. However, no one says that these are not democrats, or that they failed to follow the path of democracy. Therefore, all such claims are concoctions. This is the first point. Second, you yourselves know that I came to Azerbaijan at the invitation of Abulfaz Elchibey. His sitting in a village is his own problem. No one sent him there. I too sat in Nakhichevan close to three years, and I never said that anyone had forced me to settle there. I simply had no place other than Nakhichevan to go. That is why I went and settled down there. I had no place in Baku, that is why I went to Nakhichevan. They also gave me no means to make a living in Baku. This is each person's problem. I, as a former leader of Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union, never said why I stayed in Nakhichevan for three years. I accuse no one for this. It was Abulfaz Elchibey who invited me here. I did not want to come here, I came only because he invited me. I was elected chairman of the parliament on 15 June, the day I came here. Since then I have always said: Azerbaijan is an independent state, and I will never allow the loss of this independence. Azerbaijan must walk along the path of democracy. Azerbaijan must establish a democratic and law-based state and society by making use of the internationally accepted democratic principles in accordance with the Azerbaijani national traditions and characteristics. This is the path followed by Azerbaijan. I am also walking along this path. I am also trying to take the Azerbaijani Government along this road. Therefore, claims of violation of democracy in Azerbaijan are lies. Those writing such things in Turkish and Azerbaijani press are writing lies. The relations with the opposition here is normal. No one is preventing the opposition from speaking. Since my election as president I have repeatedly said that I am the guarantor of democracy, human rights, and of equal legal treatment of the Azerbaijani citizens regardless of their linguistic, religious and political affiliations. I am the guarantor of speech and conscience, and I favor political pluralism. I am in favor of a multi-party system. Here there are far more parties and papers than in Turkey. If Turkey has 10 major newspapers, here there are that many whose names I do not even know. Whoever wants can publish a newspaper. Therefore, the talk about the strangulation of democracy is totally false. These claims arise from the assumption that allegedly there was democracy when the People's Front of Azerbaijan [PFA] and Abulfaz Elchibey were here. This is wrong. When Elchibey was in power, the interior minister used to beat up the reporters. I remember, once I was watching television in Nakhichevan. The then Prime Minister Panakh Guseynov and the representatives of the National Independence Party were engaged in a debate. Suddenly, the then Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, he is the leader of the Bozkurt [Gray Wolves] organization -- maybe there are also Bozkurts from Turkey too in this organization, I don't know -- charged in and smashed the television studio. Could there be worst violation of democracy then this? Yet, Abulfaz Elchibey said nothing about it. If Abulfaz Elchibey or Isa Kamberov [the former chairman of the parliament] were guarantors of democracy they should have punished him that very day, because this was the worst sort of violation of democracy. It was violated in the most gross manner. They beat up hundreds of people in the past and sent them to hospitals during rallies in [Baku's] Azadlyg Square on orders from Iskender Gamidov and Azerbaijani leaders. Why was it was not said then that these were violations of democracy? But now there is not a single person or deputy jailed for his views. Each person says and writes whatever it likes. There is democracy here. The PFA is not the embodiment of democracy, and democracy does not equal the PFA. Democracy is a larger concept. Turkish democracy draws its principles from international democracy evolved over centuries. I, as a political personality, have always been a democrat. You should not believe that there were no democratic people in the Communist Party. There were such people and they are now active in politics in Russia and everywhere else. Thank you. I believe that you will work to publish in your papers and other information organs objective and correct information on the present situation in Azerbaijan. Because some Turkish news media and papers publish wrong information. This is not helpful. Everything should be correct. [video shows Geydar Aliyev and reporters sitting around oval table]
