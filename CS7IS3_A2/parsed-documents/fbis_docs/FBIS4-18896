Ro."; place and date not given: "It Was the League Which Knocked on Our Door"] [Text] Rome -- [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Following a "long-range war" made up of rather scathing statements, you have finally met eye to eye. Deputy Fini, how did you find the Senator [League Secretary Bossi]? [Fini] I know him. In some respects, Bossi is even quite amiable. But, on the other hand, he is also unpredictable. After a few moments of friendliness, he begins to attack, to overturn... everything that can be overturned. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did you feel? [Fini] I have a very peculiar character. I am a cool-minded person. I did no let him overpower me in any way, I am used to political battles. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Did you expect this kind of move from Bossi -- coming like this, suddenly, to speak with you? Was it the League that knocked at your door? [Fini] Last Tuesday afternoon [5 April], [League lower house floor leader] Maroni turned up at our group's office in the Chamber of Deputies. He met [National Alliance lower house floor leader] Tatarella. I learned this later, when I spoke on the phone to Luigi Rossi. No, frankly, I did not expect them to approach us. I was pleasantly surprised, among other things because apparently they have forgotten the consultations they were supposed to have with the center and the Left. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What do you think of this thaw? [Fini] I am glad. I had advocated this repeatedly: Let us stop just asserting our respective principles. How can we give birth to a new system if we go on like this? [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You are accepting federalism. Is this not out of keeping with your tradition? [Fini] Federalism, in theory, is neither good nor bad. The essential thing is to ensure national unity is not endangered. American and German federalism are built upon a strong national sense, which is never called into question. However, things are different in Italy. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is this why you want presidentialism as a counterweight? [Fini] Of course. There are several forms of presidentialism, a high form which provides for the president of the republic's direct election; another form based on the people electing the prime minister. We must find constitutional solutions enabling a synthesis. This, however, is a task for the constitutional experts. I might say something misleading. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] If you do not mind my asking again: How could you convert to federalism? [Fini] Let me stress that, even in our platform, we did not rule anything out a priori. We asked for an efficient state, safeguarding national unity. It is now up to constitutional engineers, working at a negotiating table, to find the right solutions. No agreement has yet been reached. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Perhaps you and the League shared a common interest, namely that of not allowing Berlusconi's personality to overshadow you? [Fini] I am only interested in one thing: enabling a coalition government to be formed -- and coalition governments are effectively established when the political parties involved are on an equal footing.
