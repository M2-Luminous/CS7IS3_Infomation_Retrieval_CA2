Accompanied by some members of the company's board of directors, Abda'u told the press here Wednesday that aside from the twelve new oil fields, eighteen other oil fields were still open to exploration. Two of the new oil fields, Abda'u said, were on-shore fields in Bengara and Kisaran, East Kalimantan. Two others, he went on, were off-shore/on-shore fields, namely one in Muna, South-East Sulawesi and the other in Pagatan, South Kalimantan. The remaining eight oil fields, he added, were off-shore fields, namely Java Sea I, off-shore Lampung and Pangkah in the Java Sea, Asahan in North Sumatera, Sebawang in East Kalimantan, Wowoni in South-East Sulawesi and Tamuloi as well as Sebakor, both in Irian Jaya. In the meantime, G.A.S. Nayoan, Pertamina's director of exploration and production, said that as the new PSC exploration fields were outside the areas included in 1993 oil/gas incentive package scheme Pertamina had recently introduced, the split effected would not change. In addition, he said, Pertamina was also offering to investors 28 old oil wells under the technical assistance contract (TAC) scheme, whereby old oil wells already given up by old contractors would be reactivated through a process known as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) so that the remaining oil deposits could be tapped. He also disclosed that 1:9 oil companies, 50 of them national private companies, had been put on Pertamina's mailing list for 1994 oil exploration activities, under either a PSC or EOR basis. On the occasion, Nayoan also said that the policy of opening up new oil fields was, in fact, related to efforts to intensify exploration and drilling activities because in 1993 only 111 out of the targeted 207 oil wells had been drilled. He said that the failure in reaching the drilling target was attributable to stiffer competition to attract oil investors, declining profits owing to a drop in the oil price and preference on the part of oil/gas industry to invest in the downstream industry rather than in the upstream industry because of much-discussed environmental matters. "As we are greatly concerned about this fact, our policy in exploration and production in 1994 is focused on intensifying drilling activities," He explained, adding that in this context the government's recent incentive package to be applied to Indonesia's eastern regions and other frontier areas in the country's western regions was expected to spur exploration and drilling activities.
