A series of arrests was made last night in Asti and Piedmont as part of the inquiry undertaken by the Italian and Swiss police, revealed the carabinieri during a press conference. The police operation undertaken jointly by the Italian and Swiss investigators and dubbed "San Jose"--the name of the Colombian town from where the cocaine leaves--led to a series of arrests in Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy) and Ticino. Over a month ago, a native of Lugano and his companion were the first to be arrested in Asti. On 18 February, the Ticino police put the handcuffs on one of its own men, a 40-year-old corporal who worked at the Agno airport. The man immediately admitted participating in the international trafficking of some 150 kg of cocaine, an amount that rose to 500 kg a few days later. On 24 February, it was the turn of a Lugano bar owner to be arrested. Then, on 2 March, a 30-year-old Italian employed by the airline Crossair was apprehended. On Wednesday, a few hours before the last arrests that took place Wednesday night in Asti, the Ticino police announced the arrest of a 54-year-old Italian man in a Lugano hotel. The police asked the press not to report the story until further notice. The silence was broken Thursday by the Italian investigators, who revealed the identity of the man arrested in Lugano. He is from Milan and is considered the right-hand man to the head of the organization, a 28-year-old Colombian. With these latest arrests, operation "San Jose" has put 18 people behind bars in Italy and Ticino. Only five kilograms of cocaine were seized. The trafficking operation, which has been going on since 1991, involved some 2,000 kg of drugs with a value of 4.5 million Swiss francs. After being exported from Colombia, the cocaine was transported by ship to Savona, near Genoa, or by airplane with stopovers in Bogota, Santo Domingo, Madrid, Zurich, and Agno. The drugs that arrived in the Lugano airport were taken over by the crooked policeman and thus avoided customs checks. While the prosecutor, Jacques Ducry, who is in charge of the inquiry in Ticino, said Thursday that "for the time being there is no link between the arrests in Ticino and those in Italy," the names of the Ticino inhabitants implicated were given to the Italian police during the press conference in Asti.
