What are the greatest operating difficulties faced by countless Taiwan traders speaking the same language and of the same race, but who have a different system than the mainland? Public Order Every Taiwan trader on the mainland has his own story to tell. In addition to the opeating difficulties they face, their persons and their property are most frequently threatened. When Taiwan traders, who dislike and try to avoid poor public order in Taiwan, leave home to go to the mainland, the public problems they face there are even worse. The China mainland has a two-track society. Not only is there a wide gap between the rich and the poor there, but the gap in the standard of living between the two sides of the Straits is even greater. Furthermore, some Taiwan traders spend too freely on the mainland. Their automobile and their clothing are too ostentatious, and their haughty behavior even more provokes scoundrels. The farther south one goes in China, the worse public order becomes. In Baoan County, where Shenzhen is located, in particular, Taiwan traders' plants are frequently robbed or extorted by hooligans. On payday, workers are also frequently robbed. Many Taiwan traders like to keep anti-riot rifles, gas pistols, stun batons, and knives or daggers in their factories, beside their beds, or in their automobiles. Wu Sheng-shun, the director of the Shenzhen Taiwan Traders' Association, is now organizing a peace preservation team in Buji Town. Local foreign merchants have put up money to protect themselves. An underworld has emerged on the mainland. On 2 October, a 48 man gang headed by the local underworld leader "Feizaiqiang" attacked and killed three Taiwan traders. One of the Taiwan traders was stabbed 19 times on the highway. These three traders were heads of the local "Treasure Island Amusement City." This atrocity resulted less than one week after the opening because the entrance fee was too expensive (2,500 yuan -- the equivalent of NT$9,000 -- for an hour of karaoke), and because of haughty behavior. One local Taiwan trader said that the backers of Treasure Island Entertainment City were a group of Taiwan shoe firms. This Taiwan trader also said that "Feizaiqiang" had gone to Taiwan where he had been wined and dined by these shoe firms. Because these shoe firms were also his mainland karaoke partners, this Taiwan trader asked that Taiwan traders on the mainland stick to running good businesses, because the entertainment business inevitably became connected with the underworld and sex. "If this continues," he said, "it can only make relations between the two sides of the Straits more and more tense." In order to protect themselves, some Taiwan traders have no choice but to improve their contacts with the military and the people's armed police. They forge links with mainland military and with intelligence and public order units. One observer asked with a sigh why one chooses such a hard way to make money. One Taiwan trader said that on no account should one believe a mainland employee. They are really infuriating. They can only do one thing at a time, and they are fond of eating but averse to work. Do not put them in charge, and do not let them do any purchasing, because they are so incredibly poor they will cheat you blind. After 40 years of separation, people's thinking, value concepts, and working spirit are very different on the two sides of the Straits. The attitude of the above Taiwan trader, for example, is the typical attitude of a Taiwan trader toward mainland employees. In adhering to China's distinctive brand of socialism, Deng Xiaoping stresses that without reform and opening to the outside world, China will face only a dead end. In accordance with this principle, large numbers of foreign traders have been brought into the country. However, an eating out of a large common pot psychology persists among employees who expect the same benefits no matter their performance. From top to bottom, the Chinese Communists believe that Taiwan's success during the past 40 years is attributable to "Chiang Kai-shek's movement of large quantities of gold, so now Taiwan naturally should make a contribution to the motherland." Very few realize that Taiwan's success is due to making an all-out effort, hard work, and frugality. A Taiwan trader in Kunshan, Suzhou said that he has spent a large amount of time explaining that Taiwan's success is attributable to hard work and frugality. A Taiwan trader in Shanghai said that mainland people are rather short-sighted. They are rather impetuous. They want to reach the heights in a single step. Because of the difference in thinking, many Taiwan traders spend a lot of time on education and training. They generally feel that mainland vocational education, working spirit, and job education are inferior to Taiwan's. Consequently, they spend a great deal of time on education, training and transplanting the business culture of the parent corporation in Taiwan. Factories are filled with posters on the five C's (checking, cleanliness, collating, and consolidation). "The number of Taiwan cadres is small, so who will influence whom? Work here requires stamina and fortitude," said Ch'en Sen-yen, deputy manager of China Chieh-an-t'e [phonetic]. Hidden Costs Land and manpower are the major elements attracting Taiwan trader investment. The problem is, they are not necessarily cheap. Behind the scenes lurk numerous hidden costs. Some Taiwan traders describe these hidden costs as "a hidden man in the mirror" who may jump out at you at any time. The mainland is essentially a country ruled by men rather than by laws; consequently, good relations with all sorts of administrative personnel and ranking cadres is very important. One Taiwan trader in north China said that he has spent a lot of time and money on public relations. One must have good public relations with high cadres, their families, and even their chauffeurs. The salty land where he was located had no telephone wires, but thanks to his good public relations efforts, telephone lines were connected. Very many things on the mainland over which one has no control constitute an even greater hidden cost. A chauffeur in Beijing said that there are no standards for many things on the mainland. "Someone may say something may be done, so even if it may not be done, it may still be done; or he may say it may be done, so even if it may not be done, it may still be done." One Taiwan trader said that on the mainland many things cannot be done on time, and having a contract makes no difference. Also, "if someone says he has a contact who can get things done, he probably does not have a contact; if he says he has no contact, he probably does have a contact." Contracts signed with the Chinese Communist government are not necessarily valid. The farther south one goes in China, the earlier Taiwan traders invested there, and the earlier such problems surface. In October, for example, a Taiwan trader in Shenzhen was suddenly informed that his previously signed rental lease was invalid and that he would have to pay more rent. Great changes occur that one cannot predict.
