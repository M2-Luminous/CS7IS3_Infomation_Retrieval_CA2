FR940405-2-00176 FR940405-2-00081 Tuesday April 5, 1994 Part IV Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year 1994 for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration in HUD Region I; and Project Guidelines; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 65␣/␣Tuesday, April 5, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3667; FR&hyph;3571&hyph;N&hyph;03] Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year 1994 for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration in HUD Region I; and Project Guidelines AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994; and Notice of Project Guidelines for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of funding in the HUD Boston Region for section 8 project-based certificate (PBC) assistance for one multifamily housing project and a supportive services grant under the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. The Multifamily Project Demonstration must be administered by a public housing agency or Indian housing authority (HA), and located in a unit of general local government of under 50,000 population. Selection of an HA to carry out this Demonstration is limited to eligible HAs in the HUD Boston Region which includes the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. This notice presents the Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines and announces the availability of funding of up to $6,172,250 in section 8 budget authority which will support project-based certificate assistance for an estimated 75 to 150 units. In addition, up to $1,012,500 in supportive services grant funds will be made available by HUD to the selected HA to provide program participants who are frail elderly persons with services appropriate to their needs so they may continue to live independently and avoid premature or unnecessary institutionalization. The selected HA must match the HUD supportive services funds with at least 50 percent of the total cost of the supportive services estimated to be necessary by the HA and approved by HUD. The purpose of the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to determine the feasibility of using section 8 project-based certificate assistance to assist frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in a single multifamily housing project specifically designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons, and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in the provision of supportive services. The Multifamily Project Demonstration is a five-year demonstration; however, the initial term of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is renewable for three additional five-year terms at the option of the HA and subject to the availability of funds. The NOFA contains information concerning the deadline for filing applications; eligibility of applicants; available amounts; selection criteria; and the application and selection process. Section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 requires that any HA receiving additional section 8 rental voucher or certificate program funding must administer a family self-sufficiency (FSS) program. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), participation in the FSS program is optional. The FSS program regulations were published in the Federal Register on May 27, 1993 (56 FR 49592). Any rental voucher or certificate funding reserved in FY 1993 or subsequently, including funding made available under this NOFA, will establish or increase the minimum size of an HA's FSS program. This NOFA is substantially similar to the NOFA published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50768), and withdrawn on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63181). The principal differences between this NOFA published in today's Federal Register and the September 28, 1993 NOFA, are that this NOFA increases the availability of funding with amounts remaining from the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, and opens up occupancy in the multifamily demonstration project to near-frail elderly persons, as this term is defined in this NOFA. Although eligible near-frail elderly persons are permitted to reside in the multifamily project, supportive services grant funds are still restricted to funding services for only the frail elderly. This NOFA provides for a two-tiered competition based on: (1) The proposal for supportive services and the proposal to construct or rehabilitate the housing, and (2) The competitive selection criteria identified in the law. This NOFA also increases the fair market rents (FMRs) published April 24, 1991, by two percent per year to adjust for inflation and corrects the FMRs previously published in Appendix 10 to reflect section 202 FMRs for housing designed for elderly persons and persons with disabilities. DATES: The due date for submission of applications in response to this NOFA is July 5, 1994. Applications must be received in the local HUD Field Office on the due date by 4:30 p.m. local time. The application deadline is firm as to date and hour when applications must be submitted to the Field Offices. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, HUD will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is not received on or before the application deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. Application forms may be obtained from the local HUD Field Office. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald J.
