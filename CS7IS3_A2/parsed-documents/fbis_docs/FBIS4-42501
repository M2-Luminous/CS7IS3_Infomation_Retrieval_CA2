Kinkel stressed that the party conference should "send out" this signal "to all parts of the country." The FDP, "on the basis of its liberal program," intends "to continue the successful coalition with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period." The party conference is to vote on this proposal this afternoon. Kinkel expects that an overwhelming majority of the approximately 660 delegates will vote in favor. The FDP chairman pointed out that the election program of the Free Democrats would be adopted by the Rostock party conference. He emphasized that this will give a distinctive stamp to the FDP. At the same time, Kinkel warned against a red-green or a grand coalition in Bonn. A strong FDP would be the guarantee that this would not happen and that "common sense" would continue to govern for the benefit of the country.
