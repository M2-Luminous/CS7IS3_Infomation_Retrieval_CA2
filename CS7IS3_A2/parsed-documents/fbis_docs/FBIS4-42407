When membership of the Atlantic alliance "cost little and yielded a great deal" (U.S. protection against a definite "enemy," the Soviet Union, in exchange for our relinquishing overly close relations with U.S. enemies) our membership was often challenged both by the opposition and by some sectors of the majority itself. Now that membership of the Atlantic alliance "yields much less and costs more" (due to the disappearance of our "enemy" and the need to contribute to international stability outside Europe), there are more and more appeals for "Italy's loyalty to its alliances" even from the same people who used to challenge our membership. Unfortunately, however, nobody has wondered what loyalty to the Atlantic alliance means now, after the crisis of European communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have eliminated the historical, political, and strategic reasons for its existence; what loyalty to the European Union means, after international speculation caused the "explosion" of the monetary system, after the recession has called into question the German model of development (approved by the Maastricht Treaty), and after the Yugoslav crisis has revealed Europe's impotence. The main concern has been to appear "loyal," without, however, explaining "to what" and above all without wondering what costs and benefits it entails for our country. Thus a great opportunity for a serious discussion of foreign policy has been wasted. Having for years described our allies' reservations concerning the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] possible entry into the government as "an intolerable interference in our internal affairs," the Left has now applauded foreign criticisms of the appointment of National Alliance ministers. This shows that for many Italians national independence is optional, depending on whether it affects themselves or their adversaries. The pressing need to immediately deny any possible suspicion of "fickleness" has prevailed. This is a praiseworthy political need, but it too is the result of guilt complexes and an approach to the new international situation that are entirely anachronistic. Indeed, the concern with averting any suspicion of "elaborate footwork" seems to ignore the fact that "the music has changed" and that so too have the "dancers," that the major powers are able to keep to the same "beat"; that the important thing is not Italy's membership of the Atlantic alliance and the European Union but what specifically our country intends to do within the international bodies to which it belongs. During the Cold War era we were one of the most loyal members of an "unequal alliance": The weaker allies (the Europeans and Canadians) were obedient inasmuch as they were protected, and the stronger ally (the United States) provided protection inasmuch as it was obeyed. Now that alliance, which was the result of the bipolar international system (the United States versus the USSR) is bound to change into a different kind of international system. The allies' common democratic and liberal background is no longer enough to justify its existence. Neither is the aim to transform it generically into the "custodian of peace." What we need to consider is what the allies can still achieve, and at what price, and what problems are involved in transferring the alliance's original aims, which were defensive, to the new international context. A medium regional power such as Italy is no longer bound to "passively" submit to the dynamics of the geopolitical or geoeconomic context within which it operates, but can seek to take part in it "actively." This has a whole series of implications for our country. First, the international context has less impact than in the past on decisionmaking processes affecting our foreign policy; the prevailing national interest is no longer security, but economic development. Second, the international framework has less impact than in the past also on the decisionmaking processes of our domestic policy; it is no longer a matter of reconciling objectives derived from our alliances with the presence of opposition forces hostile to them. Third, the "scope of action" of our foreign policy is extending from the regional to the global, from the political-military to the economic, commercial, and cultural; new markets are opening up that were until recently closed to us either for security reasons (Russia and East Europe) or because of our "obedience" to our American protector (China). Fourth, the rules of conduct to which we have subscribed remain (the need for loyalty); those connected with our membership of the Atlantic alliance, more flexible, and those connected with our adherence to international economic agreements, more full of opportunities. There are increasing incentives to bring the rules of the international market more into line with increasing international competition. Very appropriately, having paid rhetorical tribute to our "loyalty to our alliances," Foreign Minister Antonio Martino has immediately engaged in foreign policy at the practical level, and has already imparted a more realistic approach better suited to the changed international conditions. Even the diplomatic corps which, despite a few "rotten apples," remains one of the best areas of the public administration, has established an internal "foreign policy organization" with the aim of placing its unquestionable professional expertise at the service of a new and more dynamic international action. Why, then, not begin a major debate between the political forces and throughout the country on "what is to be done in foreign policy"? Why, basically, do we not abandon our provincialism once and for all? Prime Minister Berlusconi, Messrs. Bossi, Fini, Occhetto, Pannella, Buttiglione, Segni, and whoever else: Will you please try this, instead of wasting your energies on your own petty domestic quarrels?
