The two leaders expressed full confidence in the continuous growth of bilateral relations and the smooth implementation of the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao Question. Jiang Zemin recalled with delight the good impression he had of Portugal when he visited that country last November. He said: "We appreciate Prime Minister Silva's positive efforts at developing Sino-Portuguese friendly and cooperation relations." He said: Despite the geographical distance and different social systems, China and Portugal share common interests in safeguarding world peace and stability, as well as common needs to develop bilateral cooperation. He expressed the belief that so long as the two countries observe the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, bilateral relations will grow continuously. Turning to the Macao question, Jiang Zemin said: During His Excellency Prime Minister Silva's visit to China in 1987, he signed with the Chinese Government a document of great importance, that is, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao Question. Since the joint declaration was signed and since it entered into force, the two countries have cooperated in seriously implementing it. Facts show that the joint declaration has laid a solid foundation for Macao's stable development and the friendly cooperation between the two countries on the Macao question. It has also set a good example for the peaceful settlement of problems left over from history between two countries. Jiang Zemin said: Only five or more years remain in Macao's transitional period. The work facing China and Portugal is arduous; and the two countries should expedite the solution to a number of questions. He said: So long as China and Portugal step up consultations and cooperate closely, the two countries will certainly be able to properly solve various questions during the transitional period. The Portuguese prime minister said: Since the signing of the Portuguese-Chinese Joint Decclaration on the Macao Question, the two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in implementing it, while smoothly expanding friendly cooperation in other areas. He said: Portugal and China share identical views on many international issues, face an identical task of improving the people's living standards, and have common interests in solving the Macao question. "We hope the visit will further promote cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and scientific fields." Jiang Zemin asked Silva to convey his greetings to Portuguese President Soares. Peng Qingyuan, executive vice chairman of the Kuomintang Revlutionary Committee Central Committee; Liu Xiliang, head of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of radio, film, and television; and Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of foreign affairs; were present at the meeting.
