The adoption of these decisions has been dictated by the firm conviction that it is impossible to extricate Russia from the nationwide crisis without an amnesty for all those who participated in the well known events of 1991 and 1993, and it is impossible without stable civil peace. During discussion of the issue and through the joint efforts of the absolute majority of the State Duma deputies, a formula has been found for social reconciliation and for achieving nationwide accord. The basis of the formula is formed by a striving for constructive cooperation with the president of the Russian Federation, with the Government of the Russian Federation, and with all power structures and political forces, for the sake of consolidating society, and toward an understanding of the great responsibility for the revival of Russian statehood, and for the construction of a new Russia. The Council of the State Duma Council believes that the decisions on amnesty offers thousands of Russians who have regained their freedom the chance to become actively involved in the creative work of all constructive social forces for the benefit of the Fatherland. However, if any of them lacks the common sense, the heart, or desire to take the road of accord, the State Duma, in conformity with the spirit and letter of the decisions adopted, will find an opportunity, jointly with the president of the Russian Federation, to take measures which do not allow the situation within society to be destabilized. The State Duma is prepared to examine constructive proposals for a mechanism to implement the resolutions stated, and also to examine a draft memorandum, agreed with other bodies of state power, on the responsibility of state institutions and politicians to preserve civil peace and public order in Russia.
