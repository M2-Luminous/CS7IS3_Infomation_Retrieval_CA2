Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for Management of State Property, spoke at it. The majority of his talk was devoted to the plans for privatization and Russian President Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. You can hear the second part of Anatoliy Borisovich's news conference tomorrow. But now we shall tell you about, we shall dwell on, the other no less important and urgent questions which Anataoliy Chubays touched upon. [Begin Chubays recording] A few words about the Duma's amnesty decision. Overall I must say that this decision of course qualitatively alters the situation, in the sense that the Duma and its leader, Rybkin, have revealed their true colors, and have called a spade a spade. Everything can now be seen in its true light. Any illusions which existed before on this matter have now been dispelled. Everyone should be clear about this. To tell the truth, I am concerned not only about Khasbulatov and Rutskoy, personally -- good luck to them. What I am worried about is that the decision in the form in which it has been adopted, this decision essentially saves actual murderers -- and I use these words advisedly -- actual murderers from any punishment at all. There is, for example, a certain Shtukaturov who, it was established during an investigation, personally fired a grenade launcher at Ostankino. Four people died as a result of that shot, including one video engineering and three cloakroom assistants. Totally innocent people died. Their blood is on the hands of the murderers. Since the moment the amnesty decision was made, the blood is also on the hands of those who voted for it. Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov personally, have blood on their hands and so have their groupings. I would like to ask Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov personally, to go and meet the families of the people who died -- if only the families of the cloakroom attendants and the video engineer -- and to explain their actions and how they can justify their decision. What they will have is not an abstract vote in the Duma but a conversation with living people, the relatives of those who died at the hands of murderers who will be at liberty tomorrow, and who did not use cold steel -- a knife or a pistol -- but fired a grenade launcher in the capital in broad daylight on a Sunday. This man is to be freed tomorrow thanks to the decision of the State Duma. [end recording]
