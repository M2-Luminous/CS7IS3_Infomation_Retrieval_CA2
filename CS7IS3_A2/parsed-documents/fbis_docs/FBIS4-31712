A coordinating group that will settle unresolved issues in the area of preparing systemic legislation and derivative legal acts and in the area of education on an ongoing basis will meet for the first time in May, according to a statement at today's news conference by Defense Minister Jelko Kacin and State Secretary Boris Znidaric. The protocol will delineate precisely the areas of operation and confirm agreements on closer mutual cooperation, ongoing notification, and mutual assistance in coordinating tasks and operations. Both Znidaric and Kacin rejected criticisms of the "policization" of the army as unfounded. Regarding those criticisms by former Defense Minister Janez Jansa, made nine days after the appearance of the new state secretary, Jelko Kacin said that it was not possible to policize any system in such a short time, especially not a military one. The results of an internal investigation within the Defense Ministry regarding the Smolnikar scandal have been sent to the prime minister, Kacin said. The internal commission, which is headed by Miran Bogataj, will function as long as there is a possibility of discovering new aspects of the background of the event in the village of Depala. The investigation of the attack on Mitja Kunstelj and the Krkovic-Blagojevic case are in the hands of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The defense minister did not confirm the suspicions that organized dark forces, which might threaten the lives of the chief witnesses in the case, might be behind the incident (except that "the events happened in the dark"). The Defense Ministry learned about the attack against Mitja Kunstelj only late in the afternoon, whereas the attack happened at midnight. Kunstelj, judging by the defense minister's answers, evaded the protection of the bodyguard assigned to him by the Defense Ministry, Jelko Kacin also said. The news conference was otherwise devoted primarily to the Defense Ministry's foreign policy activities. Defense Minister Jelko Kacin cited numerous meetings with the defense ministers of foreign countries during the Brussels conference. In the final documents of that conference, Slovenia, in addition to neutral Sweden and Finland, is also mentioned as a signatory of the Partnership for Peace. In Kacin's opinion, admission to the Western European Union will only be possible after Slovenia obtains associate membership in the European Union. Jelko Kacin also mentioned as important his talks with the U.S. and Italian defense ministers. With the U.S. secretary of defense, Kacin talked about the possibility of lifting the embargo against Slovenia, while the subject of the talks with the Italian defense minister was a document on cooperation in the military area. Italy will be the third country with which we have signed such an agreement. Tomorrow, Austrian President Thomas Klestil will also be accompanied by the Austrian defense minister, the Czech defense minister is coming to Slovenia in September, and also during that month a Slovene delegation will visit the NATO base in Avignan. At the news conference, Miran Bogataj assessed the Defense Ministry's participation in an international conference on reducing natural disasters, at which there was a discussion of the global threat and of a strategy until the year 2000.
