FR941004-2-00089 FR941004-2-00054 [OPP&hyph;30347A; FRL&hyph;4913&hyph;7] Becker Microbial Products Inc.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Becker Microbial Products Inc., to conditionally register the pesticide products BMP 123 (48 LC), BMP 123 (2X WP), and BMP 123 (32 LC) containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Phillip Hutton, Product Manager (PM) 18, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 213, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;7690). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of February 18, 1993 (58 FR 8945), which announced that Becker Microbial Products Inc., 9596 N.W. 11th St., Plantation, FL 33322, had submitted three applications to conditionally register the pesticide products BMP 123 (48 LC), BMP 123 (2X WP), and BMP 123 (32 LC) (File Symbols 62637&hyph;A, 62637&hyph;L, and 62637&hyph;U),~ containing the active ingredient Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki at 2.15, 6.4, and 1.60 percent respectively, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products. The company later amended the name of the active ingredient to read `` Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strain BMP 123.'' ~~~~~~~~~ The applications ~were approved on August 5, 1993, which contain the active ingredient Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strain BMP 123 for terrestrial, forestry, and food use to control various insects, for the following products: 1. BMP 123 (48 LC) (EPA Registration Number 62637&hyph;6). 2. BMP 123 (2X WP) (EPA Registration Number 62637&hyph;5). 3. BMP 123 (32 LC) (EPA Registration Number 62637&hyph;4). A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strain BMP 123, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strain BMP 123 during the period of conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is, in the public interest. These products are conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C) provided that the studies be submitted by December 21, 1994, as listed below: 1. Avain Oral (Guideline Reference Number 154A&hyph;16). 2. A 30&hyph;Day Freshwater Fish Toxicity/Pathogenicicty Testing (154A&hyph;19). 3. Freshwater Aquatic Invertebrate Toxicity/Pathogenicity Testing (154A&hyph;20). 4. Honey Bee Toxicity/Pathogenicity Test (154A&hyph;24). 5. Analysis of Samples (154A&hyph;13). If these conditions are not complied with the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e); this registration will expire on May 21, 1996. Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strain BMP 123. A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805).
