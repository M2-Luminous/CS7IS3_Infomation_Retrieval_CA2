Vice Premier Li Lanqing's inscription reads: Bring the combined strong points into play, further improve teaching quality and the social benefit of running a school, and contribute to running well a new-type university. Under the correct leadership of the provincial party committee and government and with the support of the State Education Commission, Nanchang University has achieved gratifying results in teaching, scientific research, production, and spiritual civilization building, and enhanced its overall management capability since its founding on 4 May last year. In the past year, the university has strengthened teaching reforms focusing on the credit, elimination, and rolling competetion systems, thus improving teaching quality. The first acceptance rate on the national English examination of 1992 students increased from 47 percent scored before the merger of two schools to 64.98 percent. At the same time, the university has achieved initial results in expansion of key disciplines. It has become a pre-doctoral education unit with an additional unit of Ph.D. graduate students, two doctoral tutors, and nine units of students studying for a master's degree, thus ending the situation in which there has been not any unit of Ph.D. graduate students in Jiangxi for a long time.
