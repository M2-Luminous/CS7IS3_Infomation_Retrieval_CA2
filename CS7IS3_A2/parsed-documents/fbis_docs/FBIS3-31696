General Jean Cot, commander of the United Nations Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia, told journalists that "it is only because there was no absolute means of determining the origin of the shell that it was not possible to use the (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) air force." An official at UNPROFOR headquarters here told AFP that "we came very, very close to using air power." [passage omitted]
