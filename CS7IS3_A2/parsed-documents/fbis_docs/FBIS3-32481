Lage had lunch immediately afterward with Amorim and personalities from the Brazilian political and economic arena, among which were Inocencio Oliveira, president of the Chamber of Deputies and Alexis Stepanenko, planning minister. This was the second day of the Cuban guest's official visit to Brazil. After arriving at the capital from Sao Paulo, he met with a group of parliamentarians, and friends of Cuba, chaired by Deputy Waldir Pires. The conversations with the group were deemed fraternal, and during these talks information was given to the parliamentarians on Cuba's economic situation "and the efforts of the Cuban people and government to resolve the difficulties imposed from abroad," according to a source close to the visiting delegation. During the afternoon of 3 February, the delegation met with Treasury Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, with whom matters of bilateral interest were broached. Lage's agenda concluded tonight with a reception given by the Cuban Embassy which was attended by ministers, Latin American ambassadors, businessmen, and political party leaders. Lage is scheduled to meet with Brazilian President Itamar Franco on 4 February.
