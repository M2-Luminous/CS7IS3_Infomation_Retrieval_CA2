Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military District and commander in chief of the optical cable communications project, summed up the project. He said: The Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable communications project is a key state project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan and a part of the continental communications bridge connecting Asia and Europe. Completion of the project has great significance for China's reform and opening up, for invigorating the economy of northwest China, for accelerating Xinjiang's development, and for preserving Xinjiang's social stability. The Xinjiang Military District dispatched nearly 10,000 officers and men and more than 600 vehicles and other equipment to dig trenches for laying the 880-km long optical cables. The troops taking part in the construction work, in keeping the overall situation in mind, earnestly practiced the five kinds of revolutionary spirit advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character enterprising spirit advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They worked diligently under extremely difficult conditions, which enabled them to complete the project 45 days ahead of schedule and thus accomplish a miracle in the construction of the country's communication projects.
