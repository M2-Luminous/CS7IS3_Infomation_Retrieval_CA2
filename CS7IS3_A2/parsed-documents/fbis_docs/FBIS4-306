His proposal to hold a national conference took the heat off for a while, but now a military man, Lieutenant General David Mark, who was a member of former President Babangida's government and one of the officers retired after Gen. Abacha seized power last November, has launched an attack on the military regime, talking of hidden agendas. But there are those asking if Gen. Mark might not have a hidden agenda of his own. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] Lt. Gen. David Mark described the Abacha government as a betrayal of the military officers who took part in installing the government and as a betrayal of hope and aspirations for all Nigerians. The general told the magazine, NEWSWATCH, in an interview published in Lagos that he was one of the officers who met towards the end of last year to decide what to do about the interim national government headed by the civilian business executive, Chief Ernest Shonekan. He said that most of the officers favored giving full military backing to Chief Shonekan to conduct another presidential election, but, under pressure from Generals Sani Abacha and Oladipo Diya, they agreed to sack the interim government and install a full military government to rule for no longer than one year. He said that the option for a return to full military government was supported by leading politicians. Lt. Gen. Mark said that the strongest support came from close political associates of Chief Moshood Abiola, the SDP [Social Democratic Party] candidate who was believed to have won the annulled presidential election held last June. Lt. Gen. Mark said, however, that since the restoration of full military rule, the Abacha government had repudiated the original plan that it should last only a maximum of one year. He said that all its actions showed that the new rulers were seeking to be in power for at least five years but they were finding it difficult to tell Nigerians their real intentions. The interview contains harsh criticisms of Gen. Abacha and his second in command, Gen. Oladipo Diya, and praise for the ousted president, Gen. Babangida. These have led many people to regard the entire piece as another propaganda work by former officers still loyal to Gen. Babangida in the same vein as some of the ex-president's former aides talked Chief Abiola into writing a private letter to him as a friend and then they leaked it to the press to show him up as a person who cared only for his personal interests.
