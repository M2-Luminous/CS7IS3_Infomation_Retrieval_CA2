The Swedes must realize this. So said Spanish European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp on the subject of Swedish admission to the EU [European Union]. He also said that Sweden cannot remain outside a common currency. "If Sweden were to want to remain outside, there would be legal problems. It is only Denmark and Great Britain that have opt-outs that give them the right to remain outside." The Spaniards were very active participants in the most recent round of membership negotiations, particularly toward the end, when the issue was Norway and fish. They had their own protracted negotiations in the eighties fresh in their memories. And many Spaniards thought that those countries now seeking membership achieved much better terms than they achieved themselves. In the Spanish press it was often possible to read sentences like: "The Swedes are negotiating as if the EU wants to become a member of Sweden and not the other way round." In Sweden on the other hand the Spaniards' attitude was taken to mean that they did not want the Swedes as members of the EU. "Of course we do," Carlos Westendorp said. "Above all because Sweden has the right to become a member. But also because the level of intellectuals, businessmen, and politicians is high in Sweden. ``No, I am not afraid that the Nordic area will have too much weight in the EU context. The center of gravity will move northward, but this is a fact; there is nothing to be done about it. The EU cannot be enlarged to the south.'' He could not be expected to say anything else. Nor does the opposition say anything else. But Isobel Tocino, the conservative People's Party EU spokesman, gave a slightly more open display of Spanish concern. She is fond of talking about the "European troika" and refers here to Germany, France, and Spain. "From Germany and France we have received promises that the Mediterranean region will not be forgotten," she said. "We border on Africa, and the instability that could come from there." I was told several times in my conversations in Madrid that Germany, France, and Spain are the major countries. It was also repeated several times that the applicant countries together have fewer inhabitants than Spain. Spain is also a major recipient of EU support. Twice as much money goes to Spain as goes to Italy or Greece. Much of the EU money goes to infrastructure. There is a frenetic building of roads throughout Spain, and the impression is gotten of a country that is much more prosperous than it really is. The EU money that goes to individual companies is only a small percentage of all the EU money. And businessmen are not particularly happy. Least happy were the Spanish fishermen who were unable to understand why the Norwegians should be given better terms than they had been given. Now the Spanish Government is relatively content with the final agreement. But the fishermen are not content, and their discontent is not directed against Norway alone. An "anchovy war" is currently taking place between French and Spanish fishermen. "On the fisheries issue we were defending national interests, but apart from that we have the whole time pushed common EU interests," Isabel Tocino said. She was referring here to the agreement in Greece on how many votes are needed to reach decisions after the EU is enlarged. Here Spain and Britain were the two driving forces. Recalcitrant countries, some said. As far as Sweden's admission is concerned, it was chiefly a phasing-in of dues payments that the Spaniards could not accept. Nor could they accept that Sweden's regions would receive as much support money as impoverished Spanish regions. But the compromises that were cobbled together have satisfied the Spaniards, for the time being at least. What worries the Spaniards is that Sweden agrees to raising environmental standards. Although Carlos Westendorp said that it is not Swedish environmental policy that could cause problems. "Sweden and Norway have developed without destroying their environment. What we cannot accept is that Germany and Denmark want to limit our ability to develop when, at the same time, they have destroyed the environment in their own countries. They say that we cannot build roads because some particular sort of animal must be saved. All right, but in Germany and Denmark they have killed all those animals. Now they have to give us a chance to develop. ``What worries us is when people use the environment as a pretext to prevent free trade. As when Germany demands that we should clean up our water, and the equipment is only sold by German companies.'' Carlos Westendorp is convinced that the Swedes will vote in favor of membership in the EU. But he thinks that a national debate is needed in Sweden. "There is a need for a pause for thought, a little time. But soon you will have to make up your minds about whether or not you want joint defenses. Joint defenses are probably much cheaper than retaining neutrality." As far as a common currency is concerned, the Spanish Government and opposition are in complete agreement. Nobody really wants to start planning for it yet, but both view it as a natural development. Isabel Tocino sees no possibility for Sweden to preserve its neutrality in the event of membership. "Before we ratify the agreement we must look at the Swedish attitude. I reiterate that there is no room for neutrality if you want to create a union. A country cannot stay outside and think that it can do what it thinks is most comfortable. When you join a union you have to accept and live by its rules."
