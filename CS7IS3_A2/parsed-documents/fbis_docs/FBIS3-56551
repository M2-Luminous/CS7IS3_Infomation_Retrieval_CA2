We are especially pleased by President Clinton's strong support for the withdrawal of Russian troops in early 1994. Meeting its international commitment to do so is, in my opinion, the best way to demonstrate Russia's sincerity in respecting Estonia's sovereignty and independence. After all, what country can be called sovereign and independent if foreign troops continue to be based on the territory against its will. On the issue of human rights, another topic to come up in the meetings between the two Presidents, Estonia is pleased to agree with the findings of the United States Department of State in its report of January 1993 as well as of the CSCE Commission of the United States Congress in its exhaustive study of the issue published in September 1993. Those reports found, along with over a dozen other international organizations, that Estonia belongs to that group of free nations where human rights are not violated. I quite agree with the comments by President Yeltsin that double standards should not be applied to the question of human rights. We of course know that Russia has used human rights as a political tool. President Yeltsin's comments are clearly an attempt to sway international public opinion against Estonia and, as such, have nothing to do with the actual situation of Russians living in Estonia.
