Meanwhile officials in the capital accused southern forces of massing troops along the former border which divided North and South Yemen before unification in May 1990. The official news agency SABA' said Salih, the rival of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, ordered that southern troops who surrendered after clashes Wednesday and Thursday in the 'Imran region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa, would be free to return to their units. The ferocious tank battles left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others wounded, according to journalists. But the Defence Ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed and 119 wounded, while an unknown number of others had fled or disappeared. Salih said he had ordered the state to pay for 11 seriously wounded southern troops to be flown abroad for hospital treatment, SABA' reported. Three had already left Sanaa for Jordan Saturday. Northern military officials said several hundred troops of the southern third armoured brigade at 'Imran had joined the northern forces. A Defence Ministry spokesman in Sanaa said 85 tanks were destroyed in the fighting, which caused more than 500 million dollars' worth of damage. Salih pledged that the buildings hit in 'Imran would be rebuilt. The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000, have never merged since unification. Military officials in the capital said there were "large concentrations of southern troops along the former border" Sunday, and accused al-Bid's supporters of "wanting to push the country into a bloody civil war." The officials also said southern jets were buzzing northern units based in the Abyan region, east of the southern port city of Aden. Fighting erupted in Abyan in February and the officials said "secessionist" elements in al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) were planning fresh attacks on the northern al-Amaliqa brigade based there. Yemen's political crisis erupted in August, when al-Bid refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic and military reforms and citing security fears. yemen
