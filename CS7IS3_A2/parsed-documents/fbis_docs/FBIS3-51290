The Indians, who spoke to reporters in this city without disclosing their identity, said they were captured by Army troops 6 January in Altamirano and locked up all night inside a coffee warehouse in which there were at least "25 to 30 bodies." The group, which was arrested "for investigation" by the Army, claimed they saw the bodies, "which were already cold," moments before the soldiers blindfolded them and tied their hands, which show signs of cuts and bruises. The soldiers pushed the prisoners to the floor, very close to the bodies, and then lighted candles, warning them that "we are having a wake for them and we might as well have one for you, because we will shoot you tomorrow." The five Indians, all from Altamirano, recounted how they spent the night hand tied and blindfolded, lying down close to the bodies, and that the soldiers returned the following morning and evacuated them from the warehouse "with blows" and forced them into a military truck parked a few meters away. They added that from the truck they were able to see that the military personnel sprayed the warehouse with gasoline--and minutes later "we heard an explosion." The group was taken immediately to the town of Margaritas, where the military truck picked up four other people who were arrested and took them to the headquarters in Comitan, where there were "16 more prisoners," they stated. At the headquarters, the Indians were "interrogated, beaten, and tortured" with electric shocks and blows to the testicles, according to the account they gave to reporters. Later, they said, they were turned over to the Tuxtla Gutierrez judicial authorities where for the first time in their four days of capture they were able to "eat and drink water." Subsequently, they were confined to a cell of Prison Ward Number 1 "along with 35 more Indians" of Chiapas. They added that in that cell they also saw "several Central Americans," including Hondurans, who told them they had been captured as undocumented and that the Army "forced them to say they were guerrillas." After eight days of captivity, the five Indians, who were arrested for presumed "criminal association," were released 14 January in this city by authorities, for lack of evidence. During the past few hours, international human rights organizations, including Americas Watch, and former U.S. District Attorney Ramsey Clark demanded that the Mexican Government clear up charges of alleged human rights violations of Indians and peasants by the Army in Chiapas. Two weeks after the rebel uprising in the southern part of the country, the government is trying to establish a dialogue with the rebels to halt the warring conflict, which thus far has left an official toll of 100 dead, a figure that local church organizations have estimated at over 400.
