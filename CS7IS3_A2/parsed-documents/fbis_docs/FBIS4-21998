FBIS4-21998 "jptot016__l94055" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 13 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA ISRAEL Bomb Blast in Hadera Bomb Blast in Hadera Initial Report TA1304070994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0653 GMT 13 Apr 94 TA1304070994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Excerpt] Here is a report just in: There was an explosion on a bus in the Hadera central bus station. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv is on the line with more details: The explosion occurred in the back part of the bus, near the rear exit door. We know that there were fatalities -- apparently one or two people were killed in the blast. I must stress that this is an initial report, and the details may not be final. There are wounded too, and they are being evacuated by ambulances to the Hilel Yafe Hospital in Hadera. Police have cordoned off the area and have already collected eye witnesses' testimonies about Arabs they had seen on that bus. Those who placed the explosive charge may have gotten off earlier. Searches are in progress. To repeat, an explosive charge went off aboard bus No. 820 from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. The charge went off when the bus got to Hadera. [passage omitted]
