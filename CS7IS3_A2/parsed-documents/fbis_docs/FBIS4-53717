This source added: As a result, the inner circle of the North Korean leadership has been seriously discussing the issue of having Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, become the successor. This source also said: During last December's party and government reshuffle, many of Kim Chong-il's confidants were relieved from their posts, and Kim Yong-chu, Kim Il-song's younger brother, who had disappeared from the North Korean power circle in the mid-seventies, reappeared. Rumors abounded at that time that something had happened to Kim Chong-il. However, the rumors abated in early March, when Kim Chong-il met with a General Association of Korean Residents in Japan delegation. However, the Kim Chong-il who appeared at that time may have been a "stand-in" [taeyok]. This source went on to say: North Korea sent Kim Pyong-il to Finland as ambassador last December to soothe Kim Chong-il's opposition to the expulsion of his confidants from the leadership but called him in later. Kim Pyong-il again visited Pyongyang recently. This was possible because Kim Chong-il's power has waned significantly in a few months.
