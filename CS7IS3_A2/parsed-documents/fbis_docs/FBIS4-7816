Have the convulsions and tensions in political parties even reached the Croatian Peasant Party [HSS], the party that was the most pleasant surprise in the last zupanija elections, just a little more than a year ago? Was it precisely then, as some say, that the peasant cart began to go downhill, has peasant concord become more and more peasant discord, and has belief in God remained the only unquestioned maxim of the party? Is the history of the Croatian Peasant Party actually the paradigm of historical Croatian discord, which so many times has taken bloody tributes from us, of which we are perhaps witnesses even today? Yet another intraparty conflict or showdown is taking place in the (overcrowded) Croatian political space, this time between the top members of the Peasant Party. Although the party has been saying (in writing and verbally) that it is a question of party squabbles and differing views, there are quite a few people who say that this is a naked struggle for power and even a split in the party. Following the sharp division in the incumbent party, where thanks to Tudjman's strong position and intervention they managed to find a "middle" line as a compromise of the division into "right" and "left," following the open conflicts in the strongest opposition party, when Budisa nevertheless "survived" in the position of the party's top man, and after the fierce conflicts in the strongest regional party, which, it seems, was also the most radical in settling "its affairs," it is now the turn of the "Croatian peasants" who, judging by all appearances, have applied the "Istrian models" in solving their problems. In short, Dr. Josip Stojanovic, chairman of the Executive Committee, and Mirko Mador, member of the party's presidium and a deputy in the House of Representatives of the Croatian parliament, have been suspended. The Kasina Meeting Although both Josip Stojanovic and Mirko Mador say that there is no split in the party and that they do not want to bring down Stipac (although Stipac brought them down, at least for the present), one gets the impression that the "peasants" have nevertheless been playing games and looking for justice. In the village Kasina (not far from Zagreb), there was a meeting of the party's Initiative Committee in order to offer, it was stated, support to the Executive Committee in its effort to achieve the most successful activity and organization of the party, especially of its central headquarters. The "Kasina group" of some 100 HSS members (some say even less, although that is no longer the point) met in the afternoon hours of Saturday, 26 February, the same day when the party's presidium held a meeting in the morning at which the decision was made to "dispatch" Mador and Stojanovic, although the "Kasina meeting" still had not begun. What is more, according to Mador, that decision was made even a day earlier, on Friday. In its meeting, the party's presidium adopted a unanimous decision to suspend the two members on grounds that "contrary to the provisions of the bylaws and without knowledge of the presidium, they organized and held a party meeting that same day in Kasina." Mador, on the other hand, says that from the legal standpoint it is completely legal to hold such a meeting ("After looking at the party bylaws, I saw that I was not violating any party regulation by holding a party meeting"), and it is also indicative that the party's presidium should judge a priori something which actually had not even begun. It is obvious that party confrontations had been prepared in advance in the apparently tranquil Peasant Party. "Since back in February we have been issuing warnings about the party's problems, especially the ineffectiveness of its central headquarters," says one of the "expellees," Dr. Josip Stojanovic. "That meeting in Kasina should have been closed to the public, at least until all the materials were turned over to Drago Stipac, the party's president, but that did not occur because Stipac did what he did. All the criteria and keys to election in the party are in the hands of the presidium, and those people render judgment, which is evident once again in this case." Gunfire From Wooden Rifles It is quite obvious that in spite of the desire to have it all take place "out of the public eye," the party's dirty linen has nevertheless come out in public, and the first step was actually taken by Mador in his open letter to Drago Stipac. "Yes, I wrote that letter during the meeting in Kasina, because we already knew about the suspension decision of the party presidium. That is in fact why I wrote very emotionally." Still, there is much that is unclear and foggy in the entire story. For example, why did Stipac expel only Stojanovic and Mador, although the Kasina meeting was attended by some 100 people, what are really the reasons of the conflict, did it all come down to personal animosities, to a naked party struggle for power, has the party at this point been equal to the new political realities and the increasing number of its members (according to certain indications, the HSS is the country's second largest party in terms of membership), is this a case of unclear ideological definition and unrecognizability, can it all be blamed on the "notorious moles" who obviously have not bypassed even the 90-year-old Peasant Party? "I still stand by what I wrote in the open letter," says Mirko Mador, "and that is that the HSS must be a general Croatian party, a party of the center, social and democratic. It must be a modern party, the wooden guns and hoes with which Macek created the Croatian banovina will no longer do, the Croatian peasant must be a policymaker, not the object of policy. The main trouble in the party is its ideological unrecognizability, in that the problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina was put ahead of Croatia in general, and it is also the party organization itself, its general ineffectiveness, especially that of the central headquarters. The party's growth trend, which has been marked, is not in line with the work of the central headquarters, and there are many things that are unclear concerning personnel and finances. The main party problem nevertheless came from outside, with the help of certain people within the HSS, and it is thanks to those people that the party was some kind of political appendage or hanger-on. Within our party, there were and are special-interest groups of the incumbent party and the strongest opposition party, various emissaries make their rounds, and the party has become a highly eligible maiden. All of that is politically unclear and morally disgusting. That is why I made my deputy's seat available, because my main interest is for the party to get on its own right road. So, along with the special-interest groups from outside, the main problems of the party are contained in the very conception of the party's organization and in its ideological unrecognizability." Suspend Me as Well The conclusion is drawn from all we have said that strange things have been happening for a long time now within the HSS, something that was mainly unknown to the public before Mador's letter, although the question might be put why Mador has hung out the party's dirty laundry at this particular point, is this nevertheless a struggle for power and the kind of lobbying in advance of certain important party meetings (perhaps even a party convention?), is Mador actually an HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] mole (that has also been said), or is it after all a struggle for some different HSS, as Mador says, "more acceptable from the generational standpoint, younger, better-trained, and more professional"? It nevertheless remains unclear why in his recent press conference Mador did not want to expose the alleged HDZ and Liberal "mole" even when the journalists insisted several times. Nevertheless, one learns behind the scenes that the names of Josko Kovac and Tihomil Radja are being spoken of as the men from the incumbent party and Budisa's party, respectively. Kovac himself says that in Dalmatia and Split the HSS is supporting President Stipac, and that the voices of the two men expelled and the group around them are a minority compared to the 40,000 members of the HSS who stand behind Stipac, and that "Stipac is too democratic, because if he were not, Mador and Stojanovic would already have been not suspended, but read out of the party." Radja, on the other hand, says that all of this is yet another attempt of the incumbent party to undermine the work of the HSS by provoking a conflict within it, indeed even with the help of a high government official ("let him recognize himself"). According to Radja, it is a question of HDZ "special operatives," i.e., of "members of the HDZ youth groups," while Mador's blow was "below the belt." "I openly support Stipac, who still has never made a single political gaffe, although that does not mean that some of his actions should not be criticized." The split in the party is obvious, there is evidence of that in the open letter of Josip Fajdic, the man who chaired the meeting in Kasina. According to Fajdic, the party central headquarters is itself the bone of contention, it is a question of "fossilized structures" which fall utterly short of the current political situation and general situation, as well as the needs of the party for more up-to-date political activity. So, in spite of the party's ideological unrecognizability ("let us move on, Mr. President, from Busovaca"), Fajdic concludes his letter with the request "that you suspend me along with the rest from the party, because I truly belong to that part of the HSS." An Impermissible Gaffe Is the HSS really facing perhaps its crucial and fateful moments, is Josko Kovac really right when he says that it is a question of "marginalized structures," or have Mador and Stojanovic only started an avalanche of malcontents who, as we see, have now been joined by Fajdic, but also by Nikica Novakovic, the first president of the revived HSS, also "dissatisfied with the way the party has been led by Drago Stipac, and with methods that have nothing in common with the doctrine of the Radic brothers"? We should also mention that the Medjimurje chapter of the party also favors reorganization of the HSS. On the other hand, however, Drago Stipac does not want to debate through the media the "accidental fellow travelers" in the party, he obviously wants to work this out behind the doors of the party, although the door is already cracked open. The man who is said to lead the party in an authoritarian way, who is said to be too old to lead the party, and who is said to be responsible for the party's ideological wandering, in which the valley of the Lasva has frequently been more essential than crucial problems in Croatia, and who is said to have committed certain impermissible political gaffes (in SRPSKI GLASNIK, Stipac talks about a federal Croatia and about the Serbs as a constituent nationality), will nevertheless have to respond very quickly to the charges which are becoming more and more frequent. Is the party too much submerged in populist and folklore rhetoric, has it become a kind of "peasant trade union," are its president and the seven vice presidents really "used up," people whose traditional HSS values simply have no place in a time that is half a century after Macek and the Radic brothers. There are many questions, but one thing is still quite certain: The party split in the HSS is obvious, the divisions run deeper than it seems at first, the only question is how, whether through a party convention, with full-scale preparations, or on the other hand "behind the scenes," the HSS will get its new victorious image.
