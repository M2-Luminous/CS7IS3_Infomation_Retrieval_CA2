Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and the Pacific affairs, said in a speech delivered at a university: "The ROK has successfully established democracy, and the human rights situation has considerably improved. The U.S. Government, however, still hopes the ROK Government will repeal the National Security Law." Answering a question regarding this at the National Assembly, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the ROK has never been informed of the U.S. Government's official position in connection with the demand for abolition of the National Security Law. I think, however, Mr. Hubbard's remarks reflect the U.S. Government's intent, in view of the U.S. State Department's criticism in its annual "Human Rights Report" released on 31 January pointing out "the National Security Law is still used to repress the freedom of expression, gathering, and travel." The U.S. view elicits our agreement as we have repeatedly urged the abolition of the National Security Law. Nevertheless, it is unpleasant that such insistence basically equals intervention in domestic affairs [naejong kansopsong chujang]. If the government's inflexible negative [pujongjok] position on repealing this law is still steadfast, I would like to ask the government if it is willing to officially protest to U.S. Government. In order to undergo [sohwa] the affront [moyok] to us by the United States, who we have considered a friendly nation, our government should review several things coolly. The government should review, above all, whether the situation of human rights in the ROK has sufficiently improved befitting a civilian government. The guarantee of human rights at the level in Western countries must become our ultimate and this is what the United States desires. The human rights situation in our country still lags behind the level we have tried to restore since the military dictatorial regime. Many conscientious prisoners are still suffering hardships behind bars, and the government does not have a deep interest in their release. This is one of the factors that prove the above. How can the government explain the inconsistency that it is pushing ahead with the South-North dialogue and summit talks while considering North Korea an antistate body [pan kukka tanche]? The government also needs to closely examine if this incident [satae] is a sign of delicate changes [mimyohan pyonhwa] in the U.S. Government's policy on North Korea. It does not have to pay attention to the fact that Mr. Hubbard has been the chief delegate to North Korean-U.S. contacts in New York, or to his expected role in the forthcoming third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The government must remind itself of the fact that it is the first time a U.S. high-ranking official has openly mentioned the abolition of the National Security Law, although the United States has recognized that this law is being used to repress people's human rights, as revealed in the annual "Human Rights Report." We now need to have enough keen insight to understand that the United States cannot help but make some changes in its policy toward North Korea to improve relations and to predict what those changes will be. It is needless for us to explain again why the National Security Law -- which, backed by anticommunist ideology, has been abused as a means of infringing upon human rights -- must be abolished. I would like to stress again, however, that various issues can be resolved at the same time upon the abolition of this law.
