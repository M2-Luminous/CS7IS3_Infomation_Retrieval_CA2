SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Although not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2). A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations when the Government has decided not to seek further review of that decision or is unsuccessful on further review. We will apply the holding of the Court of Appeals decision as explained in this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling to claims at all levels of administrative adjudication within the Fourth Circuit. This Social Security Acquiescence Ruling will apply to all determinations and decisions made on or after July 7, 1994. If we made a determination or decision on your application for benefits between June 29, 1987, the date of the Court of Appeals' decision and July 7, 1994, the effective date of this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling, you may request application of the Social Security Acquiescence Ruling to your claim if you first demonstrate, pursuant to 20 CFR 404.985(b) or 416.1485(b), that application of the Ruling could change our prior determination or decision. If this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling is later rescinded as obsolete, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register to that effect as provided for in 20 CFR 404.985(e) or 416.1485(e). If we decide to relitigate the issue covered by this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling as provided for by 20 CFR 404.985(c) or 416.1485(c), we will publish a notice in the Federal Register stating that we will apply our interpretation of the Act or regulations involved and explaining why we have decided to relitigate the issue.

Issue Whether, in making a disability determination or decision on a subsequent disability claim with respect to an unadjudicated period, an adjudicator must adopt a finding regarding a claimant's residual functional capacity, or other finding required under the applicable sequential evaluation process for determining disability, made in a final decision by an Administrative Law Judge or the Appeals Council on a prior disability claim arising under the same title of the Social Security Act.* * Although Lively was a title II case, similar principles also apply to title XVI. Therefore, this Ruling extends to both title II and title XVI disability claims.
