Law Minister Syed Hamid Albar said several other draft amendments to the Constitution were approved, including the appointment of judicial commissioners, clarifying the practice of constitutional monarchy and the appointment of a Chief Justice for the Court of Appeal. He said the amendments would be tabled in Parliament in April or May. With the setting up of the Court of Appeal, there will be three levels of higher courts -- the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Syed Hamid said this would enable the country to have a three-tier system. "Any judge who is qualified for the High Court will be able to sit in the Court of Appeal," he said, adding that there would be a panel of judges for the court. He said the Chief Justice for the Court of Appeal would be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong [Paramount Ruler]. Syed Hamid was speaking to reporters at his office after the weekly Cabinet meeting. On the code of ethics, Syed Hamid said the Cabinet had approved a new provision to Article 125(3) of the Constitution. "The new provision will allow for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to prescribe a code of ethics which should be observed by judges." Syed Hamid said the code of ethics would cover the performance and duties of the judges in terms of their honesty and integrity. "Any judge who breaches the code of ethics will have action taken against him including being dismissed from his post," he said, adding that the Lord President [Chief justice of Federal Courts Malaysia] would decide if any judge had breached the code. The public had a right to details about the code of ethics as it would be a step towards creating a better public image for judges. Syed Hamid also said the Cabinet had approved the substitution of the word "misbehaviour" in Article 125 with "any breach of the code of ethics". "The Cabinet has also approved that the word `advice' in Article 40 of the Constitution be defined to avoid misunderstanding," he added.
