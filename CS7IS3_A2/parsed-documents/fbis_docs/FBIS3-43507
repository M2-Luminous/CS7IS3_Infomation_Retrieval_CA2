The attack is said to have left several victims, and the Guinean Army was dispatched to the spot. From Conakry Ben Daouda Sylla has more details: [Begin Sylla recording] The incident on 5-6 January in the town of Macenta, situated 820 km to the south, seems to be a reprisal against the (Konyianke) ethnic group, which makes up the majority of the ULIMO fighters. A week ago, ULIMO mistakenly attacked and decimated a group of Tooma tribesmen from Macenta, who had gathered for an initiation ceremony in a sacred forest near a border village. Some eyewitnesses say that this village was Niaguerazou, in the northwest of the prefecture. Persons contacted by telephone Thursday night gave contradictory figures concerning the dead ranging from two to a dozen. The incident reportedly occurred in the center of the town, with some houses being burnt down -- including that of the mayor of Macenta. Reinforcements sent from Conakry, Dikedoue, and Nzerekore reportedly have brought the situation under control, and persons from the border areas of Zimi, Taourou, and [words indistinct] have been tracked down.
