According to reports from authorities, apparently a new subversive group calling itself the Putumayo Liberation Organization [Organizacion Para la Liberacion de Putumayo], whose members are EPL [Popular Liberation Army] dissidents, was responsible for the kidnapping. The objective of the guerrillas was to obtain money to strengthen their movement economically. [Begin Ruales de Laso recording] I told them this was not the way to help the country. I told them that if we all worked together, but not the way they are doing things, Putumayo would advance. [end recording]
