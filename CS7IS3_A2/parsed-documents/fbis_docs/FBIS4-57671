Reina added that Gore's trip to Tegucigalpa to meet with Central American presidents "is not by chance, because Costa Rica used to be the favorite nation; it is a message of recognition for the type of government Honduras has by popular mandate." The Honduran president told journalists that such issues as the environment, human rights, corruption, foreign debt, and sustainable development with a "human face" are included in the summit agenda. According to Reina, the objective of this meeting is to define the course the presidents will follow during the 14 June Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, and the December Americas Summit in Miami. Presidents Ramiro De Leon Carpio (Guatemala), Alfredo Cristiani (El Salvador), Jose Maria Figueres (Costa Rica), Guillermo Endara (Panama), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua), and Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel were invited to the meeting. A Foreign Affairs Ministry communique states that the Central American presidents will arrive in Tegucigalpa on 23 May to meet on that day "as a prelude to the U.S. vice president's arrival." According to the Foreign Ministry, Central American experts will meet on 21 May to draft a common agenda to follow during the summits.
