The tablets should be for "hysteria, suspicion and other types of devilish possession". "There is a feeling that Zhirinovsky has succeeded in creating the situation of hysteria and suspicion", Kozyrev told reporters after meeting international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg on Tuesday. He was evidently referring to statements of Zhirinovsky who said that air strikes on Bosnian Serbs will be viewed as an attack on Russia and promised to use an alleged secret sonic weapon in retaliation. But Kozyrev expressed hope that there would be no air strikes on Bosnia although the possibility is not ruled out in the framework of the UN Security Council resolutions and only in "extreme cases". He added that "punishment strikes" are "absolutely inadmissible". However, the foreign minister admitted that "hypothetically the possibility of air strikes exists" in case UN peace-keepers are attacked by any of the conflicting sides while fulfilling their humanitarian mission. Kozyrev said that the UN secretary general had named Srebrenica and Tuzla as the regions where a threat to UN forces exist. "Luckily, talks with the Serbian side resulted in an agreement on help in replacing the Canadian battalion with a Dutch one. Diplomatic work to unblock the situation in Tuzla is going on which is possible with a direct Russian participation", Kozyrev said adding that attacks on UN convoys are staged not only by Serbs, but by Muslims and Croats as well. Lord Owen thanked Russia for "a very constructive role" on all stages of the work to reach a political settlement. None of the three warring parties can secure a military victory and a solution can be found only at the negotiating table, he told TASS. He expressed hope that the conflicting sides will resume negotiations in the coming weeks to "find a compromise on those inconsiderable contradictions which still exist". Owen urged to continue humanitarian aid supplies to the civilian population in conditions of a harsh winter.
