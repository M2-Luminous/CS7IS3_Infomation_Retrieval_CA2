"At last, it has learned to offer due resistance to Armenian offensives," he pointed out. Sadykhov said that all Armenian attempts to launch an offensive over the last months "have been successfully repelled." The state advisor indicated two reasons for Azerbaijan's military successes for the last month and a half. Firstly, the Azerbaijani armed forces have stood up on their own feet, surmounting obstacles, gaining strength, raising combat readiness, and forming various units. Secondly, the Azerbaijani army got a second wind after Geydar Aliyev's election as president and his appeal to the people last November. "Then, all people recovered their self-confidence, many deserters started to return to their units, and the army became better equipped with hardware," the state advisor said. As a result, the situation along the front line has gradually stabilized. An avalanche-like Armenian offensive was stopped, and a possibility to start "clearing Azerbaijan's territory from occupants" appeared. Sadykhov said "we had managed to free certain parts of the occupied territories." At the same time, the official admitted that the republican army's current state could hardly be characterized as "high combat readiness." He said Azerbaijan desperately lacked military experts. Sadykhov added that "last autumn's army draft plan was over- fulfilled." He pointed out that people started to ask to be sent to the army, to the front line, after the president's appeal."
