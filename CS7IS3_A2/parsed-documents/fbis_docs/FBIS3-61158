The Agrarian Crisis Will Continue Unless the Government Attitude Toward Rural Areas Changes"] [Text] Agrarian reforms have been under way for three years in Russia. It is now possible to sum up certain results and look to the future. But first--about their initial base. It is known that the Russian Federation had exaggerated specialization of the national economy. By 1989 the branches of group A here (the military-industrial, fuel-energy, metallurgical, machine building, and chemical-timber complexes) accounted for more than 70 percent of the gross national product. Immense quantities of their output went to other republics and CEMA countries, and also to the West. The share of the agro-industrial complex was only 15.2 percent. For comparison: in the Baltic countries it exceeded 50 percent. And about two-thirds of what was produced was consumed locally. The center did not devote the proper attention to Russian agriculture. Farms of Russia received less in capital investments, fertilizers, technical equipment, manufactured concentrated feeds, construction materials, and energy resources per 100 hectares of arable land. The capital availability for agriculture in Russia, for example, was 12 times less than in the Baltic region. The disparity was just as great in the levels of land reclamation (88.5 percent in Lithuania and 6.2 percent in the RSFSR), the provision of natural gas, and social structuring of the rural areas. For this reason there were more and more ghost towns that had lost their able-bodied population. The demographic crisis became irreversible in a number of regions. And the demand for food products in Russia was covered through three sources: its own production, deliveries from Union republics, and imports. The last two items provided for more than a third of all the consumption. Such were the starting conditions for the agrarian reforms. It seems that because of these, the collapse of the Union and previous ties dealt an especially painful blow to the food supply for Russians. Well, one learns from one's mistakes. Of course it would be better to learn from others'. But since this is the way it has turned out.... In other words, it is necessary to restructure the entire economy, assigning a larger role in it to the agro-industrial complex. But it seems that once again life has not taught us a thing. The share of the agro-industrial complex in the national economy not only is not growing, but is rapidly decreasing. And it is not difficult to guess the result: a rapid collapse of production. In terms of per capita consumption of meat and milk, we have dropped back to the 1965 level. The number of Russians is decreasing. In 1992 the natural attrition amounted to only 200,000 people, while the preliminary estimate for this year was about 600,000. And still today there is not even the smallest significant social group of the population that would be against the reforms. Debates about how to conduct them are another matter. Throughout the year, over 500 days, or according to the Stolypin method: "Leave me alone for 20 years and I will make Russia prosperous"? During three years of reforms, about 170 million hectares of arable land have been turned over to the ownership of agricultural commodity producers. A multiple-system economy is being created. Hundreds of thousands of peasant farms have been registered. Millions of city dwellers have received garden plots and orchards, and land is being allotted for residential buildings. The system of administration is changing. There is no longer the previous dictatorship from the center. What to plant, what production structure to have, how to use profit--these things are being decided by the people themselves. This is good. The only problem is that the rural areas are continuing to decline from day to day. And one cannot agree with those who justify this rapid collapse. They say that it is necessary to pay for the reforms. The experience of other countries does not confirm this. In China during 12 years of reforms, the gross agricultural output increased 2.2-fold, meat production--3.7-fold, fish production--2.8-fold, and sugar production--3.5-fold. These reforms were based not on ideological but on economic principles. The Chinese say: "The color of the cat makes no difference as long as it catches mice." Instead of having a clear-cut concept of our own, we are inclined to borrow others' models. Hastiness in the development of legislative and normative documents and standard formulas for reform of all of the immense area of Russia without preliminary checking in various regions has led to mistakes and pro forma actions. One of them was the attempt to solve the food problem solely through deep reformation and change in the forms of ownership and management. We must be realistic. This alone will not stabilize production or increase its effectiveness. Especially when deliveries of technical equipment, fertilizers, and construction materials to agriculture are being catastrophically reduced. When procurement prices for agricultural products are growing much more slowly than the prices of industrial products for rural areas. Because of the lack of equivalence in exchange, rural areas are failing to receive hundreds of billions of rubles. With the destruction of the state procurement system, numerous middlemen and speculators attach themselves to rural commodity producers like barnacles on an old ship. Rural residents sell their goods for three to five times less than we buy them for in the stores. As we can see, it is by no means the agricultural workers who are to blame for the high retail prices. Because of the impoverishment of the masses, even the significantly curtailed production remains largely unconsumed. In many regions of Russia, an immense quantity of butter, meat, grain, and potatoes has accumulated in the warehouses. At the same time, the state continues to buy them abroad at higher prices. The government is ripping off the rural residents, forcing them to sell grain at prices set from above without paying for it. At the same time, peasants today have to pay in advance for every nail, while for products that are produced the prime minister is promising that by the new year a maximum of 80 percent of the debt of more than 2 trillion will be paid. By that time the ruble will be worth even less. In the past the peasantry took on the job of accelerated industrialization and restoration of the national economy destroyed by the war. Today an attempt is being made to make it responsible for emerging from the financial crisis. But even Adam Smith said that the country gives the city exactly the same amount as the city gives the country. High prices of industrial goods and high taxes have sharply reduced investment activity and have blocked structural changes in the agro-industrial complex which are necessary for the formation of a market. And this predetermines the long-term tendencies toward decline of production. The already weak social sphere of the rural areas is being destroyed. But perhaps the most terrible thing is the degradation of the production and scientific-technical potential and the fertility of the soil. The gene pool of the animals, breeding work, and seed growing are being destroyed, and production construction has been reduced many times over. Fixed capital is aging, and the load per tractor and combine is increasing. Capacities and work force are engaged in repair of machines and equipment just as they are in agricultural machine building. A process of physical disintegration of productive forces has begun, and the demand for scientific and technical products is decreasing. Nonetheless, the state refuses to grant subsidies to agriculture. Although in the West, even with a surplus of foodstuffs, the governments grant immense subsidies to the farmers. Incidentally, in developed countries, approximately half of the increase in production of food products comes through technical progress. Government leaders justify their policy with respect to agriculture by saying that the state has no funds. Although it is known that the enterprises and citizens pay immense taxes. Prices, apartment rents, and the costs of other services have increased many times over. Energy resources, timber, and metal are being exported in considerable quantities to nearby and distant foreign countries. There are many holes. They include the bloated state apparatus, which has occupied not only all republic buildings, but also the buildings of the former Union ministries and departments. Numerous bureaucrats of the state apparatus are receiving wages that are several times higher than those of world-renowned scientists. Today a large proportion of the members of government, especially deputy prime ministers, are bending over backwards--they travel through foreign countries trying to scare up a billion and a half or two billion dollars in credit. At the same time, with the help of their own government, funds of Russian entrepreneurs amounting to more than $20 billion a year are sitting in Western banks. Creating an economic mechanism that would make it possible to motivate our entrepreneurs to invest this money in Russia's economy--this is what our government should be working on. And another large financial source would be to demand repayment of debts from republics of the former Union. After the proclamation of sovereignty by the parliament of Russia in 1990, there was the hope that we would become the masters of our own wealth, that we would develop the economy on the basis of our own advantage and determine an efficient specialization. Then the peoples of the former Union would know who is who. Because relations among independent states should be arranged on an equivalent basis and their well-being should be made directly dependent on labor productivity and the generation of capital as the basis of social justice. After all, it is known that of all the republics of the former USSR, only Russia previously had a positive balance in interrepublic exchange, and in 1989 it was more than $50 billion. Alas, Russia is continuing to supply its neighbors with energy sources, raw materials, and processed materials at extremely low prices. Because of the differences in prices (world and transfer) it annually loses $17 billion. With this kind of state foreign economic policy, where are we supposed to get the money to repay our debts to rural workers? Here it is necessary to resort to deception or, rather, get involved in the state rackets with respect to our peasants. Because we are not used to paying them their due. At the end of the 1920's, Stalin spoke about tribute from the rural areas as a temporary measure. Today this is considered to be an ordinary phenomenon: the peasant can be patient a little longer for the sake of the reforms. He has already been patient for 75 years! The agrarian crisis will continue unless the attitude toward it changes. Do not neglect the disease, esteemed state leaders!
