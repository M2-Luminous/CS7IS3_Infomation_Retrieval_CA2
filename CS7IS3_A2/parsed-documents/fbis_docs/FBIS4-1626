Before it was designated a province, Hainan Island was economically backward, but nowadays it has become one of the most vigorously growing regions in China. In the last few years, the provincial party committee and government has persisted in market orientation, continuously deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world, and thus achieved inspiring results in economic construction. In the last six years since the founding of Hainan Province, economic indexes such as gross domestic product and national income increased at an average rate of more than 11 percent a year. Nevertheless, as the economy developed at high speed, corruption was haunting Hainan like a specter. Hainan is a small province, with a population of only 68 million people. Last year it had three cases carried in nationally circulated notices. In the cases, Jiang Wei, former planning department director and Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general of the provincial government, took 100,000 yuan or so and tens of thousands of yuan in bribes respectively and, had thus their cases became well-known as two typical corruption cases. To punish corruption, the Hainan provincial party committee has worked hard to investigate and handle cases and done a lot of work in the last few years. The province has handled 4,421 cases of violating party discipline and investigated and dealt with 3,810 party members who violated discipline, of whom 15 were cadres at the departmental level and above, 126 cadres at the office level, and 694 cadres at the section level. Corruption has disappeared to some extent but in some aspects, it is continuing to spread. As the drive of reform and opening up spurs speedy economic growth, corruption is growing and spreading continuously. In early 1993 it was this grim situation that the new Hainan party provincial committee and government confronted. The facts are thought-provoking. Do reform and opening up bring about corruption? Apart from investigating and handling cases, are there any other more effective options in combating and punishing corruption? Through a thorough investigation and study, leaders of the party provincial committee reached a consensus: Some corrupt phenomena did appear in the course of reform. However, the fundamental cause for corruption lies with the lack of reform rather than reform itself. At a time when the old structure was being replaced by the new one, the old structure and the imperfect new structure were counteracting with each other. This gave corrupt elements an opportunity to make power-for-money deals. Hence, corruption was concentrated in the offices and departments which "dispose of resources under the planned economic structure" or retained the power of social micro-operations. The current spread of corruption is a phased phenomenon of structural transition and economic transformation and a kind of "transitional corruption." For example, as prices are being gradually unified, profiteers living on sales of approval documents and indexes and on "the dual-price gap" will gradually disappear from the scene. It is thus clear that to punish corruption, it is imperative to investigate and handle cases in real earnest. However, this alone is not enough. Only when reform is deepened and the legal system is perfected can the soil on which corruption breeds be scratched out. If the structure is not reformed and the legal system is not perfected, corruption will grow everywhere like half-cut Chinese chives. With this understanding, the party provincial committee and government intensified reform and determinedly expanded the tentacles of anticorruption work to the old structure last year. First of all, let us take the land market as an example. Land is a nonrenewable element of production. In a market economy, land resources should be disposed of by the market. To put it another way, land prices should be determined by the market and land should not be allocated by the government using administrative fiats. The land market in Haikou, Sanya, and Qiongshan was once thrown into confusion because land resources were disposed of by the government using administrative fiats and the resulting gap between government- offered prices and market prices ranged from several to 20 times. Some people would reap exorbitant profits overnight by selling the "pieces of land" they gained through connections or position, while the government's finances and taxes suffered losses. The masses were quite dissatisfied with such a practice. Last spring, Hainan resolutely adopted a tender system and auction method in land transfers, thus thoroughly reforming the land transfer method. In Qiongshan City, the auction price of a piece of land was 9 million yuan or so. Once the new move was taken, illegal land trading at a profit was immediately checked. Haikou even got instant results in this regard. Last year the city collected 1 billion yuan in land fees, much more than the total land transfer fees collected in the previous five years. While the cries for tenders in the land market have not yet subsided, more than 100 contenders have begun entering into a fierce rivalry in the "enterprise leader open recruitment activities" sponsored by the Organization Department of the Hainan CPC Provincial Committee. Four outstanding contenders successfully distinguished themselves and assumed the post of general manager in the four companies under the commercial and trade departments. The ways of using enterprise leaders under the old structure, such as "Bo Le seeing horses for himself [bo le xiang ma 0130 2867 4161 7456]" and "naming a person for a particular job behind closed doors" were apt to lead to unhealthy practices such as appointing people by favoritism, currying favor from upper circles, and sending gifts and practicing bribery. As such, Hainan was determined to "employ people with doors open to society" and boldly explored organization and personnel systems under the market economic structure. Haikou's reform of the tax collection and management system is another successful typical case of punishing corruption. The traditional tax collection and management system relied on tax staff, who collected taxes personally from the taxpayers. Every tax collector was assigned to collect taxes from 400 taxpayers. Malpractices such as abuse of power for private gain, embezzlement, and bribery could be found among some tax collectors. However, such malpractice could not be curbed despite repeated prohibitions. In the drive to "rectify unhealthy practices" alone, discipline inspection departments in Haikou investigated and handled 17 such cases with 18 persons involved. In June last year, the city deepened reform, abolished the tax collector system, and introduced unified computerized management, under which the taxpayers were required to pay taxes directly to relevant organs or through social agency organizations. Malpractices in tax collection and management have disappeared since then. For example, a certain enterprise was fined for tax evasion. When its manager personally went to the tax bureau director to ask for an exception, he saw the fine bill on the manager's computer screen, and he had to withdraw his request blushingly. Some reforms have been introduced such as changing the "enterprise legal person examination and approval system" into a "direct registration system"; removing the 10 barriers to enterprise examination and approval; changing the system of managing university student job assignments on graduation into a system under which "the supplier and the end-user meet" and choose each other and students on graduation seek jobs themselves in society; introducing an all- worker contract system by breaking the demarcation line on identity, encouraging fair competition, and carry out a job assessment system; and introducing a tender system in distribution of export quotas. The reforms have a common special characteristic -- operational procedures being simplified, standardized, open, and fair, and arbitrariness in doing things being reduced. Like double-edged swords, the reforms thrust directly into the old structure and systems. Thus, the intensity of reform was increased and corruption was checked once and for all. "Veteran discipline inspectors," such as Cao Bailin, deputy secretary of the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee and Xie Mingren, secretary of the Haikou City CPC Committee, maintained: In regard to discipline inspection and supervision work, there is also the question of micro and macromanagement and of effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary solution. Investigating and handling specific cases belongs to micromanagement and bringing about a temporary solution. Deepening reform and establishing a new structure will help solve recurring problems. This belongs to macromanagement and effecting a permanent cure. In discipline inspection work, if we are satisfied with limited investigation of cases and do not adapt ourselves to the objective requirements of the new situation for anticorruption, we will find it difficult to keep the initiative in anticorruption work. Effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary solution are the two aspects of anticorruption. Neither should be overemphasized at the expense of the other. While striving to effect a permanent cure, Hainan did not relax in the slightest degree in its efforts to investigate and handle cases of corruption. From January to December last year, the discipline inspection and supervision departments of the province placed 733 cases of party and government cadres violating discipline for investigation and prosecution, punished 650 party members who had violated discipline, of whom seven were cadres at the departmental level and above, 34 were at the office level, and 166 were at the section level. Some typical cases were exposed to the general public and the several unhealthy practices against which the masses of people had strong complaints were effectively rectified. Deepened reform and anticorruption have injected new vitality into economic construction. The province's economy is developing healthily and at high speed. The main economic indexes, such as gross national product and local financial revenues showed relatively big increases over the previous year. While many people have some confused ideas about the launching of anticorruption struggle at a time when the old structure is being replaced by a new one, the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee conscientiously implemented the party Central Committee's strategic plan of "grasping reform and opening up in the one hand and grasping anticorruption in the other," and has proven with its fruitful explorations and practice that the dialectical unity of "anticorruption and deepening reform" has opened a path of effecting both permanent and temporary solutions to fighting and eliminating corruption in the new period.
