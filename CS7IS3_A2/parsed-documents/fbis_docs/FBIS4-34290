But they will no longer occupy buildings or demonstrate for bigger budgets. They will come to study, if they want. On 9 June, the four university associations decided to lift the strike that halted classes and research at the university. The strike lasted 45 days but teachers and employees continued receiving their salaries. The strike started on 25 April. It was staged in demand of a 20 percent salary increase [for faculty members] that, according to students, was the cost of living increase last year and was what the government promised to give the faculty in April 1993. What students finally got was a 6 percent increase through a law approved by Congress that interpreted a previous decision and that, according to the University Inter-Association, "merely corrected the illegal discrimination against the university." The students also collected 436,400 signatures in support of a plebiscite proposing a constitutional amendment to assure bigger education budgets in general. [passage omitted]
