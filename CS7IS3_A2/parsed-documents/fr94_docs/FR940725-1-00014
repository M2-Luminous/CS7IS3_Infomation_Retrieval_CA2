For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes to amend 12 CFR part 325 as follows: PART 325_CAPITAL MAINTENANCE 1. The authority citation for part 325 continues to read as follows: Authority : 12 U.S.C. 1815(a), 1815(b), 1816, 1818(a), 1818(b), 1818(c), 1818(t), 1819(Tenth), 1828(c), 1828(d), 1828(i), 1828(n), 1828(o), 1831o, 3907, 3909; Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, 105 Stat. 1761, 1789, 1790 (12 U.S.C. 1831n note) Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2236, 2355, 2386 (12 U.S.C. 1828 note). 2. In appendix A to part 325, section II.E. is amended by revising the first sentence of the introductory text of II.E.1. and removing the footnote in II.E.1.(a); removing the last two sentences of the second paragraph of II.E.2.; and adding new II.E.3. to read as follows: Appendix A to Part 325_Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital * * * * * II. *␣*␣* E. *␣*␣* 1. Credit Equivalent Amounts for Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Rate Contracts. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section III.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (which is equal to the mark-to-market value 39 and is sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract. *␣*␣* 39 Mark-to-market values should be measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in both interest (or foreign exchange) rates and in counterparty credit quality. * * * * * 3. Netting. (1) For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting of rate contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that: (a) The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included individual contracts, with the effect that the bank would have a claim or obligation to receive or pay, respectively, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to any of the following events: default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances. (b) The bank obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from a failure to perform due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances, the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under: (i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities and, if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts covered by the netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract.
