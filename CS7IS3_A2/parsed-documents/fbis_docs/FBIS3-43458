His victory has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Conakry. The opposition, which is determined to come together and begin consultations, says it is not surprised by President Conte's victory. Here is the opinion of Siradiou Diallo, chairman of the Party of Renewal and Progress [PRP], in an interview with Carmen Diop: [Begin recording] [Diallo] Everybody can be surprised by this confirmation -- but not we of the PRP. Our party had for a very long time before the polling day known that everything had been set to proclaim the president elected right from the first round. That is why the opposition held a series of meetings to decide not to participate in the polls, which was going to be a real masquerade. The president could not have an absolute majority right from the first round; it is technically and practically impossible. However, he was declared the winner. We think this is a forced victory, and this result is far from the rules of democracy. It is rather thanks to his military force that he has been reelected. [Diop] How do you plan to react to this? [Diallo] Right now, we have asked our supporters and the whole party to remain calm for the moment -- not to indulge in an uncontrolled reaction. This a matter which should be studied in detail before embarking on a new course of action or strategy. But all this, in our opinion, should be done with the other opposition parties. [end recording] The reaction from the committee of support for President Conte's action in France is that Guineans should put an end to postelection wrangling and get down to work. The challenge facing the country today is economic redress, as the chairman of this association explains to Carmen Diop: [Begin recording of unidentified official] We shall continue to work for Lansana Conte and his actions, and we appeal to all opposition political parties and their outfits, after exhausting all institutional avenues for redress, to respect the verdict of the polls, so that Guineans can get to work, because we have no right to waste time. We have wasted time for 26 years, I think Guineans must roll up their sleeves and get to work -- by taking up the challenges of under development. [Words indistinct] many Guinean students are indignant concerning the insulting statements made by a representative from an obscure Guinean students association. The entire presidential support group wants to reaffirm that the 19 December 1993 elections were not a masquerade. [end recording]
