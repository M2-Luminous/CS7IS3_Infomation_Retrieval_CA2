The Chinese Government's conception of Hong Kong's political system after 1997 was to maintain the British Hong Kong Administration's status quo essentially unchanged, being depicted in Liao Chengzhi's [1675 2110 1807] terms as "a change of national flag," with "the Hong Kong governor becoming a Hongkonger appointed by China." But the Sino-British Joint Declaration's Appendix 1 on the SAR's political-system clause differed substantively from the Chinese Government's original conception. In the drafting of the Basic Law, the sharpest controversies were mainly in two areas: 1) On "the Hong Kong SAR's enjoyment of executive, legislative, independent judicial, and final judgment authority." 2) On "the Hong Kong SAR's legislature being elected, with the executive having to observe the laws and being responsible to the legislature." The crux of the controversy was: Would the SAR's political system be one of a tripartite balance of powers, with mutual checks and balances? Would the "executive" or "legislature" dominate? As I did not take part in the Sino-British talks (as Li Jusheng [2621 5468 3932] had blocked me from the early-stage talks), the only records that I could see were mostly "verdicts," making it very hard for me to see the crux of the controversy. But by the time of the drafting of the Basic Law, the controversy came to light. I guessed at the time that the Chinese consideration for after 1997 was that: As the former colonial government was not democratic, it would need to be changed somewhat; and these Chinese democratic plans had induced the British to promote a representative system. Or possibly it was the British who had proposed the representative-system idea in the talks. But regardless of which side was responsible for it, it was certain that the Chinese had never reckoned during the negotiations with Britain's "surreptiousness" before the two sides had even reached agreement, in that it would "rush" to promote the representative system during the last 12 years of its jurisdiction, to change its promise in the Sino-British Joint Declaration to "return administration to China" into "returning administration to the people." (While the Sino-British Joint Declaration had stated that "the two kingdoms jointly declare that the governments of the two kingdoms will return Hong Kong to the PRC on 1 July 1997," the British had still set forth in a "white paper" the "need to gradually establish at the Administration's central level a representative system that is more directly responsible to the people and firmly rooted in Hong Kong.") Li Hou [2621 0683] [deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO)] did not at first seem to understand Britain's plot. At a meeting in Macao of the Basic Law Political System Group that he chaired, he had proposed that the future SAR Administration would practice a "separation of powers" program, with executive, legislative, and judicial authority being separate and having mutual checks and balances. This not only was out of line with the understanding of the Central Government's views by the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee of the time, but also before long was disagreed with by Deng Xiaoping as expected. As to the executive being "responsible" to the legislature, Lu Ping [7627 1627] [deputy secretary general of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong SAR and deputy director of the HKMAO] explained this to Hong Kong reporters as being legislative consultation, just as the then relationship between the British Hong Kong Administration and the Legislative Council (LEGCO). And the response to public calls for the British Government to explain this was also very vague. I doubted at the time whether the "senior advisor" of the Chinese Planning Committee would clarify the issue in the Sino-British talks. This was because in a discussion of the "decade of great changes remaining in effect for 50 years" by the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee, its "chairman," Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] [chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong SAR and director of the HKMAO] had sighed to me about the provision on "the legislature being elected," that "he had not added consultation' at the time, as he had not fully reckoned with Britain's (intentions)." (The Sino-British Joint Declaration provided that the SAR Chief Executive would be produced through either election or consultation.) The British Hong Kong Administration's "surreptitous rush" to promote a representative system touched off a wave of democracy unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. This was the British Hong Kong Administration's brilliant "public opinion card" stroke, which intensified Hong Kong's social division and unrest. Outstanding mid-level and grassroots figures, who had no confidence in China and were dissatisfied with the public status quo and their own plight, came out with calls for rushing to democracy, some of whom were dependent on British Hong Kong largesse while considering it inadequate. Of course, many were also trying to exploit the struggle between China and Britain to win democracy from both sides. While this led to a surge toward democracy by various types, the "silent types" were probably still in the majority. It should be pointed out that while Hong Kong had never questioned the social climate of its politics, this [wave of democracy] began a fundamental change that has gradually evolved to turn Hong Kong into one of the world's regions with a rare and maximum political sensitivity. As to this wave of democracy, most of the upper levels of society were laden with anxiety. Most Hong Kong Chinese big bourgeoisie had been economically dependent on the British at first. And while some later had vanquished British capital in market competition, even supplanting it in some areas, they had not yet completely overcome this dependence, at least not financially. As they lacked political independence, their major aspiration was to maintain the status quo. Confronted with the ever-surging wave of democracy, they started out with no ideological preparation, and with even less preparation for playing the democracy game, which turned into concern that middle and lower class participation in and control over political affairs would change the status quo, bringing great calls for a "free lunch" and sharply higher taxes that would lose them their advantage in Hong Kong's moneymaking paradise. But while democracy was a wave that could not be opposed "rationally" or stopped with "force," leaving them for some time in a state of depression and vacillation, the process of drafting the Basic Law made some of them dependent on China, in order to cope with the Hong Kong democracy wave's ideas and actions. The big capitalists had the same position among both the British financial groups and the Chinese. Chia Tao-li [0857 6670 3810] endorsed and supported my "statement-storm" speech, as well as telling me directly after the 4 June incident that he supported the middle-of-the-road plan proposed by business world figures, such as Luo K'ang-jui [5012 1660 3843]. And Simon Kaise told me twice that he was dissatisfied with the position of Hong Kong's democratic radicals. They held that as Hong Kong was founded on stability, instituting democracy too quickly might cause unrest that would produce an investor-confidence problem.
