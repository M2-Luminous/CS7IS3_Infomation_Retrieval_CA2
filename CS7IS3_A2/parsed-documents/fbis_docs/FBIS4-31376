According to the announcement from President Gligorov's cabinet, at the beginning he emphasized that in accordance with his constitutional and legal competence and authorization, he had no jurisdiction to directly investigate the accusations of involvement of the State Security in the internal-party relations. In compliance with the clear constitutional and legal authorizations, Gligorov expressed full conviction that questions of this type should be raised and settled within the framework of the determined legal procedure. In that sense, President Gligorov underlined that the only competent place, according to the Constitution, which should deal with any kind of realizations or suspicion regarding the attitude of the State Security Service toward VMRO-DPMNE is the Commissions of the Macedonian Parliament for control of the work of the Security Service. Also, a procedure should be initiated before the competent organs -- the public prosecutor sand the appropriate Court, in relation to any kind of document concerning that. That is the only way to avoid any kind of speculations or mystifications regarding such serious accusations. Also, that is the only way to maintain the principles of democracy, the respect of the laws and the functioning of the government authority in the Republic. President Gligorov added that the building of a democratic atmosphere and the respect of the laws, as a lasting political orientation, had a special important in the present pre-election period in the Republic. That will contribute to the strengthening of the feeling that the basic national interest are respected, both in the country and abroad, and that the integrity of our country will be protected, both from internal conflicts and outside aspirations.
