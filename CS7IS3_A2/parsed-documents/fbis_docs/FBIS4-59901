He is bringing with him the Israeli Government's answers to a number of questions posed by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad during his last meeting with the U.S. secretary, in preparation for the resumption of the bilateral talks. No date has yet been set for holding these talks in Washington because of the fundamental differences that continue to separate the Syrian and Israeli positions. Certainly, the progress achieved so far has been too little and too slow. Syrian-Israeli differences revolve around the principle of implementing international resolutions, especially with regard to Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights in accordance with Security Council Resolution 242. So far Israel has refused to do so and has added a number of preconditions to any partial withdrawal to which it will agree. It is also evident that past U.S. efforts, including the shuttle trips by former Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary Christopher, have failed to bridge the existing major gap and, consequently, failed to give impetus to the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track. Naturally, creating such an impetus and emerging from the stalemate require serious U.S. positions that press for implementing international resolutions, particularly Resolution 242. Hence, talk about gradual and partial withdrawals from occupied Syrian lands without knowing the extent of Israeli commitment to full withdrawal, and a demand for full peaceful relations with a prior commitment to this, do not conform with the stated aims of the peace process and flagrantly contradict the required trust for peacemaking. In short, so that the U.S. secretary of state's upcoming tour of the region will not be similar to the previous ones, what is required today is more than the idea of partial withdrawal and is confined to clear Israeli respect for the resolutions of international legitimacy and the commitment to implement them. This will open the way to invigorating the talks. Such a development requires a real and serious effort by the U.S. secretary during his talks in Israel rather than in Damascus. Otherwise, the entire peace process will remain at a standstill despite the limited achievements made so far.
