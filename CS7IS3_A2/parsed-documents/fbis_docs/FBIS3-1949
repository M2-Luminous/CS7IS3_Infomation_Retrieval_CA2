Recently, our reporter visited the Xinzhonghua plant. Three large rockets --the "Long March 4, 2-J and 3 (Class I and II) carrier rockets, each measuring 30-40 meters in length, were seen lying alongside in the workshop of the general assembly plant which can be reached directly by train . These three rockets were assembled a year ago with great efforts by several thousand rocket experts and technical workers of the aerospace center in Shanghai, and they will be sent to a satellite launch center to shoulder heavy responsibilities. The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant is an aerospace base for assembling large-sized rockets in Shanghai. It has successively launched 16 man-made satellites on 12 occasions for the country. These included China's first meteorological satellite, first communications satellites, and first foreign satellite (China undertakes satellite launching task for foreign countries), and the first successful attempt to launch three satellites with one rocket. The 12 launches were all successfully executed, thus writing a glorious chapter in the history of China's space technology. The Xinzhonghua Machinery Plant also pursues the policy of "making both military and civilian products" by manufacturing rockets as well as freezers. So far it has sold more than 1 million freezer units for the space industry. Last year, the plant's total output value was approximately 300,000 million yuan, with annual profits exceeding 20 million yuan.
