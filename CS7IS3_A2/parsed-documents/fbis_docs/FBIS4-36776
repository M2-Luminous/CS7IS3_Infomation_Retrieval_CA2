The interview was conducted by Margaret Sheno. Its text is as follows: The Leader: Are you coming from America or from Egypt Margaret: I was not able to come directly to Libya. I arrived in Cairo and hired a car with an Egyptian chauffeur. I traveled to Tubruq and Banghazi then to here. I crossed half of Libya to you. I crossed the world. The Leader: We are sorry for the troubles caused by your government. Margaret: Is this a fact? The Leader: Certainly. Margaret: Can you explain the style of this tent design? Are the colours of a special significance? The Leader: That means the stars for the transparency of the sky and the sun. The yellow colour is for the desert. Margaret: In a certain phase of this interview I will talk about politics but as we have met in the desert I want to thank you and I am sorry for not being able to speak your language. Can we start now by politics. What does this all mean? The desert we are close to your birth-place? Is it not so. The desert is one of my ways of understanding who you are when you tell me something I can understand it better [as received]. Don't you believe me? Tell me about your origins. You are a man of military training and you have written the Green Book so what does the desert mean to you? The Leader: Firstly I am not a military man Margaret: You are a military man. The Leader: Since I was a student at the secondary school I started establishing the popular revolutionary movement and I created revolutionary cells. Margaret: At the secondary school. Amongst the students? The Leader: Yes, students and non-students. We joined the army in order that some of us pass through the army and use it for the revolution. I was not recruited as a professional soldier. I hate the military and I consider the military as a fascist organization. The military has destroyed the world it is the tool of invaders and tyrants which used it to cross the borders and injure the others and ruin the world. When I see the military badges I hate it because it reminds me of the badges of Mussolini and Hitler and then my theory calls for the abolition of armies as it calls also for the abolition of parties, parliaments, classes and governments. Margaret: When did you start thinking about the revolution? The Leader: Since I was 17 years old. Between [passage indistinct] the Libyans but in 1951 Libya was not like that. The Leader: I started establishing the revolution since 1959 Margaret: Why 1959? The Leader: That was the start of reason with me. It is then I knew that the third world was colonized and it is then I knew there was western colonization. Margaret: Was that in 1959? The Leader: Yes. At that time I was aware of it. Margaret: What was the western power? Was there the king? The Leader: In 1969 there were five American military bases in the Libyan territory. There were British bases, in fact armies, present here and there was the Italian settler colonization. Margaret: An Italian settler presence in 1969? The Leader: Yes. Margaret: Then according to you in 1969 even with the presence of the king or others Libya did not belong to Libya. The Leader: Certainly. Margaret: What about 'Abd-al-Nasir? Does he mean something to you? The Leader: He is one of the heroes of liberation in the world. Margaret: In what way? The Leader: Because he is a defender of freedom. The freedom of nations. It means that the nations lost an international defender. The cause of freedom lost by the death of 'Abd-al-Nasir. Margaret: The military has destroyed the world and created chaos as you said. But when you came to power for the first time you built the army with Soviet weapons, you went to the south to Chad. The Leader: That was in the beginning, but now it is over. It change [as received]. The army is abolished now and it is replaced by the armed people. Margaret: The armed people means the people with weapons. The Leader: No, it is the armed [word indistinct] now onwards. Margaret: You are saying that and you are smiling. The Leader: There is no state in the world that I did not survive its presidents and kings with the exception of Morocco and Jordan. Margaret: And Syria. The Leader: In Syria I survived three presidents since 1969. Margaret: Is that true but [Hafiz] al-Asad is a president for life as I know. What do you feel when you see the departure of these people? The Leader: I feel the intensity of my international experience. Margaret: Did you learn from these people? The Leader: Certainly. Margaret: What? Perhaps I am wrong but I mean the good things? The Leader: I know that. We call it the good lessons. Margaret: What did you learn from American presidents? The Leader: I knew what is America. America is not a nationality like other nationalities. Not like India or China or [words indistinct]. America is all the nations. All of us. We have made America and we are still making it. Even my sons if they go to America and stay there for ten years they will [words indistinct]. Margaret: Did your sons go to the United States? The Leader: No. They have got the desire to go but if America allows them. Margaret: Why do they have the desire to go? The Leader: The elder son wishes to be the son in law of the American president. Margaret: You are kidding. The Leader: No. Margaret: What daughter of the president, [words indistinct] Clinton I don't [words indistinct] don't like Arabs. Margaret: I do not believe your son will marry the daughter of the American president. I do not believe it. Perhaps your son got [word indistinct] better expression. Do you speak seriously? The Leader: Yes, I speak seriously. We have got a number of Libyan sons and they [word indistinct] Americans and offer sevices for the American people which they consider their people and they consider America as their second home. Some of them were educated there and remain there you have to thank us. We have highly prominent experts and scientists present with you. You have to thank the Libyan people . Margaret: Thank you. The Leader: Thank the Libyan people which is a small nation and even so they contributed to the making of America. Margaret: You always have a feeling and the awareness regarding the size of your country and you always hold comparisions between countries as big and small. The Leader: In respect of human beings we do not know of one big and one small. All the sons of Adam are equal -- it is you who know the big and small and the iron and wood. Iron and wood. With weapons. With wealth these are your scales for the big and small that is the American complex. You always [words indistinct] the people as big [word indistinct] Margaret: Let us forget the question of your son and marriage. Do they have a different feeling towards America? The Leader: We differentiate between America and the imperilaist policy. Margaret: Can you describe that to me. This will help me in explaining this issue to American readers. What are the American policies that you see? The Leader: The ruining of other nations' economies. Margaret: What nations? The Leader: All other nations especially the third world is still colonized and is not independent yet. Margaret: Even Egypt? The Leader: All of us. The third world will enter the phase of liberation. There will be no presence for the west in the third world, no tourist, no relation, no company, no investment and no trade. Margaret: And you support that. I thought you were a friend of President Mubarak. Is he aware that he is colonized? The Leader: Even Libya is not independent yet. The battle for independence did not begin yet. Margaret: All these western countries pump your oil. Why are you not grateful for them? The Leader: They need the oil and if we want to punish them we will stop the oil from them. Margaret: No. The Leader: We might do it. Margaret: What will you do for cash and resources? The Leader: We are not in need of cash. We need independence. Margaret: Why - I don't think so, especially oil. I have seen scores of Mercedes outside. The Leader: This is colonization. Margaret: You brought it. The Leader: We should have manufactured it here or else we drop it. This is the first step we have to take. We will not import goods from the west. And then [words indistinct] the force of the east will be sufficient rather than the west. Margaret: What is this force? The Leader: China, India, Malysia and Indonesia. Margaret: Do you have any relationship with this issue. Is it friendship or treaties? The Leader: We will shift to these countries so as to deprive the west from the billions they used to enjoy from our countries. Margaret: Who do you mean? The Translator: The west. The Leader: We will buy the goods from the Asian countries we will open our markets for them. We will [passage indistinct]
