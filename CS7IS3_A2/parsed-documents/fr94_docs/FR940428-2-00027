FR940428-2-00027 FR940428-2-00017 Golden Field Office; Grant Award to Howard University AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to Howard University for continuing research efforts in support of the Biological and Chemical Technologies Research (BCTR) program at DOE. The BCTR program seeks to improve operations and decrease energy use in the chemical and petrochemical industries. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: John W. Meeker, Contract Specialist, phone number (303) 275&hyph;4748. The Contracting Office is Paul K. Kearns. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Howard University has been conducting research for a number of years to develop genetic engineering techniques to enhance the capability of fungi/bacteria to degrade lignocellulose to simpler materials. Successful completion of this research would advance the public goal of converting biomass to useful chemicals and other products. A detailed understanding of the processes that control the reactivity and specificity of enzymatic reactions within the fungi/bacteria will provide the knowledge needed to exploit these reactions for technological applications. The proposed award will be an extension of work currently supported by the Department of Energy and constitutes an integral part of the DOE program by further developing genetic engineering techniques to enhance the decomposition of lignocellulose to simpler materials. This application represents a unique approach in this area and one in which the applicant has the exclusive capacity to perform as required. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research and that a noncompetitive award is duly justified. DOE funding for this grant is estimated at $150,000 and the anticipated period of performance is twelve (12) months. Issued in Golden, CO on April 18, 1994. Christine A. Phoebe, Director, Administrative Div., Golden Field Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10155 Filed 4&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
