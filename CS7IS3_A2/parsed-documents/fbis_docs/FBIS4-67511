As Fikret Dzhafarov, the chief of the department of planning for natural resource utilization of the Azerbaijani State Committee on Ecology, told ANS-PRESS, this project envisages beginning in the nearest future work on organizing an international conference on the Caspian Sea problems, in which CIS member countries will participate. According to Fikret Dzhafarov, a preliminary agreement already has been reached on Azerbaijan's participation in this forum. Baku is a possible site for the conference. The staff of the Azerbaijani State Committee on Ecology refuted information that Armenian leadership intends to insist on holding this conference in Yerevan, as well as ensuring participation of this country, along with the Caspian coastal countries, in this forum. However, as ANS-PRESS learned from reliable sources close to the Russian Government, such initiative on the part of Armenia has indeed taken place and it has been prompted by the fact that the EU underwrites all expenses on organizing and conducting this event. At the same time, at the recent press conference Paolo Lembo, head of the UN Development Program in Azerbaijan, remarked that it is Baku that should become the center of research on the Caspian Sea problems. On 2 May, William Nikoff [as transliterated], a UN Development Program adviser, is expected to visit Azerbaijan; he will also look into the Caspian problems reflected in the London report of the UN Development Program.
