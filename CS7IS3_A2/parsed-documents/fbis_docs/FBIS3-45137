They inspected Dayuan Iron and Steel Company Limited and Caili Aluminum Company Limited, both subsidiaries of Songdai Village Hengda Group Company. They listened to the report given by the leaders of Hengda Group Company. Songdai Village is a natural village with a population of over 600. Guided by the talks given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his southern China tour and the spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, the people in this village emancipated their minds, renewed their concepts, and boldly brought in talented people, technology, and funds. As a result, the village underwent marked changes. In 1993, the sales income of the village-run enterprises registered 120 million yuan and per-capita income for the year was over 3,000 yuan. Li Changchun also had an amiable conversation with the eight college graduates employed by the company who are from inside and outside the province. The college graduates said: The reason we came to Songdai Village Hengda Group Company is because this village has a united, practical, innovative, and enterprising leadership group. Here, we can bring our talents into full play and put our knowledge to practical use to realize the value of our life. Li Changchun was very positive of their bold and wise choice. After listening to reports, Li Changchun pointed out: Your village-run enterprises show that the ideas of the people in Songdai have changed a lot. It also indicates that township and town enterprises are a vast world where much can be accomplished. With the reform of the system of ownership and operational power, mixed economic sectors will be more and more common. It is necessary to break the established concept that township and town enterprises are inferior. In the future, no matter what ownership an enterprise is under, it must face market competition and excel. Township and town enterprises should be treated the same way as state-owned enterprises without discrimination in terms of enterprise categorization, grades of employment, and flow of professionals. Songdai Village is now a step ahead in accordance with the requirements of the establishment of socialist market economic system. It has attracted capable people and helped the whole society understand the value of capable people in a new light. I hope Zhengzhou City will take the first step in this respect and, in accordance with the principles of market economy, formulate a set of measures that encourage the rational flow of scientific and technological personnel. Li Changchun instructed Songdai Village Hengda Group Company to develop toward foreign orientation, high-technology, and integration; strive to upgrade its standards, increase varieties, and improve quality; proceed from reality and make a long-term and scientific plan; and make painstaking efforts in implementation. He also expressed the hope that Songdai Village will try to catch up with and surpass the star villages in the province in sophistication and efficiency and become one of the province's advanced enterprises as soon as possible.
