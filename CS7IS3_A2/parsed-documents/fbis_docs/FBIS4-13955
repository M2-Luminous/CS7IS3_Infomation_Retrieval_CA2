Members of the Jordanian delegation expressed high appreciation of Iraq's heroic, honorable stand under the brave leadership of President Saddam Husayn.

They stressed the inevitable victory of the banner of faith carried by President Saddam Husayn. Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf and religious affairs, also received the IAF delegation under 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah. During the meeting, the minister reviewed the dimensions of the unjust blockade imposed on the children, women, and elderly of Iraq. He said those who are besieging the Iraqi people are exercising double standards and do not hesitate to select oppressive resolutions to kill the lively spirit of the free, proud Iraqi people. 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah praised the militant, nationalist, and faithful campaign led by mujahid President Saddam Husayn. He said this campaign stresses the soundness of the Iraqi course, because it provides youth with immunity and explains to them the evil aggressive objectives targeting Arabism and Islam.
