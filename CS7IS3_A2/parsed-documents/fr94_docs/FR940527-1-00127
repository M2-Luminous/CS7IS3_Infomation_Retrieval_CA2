Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor for Changes in DRG Weights and the Geographic Adjustment Factor Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the Federal rate be adjusted so that estimated aggregate payments for the fiscal year based on the Federal rate after any changes resulting from the annual reclassification and recalibration of the DRG weights and changes in the geographic adjustment factor equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been made on the basis of the Federal rate without such changes. We used the actuarial model described in Appendix B to estimate the aggregate payments that would have been made on the basis of the Federal rate without changes in the DRG classifications and weights and in the geographic adjustment factor. We also used the model to estimate aggregate payments that would be made on the basis of the Federal rate as a result of those changes. We then used these figures to compute the adjustment required to maintain budget neutrality for changes in DRG weights and in the geographic adjustment factor. For FY 1994, we calculated a GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor of 1.0053. In this proposed rule, we are applying a factor of 1.00115. The GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors are built permanently into the rates; that is, they are applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. This follows from the requirement that aggregate payments each year be no more than it is estimated that they would have been in the absence of the changes from the annual DRG reclassification and recalibration and in the geographic adjustment factor. The incremental change in the adjustment from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is 1.00115. We note that this factor accounts for DRG reclassifications and recalibration and changes in the geographic adjustment factor. It also incorporates the effects on the geographic adjustment factor of FY 1995 geographic reclassification decisions made by the MGCRB compared to FY 1994 decisions. However, it does not account for changes in payments due to changes in the disproportionate share and indirect medical education adjustment factors or in the large urban add-on. 4. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor to Assure Aggregate Payments Equal 90 Percent of Reasonable Cost Payments Section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that aggregate payments made each year in FY 1992 through FY 1995 for hospital inpatient services be reduced in a manner that results in payments equal to 90 percent of the amount the Secretary estimates would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis for inpatient capital-related costs in that year. No retroactive increase or decrease is made if aggregate payments are greater than or less than 90 percent of actual Medicare inpatient capital-related costs for that year. Section 412.352 of the regulations provides that HCFA determines an adjustment to the hospital-specific rate and the Federal rate proportionately, so that the estimated payments for capital in each year from FY 1992 through FY 1995 will equal 90 percent of what would have been payable that year on a reasonable cost basis. The effect of this provision is that the reduction required under section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act is realized entirely through a reduction in the prospective payments for capital costs (that is, no reduction is made for this purpose in the reasonable cost payments for old capital) in FY 1992 through FY 1995. For FY 1994, we determined that a budget neutrality factor of 0.8947 was required so that estimated aggregate payments for inpatient capital-related costs would equal 90 percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis in that year. For FY 1995, we are proposing a budget neutrality factor of 0.7986. As we explain in Appendix B, we determine the budget neutrality adjustment factor on the basis of a projected FY 1995 capital costs per case budget neutrality target. We develop this target from available data on average Medicare capital costs per case for all short-term acute care hospitals subject to the capital prospective payment system (that is, data from excluded and waiver hospitals were eliminated). For the FY 1995 proposed rule, we have actual data for FY 1992 from the December 1993 HCRIS update. We also have revised estimates of the rates of increase in Medicare capital costs per case for the years FY 1993 through FY 1995. At the time of the final rule for FY 1994, we had estimated that there would be a 30.53 percent increase in Medicare inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and FY 1995. In this proposed rule for FY 1995, we estimate that there will be a 12.83 percent increase in Medicare inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and FY 1994, a decline of 13.56 percent (1.1283/1.3053=.8644, or ^13.56 percent) in the estimated rate of increase since the final rule for FY 1995. The following chart shows how the rate-of-increase estimates for FY 1992 through FY 1995 were calculated in the final rule for FY 1994 and in this proposed rule for FY 1995.
