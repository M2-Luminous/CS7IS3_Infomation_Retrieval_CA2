Disclosing this at a news conference here on Tuesday, the peace delegation of Mutahidda Ulema Council led by its Deputy Secretary General, Prof Mohammad Yahya, who returned from Kabul on Monday evening, claimed that both the warlords of Afghanistan, Rabbani and Hekmatyar have agreed to their peace formula with the exception of two points, which were still to be resolved. During their meetings with Afghan President and Prime Minister they found no real differences between the two rather they agreed in principle to the formation of an interim Shoora for framing electoral roll and meeting other requirements within a year [sentence as published]. But the bone of contention was that how and who would form the Shoora. Rabbani was of the view that Shoora should have at least one thousand members from all provinces while Hekmatyar wanted a Shoora of maximum hundred members only from Jehad forces, he disclosed. Mohammad Yahya said that the main objective of the peace mission was to coordinate the peace efforts of Jalaluddin Haqqani, he has been making since Ramadzan last, for striking a patch-up between the warring factions. He claimed that because of his successful mediation the agreement between Rabbani and Hekmatyar was only a few steps away as the main irritants have been removed. He said that the two parties were tired of fighting and wanted to put an end to hostilities for good. He said that during its three-day stay in Afghanistan, the delegation witnessed tremendous development in the peace process and considerable flexibility by the leaders of the warring factions as all of them were now ready to settle the dispute within the framework of the text of peace formula announced by the mediating commission of Haqqani. However, he alleged that some miscreants from both sides were sabotaging their efforts by escalating the fighting further. He claimed that apart from political circles all segments in Afghanistan welcomed their peace efforts and insisted that their delegation should stay in Afghanistan till finding any possible solution to the crisis. He said Haqqani's commission was there to continue the peace plan. He bitterly criticised the winding up of Pakistani Embassy in Afghanistan saying that this step of the government has enabled the "RAW" [Research and Analysis Wing] to use to use its open hand against Pakistan. He feared that the agents of "RAW" were fully active to create hatred among Afghans against Pakistan. He demanded of the government to reopen its Embassy in Kabul to encounter the anti-Pakistan activities of the "RAW". Commenting on Mehmud Mestiri's efforts for paving way for the former monarch of Afghanistan Zahir Shah, he said that one of the main warring factions has categorically rejected him as a mediator. Answering a query, he denied the impression that their peace efforts were aimed at providing relief to Rabbani for reestablishing his position.
