Under the agreement, the Taiwan bank will extend a US$30 million 20-year soft loan to Nicaragua at 3 percent annual interest. The loan includes a 78-month principal and interest holiday, the Taipei- based UNITED DAILY NEWS reported in a dispatch from Washington, DC, on Friday [15 April]. IDB agreed to provide U.S.$20 million of the loan, which is expected to be used for Nicaragua's agricultural development projects, the paper said. If realized, the paper said, it will be the second loan extended by IDB and Taiwan. In 1992, they loaned U.S.$130 million to Nicaragua to help the Violeta Barrios de Chamorro administration modernize its trade and banking sectors. Taiwan provided U.S.$30 million of the loan, the paper said. However, an Export-Import Bank spokesman told CNA that he knew nothing about the proposed loan and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied an agreement had been reached with the IDB. The official declined to elaborate. The report came less than three weeks Before president Li Teng- hui is scheduled to visit Nicaragua. Li will meet Nicaraguan President Chamorro during his May 4 visit. Nicaragua is a staunch ally of Taiwan. Nicaragua, together with six other Latin American countries, submitted a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali last August requesting that the UN put the Republic of China's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993.
