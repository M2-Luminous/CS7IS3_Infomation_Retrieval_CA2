FR940318-0-00171 FR940318-0-00023 To complete its risk analysis for the aqueous and semi-aqueous formulations, the Agency developed a screening methodology designed to characterize risks presented by typical manufacturing setups using these formulations. The diversity of chemicals used in aqueous and semi-aqueous cleaning complicated this undertaking. To complete its screen, the Agency projected concentrations in water for the most toxic chemical that could be used in the water-based formulations. These concentrations were based on the maximum possible concentration in the formulation and case studies documenting actual release profiles for several sample processes. The predicted concentrations obtained using this approach were then compared with toxicity values for this ``worst'' chemical. This analysis suggests that most risks presented by use of water-based cleaners can be controlled by standard process management practices (e.g., planned discard schedules for wash and rinse solutions in cleaner tanks) and by adhering to existing requirements for wastewater treatment imposed by municipal or state authorities. This screening approach, although it does not examine the toxicity of each chemical and mixture or project exposures for each possible formulation, does provide adequate perspective on the risks of these compounds compared with risks from continued use of CFCs. Although the Agency is listing water-based substitutes as acceptable, it urges companies to install systems that permit re-use and recycling of the formulation wherever possible to limit discharge of these chemicals. This step can offer both important benefits to aquatic systems as well as reduce operating costs of cleaning systems. Users should also note that EPA is preparing new effluent limitations and standards that will affect metals cleaning under the Clean Water Act for the Metal Products and Machinery sector. These standards, the first portion of which is expected to be issued in November 1994, will address any remaining uncontrolled risks deriving from the use of water-based cleaners in this industry. Phase I covers sectors such as stationary industrial equipment, hardware, and aircraft. Phase II, to be issued later, covers among other sectors manufacture, rebuild, or maintenance of buses, trucks, railroads, and shipbuilding. (b) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the metals cleaning sector. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations. Although these compounds can be toxic to human health and are considered VOCs, the Agency's risk screen shows that these risks can be addressed through existing regulatory controls. In occupational settings where toxicity is a concern, such as for acetone or for certain ketones, OSHA has set PELs designed to control risks. One class of organic solvents about which there has recently been increased concern for possible health effects is glycol ethers. However, the glycol ethers identified in this case are ethylene glycol ethers, whereas for solvent cleaning purposes companies customarily use propylene glycol ethers. Propylene glycol ethers are generally not believed to exhibit the same degree of toxicity as the ethylene glycol ethers. Controls also exist for sources of VOC emissions and for handling of the organic solvents as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Regulatory standards are not the only method of mitigating the environmental effects of these chemicals. Many manufacturers and distributors of these solvents have instituted programs or can refer companies to programs that will reclaim and process spent solvent_either on or off-site_for further use. The Agency encourages companies using organic solvents to seek out such programs. In addition, companies should consider the principles of pollution prevention when instituting cleaning with organic solvents and adopt emissions control measures such as appropriate freeboard and automated hoists that will reduce pollution at its source. (c) Other chlorinated solvents. Trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (perc) and methylene chloride (meth) are all acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the metals cleaning sector. These alternatives have the chemical properties to meet the cleaning needs of up to 80 percent of the metals cleaning sector, although the Agency anticipates that the actual market share for the non-ozone-depleting chlorinated solvents will not expand to the maximum extent feasible. Because of the high toxicity of these compounds, they have the potential to pose risks to workers and residents in nearby communities. However, the Agency's analysis of use of these compounds as cleaning agents indicates that these risks can be controlled by adhering to existing regulatory standards. OSHA has determined, for instance, that it is possible to use these solvents in a manner that minimizes risks to workers. To reach this conclusion, OSHA conducted extensive analyses of the toxicity and technical feasibility of using perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, or methylene chloride (54 FR 2329&hyph;2984, January 19, 1989, and 56 FR 57036&hyph;57141, November 7, 1991). OSHA found that the new PEL of 50 ppm for trichloroethylene was feasible in metal cleaning operations (54 FR 2433) and after conducting an extensive study of metal degreasing control technologies, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health concluded that an exposure limit of 25 ppm for TCE could also be achieved. More recently, in its proposed standard for methylene chloride, OSHA found that a PEL of 25 ppm is technically feasible during metal cleaning operations with the use of appropriate local exhaust ventilation and work practices.
