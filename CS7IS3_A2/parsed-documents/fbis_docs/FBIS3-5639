This is one of Japan's undisguised attempts to secure large quantities of plutonium for itself so as to produce nuclear weapons at any time and become a nuclear power. Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers are accelerating to a very dangerous stage. According to data, Japan, which has stockpiled 26 tonnes of plutonium, will increase its reserve to 100 tonnes by 2010. This is a huge amount, enough for over 10,000 nuclear bombs. Japan has developed not only elements and technology for the production of a nuclear bomb, including the electronic destructive device, but also devices for long-range nuclear transportation. This has been proven by the fact that Japan developed the large long-range H-2 rocket, which can be used as an inter-continental ballistic missile in February 1994. The world believes that it is only a matter of time until Japan will produce nuclear weapons. A Western paper reported that Japan may have already produced them. In fact, Japan could become a nuclear power in a very short time whenever it is determined to do so. These facts clearly show to what a dangerous stage Japan's nuclear armament has come. What cannot be overlooked is that Japanese authorities and politicians, who are promoting full-scale nuclear armament, are playing mean making an issue out of the so-called nuclear issue of ours. Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone recently raved that the UN Security Council should keep the possibility of imposing economic sanctions open in case we refuse special inspections. Japanese Foreign Minister Hata said the pressure for inspection on our military facilities will increase and urged that measures be taken to dispel suspicion over nuclear weapons development. As everyone knows, there is no mention of "special inspection" in the recently announced agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. In any regard, Japan is not in a position to intervene in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The reason the Japanese reactionaries have recently started playing mean by becoming more feverish in the special inspection commotion is to impede the settlement of the nuclear issue and find a pretext for the lawful promotion of the nuclear armament, which has reached the danger line. It is the most vicious and shameless intention of the Japanese reactionaries that they are picking on others while it is themselves who are accelerating the nuclear armament. It is not difficult to estimate how enormous the effect on the peace of Asia and the world might be when the Monju fast breeder reactor begins operating and large quantities of plutonium are secured for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Some Japanese reactionaries even insist on becoming a military power and dispatching more of the Self-Defense Forces overseas saying that Japan lost World War II because it was weak. It is obvious that our country may become a nuclear victim when the neighboring Japan, which is making every attempt to realize its old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is even armed with nuclear weapons. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized when Japan is arming itself with nuclear weapons. The North-South joint declaration on denuclearization will be invalid, and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be virtually meaningless. It is not a coincidence that the people of Asia and around the world, including our people, are showing grave concern over Japan's nuclear armament. It is a common desire of humanity to live in a peaceful world free of nuclear threat. People across the world should block and destroy Japan's maneuver to smoke nuclear clouds, running counter to mankind's wish. The Japanese reactionaries must correctly realize the dear price they must pay for their maneuvers for nuclear armament and nuclear power and immediately abandon their criminal nuclear ambition.
