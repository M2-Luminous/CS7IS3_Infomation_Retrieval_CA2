The seven Central European presidents met because their countries shared many concerns, but because they wanted to be considered as distinct from other parts of Europe, he said at a press conference at the end of the summit. [sentence as received] Havel said the presidents should meet as frequently as possible, though not necessarily all of them together. Groupings could depend on the matter discussed, he proposed. If it was felt that some president who should have participated was overlooked, "we shall see him next time we meet", Havel said, probably in an allusion to press comment that the Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should have been invited. Havel informed reporters Austrian President Thomas Klestil had invited to a future meeting in Alpbach which the Swiss President Otto Stich might also attend.
