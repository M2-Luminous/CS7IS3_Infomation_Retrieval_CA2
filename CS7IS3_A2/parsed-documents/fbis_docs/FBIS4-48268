According to our correspondent Rene Bila Yombiri, their main concern will be the suspension of the general strike. [Begin Yombiri recording] The social pact, which is the cause of the general strike, has still not been signed, with the main bone of contention being the preconditions. The UST, which launched the strike, has demanded the pullout of ghost labor unions from the negotiations, the withdrawal of security forces from the Labor Exchange -- headquarters of the country's two labor federations -- and, especially, the abrogation of a decree controlling strikes in Chad, which was enacted at a cabinet meeting in view of the current strike. The government has refused to abrogate the decree so the UST has called for its suspension pending the establishment of the administrative court, which alone is entitled to abrogate or maintain the decree. If the decree is suspended, the UST promises to suspend the general strike for two weeks in order to examine and sign the social pact. [passage omitted] [end recording]
