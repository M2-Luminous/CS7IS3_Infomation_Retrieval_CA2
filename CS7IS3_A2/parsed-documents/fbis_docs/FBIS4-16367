Kozyrev told Interfax on Thursday that he had repeatedly said April 21 was only a tentative date for the start of his visit to the Belgian capital. "I'm getting the impression that Russia's partners in the West, especially in NATO, have not yet found correct solutions" concerning Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace, he said. "We are interested in a much more serious approach and not merely in the discussion of some kind of framework document. The Foreign and Defense Ministries of the Russian Federation have formulated proposals to that effect, and now they are thinking about a more serious format for a relationship with NATO," Kozyrev said.
