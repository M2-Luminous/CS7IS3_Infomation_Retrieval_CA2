FR940105-2-00101 FR940105-2-00050 [Docket No. 030&hyph;01244, License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03, EAs 92&hyph;241 and 93&hyph;016] Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut; Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties I Yale-New Haven Hospital (Licensee), New Haven, Connecticut, is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03 (License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission). The License was most recently amended on September 15, 1993. The License authorizes the Licensee to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with radioactive material as well as research in accordance with the conditions specified therein. This is a broad scope license. The License was most recently renewed on August 13, 1985, and was due to expire on August 31, 1990 but was extended by the NRC pending staff action on the Licensee's renewal request. Based on the Licensee's application to renew the License dated June 17, 1990, and pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b), the existing License has not expired and continues in effect. II Between December 3, 1992, and January 27, 1993, the NRC performed two inspections of licensed activities at the Licensee's facility. The inspections were conducted to review two incidents involving therapeutic misadministrations and a failure to control licensed material that occurred between November 30 and December 1, 1992, and on January 21, 1993. During the inspections, five violations of NRC requirements were identified. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated April 26, 1993. The Notice states the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalties proposed for the violations. The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 10, 1993. In its response, the Licensee denies Violations II.A and II.B set forth in the Notice; questions the Severity Level classification for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C; and requests reduction of the civil penalties. III After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violations did occur, the Severity Level classifications were appropriate, and the penalties proposed for the violations designated in the Notice should be imposed. IV In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205, It is hereby ordered that: The Licensee pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. V The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for a hearing should be clearly marked as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, with a copy to the Commission's Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.
