It was precisely at the session of the Consultative Committee that the formulation about organizing the economic weekly SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] based on OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was adopted. Why did you support this idea? [Shokhin] The CIS institutes are still not working effectively, particularly due to lack of professional technology, first of all information technology. Such operational information on the situation in each of the countries which it is now possible to receive is insufficient. In addition, meetings on a bilateral and multilateral basis often arise but the large apparatus of state employees and business people who, according to their activity should be privy to these mutual relations, do not have reliable sources of information. Of course, a newspaper cannot be the only source and we are trying to create other systems, particularly computer systems for exchanging information. But if an economic weekly were published, which knew how to give professionals not only food for thought but also for action, I think that would be a big step toward real strengthening of our mutual action. [Question] Of course, the features of a newspaper take shape gradually. But it is already possible to determine its basic direction. First of all it is a comparative analysis of the situation in one country to another according to various parameters. [Shokhin] It must be said that if a comparative economic analysis can be introduced successfully as one of the basic ideas of the newspaper that would be excellent. If we know how to give a professional analysis and the corresponding prognosis on various themes, be they banking affairs, financial management, the consumer basket, inflation, etc., the newspaper would be able to exert a strong influence on life. [Question] Does possible jealousy not embarrass you? [Shokhin] So as not to use politicized terminology, it is possible with a comparison of a specific set of economic policy measures and an evaluation of their short, medium and long-term consequences to prove of great use to our colleagues and neighbors, rather than by pinning on labels. If an element of envy enters the professional channel then it will not be an element of envy but rather a moment of truth, which leaders need. [Question] One of the basic directions of the new publication should be integration in the broadest sense of the word: from economic union, ensuring a unified economic space, free movement of goods, services and capital to the reestablishment of traditional economic ties and the search for new companions. What can the new weekly do that can be useful in developing this process? [Shokhin] The very name of the newspaper already proposes that it should propagandize four freedoms: the freedom for movement of capital, work forces, services and goods. Now, when we are trying to build a program of practical steps, not just as the basis for these freedoms, but also for their practical realization, it is important to understand the consequence of these actions. The matter is that even on the highest political level the plans on how to proceed toward economic union have not been charted. At one time a somewhat simplified approach prevailed. It was enough to display political decisiveness and everything would be reestablished. Now it is clear that to reestablish economic links and to remove barriers which have appeared in recent years is more easily done through the resolution of specific questions than through universal outlines. It would be desirable if the newspaper could help strengthen production links between potential partners. Here is an additional field of activity for the paper. The search for partners and the corresponding propaganda can give an additional impulse to this work: the newspaper should not rely on the budget all the time. It should become self-supporting. [Question] The state of economic and ecological fragmentation tragically affects the problems, the resolution of which is possible only through common efforts. How can the newspaper help here? [Shokhin] I cannot say that these general state projects are not found in the field of vision of the CIS governments. There is the Caspian, and there is Chernobyl. It is impossible to say that they are being resolved effectively. It is difficult to say to what decree the newspaper is able to help them. More likely, by mobilizing various types of resources, inasmuch as it is impossible to resolve these problems solely on the basis of state financing. For example, we have the Yelabug project; the agreement on creating an interstate consortium was signed a year ago and the CIS countries are participating. If the newspaper could attract the most varied investors, or foreign capital...Perhaps there could be a possibility to hold a contest for interstate projects. The newspaper could draw attention to these projects and help decide them. [Question] What kind of readers do you see for the new newspaper? [Shokhin] I think that a certain stratum of state employees has already formed which handles the problems of the CIS. The population is also interested in knowing what is happening in interstate relations. I think that Russian businessmen should know what investment conditions exist outside the borders of Russia, in the near abroad, how to protect their capital investments there, and so forth. The newspaper could be an irreplaceable source of such information. I hope that it will really become one of the first international newspapers, although several publications are contending for this title with us.
