This was stated today in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, the minister of internal affairs of the Crimean republic. In his words, claims that the armored vehicles that had been moved to Simferopol the other day had been under repair and had now gone to their places of previous deployment, were at variance with reality. In fact, they have been handed over to the Ukrainian National Guard brigade which is being formed in Sevastopol and Simferopol and includes subunits of the Special Forces. V.Kuznetsov drew attention to the fact that this kind of military build-up was "not necessary and not typical" for the Crimea, which was already "oversaturated with military formations and combat equipment" as it was. At the same time, he pointed out that moves are being made on the part of the Ukraine to win over and test the ground in army units as to the readiness of the personnel in the event of an emergency being introduced in the Crimea. It is essentially a question of possible interference by the army and National Guard if the situation deteriorates. At the same time, attempts are being continued to split the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Crimean Republic by creating a Chief Administration subordinated to Kiev. So far, V.Kuznetsov said, the unity of the MVD is being maintained. In our view, he continued, the best thing is to tackle all the disputed questions at the negotiating table. Russia's treaty with Tatarstan and current dialogue with Chechnya could serve as an example, "especially," the Crimean minister of internal affairs stressed, "as we are not declaring that we are ceasing to form part of the Ukraine or reviewing the existing frontiers."
