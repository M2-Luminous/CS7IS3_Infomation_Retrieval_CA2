We will negotiate with each country or group of countries in accordance with the interests of each. In addition, the agreements with Central America are "to promote rather than to regulate trade" as was the case with the two North American countries. Herminio Blanco, deputy secretary of International Trade Relations of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development (Secofi), and Jesus Flores Ayala in charge of Latin American negotiations for the Secofi, expressed themselves in these terms while participating in a course on "Public Administration Vis-a-vis the New Dimensions of Foreign Trade between Mexico and Central American Countries," which was organized by the Secofi and the National Public Administration Institute (INAP). Herminio Blanco pointed out that Mexico is interested in negotiating with Central American countries: Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (Mexico has already signed an agreement with Costa Rica), but as to how far and how these nations want to negotiate with Mexico must be determined. Besides, it is up to the Central Americans to decide if they want to join NAFTA. The Partial Reach Agreements [Acuerdos de Alcance Parcial, AAP] are a very "old" model no longer functional within the framework of ongoing economic and trade globalization. What is more, of the agreements currently in force only 50 percent of a total of 1,000 tariffs are being used. Through these agreements Mexico has imported only $51 million from Central America, two-thirds of this amount from Guatemala. That is why free trade agreements are sought to modernize relationships in order to encourage investments and joint investments, to exchange technology, and to create jobs, in essence for the economic development of countries, Blanco stressed. He made clear that the rules of origin established in trade agreements with Mexico are simple, and above all seek to reduce costs and avoid the illegal transshipment of goods. The established rules are balanced according to the interests and competitive capacity of the countries seeking free trade. In addition, Jesus Flores Ayala, in charge of negotiations with Latin America, warned that agreements such as that signed with Costa Rica "are not a free ticket for access to NAFTA" because the grounds for negotiations on specific items are different, in the long run they might be complementary, but it is obvious certain adjustments have to be made to comply with NAFTA provisions. The Central and South American countries must evaluate "if they are or are not in condition to compete on an international level with prevalent market conditions." In this sense, for example, Guatemala and Honduras should define what they want to do in trade, whether to negotiate bilaterally or as a group with El Salvador. This is despite a long-standing "political agreement" that all three Central American nations together would negotiate with Mexico. While they decide about their positions, we must not lose any time and must continue to negotiate, Flores Ayala said. Lastly, Herminio Blanco stressed the importance of updating relations between countries, and seeking opportunities and access to markets within the context of equality and mutual benefits.
