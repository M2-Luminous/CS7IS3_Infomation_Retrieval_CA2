Because of the large number of proposed changes and to give the deputies time to study them thoroughly, the vote on the amendment was postponed until 2 June, according to NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. [passage omitted] The proposal to amend the electoral law was put forward by Deputy P. Hrusovsky (Christian Democratic Movement). He proposed that the provision be deleted from the law under which the ballot papers are delivered to the voters' homes. According to the amendment, the ballot papers should be handed out at the polling station. The amendment also amends provisions on the active right to vote of citizens of the Slovak Republic living outside the territory of the Slovak Republic. Until now, only Slovak Republic citizens permanently residing in the Slovak Republic had the right to vote. Under the coalition's proposal, they are to retain the right to vote even if they are not permanently residing in the Slovak Republic. To exercise this right, however, they must come to the Slovak Republic to cast their vote. The amendment proposes, furthermore, an increase in the number of candidates on the political parties' slates of candidates for the NRSR from 40 to 50. The coalition's proposals were opposed by deputies from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]. [passage omitted] Jan Carnogursky proposed that campaign broadcasts be permitted on private radio or television and not just on Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. Countering calls that the ballot papers be delivered to voters' homes, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said that "that which prevents manipulation in filling out the ballot papers is what is democratic." According to Pittner, the issuing of ballot papers on election day is customary in the neighboring countries. Besides, the citizen can familiarize himself with the candidates not only from the election campaign but also at his place of residence, where the lists of voters and electoral lists with the names of candidates and political parties will be posted 30 days before the elections. [passage omitted] The deputies then passed an amendment to the law on the regulation of conduct of business with tobacco, salt, and spirits and on the abolition of state financial monopolies. The existing legislation awarded the exclusive--that is, monopoly--right to conducting business in these areas to state-owned enterprises, which was an obstacle to the development of economic competition. [passage omitted] The NRSR bill on the social fund was put forward by P. Jakubik (Party of the Democratic Left) on behalf of a group of deputies. The bill was largely identical with the principles for the generation of the social fund that the government approved on 24 May. The only remaining disputed issue was the possibility of generating the social fund in loss-making companies (this idea was favored by the trade unions, while employers and the government were opposed). Ultimately, the deputies approved a version under which both commercial and nonprofit organizations will be obliged to set up the fund from 0.6 percent of the volume of wages or salaries paid out in the current year. This obligatory allocation will be included in the organization's expenditures (costs). Employers who made a profit [the year before] will also create the social fund from the company's costs. In the case of profit-making organizations, the social fund can amount to up to 1 percent [of the total wage bill]. The adopted law will come into force on 1 September 1994 for the production sphere and on 1 January 1995 for budget-funded and subsidized organizations. All contributions paid out to employees, in cash or in kind, will be subject to a special 10-percent tax. The aim of the social fund is to grant employees certain material benefits, such as contributions to meals, transportation, or a supplementary pension insurance, and also the provision of nonreturnable social assistance. Of the 104 deputies present, 67 voted in favor of the bill's passage, 17 were against, and 18 abstained. [passage omitted]
