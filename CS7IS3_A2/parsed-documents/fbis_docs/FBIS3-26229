Figures are boring, but also thought-provoking. Do you know that we can trace back from 1949 to 1864, a year in which the British imperialists waged an Opium War and blew open China's door with big guns, and a year in which our country's total import and export volume was $286 million, of which the export volume was $147 million? Eighty-five years later, it was 1949. Can you guess how much the total import and export volume had increased? It was only $52 million, less than 20 percent; whereas the diagram (below) [original item shows line graph with following information illustrated; unable to reproduce graph here] shows that from 1949, when the country was liberated, to 1993, that is, in a period of 44 years, the volume rose from $340 million to $195.72 billion, an increase of some 570 times. Judged from the absolute figures, the most rapid growth took place after the reform and opening up: In 1978, our country's total import and export volume was $20.64 billion; in 1993, the figure had increased by more than $175 billion over 15 years before. The picture and diagram also show that the composition of our country's exports also changed markedly: In 1978, primary products accounted for more than half of the export volume [pie chart reflecting the "Composition of Exports" referred to as picture and diagram above indicates primary products accounted for 53.5 percent of the export volume while industrial products made up 46.5 percent of the total], whereas in 1993 they made up less than 20 percent of the export volume, that is to say, finished industrial products accounted for the great majority of our country's exports [second pie chart indicates industrial products accounted for 81.8 percent of 1993 exports while primary products made up 18.2 percent of the total.] When we look at history we acquire new knowledge. Speaking in terms of foreign trade volume in the international community, in 1992, our country ranked 11th in the world (the statistics for 1993 are not yet available). Obviously, this result was hard-won, but for a big country with 1.1 billion people, we still have to catch up. Speaking in terms of composition of exports, we have just accomplished the first change from exporting large quantities of primary products to exporting mainly finished industrial products. The second change, that is, changing from exporting industrial products of low added value to exporting industrial products of high added value as much as possible, is still an arduous task. Someone has mentioned the following: Our country has exported 50 million pairs of shoes to a certain country, so everyone in that country has a pair of shoes, but the value of these 50 million pairs of shoes is less than that of two airbuses! Here we can see that we still have to do a great deal of work.
