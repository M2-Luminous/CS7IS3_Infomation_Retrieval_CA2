During the meeting, the participants reviewed the province's economic operation in the first quarter this year. The objectives and primary tasks were set forth for the second quarter. Tian Chengping, Wang Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and the principal officials in charge of all the commissions, committees, offices, departments, and bureaus of the provincial government attended the meeting. The leading officials of the provincial planning commission, the financial and economic commission, the financial department, the commercial department, the economic and trade department, the statistical bureau, the agricultural and animal husbandry office, and the provincial People's Bank briefed the meeting participants on the conditions in industry, agriculture, capital construction, foreign trade, and implementation of the financial budget in the first quarter of this year. Statistics show that the province's GDP for the first quarter this year totaled more than 1,722 million yuan, which means a 5.7 percent increase over the same period last year in terms of comparable prices. Industry has maintained a 5.6 percent growth rate, and agriculture and animal husbandry have exhibited satisfactory performance. Foreign trade has been developing steadily and the banking sector has been operating smoothly. The economic operation as a whole remained basically stable in the first quarter, but some fairly serious problems have yet to be resolved. The main problems are as follows: with regard to agriculture, slow progress has been made in spring sowing; the peasants' investment in agricultural production has decreased; and, with regard to industry, production has been affected by various factors and has dropped by 10.9 percentage points as compared with the same period last year; a larger portion of enterprises have suffered losses, with an increasing amount of losses set against decreasing economic returns. To cope with the existing problems and difficulties, Governor Tian Chengping urged the departments in charge of comprehensive economic management, competent departments, and banking and taxation sectors to work together more closely to ensure steady economic growth this year. [passage omitted] Tian Chengping said: Deepening reform is an effective approach to invigorating the economy, especially large- and medium-sized enterprises. Enterprises must devote efforts to transform the enterprise operational mechanism, while government agencies, in the process of functional transformation, must not slacken their guidance and assistance to enterprises, but must instead strive to solve more practical problems and serve the enterprises.
