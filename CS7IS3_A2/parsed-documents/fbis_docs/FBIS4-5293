FBIS4-5293 "dreas069__a94028" FBIS-EAS-94-069-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Patent Office To Improve Protection of Inventors Patent Office To Improve Protection of Inventors OW0804135794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0804135794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Patent Office is scheduled to amend the Patent Act in order to strengthen the system for protecting inventors' rights. The pillars of the amendment are: 1) the term of validity of the patent right should be extended by five years to 20 years; 2) stricter conditions should be applied for invoking the "compulsory implementation right"--which allows the government to order a patent holder to allow a third person to use his patent for welfare purposes; and 3) the application limits of the patent should be extended. The Patent Office plans to enact the amended act by January 1995, when an agreement reached on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights negotiations (TRIP) under the Uruguay Round of (GATT's) multilateral trade talks late last year will come into effect. The Patent Office plans to submit a bill for amending the act to an extraordinary Diet session in autumn. In the current act, it is specified that the term of patent "shall be 15 years from the date of the public announcement, but shall not be over 20 years from the date of application for patent." In the amended act, it will be specified that the term of patent "shall expire after 20 years from the date of application." Therefore, the maximum limits of a patent will be virtually changed from 15 years to 20 years, and with this change, an inventor's--companies or individuals--income from patent royalties will increase. The amended act will be applied to a patent request which is under examination now. Under the current act, as far as patent-related medical supplies are concerned, it takes about 10 years for a pharmaceutical company to merchandise patented products, and in many cases the patent term expires soon after patented products are put on sale. It is expected that pharmaceutical companies will benefit from the amended act because it costs approximately 10-15 billion yen for them to develop a new medicine. In addition, in order to further protect a patent holder, more strict conditions for invoking the "compulsory implementation right"--which allows the government to order a patent holder to allow third persons to use the patent only for the public interest--will be introduced. Specifically, 1) adoption of the first invention--to which the patent right has already been granted--should be limited to the purpose for "developing economically more important and more advanced technology," and 2) with regard to semiconductor-related technology, "the compulsory implementation right" should be invoked only for welfare and noncommercial purposes. So far, the Japanese Government has not invoked the "compulsory implementation right." But among foreign companies which have basic patents in Japan, a critical view have been expressed that "Japanese companies, by waving the government's 'compulsory implementation right' before foreign firms, tend to try to use it to their advantage in conducting negotiations on royalties of foreign companies' basic patents." The Patent Office believes the amended act will help to overcome this view.
