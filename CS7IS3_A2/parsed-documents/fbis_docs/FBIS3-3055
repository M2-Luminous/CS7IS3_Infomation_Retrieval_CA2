China will ensure "maximum possible flexibility on tariff and non-tariff measures as well as other issues of interest to GATT parties, while maintaining a balance of rights and obligations in GATT," said the official, Long Yongtu. Long is in charge of GATT affairs for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). Long made the remarks in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY on the eve of the 16th session of the GATT Working Party on China, to be held from March 15-18 in Geneva. Long, who is general secretary of the Chinese delegation, which left for Geneva on Saturday, said details of the "significant measures" would be announced then. "Some of the measures will be bound to specific implementation timetables," Long said. "And," he added, "we will make new commitments to foreign exchange reforms." These impending measures should better position China for resuming contracting party status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), economists said. The United States and the European Union (EU) have complained that China's proposed concessions to the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations are not enough. But the U.S. and EU agree that China could be allowed a transitional period to revise its proposals after it rejoins GATT. Analysts said the new measures by China on liberalizing trade can be significant steps in that direction. Long's delegation to Geneva, which is led by Moftec Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang, is the largest of any sent by China to Geneva. Yu Xiaosong, Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission which masterminds the nation's industrial policies, is vice-chairman of the mission. Long pointed out that the Geneva session on China's re-entry into GATT is the first following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. "It is high time for China to rejoin GATT," Long said. His opinion is based on three reasons. Firstly, China's economic reforms in the past 15 years, particularly those adopted this year, have substantially pushed the country's economy onto a market-based track. "Even the U.S. and EU have acknowledged the remarkable progress China has made," Long said. U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin and EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan visited China last month and gained an appreciation of China's economic reforms. Secondly, China has accepted the notion of a transitional period for it to meet GATT's requirements. Thirdly, China's resumption of its GATT status would be the prerequisite for becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT next year as the primary international free-trade body. "Without the participation of China as a founding member, WTO will be incomplete and its universality will be weakened," Long said. If China, the world's 11th largest trading nation, should be kept outside WTO it would be a setback for the international trade system, he added. Long reaffirmed that China would not seek to reduce its obligations for maintaining world trade once it rejoins Gatt. "We will not dilute our commitment to GATT or the WTO by resorting to treatment as a developing nation," he said. GATT rules, as well as preliminary regulations drawn up by the WTO, stipulate different treatment for developing and developed nations on certain issues. "We are only insisting on being treated as a developing nation when there are different stipulations for the two categories," he explained.
