A Triptych for Two Ministers and a Vice President"; date not given] [Text] Of course you remember the words in the subtitle below, from Genesis, when Adam and Eve realized they were naked. The race of Adam lives on this "cursed ground" because of him (3:17) and must "eat bread in the sweat of his face until he returns into the ground" (3:19). We toil for our sustenance all our lives in this era of night herdsmen and ministers. And we seek a way out by making aprons appropriate to the times, to cover our nakedness. Even today. But on a grander scale. We talked to Georgia's Industry Minister Vladimer Kereselidze on specific subjects of practical value, for we've had it up to here with the tea, citrus, Borzhomi water and the strong, healthy economy promised at rallies. "And They Sewed Fig Leaves Together, and Made Themselves Aprons" [Saneblidze] My first question, Batono Vladimer, is about the 32 percent your enterprises are not paying to the state. Why are they hiding it? [Kereselidze] You mean the funds our enterprises have in Russia. They add up to a lot, but we can't get them--that is, we can't bring them back to Georgia, so the money circulates in Russia. I personally am against any deviation; the law is the law, and I try to obey it. The republic budget should be getting its due. [Saneblidze] You are aware that practical executives have their own practical arguments as to why they aren't bringing the money into Georgia. [Kereselidze] If they don't put the money to work there, in Russia, Georgia's enterprises will just shut down. You know the banking and credit system has broken down and transfers between countries have been stopped. And, nobody wants our coupons. The only chance our factories have now is to circulate the money in Russia, for example, to use it to buy the materials and supplies the enterprises need. Is that a crime? I think not. But, again, we have to obey every lawful requirement. [Saneblidze] Neither sinful nor sinless.... Specifically, how much does this action by enterprise executives help Georgia's economy--or does it? [Kereselidze] Of course not. The situation has to be corrected, but that is often beyond the powers of enterprise executives. Let's be specific. I mentioned that money circulation between the independent countries has been stopped. Here we are in Ukraine, and one of my main tasks is to bring it about that the Ukrainians' debts go to work in their own country. For example, Tbilisi's Elektroapparat and Kutaisi's Automotive Plant have money here that they got from selling their products, yet we can't transfer it from Kiev to Donetsk Oblast--Makeyevka--in order to obtain goods in exchange from that city's enterprises, because Ukrainian law forbids it. The intergovernmental agreement we signed should change this status quo. That's the goal of me and our delegation. [Saneblidze] I almost hate to ask, but do you think Georgia's joining the ruble zone is the way to solve the problems of money circulation between countries and, hence, industry's problems? [Kereselidze] Of course, if they'll have us! [Saneblidze] Why? [Kereselidze] First, because rubles are rubles and coupons are coupons, whether Georgian or Ukrainian coupons. Both countries are suffering from hyperinflation, so naturally they aren't interested in our coupons, nor we in theirs. If a unified zone is created--call it the ruble zone--the problems that today are unsolvable for the above reasons will be solved. [Saneblidze] Finance experts (and others besides) think that the only way to strengthen Georgia's finances is to revive our economy, specifically industry. What are the prospects? [Kereselidze] Economists and finance experts have their own ideas on that. I'm not the kind of man who has a ready answer to everything. I'll just tell you what industry's contribution to the revival of Georgia's economy will be, in the Ministry's framework. The Industry Ministry was formed by combining the Light Industry Ministry, the Timber and Woodworking Ministry, Local Industry Ministry, and plants formerly under Soviet jurisdiction. That accounts for its large share: the Ministry complex accounts for 50 to 55 percent of Georgia's production output. That shows the role it plays in our economy. A lot has been said about the causes of our woes, by your newspaper in particular. The main thing, however, is that the vital ties our industry used to have with Ukraine, Russia, and other former Soviet republics were broken. These ties have to be restored. That is the purpose of all our trips to these countries. I've already mentioned the other necessity and need not repeat it. These things will create the economic climate to help put industry back to work. Another thing: unless the problem of natural gas supplies and electricity is solved, industry cannot function, and the ties we are trying to restore cannot operate. In addition, our enterprises have been operating at 20-percent capacity until now, but in the near future we will wish we had even that. We hope that the tremendous efforts we have made along these lines will yield results. Last December we concluded an agreement with two major committees in Russia; one of them oversees the machine-building sectors and eight ministries, while the other oversees the military-industrial complex. We have signed an intergovernmental agreement with the latter. Questions of licensing, quota-setting, and customs duties between Georgia and Russia have been completely settled in our sector. Let no one think that the Ministry's leadership is sitting idle and waiting to join the ruble zone. I have met with officials of Russia's chemical and metallurgical complexes, and documents have been prepared to conclude the appropriate agreement. This means we will be bringing in the raw materials, components, and supplies our enterprises need; for some enterprises these make up 90-95 percent, for others it is less. If, in addition, we restore banking transactions, industry will go to work. [Saneblidze] But some specialists doubt that our industry can start operating, arguing that the plants' and factories' equipment has been looted and cadres have departed. [Kereselidze] That's partly true. Policies in recent years have caused a certain alienation between the Ministry and, for example, plants formerly under Soviet jurisdiction, which have gone virtually uncontrolled. For this and other reasons, there have been cases of unwise privatization, specialists have quit, and equipment, sad to say, has been looted. I had occasion to discuss that in an article in your newspaper. But I also want to say that executives, engineering-technical personnel, and workers are itching to go to work. If we can systematize all this there is no danger of not being able to revive our enterprises. And industry will certainly go back to work. [Saneblidze] When? [Kereselidze] Tomorrow! Day after tomorrow!--but only if the above conditions are met and, in addition, we get offers from the privatized enterprises to work together, requests for the Ministry to continue partnership with them. I am certain that privatization will yield the desired results when the state treats the privatized enterprises with the same consideration as those still in the state sector, because ultimately every enterprise has to work for the market, and closely with each other as well. There are, for example, the Amirani, Kolkheti, and Bakhtrioni factories and many others, making up a unified link with a different form of ownership. [Saneblidze] About bank credits and your Ministry: do you need loans from the state? [Kereselidze] Of course we do, but debts have to be paid back. If an enterprise doesn't work, how can it get out of debt? Georgia got 60 million dollars in credit from Turkey, and all the Industry Ministry got was about 2.5 million, which is definitely not in accord with the share our complex occupies in the country's economy. Another thing: Western credits ought to be spent boldly on conversion, choosing options that are economically sound and profitable, so we can invest to create a base producing consumer goods, sell the products, and thus pay our debts. What's wrong with that? [Saneblidze] Problems keep mounting, and our readers need to hear an encouraging word and some specifics. [Kereselidze] Let me assure your paper's readers and the public that the Industry Ministry and its whole complex have the ability to accomplish the tasks they face. A program has been worked out for 1994, with all the enterprises participating, and plans have been mapped. Our prognosis calls for a twofold (or more) increase in production output; our Ministry has approved its privatization program; we have worked out an investment program for the Ministry's enterprises and published it in English to attract foreign capital to Georgian industry. We are working intensively to attract foreign partners, and Australian, German, and American specialists are working on specific tasks in this effort. It involves, for example, the Mining-Enrichment Combine, the Rustavi Chemical Fiber Plant, the Gori Cotton Mill, and others. All of these programs will go into action and will, of course, produce results. But until then we have to accomplish the prime tasks mentioned above. I think everything is going to go the way the Georgian government's strategic plan calls for, and we must not try to do everything at once, nor yet too little either. * * * Debts, debts! Nearly everybody in the country is in debt to Sakgazi [the Gas Department], to the tune of a trillion coupons. For this reason, Sakgazi can't pay a kopek to the countries over whose territories the gas we get from Turkmenistan flows; it can't pay the transit fee. Where are we going to get the 40 million dollars it will take? A piece of late news: Last Saturday, Sakgazi official Davit Eliashvili came back from Turkmenistan and said, We're beaten. Because we are so far behind, on 1 February Turkmenistan would no longer supply us with gas and.... But let's not say what would have happened then, because our guys wheedled them into postponing it until 1 April. And that day will come. Last year's 200 million dollars will have this year's amount added to it (already 25 million in January). Hence, industry has to go to work, there's no other way. The great physicist Albert Einstein once said, What mankind needs most now is a chair to sit down on and think. Well, because of "meteorological conditions" we've had to sit for two days in the Donetsk Airport's waiting room. We've said what's on our mind. The three participants in our triptych have had their say and left us with their thoughts. To all this let me add one thing. From 1945 to 1950 Japan took vigorous measures to dismantle its centralized economy and convert to the market economy. This big turnaround took place in two stages. In the first stage they gave priority to administrative measures of regulation, affecting price formation, finances, credit, allocation of resources, and wages and salaries. Along with filling the markets they carried out stern measures to restore financial health and curb inflation. In the second stage they created the conditions necessary to develop competition, get rid of price controls, liquidate subsidies and budget deficits, and introduce a single exchange rate for the yen. And what they ended up with was today's remarkable Japanese economy. Many people in our country reject this kind of phased development--after all, we are tougher, we'll just get to work and get around any economic obstacle. But before we start boasting like hillbillies, let's sit down on that chair and think. The Donetsk Airport is as quiet as Georgia's economy. The white airplane is shrouded motionless in the fog and time stands still. A crow is perched incongruously among the skittishly arranged lines of the garden's black branches and reacts to nothing. The crow is 299 years old. "You're not afraid of anything, are you?" (Galaktion Tabidze [a poet]).
