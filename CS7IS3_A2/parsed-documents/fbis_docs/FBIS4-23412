This is a period of national reconciliation, after years of grief, struggle, and suffering that we all experienced. We stand for reconciliation during this period of peace and consolidation of democracy. Democracy: my dream, the dream of all of us! Each and every process of national reconciliation signifies the establishment of a government of national unity. This results from the idea that what unites political forces of a government of national unity is far greater than what separates them. In our case, some of the reasons that would lead us to establish such a government are very clear. Our first objective is to guarantee the holding of free elections to establish democracy in Mozambique. We know who the democrats are. We also know who the other people are who have been in power for the past 19 years! We are not dealing with a question of party strength. What is at stake is not the fact that the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] is stronger than other opposition parties. This cannot and should not raise doubts about our intentions. Through its positions, Renamo has demonstrated deep respect for all political forces since, I repeat, what is at stake is the defense of democratic values, social justice, and solidarity -- values which our people have not known and do not know in practice. All of us present here are very aware of the needs and difficulties facing our people in their daily lives. We all want to change this situation, by imposing justice and democratic legality, fighting abuse of power and corruption, and creating a new society. We want to create a new society where economic and social development will receive priority with a view to establishing, from October, a better life for all Mozambicans and creating foundations for progress, our future concern. If all the problems that we face concern us and bring us closer, then the only thing that remains is for us to combine our strength through the establishment of a government of national unity to find a solution to the needs facing our people. Our disunity can only benefit others, notably the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], which has always involved itself in divisive maneuvers to continue ruling, which has always created a gap between the privileged and the persecuted, a party which has distanced itself from the country's reality, from our people. Frelimo finds itself lost in this new model of society to create true democracy. The new Frelimo democrats are the old Frelimo Marxists. Their methods and production have not changed: Mozambique's backwardness and increasing difficulties facing our people. As far as Frelimo is concerned, the existence of many parties standing for elections is a good thing, because its strategy is to safeguard votes that it is sure of obtaining from the few supporters of the Marxist policy under the disguise of democracy. Its aim is to see the votes of the rest of the electorate divided among the many political parties, making difficult the emergence of a party with absolute or relative majority, thus creating compromises that would thwart democratic values. Friends, we cannot forget that Frelimo is well acquainted with electoral mechanisms, it has immense financial resources and an electoral machinery capable of all tricks, since it has been in power for the past 19 years in a single party dictatorship. In the coming elections there are many presidential candidates, but we all know, however, that there will only be one president! The issue now is for us to decide whether this president should be a democrat or whether we want to continue with a "make-believe democrat" whom we all know as Chissano. Brothers, when I present myself to the electorate, I do not do so merely as a Renamo candidate appointed during a special congress of our party. I want to be and I will be a candidate of democracy who represents and defends the people, regardless of their political creed. It has not been in vain that I have been defending solutions that lead to national reconciliation. I will not distinguish between winners and losers, and once again the best solution is the establishment of a government of national unity. What distinguishes us from Frelimo is that if Joaquim Chissano remains president of the Republic he will continue to be the president of a section of society pitted against another, whereas a democrat will be the president of all, without exception or discrimination of a political, social, economic, religious, or ethnic nature. That is what democracy, for which I have fought so much, means to me! Thus, I have always supported the existence of a financial fund for the electoral campaign to enable us to carry out our electoral campaigns with some financial backing that we have been lacking so far. The agreement that we may reach will enable us to reinforce control mechanisms at the level of voter registration, which is a decisive step in the electoral process. If we do not take all precautions in order to jointly ensure complete neutrality and transparency in this process, then all other following phases of the electoral process will be jeopardized. Our joint monitoring will include the tight control of "vote counting," the use of data systems that assess and inform us about the use of computers, and the invitation we will make to those countries that form part of the UN Operations in Mozambique to form a group of electoral observers. Although provisions have been made for the establishment of "mobile voter registration centers," the same is not the case regarding the ballot boxes. This will evidently create difficulties for the people deep in the interior. It will be up to us to guarantee their movement to polling stations. Once again, the government and Frelimo -- which is one and the same thing -- obtained the approval of an electoral law favorable to them. It is not only important to guarantee security in voter registration centers, it is also vital to guarantee security during the entire electoral process. I am referring to the security of our candidates and our electorate. This will only be possible through the assistance of the police, which is neutral and depoliticized. Together, we must demand the reinforcement of the National Commission for Police Affairs and the Civpol [UN Civilian Police Force] at national level to prevent incidents of insecurity and conflict which would certainly jeopardize the whole process now under way. I am convinced that together we shall be able to more easily overcome all the difficulties that lie ahead. Some of these difficulties are already known to us and we shall be cautious. Brothers, we shall certainly experience other unforeseen difficulties, however -- constant surprises, provocation after provocation -- that jeopardize the process for which many people gave their lives and many more are willing to work tirelessly and sacrifice their lives. I am convinced that the challenge before us today, to form a government of national unity, is a decisive step forward toward victory by the democratic forces.
