The average air temperature over most of the territory of Northwestern, Central, Central-Chernozem, and North Caucasian regions and also in the south of the Volga region was 5-7 degrees above the many-year averages, and on the rest of the territory of Russia--1-3 degrees. The total negative air temperature for November-January, which characterizes the severity of the winter, over a large part of the European territory of Russia was 80-90 percent of the many-year average air temperatures. But if one does not count the cold November over a large part of Northwestern, Central, and Central-Chernozem regions and Lower Volga Area, the sum of negative air temperatures was only 25-45 percent of the norm, and in the Northern Caucasus--only for the first 10 days of December. In St. Petersburg on 16 January the absolute maximum air temperature for that day was surpassed (4.3 degrees as against 4.1 degrees in 1983). The largest amount of precipitation (180-220 percent of the norm and more) fell in the central oblasts of the Non-Chernozem zone of Russia. Almost everywhere with the exception of the Northern Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the snow cover on fields planted in winter grain crops was 20-40 cm and more. The minimum soil temperature at the depth of the tillering node of winter crops remained mainly within the range of minus 3-5. Over the majority of the territory of the Northern region and the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions, where a deep (30 cm and more) snow cover was established during the second half of December on slightly frozen soil, by the end of January it had increased 1.5-2-fold. The minimum soil temperature at the depth of the tillering node of grain crops remained close to zero. There is a probability of damage to winter crops by rotting. Beginning in the middle of January the same conditions for the wintering of planted areas were created in the northern part of the Central region as well. Here the depth of the snow cover increased to 30 cm but as a result of the warm weather the depth of freezing of the soil decreased and even in the middle of the month it was less than 50 cm. The deep winter rest of the winter crops was disturbed--and intensive expenditure of nutritive substances for respiration began. In regions with a deep (more than 30 cm) snow cover and slight (less than 50 cm) freezing of the soil, measures for compacting the snow on the fields are very effective. The existence of a crust of ice mainly 15-20 mm thick ground into the soil on the fields in the Northwestern, Central, and Central-Chernozem regions is unfavorable for winter crops. But it is basically under a deep (more than 15 cm) snow cover and presents no great danger to the planted areas. Over the majority of territory of the North Caucasus region and Lower Volga Area warm weather remained for most of the month. The maximum air temperature, especially during the first half of the month in the south of Rostov Oblast, Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, and the south of Kalmykia rose to 8-16 degrees. The winter crops began to grow during this period. Shoots appeared on the fields with late planting times. The areas with plants that have developed poorly since autumn increased. The reserves of productive moisture on the fields with wintering crops increased and mainly amounted to 30-40 mm in the plowed layer of soil, and 110-160 mm in the 1-meter layer. At the end of the month it became cold in these regions and the plants stopped growing. A snow cover was formed in places. The temperature of the soil at the depth of the tillering node dropped to slightly negative values. In Western Siberia the wintering of winter grain crops proceeded favorably. The planted areas were under a snow cover whose depth was mainly 25-35 cm and more. Only in the southwest of Altay Kray was there somewhat less snow on the fields--8-12 cm. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the air temperature dropped to minus 30-34 and lower on certain days, the minimum temperature of the soil at the depth of the tillering node of winter grain crops remained within the range of minus 7 to minus 12 degrees, and in the southwest of Altay Kray--minus 15 to minus 17, which was not dangerous to the planted areas. According to the preliminary forecast of Rosgidromettsentr, in February in the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions the air temperature is expected to be one degree below normal. Therefore the processes of rotting of winter grain crops are somewhat retarded. In Central Volga Area the air temperature is also expected to be 1 degree below normal, but there the winter grain crops are under a snow cover which reliably protects the planted areas from the harmful effects of low temperatures, and there will be no freezing on large areas. In the Northern Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the quantity of precipitation in February is expected to be close to the many-year average, and the air temperature--1-2 degrees below normal. The winter grain crops will not grow in February. It is not expected that winter crops will freeze on large areas since the warm weather in December and January led to melting, and in the north of Rostov and Volgograd Oblast--to a reduction of the freezing of the soil. In the Northwestern Region where the depth of the snow cover on fields planted in winter grain crops is not great (mainly less than 10 cm) in February the air temperature is expected to be 1 degree above normal. Therefore there will be no freezing of winter grain crops on large areas. On the rest of the territory of the Russian Federation the air temperature and the quantity of precipitation in February is expected to be close to the many-year averages.
