[Al-Natshah] Good morning, thank you. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the UN Security Council's resolution concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? [Al-Natshah] I can say that the issue of protection is a just demand. We welcome the resolution. I hope that it will be implemented completely and will ensure real protection for the citizens against the settlers' attacks and the Israeli army's actions as well. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The resolution failed to refer to the issue of Jerusalem. How do you explain this? [Al-Natshah] We regret that the issue of Jerusalem was not included in the resolution. This, perhaps, is due to U.S. pressure. It represents a serious shift in the U.S. position. The United States has often voted in the past in favor of considering Jerusalem an integral part of the occupied territories. But it is the U.S. pressure that has now played a role in omitting the issue of Jerusalem from the resolution. All the people have voiced their indignation over this stand. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect that the UN Security Council resolution, which condemns the massacre, will pave the way for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks? [Al-Natshah] I believe that this could help the PLO return to the negotiations, and I also believe that the Israeli authorities might respond to other demands. We also hope that the Israeli authorities will also respond to the resolution and to the other demands set by the PLO as a condition for returning to the negotiations. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Security Council has called for providing a temporary international presence to ensure protection for Palestinian citizens. What do you think of this presence? [Al-Natshah] The word presence does not mean international forces like those that are deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina or Somalia. It is rather the presence of unarmed UN observers to intervene in one way or another if attacks take place. This does not mean armed protection as is the case in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is just few observers in the occupied territories who would do their best to prevent any attack on the citizens. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Israeli Government is currently studying the idea of assembling all the Jewish settlements in an area in the town of Hebron. Could this represent a solution to guarantee Palestinian security? [Al-Natshah] The attempt to assemble them in Hebron is not a solution. Because the presence of settlements in the heart of Hebron has split it in half and has obstructed communications between the southern part and its western and northern parts, particularly during Fridays and Saturdays when the army bans traffic between the two parts of the town. Therefore, the best practical step in this issue is to withdraw the citizens from Hebron to another settlement as a temporary solution until a final solution is worked out, namely dismantling the settlements and withdrawing the settlers from the occupied Palestinian land. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What more do you need from the international community after the Security Council resolution, which condemned the massacre? [Al-Natshah] We call on the international community to help place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda of the negotiations. This is a basic demand that has also been prompted by the Hebron massacre. It is a fundamental, pressing demand and should not be delayed. Because the presence of settlements during any transitional stage would be an explosive issue that might destroy any agreement. This kind of massacre could recur in the future in other areas and could torpedo any agreement. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. [Al-Natshah] You are welcome.
