They were among 37 people admitted to the hospital with the disease which had broken out in the Jirapa Lambussie and Nadowli districts. Dr. Francis Banka, medical superintendent in charge of the hospital, briefed Mr. Joseph Yieleh Chireh, Upper West Regional Minister, who visited the hospital at the weekend. Dr. Banka said although the disease had not yet been proved to be yellow fever, clinical tests so far carried out indicated a high probability that it is the major cause of the deaths. A medical team from Accra in collaboration with personnel from the regional directorate of health services was currently in the district to establish whether the disease is yellow fever or a combination of hepatitis and jaundice, he said. Dr. Banka said the team had been divided into three groups to carry out the survey in the affected areas and also vaccinate and educate the people on preventive measures.
