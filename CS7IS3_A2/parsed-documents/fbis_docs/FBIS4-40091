But It Seems This Will Not Make Their Lives Any Easier"] [Text] Fifty Latvian Saeima deputies have decided the fate of the hundreds of thousands of residents who are uncertain of their future. The law on citizenship has passed its second reading. This means that conceptual changes are no longer possible, and at the third reading (expected to be held at an emergency session during the summer parliamentary recess) only editorial amendments that do not alter the essence of the law will be possible. This long-awaited law -- Latvia is the only republic in the former Union where such a document has not been adopted -- has undergone significant changes since its first reading in the fall. Proposals have mainly been submitted by the national-radical faction of the the Latvian National Independence Movement [LNNK] (as is well known, the LNNK was victorious in the recent municipal elections). The new articles are notable for their ethnic protectionism -- for instance, the "priority" group of those who can apply for naturalization before 1 January 1996 includes not only ethnic Latvians and Livonians, but also Estonians and Lithuanians. Attempts to ascertain in what way they are better than Belarusians or Poles have proved fruitless -- politicians have provided no sensible explanations, citing "Baltic unity." The first people who can claim Latvian citizenship are the spouses of citizens (if married for more than 10 years). The list of those who cannot become Latvian citizens under any circumstances is very long -- these include criminal elements, people spreading fascist or communist ideas (in the period since 4 May 1990, when Latvian idependence was proclaimed), KGB and other special service staffers, and demobilized Soviet Army personnel who have remained to reside permanently in the republic. I would note that the demands on "noncitizens" are far stricter than those on "citizens": The latter can have been in the security services or served in the Soviet Army, or leaders of the criminal fraternity -- it will not affect their citizenship. Those given "priority" will not receive automatic citizenship. They also have to meet a residence qualification. They will have to take a test of their knowledge of the Latvian Constitution, the republic's history, and the Latvian language. They must have a legal source of income. It would be nice to think that all the tests and checks would be objective and impartial, but the current arbitrary civil service practice at local level raises doubts -- the arbitrariness of departments and clerks have been recognized by international experts working in Latvia. As of 1 January 1996 it will be time for those born in Latvia to apply to be naturalized. Age lists will be drawn up and, deputies believe, by the year 2000 anyone "over 30" should have submitted an application. After this date everyone else can apply for citizenship, but...not more than 0.1 percent of the total number of citizens may apply each year. Recent statistics show that Latvians currently make up 54.2 percent of the republic's total population. But the initiators of the hard line in the citizenship law -- such as Deputy Aristids Lambergs, for instance -- believe that this figure should go beyond the 70-percent mark. Latvia is making no secret of the fact that it would like the fall Council of Europe session to consider the Baltic state's admission to this international organization. The citizenship law and the criticism of it by Max van der Stoel, CSCE commissioner for ethnic minority affairs, have held up this process. The assessment that the new document receives from experts and European politicians is something awaited by both the Latvian authorities and by Latvian "noncitizens" who are dissatisfied with it.
