FBIS3-29745 "dreas035__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-035-A Document Type:Daily Report 22 February 1994 ANNEX Japan SDF-U.S. Exercises Target Russian Objectives OW2202012494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Feb 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2202012494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Self Defense Forces [SDF] have been conducting Japan-U.S. joint exercises over the past nine years. Based on statements by those connected with the exercise, it was disclosed on 19 February that at the command post exercise [CPX] conducted during the joint exercise, SDF units were supposed to attack Russian territories, including the four northern islands and Sakhalin. Despite the fact that the CPX is conducted on computer screens without actual mobilization of units, the exercise may become a controversial issue because such an exercise could be regarded as a deviation from the authority of the SDF whose objective is to defend Japanese territorial land, sea and air space based on the principle of an exclusively defense-oriented posture. The objective of conducting a CPX, which is different from an actual exercise [jitsudo enshu] in which units will be actually mobilized, is to train staff officers in conducting liaison between the "exercise command [renshu bu]," which is in command of actual operations, and the "commanding headquarters [tosai bu]," which is in charge of creating imaginary circumstances [jokyo sotei] based on the scenario. The CPX, which was started in fiscal 1985, has been conducted every year except in the year of the Gulf war. The eighth CPX conducted this year lasted 10 days, from 26 January through 4 February, with the participation of some 3,200 U.S. Forces personnel and about 3,400 SDF personnel. Acting as the commanding officer from SDF was Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council, and from the U.S. forces was Richard Meyers, commander of U.S. Forces Japan [USFJ]. While the USFJ set up its commanding headquarters at Yokota Base, the SDF set up its commanding headquarters at the Defense Agency's Central Command, and its exercise commands at the operation rooms of the Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office, and Air Staff Office. As was done in past years, the exercise started with an attack and landing on Hokkaido by Russia, which is regarded as an "imaginary enemy." It is reported, however, that no attacks were conducted against Russian territories or the northern territories because the exercise was concluded by "UN mediation." However, it was also reported that at the CPX conducted in the past years, training in attacks against various places were conducted in accordance with different circumstances; and an attack against Russia's maritime oblasts is named "C-1 Attack"; attack against the four northern islands, "C-2 Attack"; and attack against Sakhalin, "C-3 attack." In an exercise conducted in a certain year, the exercise command reported to and requested the commanding headquarters to launch attacks against a unit of war vessels based on the imaginary circumstances that a unit of Russian war vessels intending to make a landing on Hokkaido was concentrated at Aniva Bay in southern Sakhalin. Based on the judgment of the commanding headquarters, a permit for attacks was issued. Then the U.S. Forces first attacked Russian SAM's (surface-to-air missiles) deployed at such places as Notaro at the southernmost tip of Sakhalin; secured command of the air; and then F-1 support fighters of the Air Self-Defense Force attacked Russian vessels. Reportedly, such an exercise was conducted in the past but this scenario has been handled as "top secret."
