After less than two hours of debate yesterday the parliament agreed on a statement which makes it possible -- theoretically and formally, at least -- to keep to the very tight timetable for the negotiations with Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria. Nevertheless the Parliament's position means in practice that the negotiations must be fully completed by 8-9 March so that the results are available on 10 March. The Parliament will then be able to begin discussion of the matter based on the summary which sets out the results of the negotiations, but Parliament demands that the final, legally binding texts of the agreements be submitted to it before it votes in May -- probably on 4 May. At that point the Parliament will have to bring together 260 deputies who will vote "yes." Usually only around 300 out of 518 parliamentary deputies are in place here during the parliamentary sessions, and when it comes to admitting new members the requirement is that a majority of the parliament's 518 deputies back such a decision.
