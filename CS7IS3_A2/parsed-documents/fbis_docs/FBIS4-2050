On behalf of the municipal party committee, I would like to warmly congratulate the success of this session! Since the shift of the term of the municipal CPPCC committee last July, CPPCC organizations at all levels in the municipality have profoundly implemented the guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th CPC Congress, conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, given full play to the advantages of the CPPCC, and further expanded the sphere of work and invigorated various activities in the course of carrying on and carrying forward the fine traditions of the CPPCC. These organizations have also made new progress in political consultation, democratic supervision, participation in and discussion of political affairs, and self- construction. These organizations have also made great contributions to promoting the building of two civilizations, to safeguarding social stability, and to promoting the all-around progress of the society. The good situation of today's Tianjin is indispensable from the endeavor of all levels of CPPCC organizations and all CPPCC members of Tianjin. Here, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the municipal CPPCC committee, to CPPCC committees of all districts and counties, to all democratic parties and industrial and commercial federations, to all nonparty patriotic figures, to pertinent people's groups, and to the figures of all nationalities of all circles in the municipality! This year is extremely critical to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization. As everybody knows, Tianjin's major goals to be attained in the foreseeable future are: By 1997, it should quadruple the 1980 GNP three years ahead of schedule; by the end of this century, it should initially set up the socialist market economic structure; and through 20 years' of struggle, it should become one of the areas that take the lead in basically realizing modernization. To attain these magnificent but extremely arduous goals, Tianjin is required to exert even greater efforts. It is of extremely great significance to achieve success in this year's work. If we can seize and make good use of the opportunity to make big breakthroughs in all work and effect even faster and better development, we will gain the initiative and embark on a favorable development path under the new situation and will lay a solid foundation for continuous advancement. Therefore, in this year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we should comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and seize the opportunity to form a new vivid situation of forging ahead in unity and quietly immersing into hard work in order to make 1994 a year in which Tianjin's economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and sound way, a year in which the establishment of the socialist market economic structure is accelerated, and a year characterized with stability, unity, and all-around social progress. To make this year's work a success and to fulfill all the tasks, the most important thing is to extensively and profoundly mobilize all the masses and the figures of all nationalities on all circles to work hard with one heart and one mind. This year, CPPCC committees at all levels should, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, should subject themselves to the overall situation of the work of the whole party, should continue to hold high the banners of socialism and patriotism, should better exercise the functions of political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in and discussion of political affairs, should unite all the forces that can be united, and should mobilize all positive factors in an effort to make a big breakthrough, a big progress, and even greater contributions to fulfilling all the tasks set forth by the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee and by the forthcoming second session of the eighth National CPPCC Committee. 1. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental principle, we should raise the CPPCC work to a new height. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics constitutes the Marxism of current China, the spiritual pillar of the whole party and the people of all nationalities in China, and a powerful ideological weapon to achieve success in reform, opening up, and modernization. With Comrade Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental principle, CPPCC organizations should, in particular, permeate all their work with Comrade Xiaoping's theory concerning the united front during the new period. We should conscientiously study and profoundly comprehend Comrade Xiaoping's exposition that the CPPCC is an important organization to consolidate and expand China's patriotic and united front, as well as an important form of China's political system to carry forward the socialist democracy and exercise mutual supervision; his exposition that the united front during the new period includes two alliances; his exposition that the CPPCC should hold high the two banners of patriotism and socialism; his exposition on realizing the plan of "one country, two systems" and accomplishing the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland; and his exposition that the general task of the CPPCC is to mobilize all positive factors, turn negative factors into positive factors, unite all the forces that can be united, pool the efforts of all fields to safeguard and develop political stability and unity, and work hard to build China into a strong modernized socialist country. The study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions concerning the united front work should be combined with the study of the guidelines of the important speeches on the united front work and the CPPCC work made by Comrade Jiang Zemin, Comrade Li Ruihuan, and some other central leading comrades. We should make continued efforts to deepen the understanding of Comrade Xiaoping's theory, comprehend the essence of the guidelines of the theory, have a good command of basic viewpoints, enhance our understanding of the theory, further strengthen the sense of glory and the sense of mission in doing the CPPCC work well, and give full play to the initiative and creativity of CPPCC organizations and members in order to raise the CPPCC work to a new height. 2. We should give full play to the role of CPPCC organizations in participating in and discussing political affairs in order to make new contributions to building the two civilizations. Participating in and discussing political affairs is a major task of the CPPCC, is a major form to exercise the fundamental functions of political consultation and democratic supervision, and provides an even wider sphere and even more opportunities for CPPCC organizations and members at all levels and the figures on various circles, that are connected by the CPPCC, to offer advise and suggestions and to give full play to their professional knowledge and skills. We sincerely hope that CPPCC organizations at all levels will participate in and discuss political affairs in an even more vivid manner and will achieve even greater results in this aspect. We should persist in democratic consultation. From now on, all the major issues related to Tianjin's overall situation should be subject to consultation before they are decided. We should give full play to the intelligence and wisdom of the figures on all circles to make policymaking more democratic and scientific. We should remove obstacles from the discussion channels, earnestly enact the provisional regulations of the National CPPCC Committee on political consultation and democratic supervision, and create a democratic and harmonious consultation environment for all democratic parties, people's groups, nonparty patriotic figures, and personages of all nationalities on all circles in an effort to remove barriers from and expand the channels of offering advise and suggestions. We should give full play to the unique advantages of the CPPCC, such as having a galaxy of talents and abundant intellectual resources, being not restricted by position, having a wide field of vision, having contacts with various circles, and representing a wide range of areas. With economic construction as the central task, we should pay attention to and conduct discussion of major affairs in line with the tasks and demands defined by the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee. We should focus on participation in and the discussion of political affairs on major issues that have a bearing on the overall development of the municipality. We should offer ideas, raise suggestions, and work for accelerating reform and opening up, for promoting economic development, for safeguarding stability and unity, and for building spiritual civilization. By participating in and discussing political affairs, the CPPCC should widely and frequently contact the figures of all circles abroad and should fully utilize its advantages and make even greater contributions to expanding the scale of opening up, utilizing foreign funds, and strengthening the friendship between China and the world. CPPCC organizations should continuously deepen their understanding of the participation in and discussion of political affairs, enhance their sense of consciousness and their sense of responsibility, and further improve their ability and expertise of participating in and discussing political affairs. Party committees and governments at all levels should fully carry forward democracy, provide wide opportunities for airing views to listen to public opinions, and create conditions for making the CPPCC participate in and discuss political affairs in an even better way. 3. We should pay attention to strengthening unity to help promote reform, development, and stability. The essence of the united front lies in mass unity and integration. CPPCC committees at all levels should regard the endeavor of strengthening unity as an unshrinkable duty and should play a positive role in strengthening the mass unity across the municipality. This year, China will take a big step in reform and put forward many reform measures. Hence, Tianjin is faced with an arduous task of reform and development. Under such a situation, Tianjin must appropriately handle the relations between reform, development, and stability, must not only foster the idea of depending on reform to promote development but also attach high importance to stability, and must safeguard political and social stability so as to create a good condition for the smooth progress of reform and development. Having maintained close ties with all circles of society for a long time, the CPPCC constitutes an important force to coordinate the relations between various sectors, to resolve contradictions, to strengthen unity, and to safeguard stability. CPPCC organizations should utilize its unique advantages to understand and reflect the public feeling through various channels and then help the party and the government dispel doubts and explain questions for the people through a penetrating and painstaking work, strengthen the friendship among the people, harmonize the feelings of the people, enhance the people's common understanding, further strengthen the unity among the people of all nationalities, all parties, all levels, and the figures of all circles, and encourage all the people to press forward with one heart and one mind the reform, opening up, economic construction, to safeguard stability and all-around social progress, and to work hard to invigorate Tianjin. 4. We should further build the CPPCC itself and make the CPPCC better suit the demands of the current situation and tasks. New situation and tasks set an even higher demand on the CPPCC. To successfully accomplish the glorious mission invested on the CPPCC and to create a new situation in the CPPCC work, CPPCC committees at all levels should further build themselves well. First, they should strengthen study. By carrying forward the fine tradition of self-education, CPPCC committees should encourage their members to consciously and voluntarily study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the politics on current event, the state laws and policies, modern scientific and cultural knowledge, and, in particular, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they can use Comrade Xiaoping's theory to seek unity of thinking and guide the work. To participate in and discuss political affairs in an even better way in the course of deepening reform, CPPCC members should also be encouraged to conscientiously study the "decision of the CPC Central Committee on some issues of establishing the socialist market economic structure" and study the knowledge and theory concerning the socialist market economy. Second, CPPCC committees should strengthen investigation and study. They should make great efforts to create conditions to encourage their members to go deep into the realities of life and the midst of the common people to conduct investigation and study in the light of the new circumstances and new problems cropping up in the course of reform, development, and stability and then offer feasible opinions and suggestions. Third, CPPCC committees should pay attention to summarizing experiences. By summarizing experiences, CPPCC committees should constantly deepen their understanding of the law of the CPPCC work and should further explore the new ways of doing the CPPCC work well. Fourth, CPPCC committees should strengthen and improve their office work. They should strive to improve the political and professional expertise of office workers, improve the quality and efficiency of their work, enhance the stratum and level of service, and build CPPCC organs into the "home of members" in an effort to made the CPPCC work even more vivid and achieve even more fruitful results in the work. The CPPCC constitutes the important organizational form of the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. Party committees at all levels should actually strengthen leadership over, attach high importance to, and give great support to the CPPCC work. Party committees should also list the CPPCC work as a major items on their daily agenda, listen to the report on the CPPCC work, do research for the CPPCC work, and help CPPCC committees solve practical problems. Major cases should be reported to CPPCC committees in a timely manner, and major problems should be consulted with CPPCC committees in a timely manner in order to give full play to the role of the CPPCC. The motions and suggestions offered by CPPCC members should be earnestly handled by departments concerned. All government departments should voluntarily strengthen the contacts with CPPCC committees so that CPPCC members can better understand government affairs and discuss government affairs in an even better manner. Support and assistance should be given to the inspection, visit, investigation, and study of CPPCC organizations. Press units should pay attention to widely propagating and reporting the CPPCC work. Fellow members and fellow comrades, the fighting goals and work tasks defined by the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee and by the second session of the 12th municipal people's congress are arduous but inspiring. We believe that in this new year, all levels of CPPCC organizations and all CPPCC members will certainly stand on a new starting point, give rise to a new atmosphere, and create a new situation with high morale and firm confidence. Let us closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, and work hard with one heart and one mind to further maintain and develop the fine trend of the municipality and win a new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization!
