"I have arguments which allow me to say this," he told a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. Kobelev, until recently the second party leader after Zhirinovskiy, made it clear that the arguments related to the financing of the LDPR election campaign. On the eve of the LDPR congress on April 2, Kobelev and two more deputies of the same faction, Aleksandr Pronin and Vyacheslav Marychev, received telegrams saying that they had been expelled from the party and that they could not participate in the congress. Another deputy who claimed he withdrew from the party faction Wednesday, said his step had been provoked by Zhirinovskiy himself. Vladimir Borzyuk, the head of the LDPR Orel branch, was quoted as saying that he could serve, but not be servile. Still another deputy, head of the LDPR branch in Udmurtia, Vladimir Novikov, officially announced Wednesday he was withdrawing from Zhirinovskiy's faction. The deputies said they still supported the LDPR program and charter and considered themselves members of the LDPR. Kobelev said they will be followed by other LDPR deputies who may hold an LDPR congress of their own once they constitute a sufficient number. At the same time, Kobelev said it would be difficult to work in the parliament outside the faction. He did not preclude joining some other faction or deputies' group in the State Duma. Among them, he indicated the nationalist patriotic Russian Way led by Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy Lukyanov, liberal reformist Union of December 12 headed by Boris Fedorov, Sergei Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Concord and the deputies' group New Regional Policy led by Vladimir Medvedev.
