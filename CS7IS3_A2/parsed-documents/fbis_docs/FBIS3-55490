To be honest, the people are more interested in Gamsakhurdia's suicide. [passage omitted] As for the introduction of 25,000 Russian soldiers, the best informed person -- Georgia's Security Minister Igor Georgadze -- has given us an answer to this question: [Georgadze] As for 25,000 Russian soldiers being stationed on Georgian territory, I can tell you with full responsibility that this does not correspond to reality. [Correspondent] Georgia's Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze was simply shocked by this question. He said the following: [Shevardnadze] Rumors are being circulated abroad that order is being poorly maintained in Tbilisi, and so why don't we call in the Russians and get them to organize a normal life for us? I think this is simply farcical. [Video shows correspondent reporting from Tbilisi, officials being interviewed]
