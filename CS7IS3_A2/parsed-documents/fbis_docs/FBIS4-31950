"The Chetniks were great patriots and they fought for the Serbian national question," Krajisnik emphasized on that occasion, emphasizing that the current struggle of the Serbian people for freedom and national state "can be compared to the struggle of the Chetniks during World War II." "Our state and political leadership and the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] are determined to create national reconciliation and affirm the patriotic struggle for the creation of the Serbian state in the years 1941 to 1945 to the utmost, even nowadays when a struggle for the final solution to the national question is being fought," Krajisnik specified, voicing his personal sympathy for the Ravna Gora movement. The president of the Serbian Republic Assembly also emphasized that the memory and the continuation of traditions will always exist within the affirmation of the Chetnik movement, adding that the state should regulate the celebration of all significant events from that period with legal acts. "If somebody will turn against the SDS now only because we are reaffirming the Chetniks, then let him," Krajisnik concluded. The representatives of the initiative committee demanded from Krajisnik that the movement of General Draza Mihajlovic's Ravna Gora Chetniks be legally rehabilitated and that the association's constituent assembly at the republican level be held in the shortest possible time. After the meeting with Krajisnik, the initiative committee held a session on the premises of the Serbian Republic Presidency at which it was concluded to "wait for the reply of the Assembly until 15 July, and afterward hold the founding assembly of the association in Pale or Ilidza." President of the Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Seselj, who has in the meantime dissolved his Serbian Chetnik movement, says that members of the Serbian Radical Party and the SDS took part in the organization of the new association, however, not as party representatives, but as veterans. Adding that the initiative for the creation of the association originates precisely from the ranks of the Serbian Radicals in the Serbian Republic, Seselj says that he fully supports any action aimed at rehabilitation of the Chetnik movement. The Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] is very surprised by the Bosnian Serbian leadership steering into Ravna Gora waters, especially, when one recalls that, until yesterday, even General Mladic himself would be taking cockades off the soldiers' caps. Milan Komnenic emphasizes that the Ravna Gora movement never propagated, and even less carried out, ethnic cleansing, nor did it propagate that the Serbs could live by themselves. "There were some people on the fringe of the Ravna Gora movement who had committed crimes and behaved aggressively and we are worried by Krajisnik's promotion of his own ideas about the Ravna Gora movement that have no connection whatsoever with this movement."
