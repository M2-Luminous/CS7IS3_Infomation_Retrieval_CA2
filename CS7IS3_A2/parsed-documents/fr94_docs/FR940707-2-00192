FR940707-2-00192 FR940707-2-00099 In 1986, the Pollack Report made a number of recommendations regarding short selling in Nasdaq stocks, but recommended against a formal short selling rule for Nasdaq. 48 Since 1986 the NASD has adopted a number of the recommendations for short sale regulation contained in the Pollack Report. The NASD now requires each member to mark all sale transactions either ``long'' or ``short;'' 49 requires each member, prior to accepting a short sale from a customer, to make an affirmative determination that it will receive delivery of the security from the customer or that it can borrow the security on the customer's behalf; 50 requires each member, with certain exceptions, to make an affirmative determination that it can borrow the security before effecting a short sale for its own account; 51 imposes mandatory buy-in requirements for cash or guaranteed delivery for Nasdaq securities where the buyer is a customer other than another NASD member, upon failure of a clearing corporation to effect delivery pursuant to a buy-in notice; 52 requires each member to report to the NASD, as of the 15th of each month, aggregate short positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in Nasdaq securities; 53 and requires a short seller's broker to close-out securities for cash or guaranteed delivery when delivery has not occurred within 10 business days after normal settlement date. 54 48 See supra note 31 and accompanying text. 49 NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice, Art. 3, Sec. 21(b)(i), (CCH) ¶ 2171.

On May 26, 1994, the NASD filed a proposed rule change to amend the definition of ``affirmative determination'' to require a member to maintain a written record identifying, among other things, the location and deliverability of the securities or the identity of the individual and firm who offered assurance that the securities will be delivered or available for borrowing by the settlement date.

The NASD also encouraged adoption of Rule 10b&hyph;21, 55 which prohibits a person who effects a short sale of an equity security between the filing of a registration statement and the time at which sales of such equity security may be commenced from covering the short sale with offered securities purchased from an underwriter or other broker or dealer participating in the offering. 56 55 See supra note 47. 56 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;21. B. The NASD's Initiative 1. The Need for a Short Sale Rule for the OTC Market The Commission is reluctant to approve regulations that are likely to hinder efficient price discovery. The Commission's experience with Rule 10a&hyph;1 demonstrates that limited short sale rule restrictions have not interfered with the efficient operation of the exchange markets, while reducing the potential for abusive short selling practices. In addition, investors derive a certain measure of confidence from short selling limitations. Over the past twenty years, the enhancements to, and growth of, the OTC market have led to increased expectations by investors, issuers and broker-dealers of Nasdaq securities generally, and Nasdaq National Market securities, in particular. Today, these participants expect safeguards in Nasdaq comparable to the exchange markets. The NASD believes that implementation of the principal Pollack Report recommendations have not adequately provided these safeguards.
