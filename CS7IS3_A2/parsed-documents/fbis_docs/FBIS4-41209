It said the measure would be enforced on a case-by-case basis in keeping with the program adopted by the four- party commission. The commission, now into a second day of work at the Black Sea city of Sochi, involves representatives of Russia, Georgia, Abkhazia and the United Nations. The timing and procedure of repatriating the refugees and displaced persons dominates its agenda. The ministry has spoken against any attempt to try to link the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in the region with the repatriation issue.
