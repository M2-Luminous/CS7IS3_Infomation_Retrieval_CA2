Norway has given its whalers a quota of 29 more whales than last year despite International Whaling Commission [IWC] advice that stocks could tolerate a quota of only one whale, even if the moratorium was overturned. The decision, 10 days after the International Whaling Commission meeting in Mexico, is likely to bring international condemnation and may bring sanctions from the United States. Under the quota set by Norway's Labour government, 189 whales will be killed by the commercial fleet and 112 for research. Last year Norway declared its first commercial whaling quota for six years in defiance of the 1986 moratorium and had hoped to get the moratorium overturned. A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture said last night "The government deplores Norway's decision to whale for a further year particularly in view of the uncertainty there currently is about the number of minke whales in the North Atlantic." At the Mexico meeting the scientific committee of the IWC took issue with Norway's assertion that there were 86,000 minke whales in the North East Atlantic The scientific committee said there were only 50,000. Greenpeace said that it was appealing to companies to step up boycotts of Norwegian fish. Last year Safeway and Iceland stores imposed boycotts of Norwegian products.
