In an interview with RESALAT newspaper, Velayati said an envoy would travel to the region on Thursday to resume mediation at the request of both sides. Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan urged Iran to renew its efforts to end the five-year war over the breakaway Armenian-majority enclave of Karabakh in western Azerbaijan. Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov also asked Iran, during a visit in December, to help end the conflict which has cost some 15,000 lives. Iran, which has its own Azeri population of 10 million and an Armenian community of 250,000, tried but failed to end the conflict in 1992, and has since repeatedly offered to mediate. Fighting in the enclave flared in 1988. After a year of military defeats, the Azeri army launched a counter-offensive on December 18.
