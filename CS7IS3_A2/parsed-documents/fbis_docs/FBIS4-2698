Yan Huili, Zhang's wife, said her husband had lost about four kilograms, was suffering poor health and his meagre food rations were being stolen by other inmates. Zhang, 48, one of China's most respected dissidents, was sentenced last year to three years' "re-education through labour" for allegedly "inciting incidents" and organising activities in Shanghai to mark the fourth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Another jailed activist, Fu Shenqi was being treated poorly at the Dafeng Labour Farm near Shanghai, but was not suffering any major health problems, his wife, Li Liping, said. In a letter smuggled out of Qingpu Labour Reform Farm, Zhang had said he was abused by other prisoners under the orders of team leader Chen Qingxing, Ms Yan said. He was constantly followed by at least two prisoners who shouted obscenities at him and pushed him around, she said. Zhang had complained of poor food, and said other prisoners even stole food from his meagre diet. During Ms Yan's last visit, watched by farm officials, Zhang had been unable to say much about his treatment, but she had learned from other sources that her husband was suffering chest pains, had sleep problems, had lost control of his right thumb and could not keep his hands steady. "They would not allow him to see doctors and only give him the medicine which I brought to him during the monthly visit," she said. Fu, 40, was detained last year for allegedly "instigating" others to protest against Zhang's detention. Ms Li said her husband was barred from keeping notes and reading, and could write to his family only under official supervision. She said the authorities had not replied to Fu's appeal, and no date had been fixed for the hearing. Fu filed an appeal in January after the Shanghai Huangpu District Court rejected his lawsuit against labour-reform authorities for illegal detention. Both wives said their families were under great financial stress because of their husbands' detention. Ms Yan had had to sell her personal belongings. Ms Li had difficulty paying for Fu's expenses in the labour farm and was living in extreme misery. She said she could not work because of illness and could no longer support Fu's parents.
