Environmental protection organizations yesterday warned that entire regions could become contaminated, severely threatening thousands of people. Greenpeace spoke of pesticide-poisoned "chemical lakes." The Federal Environment Ministry also conceded yesterday that the drums were "improperly" stored. According to Environment Minister Toepfer (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) there is a total of 4,000 tons of pesticides in Albania, some of it highly toxic, that had been delivered by the World Bank, the European Union, and Germany. One liter of this substance is enough to contaminate two million liters of drinking water. The toxic waste also includes 217 tons of GDR pesticides, which according to the Environment Ministry in Bonn were exported by Lower Saxony playing card firm Schmidt-Cretan in 1991 and 1992. Greenpeace claims that at the time the cargo, totaling 790 tons, was declared as "humanitarian aid" to agriculture. The environmental protection group tracked the toxic pesticides down two years ago in wagons of the eastern German railways. Government agencies in Bonn had known about the drums for years but so far failed to do anything. According to Toepfer (CDU), the German authorities had so far looked in vain for a World Bank and EU [European Union] disposal program. Toepfer now announced Germany would go for it alone. The possibility of "bringing them back" was currently being examined. He had already sent a team of experts from the Technical Support Service to Albania at the end of December. Toepfer is considering bringing the drums back to Germany by ship. He is afraid Albania is not an isolated case. Hungary and the Ukraine are also affected. Meanwhile, Greenpeace yesterday began making the pesticide containers safe. About 20 drums were packed and taken to the Yugoslav border by truck. It describes the situation in some places in northern Albania as catastrophic. "Drums are leaking, a chemical cocktail is seeping into the ground, gasses are escaping," Greenpeace says. People were complaining of burning eyes and breathing difficulties. Drinking water wells were threatened.
