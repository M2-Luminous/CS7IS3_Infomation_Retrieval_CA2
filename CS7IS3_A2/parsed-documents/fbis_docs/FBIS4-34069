We observed the great interest being shown by such important countries as the United Kingdom in Chilean economic development and in future British investments in the Chilean market. We are creating great expectations. [De la Maza] How do well-informed sectors in Europe view Chilean negotiations with NAFTA and with Mercosur [Common Market of the South]? [Aninat] With great interest and with special attention because it amazes them that Chile is undertaking two practically concurrent major negotiations, namely negotiating with North American countries--the United States, Canada, and Mexico--and with Mercosur member countries. This is a positive indication that we are maturing and gaining access to other types of alliance. This is how they see us. I say with special attention because EU countries do not want to be left out of Latin America, or Chile in particular, through this type of negotiations. This is very interesting for us and we should propose special relations with European countries. [De la Maza] In light of the criticism voiced about Chile's possible incorporation into NAFTA, from the workers' standpoint, how will joining NAFTA be to their advantage? [Aninat] For one fundamental reason: Chile has been on an export drive for more than 10 years, an outward-looking policy that seeks to promote exports. The performance of those sectors is fundamental for investments and employment. Moreover, Chile is a poor country which does not have enough capital at its disposal to undertake every interesting investment project. As we attract capital by promoting more investments in our country, there will be better and more productive employment. This is the key to sustainable wage increases. In other words, increasing productivity will mean workers will have more capital, technology, and technical knowledge about investments at their disposal which will, in turn, increase employment levels and productivity. [De la Maza] Many people wonder why Chile is so interested in joining NAFTA when we already have special tariffs on a considerable slice of our exports into the United States and we have a bilateral agreement with Mexico establishing zero tariffs. [Aninat] Joining NAFTA is not a matter of life and death. It is an important and complex negotiation, but it is neither unique nor a decisive negotiation. The lower tariffs on our products--which average a reduction of 3 percent--are to a large extent based on the premise that Chile will for ever be subject to the general system of preferences. These are unilateral preferences that the Unites States graciously grants if it so desires. We want a guaranteed and stable access and an openness over our trade with the United States. [De la Maza] What is your overall assessment of our economy? [Aninat] I believe we are doing fine. There is some impatience among some business sectors but I think we are doing fine in terms of the adjustment between spending, revenues, and our projection for the rest of the year. There is no doubt that inflation will drop in the second semester and we will see that our growth rate this year will be 4 percent. This is a little lower than last year but it will consolidate one great step forward and enable us to grow by 5 or 6 percent in real terms in 1995. [De la Maza] Thank you very much.
