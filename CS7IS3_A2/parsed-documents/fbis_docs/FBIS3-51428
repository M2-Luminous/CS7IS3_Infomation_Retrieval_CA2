"If we should be forced to leave our bleached bones on the desert trails in vain, beware the wrath of the legions!" That simple expression of feeling to a cousin has lifted Centurion Marcus Flavinius (a centurion was a kind of second lieutenant in ancient Rome) from obscurity and given him a place of honor in the most daring operation by the Brazilian military since the end of the dictatorship in 1985. In only 36 hours--between dinner on Tuesday the 7th and lunch on Thursday the 9th--the high command used veiled threats to prevent a 40-percent cut in its budget of 21.1 billion cruzeiros (at April prices). The cut had been part of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic package. In a pincer movement, the military condemned the Federal Supreme Court's decision not to strip former President Fernando Collor de Mello of his political rights and severely criticized the immobilism of the CPI [congressional investigating committee], which cannot decide how to punish the corrupt deputies. The hardest blow in that operation--an operation aimed at occupying space in the confused Brazilian political arena--came in a speech by the Army chief of staff, General Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel, on Thursday. He resurrected Centurion Flavinius and the latter's threats during what was supposed to have been a peaceable ceremony for presenting commanders' swords to new general officers in Brasilia. "It is essential that we--like our patron Caxias--know how to protect the nation from itself," was the shot fired by the general, 63, who served originally in the artillery. Considered a hard-liner, he built his career alongside former Minister of Army Leonidas Pires Goncalves, and he was selected to add more, let us say, emphasis to the message. At the commemoration of Air Force Day on 23 October, Fernando Henrique had assured Minister of Army Zenildo de Lucena that the military would not be affected by the cuts built into his budget package. By failing to keep his word, Fernando became the most probable target of the section of Gen. Benedito Leonel's speech in which the latter talked about "irresponsibility, crooked dealing, and disrespect for our most important values." Benedito (or Benedictus) Leonel concluded his speech by saying: "The time has not yet come for us to identify with the anguish of Marcus Flavinius." But the high command's howitzer had already hit its target: the government's strongbox. With the support of President Itamar Franco, who chose to diminish the credibility of his minister of finance and virtual candidate for president of the republic, the military have guaranteed that their uniforms will be safe from the effects of a package that is going to tighten the belts of ordinary Brazilians. Whereas the other ministries will have to work hard to stick to the $22 billion in cuts promised by the president, the Army, Navy, and Air Force will keep their three strategic projects: the nuclear-powered submarine, the space program, and the Italian-Brazilian AMX fighter plane. Operation "Kepi on the Forelock" was unleashed at the very cabinet meeting where the budget cuts were discussed: on Tuesday the 7th. "No, I don't agree. Would you like to have your pay cut in half?" Minister of Navy Ivan Serpa asked the head of the Planning Secretariat, Alexis Stepanenko. "I am doing what the president ordered. Why should he spare you?" Stepanenko shot back. He soon found out why. The next day, Serpa made it a point to let his irritation be known far and wide. Choosing Serpa to be the spokesman for military discontent was a deliberate move: he is one of the ministers closest to Itamar Franco. He headed a threat of collective resignation by the military ministers, a resignation that would have had unforeseeable consequences. And Gen. Zenildo de Lucena, who had kept a low profile at the start of the controversy ("we get along the best we can" was his comment), delivered to the president a statement explaining why it was necessary to stick to the original budget. In his document, the minister warned that the cuts would cause a situation even more serious than that in 1992, when there was not enough food and soldiers were excused from duty early in the afternoon so they would not eat a second meal at the barracks. For its part, the Navy sent a lengthy document out in all directions explaining the extent of its crisis. Every officer and every barracks became a trench in the operation unleashed by the senior officers. "The cuts will shut the Army down," said Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra in dramatic overstatement. "The Air Force's reserve supplies are nil," said the presiding judge of the Superior Military Court, General Cherubim Rosa Filho. "The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] has reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of operational effectiveness. It can conduct emergency operations only, and is not in condition for combat," he said in conclusion. "In terms of efficiency in Latin America, our Armed Forces are superior only to the military of Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, and Bolivia," said military analyst Roberto Lopes in agreement. Brazil ranks 73d among 140 countries in terms of military spending per capita. Each Brazilian spends $7 per year on his uniformed fellow citizens, compared to $55 in Chile. Cutting off military spending at the root would also throw a spadeful of lime onto the reeling Brazilian arms industry. "We would certainly have to close one of our firms: Aeroelectronics, which manufactures components for the AMX fighter," said Claudio Vianna, president of the Rio Grande do Sul group Aeromot. At the Rio de Janeiro Military Club on Wednesday the 8th, the disagreement seemed likely to pass from words to action. Members of the reserve joined with mothers, wives, and children in an attempt to organize a march protesting low pay. A sergeant 3d class in the Army was earning 80,866 cruzeiros in November, while a private had to be content with 8,670 cruzeiros. The protest was halted by the arrival of General Bayma Denis, commanding officer of the Eastern Command. In accordance with instructions from the minister of Army, he tried to calm people down, but a degree of dissatisfaction remained. "There is no reason for us to stifle all the anguish among the troops," one officer commented. Despite the rising temperature, almost no one mentioned a coup during the crisis. "The military have no plan to take power as they did before 1964, even though Brazilian society does not know what it wants from the Armed Forces," says analyst Roberto Lopes. The idea of a military mutiny was restricted to pockets of radicals such as the group headed by reserve Colonel Pedro Schirmer of Rio de Janeiro, who publishes the newspaper OMBRO A OMBRO and supports "energetic and bold measures even if they contradict false precepts that are allegedly democratic." In recent months, Schirmer's little group has been lining up with other coup-minded Latin American groups. His newspaper receives articles from Argentine "cara pintada" Mohamed Ali Seineldin, who is serving a life sentence, and General Francisco Efrain Visconti of the Venezuelan Air Force, who is in exile in Peru. But rejection of a coup did not mean that the high command would no longer engage in politics. Quite the contrary. Minister Zenildo de Lucena himself breached his strictly military image by criticizing the Federal Supreme Court's vacillation about confirming the revocation of former President Collor de Mello's political rights. "As a Brazilian citizen, I was disappointed," the general said on Thursday the 9th. "We military men would never do that," agreed Admiral Arnaldo Pereira, chief of the EMFA [Armed Forces General Staff]. Taking advantage of that instance of impunity, General Luciano Casales, deputy chief of the EMFA, aimed a few projectiles at Congress. "The cost of the Armed Forces to Brazilian society is less than that of the corruption uncovered by the CPI's, including overbilling and tax evasion," he told ISTOE. The civilian politicians have acknowledged the truth of what he says. "Their criticism is real. The country will not stand for it if the CPI leads to nothing, but I find the tone of some statements very worrying," said Deputy Jose Genoino (PT [Workers Party], Sao Paulo), a former guerrilla fighter in Araguaia who now has easy access to the military. And Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Para), a colonel in the reserve who went over to the legislative branch and now heads the CPI on the Budget Committee, admits that "the major new development is the fact that the military are talking about politics, something that did not happen under the Collor administration." True, but Operation "Occupy Space" began before the crisis. At the end of November, a group of military lobbyists coordinated by Gen. Benedito Leonel and his legionnaires met with about 30 heavyweight businessmen at the headquarters of the FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries] in Sao Paulo. The businessmen included the president of the FIESP, Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira; and the president of the National Confederation of Industry, Senator Albano Franco. The purpose was to gain support among the businessmen for some of the dogmas dear to the military, one example being the continuation of compulsory military service. The yearning by the military to enter deeply into the field of politics seems to have grown stronger in response to the absolute political vacuum accompanying the crisis following the announcement of Fernando Henrique's economic package. Congress, for example, has been unable to express itself as an institution--unlike the situation during Jose Sarney's administration, when Minister Leonidas Pires threatened the Constituent Assembly and encountered resistance from Deputy Ulysses Guimaraes at the head of the legislative branch. President Itamar Franco's open support during the current crisis has also encouraged the military. At the traditional yearend luncheon for the chief of state and the principal commanders of the Armed Forces, which was held in Brasilia on Thursday the 9th, Itamar tried to belittle the civilian government by overstating the role of the military. "I have been trying to lead the administration in search of new paths, but I am forced to confront terrible obstacles," the president said, hinting that the terrible forces in question were impunity and the selfishness of the politicians. The mutual attraction between Itamar and the military is not new. When he served two terms as mayor of Juiz de Fora in the 1960's and 1970's, he gained easy access to the commanders of the 4th Army Division and the 4th Military Region, both headquartered in that city. Itamar was elected by the MDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement], a party that opposed the military regime, and he was a close friend of General Itibere Gouveia do Amaral, commander of the 4th Military Region. At the time, Municipal Councilor Francisco Fonseca of the rival Arena [National Renewal Alliance] charged that the Secretariat of Public Works in Juiz de Fora had diverted funds to pay for improvements on the general's farm in Bicas, 33 kilometers from Juiz de Fora. Over the past three weeks, Itamar has left his isolation in Planalto Palace only to participate in military ceremonies. Despite urging by advisers, the president has refused to participate in any ceremony involving civilians. Senator Jarbas Passarinho says sarcastically: "He is half soldier." Following the success of their Operation "Kepi on the Forelock," the centurions in the three armed services certainly agree with Passarinho. Minister of Air Lelio Lobo went directly from the officers' luncheon with the president on Thursday to the Brasilia Air Base. There he boarded an FAB aircraft and soon landed in Sao Jose dos Campos, on his way to the office of the director of the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), General Nelson Taveira. Lobo was there to give the go-ahead for continued work on the AMX project and the space program. The Navy obtained a promise that it could continue building its nuclear-powered submarine (which is not expected to be completed before 2020), and the Army will get funds for a new runway at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Rio de Janeiro. That is where the world pentathlon championship will be held in 1994. The results of this military offensive did not stop there. The officer class is now taking it for granted that civilian and military personnel will be separated in the constitutional revision, thus making it possible to approve separate pay increases. The military adviser to Congress, Commander Sergio Porto da Luz, says it is "practically guaranteed" that the military will receive a 186-percent pay increase. That would make up for the pay they lost in 1993. It would also strike another very hard blow at Minister Fernando Henrique's policy of lean cows.
