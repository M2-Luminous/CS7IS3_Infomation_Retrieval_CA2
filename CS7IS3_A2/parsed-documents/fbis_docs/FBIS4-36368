FBIS4-36368 "drnes110dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Says Peace Will `Collapse' Without Payments Says Peace Will `Collapse' Without Payments JN0706143894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0955 GMT 7 Jun 94 JN0706143894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Report by radio correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat; from the "With the Midday Events" program] [Text] In a news conference held by Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, PECDAR, at the PECDAR headquarters in al-Barid suburb, northern Jerusalem, Dr. Abu-Libdah expressed the hope that all problems hindering the payment of funds by donor states will be overcome within the next few weeks so that the payments can be devoted to production and work, and to set up the infrastructure and the establishments of the Palestinian authority. He added: [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Since the signing of the agreement, several quarters have raised Palestinian expectations concerning what will come out of this agreement economically. The donor states pledged more than $2 billion last October, and renewed pledges of more than $643 million last January. Five weeks after signing the agreement, we have received only $5 million deposited in bank account in Cairo to pay part of the Palestinian police force's salaries. We signed an order to draw nearly $6.5 million two weeks ago from the funds available with the bank, and we have not received anything so far. We expect to receive this sum soon. Now the international community is being tested. Either we cooperate, on both the Palestinian and international levels, to realize the requisites for implementing this agreement and the donor countries will fulfill their commitments, or we will together witness the collapse of the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli level. The Palestinian National Authority will not be able to carry out its duties in Gaza and Jericho and meet its commitments toward the sons of our people in terms of services and the expected economic progress -- it will not be able to fulfill these commitments if it does not overcome the budget deficit and if it does not receive enough support to carry out a host of vital projects on which we have been working for the last few months. [end recording] Answering a question on whether the budget of the Palestinian Authority was endorsed by the Palestinian leadership, and how much this budget is, Dr. Abu-Libdah said: [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Yes, the budget has recently been endorsed by the Palestinian leadership. We are speaking about a budget that begins with this month and ends late this year. It is more than $360 million if we add the requirements of the Palestinian police force to this budget. Without the budget of the Palestinian police force, it will be about $220 million. Out of this sum, there is more than $126 million in expected deficit. As for the police budget, the situation is much worse than this. [end recording] The temporary liaison committee of the donor countries will convene a meeting in Paris next Thursday. The Palestinians will present the Palestinian budget for 1994, which was worked out in cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
