In a few days the findings of the "Slovene Public Opinion '94" poll will be officially presented to the Slovene public. The results of this year's undertaking are also interesting because of the possibility of a long-term comparison; the Slovene public opinion poll (which has been conducted since back in 1968 by the Public Opinion Research Center of the Ljubljana School of Social Sciences, under the leadership of Dr. Niko Tos) can boast of the longest tradition of that type on the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This year 1,050 respondents participated in the project. Strengthened Right Wing This year's results undoubtedly show interesting shifts. Last year the constantly emphasized dispute between Slovene President Milan Kucan and former Defense Minister Janez Jansa led to a "rewarding" of Jansa's aggressive policy, and a partial reconciliation of the electorate with Jansa's side, although Kucan still remains the politician who enjoys the confidence of all strata of Slovene society. At the same time, the recent dispute between the Police and Defense Ministries (the arrest of civilian Milan Smolnikar, overstepping the authority of the Defense Ministry's commissioner, as a result of which Jansa then took off), in spite of the stormy media campaign of the media loyal to Jansa, nevertheless did not harm the police at all, but rather primarily the Defense Ministry. Although the Slovene Defense Ministry, after 1991 (the June conflicts with the Yugoslav People's Army--author's note), received only the highest assessments in comparison with all other state institutions, after the above-mentioned case of the beating of a civilian, the situation abruptly changed; the ministry lost credit, and the public became much more critical of the activities of the Defense Ministry, which is now headed by Jelko Kacin. Naturally, the most interesting indicators are those concerning the oscillations of nationalism and interethnic intolerance. A comparison with last year's results leads to the assessment that those phenomena are slightly rising. The researchers see changes in the social structure as the causes of this. The feeling of being threatened is increasing primarily because of the war in the vicinity of Slovenia, as well as the increasingly clearer realization that the presence of refugees in Slovenia will remain a lasting problem. Only two years ago, at the time of the fiercest Serbian-Croatian war, polls at that time showed a very high, almost euphoric solidarity with the refugees; today the euphoria has vanished, and the solidarity has turned to rejection. The most perverse fact in all of this is that as many as 20 percent of the Slovene citizens polled "would not like to have a Jew as a neighbor" (in the 1991 census, according to data from the Slovene Statistical Yearbook, "as many as" 36 inhabitants stated themselves to be Jews); although anti-Semitism has not flourished in Slovenia to date, the latest results show the power of a stereotype, in which the respondents' personal experience obviously does not play any role at all. The researchers' interpretation is that such extremely nationalistic and racist prejudices are the results of "nonexperiential orientations," which means that the respondents form their attitude indirectly, on the basis of shifts in other societies close to them, for example in Austria, Germany, or Italy. Foreign Brothers Increased ethnic oversensitivity is being manifested in two forms: as aggressive nationalism (the group that supports such views represents about 10 percent of the population), and as distrust on the part of a majority of Slovenes toward the neighboring Yugoslav peoples, until yesterday "fraternal" ones, toward whom a majority of the respondents today express great coolness. In some cases, that deliberate emphasis on difference goes to ridiculous extremes. For example, in response to the question "How much are the peoples listed similar to Slovenes?" the respondents ranked the Germans in first place as closest to themselves, then the Austrians, and then, in order, the Swiss, the Czechs and Slovaks, the Croats, the Italians, the Americans, the Hungarians, the Russians, the Bosnians, and at the very end--the Serbs and Turks. On the other hand, in response to the question "Which languages do you use or understand?" the respondents answered that almost 90 percent of them spoke or understood Serbo-Croatian, 45.1 percent German, 37.3 percent English, 17.2 percent Italian, 6.2 percent French, and so forth. The irony is that thus, the vast majority of Slovenes, because of linguistic closeness and coexistence for many years in the same state, speak well and understand the languages of the peoples whom they view as the most foreign to them of all the peoples on the face of the earth. What lies behind such radical responses is an expression of sympathy or antipathy toward the actions of different peoples and states when Slovenia became independent, and a critical view of the causes of the war in Bosnia. The coolness that Slovenes express toward their "brothers to the south" is also apparent in connection with the answers to the question "Who is threatening Slovenia?" According to the majority's opinion, Slovenia is still most threatened by Croatia (50.2 percent), immediately followed by Serbia (46.6 percent). The third big and serious threat to Slovenia consists of the refugees (30.2 percent of the respondents), then Russia (27.3 percent of the respondents), and only then Italy (16.2 percent), with which Slovenia has a dispute over the Osimo accords, and Austria (5 percent), which has not yet fulfilled (and probably never will) its obligations from article 7 of the state treaty on the protection of the Slovene minority in Austria. Finally, after several years of critical reactions from the respondents, some positive vibrations can be observed only in the area of living conditions. Most of the respondents optimistically expect an improvement in living conditions in the future, even though no one expects dramatically rapid jumps. Such views are even partly confirmed by the data on the growth of exports, the halt in the growth of unemployment, and increases in direct foreign investments last year in Slovenia, which is trying right now to compensate finally for the loss of the former Yugoslav markets through free trade agreements with the members of the Visegrad group of countries. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |What Should Be the Condition for Receiving Slovene Citizenship? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Knowledge of the Slovene language |91| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Living for a long time in Slovenia |88| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Familiarity with Slovene culture |70| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Slovene descent |60| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Born in Slovenia |45| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Christian religion |28| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Who Is Threatening Slovenia? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Refugees |30.2| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Minorities |20| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Japan |3| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |United States |4| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germany |4| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |27.3| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Serbia |46.6| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Croatia |50.2| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hungary |3| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Austria |5| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italy |16.2| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
