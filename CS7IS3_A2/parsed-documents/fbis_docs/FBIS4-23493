This was announced on Tuesday [7 June] by the minister of justice, Mr Dullah Omar. Mr Chaskalson, an honorary professor of law at Witwatersrand University since 1981, was a member of the Technical Committee on Constitutional Issues appointed in may last year to advise the multi-party negotiation forum which drafted South Africa's interim constitution. Born in Johannesburg on November 24 1931, he is also a former long-standing member of the National Council of Lawyers for Human Rights and has been a consultant to the African National Congress on constitutional issues since April 1990. Mr Omar told a news conference in Cape Town that Mr Chaskalson was one of South Africa's most distinguished advocates and enjoyed international recognition and standing as a jurist. Mr Omar also announced the composition of the Judicial Service Commission which is to recommend six of the Constitutional Court's 10 judges. It is: Chief Justice Michael Corbett; Mr Chaskalson; the senior judge president, Mr Justice J A Howard; Mr Omar himself; Professor Etienne Mureinik; Senators I W Direko, E S Mchunu, B T Nqcuka and Ray Radue; Adv David Gordon, SC [senior counsel]; Adv George Bizos SC; Adv Kgomotso Moroka; and Mr J Ernstzen, a trade unionist. Mr Omar said the further names of two practising advocates and two practising attorneys would be announced once different positions adopted by the Association of Law Societies and the General Council of the Bar, on the one hand, and the National Association of Democratic Lawyers, on the other, had been resolved. He hoped this would occur "so as to enable the chief justice to proceed with the convening of the first meeting of the Judicial Service Commission". Mr Omar pointed out that in terms of Section 99 of the interim constitution, four Supreme Court judges are to be appointed to the Constitutional Court by President Nelson Mandela in consultation with the cabinet and with the chief justice. In addition to recommending judges and related judicial matters, the Judicial Service Commission would also play an important role in the rationalisation process flowing from South Africa being divided into nine provinces.
