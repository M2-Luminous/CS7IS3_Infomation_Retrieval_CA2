Dissent, if it existed at all, was not welcome and was cut at the root. Thus, we should not blame universal conformity and unanimity on the lingering collectivist mentality. There used to be a well-oiled machine to ensure that the cogs served the system reliably. Remember those endless party staff meetings, party and economic leadership meetings, directives circularly and instructional seminars? Apparently, the Presidential Service misses those unforgettable days of democratic centralism of the Communist Party, the time when those who carried out party and government policy diligently gathered in former Ordzhonikidze Street to hear the usual pep talk from the head of the department of propaganda and agitation. How else can you explain the appearance of this interesting document which fell into the hands of the NEZAVISIMOST? Here is the slightly abridged text of a directives circular sent out to local presidential representatives. We hope that the readers will draw their own conclusions. In light of the Ukrainian Supreme Council decision to hold early Ukrainian Supreme Council and presidential elections in Ukraine, it has become necessary to analyze the current disposition of forces among the participants of the political process in Ukraine and to identify areas of possible cooperation with them during the election campaign. The following citizens' organizations are the subject of study of this letter, drafted by the Presidential Service on Domestic Policy Issues: political parties; trade union organizations; veterans' organizations; and religious organizations. The stated positions are not final and may change under the influence of circumstances. Political Parties Before the Elections. At October 1993, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice registered 29 political parties. Based on territorial division of political influence, political parties can be generally divided into three groups; The first group consists of right-wing parties, the parties of the so-called national, nationalist and ultra-nationalist orientation, together with their satellite organizations; their influence extends to the western region (Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Lvov, Volyn and Rovno oblasts). They are the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP), the Ukrainian Peasants Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Christian-Democratic Party, the Ukrainian National Conservative Party, the Popular Movement (Rukh) of Ukraine (V.Chornovol, leader), the civic and political organization National Movement (Rukh) of Ukraine (L.Skoryk, leader), the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukraine National Independence. In addition to the western region, the above-mentioned associations of citizens have smaller affiliates in central Ukrainian oblasts, whereas in eastern and northern regions their political potential barely rises above zero. The other group is comprised of center and left-of-center parties whose activity and political influence cover the central region of Ukraine, as well as some eastern and northern oblasts. They are the Green Party of Ukraine, the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine, the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Beer Lovers' Party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Justice Party, the Ukrainian Solidarity and Social Justice Party, the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The remaining political parties have a left and radical left orientation. They include the Socialist Party of Ukraine, the Peasant Party of Ukraine, the Citizens' Congress of Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine. They mainly dominate the eastern and northern regions, or share their influence there with local parties such as the People's Party of Ukraine (L.Taburyanskyy, leader), the Liberal Party of Ukraine (Donetsk; I.Markulov, leader), the Labor Party (Donetsk; A.Azarov, leader), the Party of Economic Renewal of the Crimea and the Party of Ukraine National Salvation (Dnepropetrovsk Oblast). The main characteristic traits of the political parties' activity today are: the dominant position and role of party leaders in defining the political course of each party and in the decision making process; the dominant confrontational mentality resulting from the tough ideological and political struggle which is sustained by the parties themselves; and the activity of the the political parties is concentrated exclusively around power structures and is not directed toward bolstering their popular support. It is limited to congresses, conferences, discussions of their own programs to overcome the crisis and reactions by means of statements and declarations to various events in the political process. There are two main forms of party activity in the country: a. rallies and demonstrations; and b. opposition to local authorities, demands and attempts to replace them. The relative strength of different political parties, their political behavior, their attitude toward main events of the political process in Ukraine and their attitude to the political course of the president provide the basis for differentiating among political parties from the point of view of the prospects for their cooperation with the president. Potentially open to such cooperation are parties of a moderate center-left orientation (the Green Party of Ukraine, the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Justice Party and the Labor Party), as well as center parties (the Liberal Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Beer Lovers' Party, the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Ukrainian Solidarity and Social Justice Party). Excluded from this group are the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine and the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine, whose leaders, having joined forced under V.Chornovol, have recently displayed a slant against the president. Great difficulties are presented by the task of finding common ground with candidates and leaders of left-wing parties, such as the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Citizens' Congress, the Union of Ukraine Communists, the Socialist Party and the Peasant Party. At the same time, it should be noted that the political initiative of the president on the Economic Union of the CIS, as well as his position on the Masandra agreements, were welcomed by them and their affiliated organizations as a sign of the ability and willingness on the part of the president to display political will and assume the initiative and responsibility for resolving very difficult political problems. This also reduced the likelihood of attacks on the president from the left. Given the responsible change of political course by the president, certain goodwill on the part of left-wing political forces, in particular from the Socialist and Peasant parties, can be expected during the pre-election period. The Rukh, the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine and Memorial base their election platforms on opposition to the president; they should be considered as the core of a possible unified anti-presidential bloc on the right. Ultra-radical nationalist groups, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, the National Independence of Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Conservative Party and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists are moving toward opposition to the president. The election campaign, which has in effect already begun, will cause changes in the structure of political blocs. It should be noted that the form and makeup of possible electoral blocs among parties at the regional level and at local centers may not always follow accords and agreements at the leadership level of those political parties. Existing political parties have real influence on a relatively small portion of the electorate. For this reason, the election campaign will be informed by the actions of other political and economic groups: trade union organizations, associations of entrepreneurs and producers, economic managers and managers of the agricultural sector. Trade Union Organizations Thirteen national trade union organizations exist in Ukraine. The largest of them is the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU), headed by O.M.Stoyan; it is comprised of 40 all-Ukrainian industry trade unions and 26 organizations from oblasts, the Crimean Republic, and the city of Kiev, as well as inter-industry (regional) associations. Considering that the FPU has some 20 million members and possesses an extensive organizational network and considerable material and financial resources, it can be predicted that that trade union organization will have a considerable impact on the electoral campaign. Overall, the position of the FPU on the current government and political issues is moderate. Unlike some other trade union associations and strike committees, the FPU in its activities does not go outside the law. Under pressure from grass-root organizations who want the FPU leadership to act more decisively in providing social protection to workers, the position of the FPU has become more radical in recent months. The second FPU congress, which took place at the end of August 1993. severely criticized the Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the president for the policy of "robbery of the population." A resolution was approved demanding an early dissolution of the Supreme Council and a referendum (in September 1993) on the socio-economic and political structure of the state, on the form of state government and on the confidence (or no confidence) for the president of Ukraine. The FPU welcomed the decision of the Supreme Council to hold early Supreme Council and presidential elections and considered them "to some degree satisfactory." In the new Supreme Council, the FPU intends to create its own trade union faction. The FPU pursues the policy of constructive cooperation with the structures of presidential authority both in the central government and locally. However, leaders of some trade unions in the FPU have a determined, non-constructive attitude toward the president. This primarily refers to trade union leaders in Odessa and Kharkov oblasts, the trade union leadership in the coal industry and some others. The leaders of those trade union organizations are opposed to the current policy of the FPU and its leadership. The FPU maintains contacts with political parties of different orientations, but as of now it has not yet concluded any agreements of cooperation in the election campaign with any of them. It can be predicted that an active part in the election campaign will be played by the All-Ukrainian Association of Labor Solidarity (VOST), which has often supported political forces of the right. There are signs that that association, together with the Independent Trade Union of Ukraine Miners (NPG) and some other small trade unions, may join the coalition of political forces behind V.M.Chornovol and his supporters. However, the latter trade unions have small membership and lack a broadly based organizational network, so that their influence in the regions in insignificant. Leaders of the strike committees in the Donbass maintain their opposition to the president. At the same time, strike committee leaders have criticized the position of O.R.Mril, the head of the NPG, for his intent to ally himself with V.M.Chornovol. In the election campaign, the strike committees may support such political parties as the Liberals and Labor. Strike committee leaders intend to run for the Supreme Council themselves. The position of the strike committees, due to their influence in the miners' collectives in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, will probably be reflected in the results of the elections in the Donbass. The analysis of the situation in Ukraine trade union circles ahead of the election campaign suggests that the position of the trade union organizations will largely determine the results of both the Supreme Council and presidential elections. A strategy for the pre-election period should be developed with this in mind. Veterans' Organizations Despite the lack of organizational unity among veterans' organizations in Ukraine, all those different groups and associations of veterans have absolutely identical political sympathies, with the exception of those who rally around the radical interpretation of the national idea. This similarity in evaluating socio-political processes in Ukraine reflects several factors; principal among them are common life history, tied to the building of "socialism" in the USSR and extreme financial difficulties experienced by older people. However, when discussing the pre-election mood of older people, we should not overestimate their conscious adherence to various political forces. A highly defined political orientation is typical mainly to those veterans who are actively cooperating with the nationalist forces or who had been actively involved in the implementation of the "communist" idea. As a whole, the masses of veterans are open to a widest variety of political influences. Religious Organizations The post-totalitarian period of development in Ukraine has been characterized by an extremely high level of politicization of the church. The existence of conflict situations between some religious organizations is being used by a variety of political forces and their leaders to further their own ends, which in effect informs the participation of the church in the election campaign. In particular, the Congress of National Democratic Forces counts on the strong support from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate; plus the Congress continues to rely on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Galicia, although with less certainty. Thus, attempts by some Congress leaders to establish the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate, as the national church, in fact a state church, make it doubtful that believers belonging to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church would continue to support that political movement. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Kiev Patriarchate; the Ukrainian Autocephalian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church are the most politicized among religious organizations and they generally adhere to the ideas of radical nationalism. However, those religious organizations have only regional influence and make up only one third of all religious organizations, and even less than that in terms of the number of adherents. The least politicized are such churches as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (the largest in Ukraine in number of parishes and followers), the Protestant Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Religious organizations of ethnic minorities will most likely look to the left and center-left forces, which do not share the idea of establishing a single national church.
