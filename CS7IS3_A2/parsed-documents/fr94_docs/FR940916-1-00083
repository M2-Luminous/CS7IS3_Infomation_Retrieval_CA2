FR940916-1-00083 FR940916-1-00016 The AAR and a number of railroads commented that dynamic brakes are not safety devices but are economical devices and their operation should be governed by the railroads' operating rules and not federal regulations. Every railroad commenting on dynamic brakes stated that they are not the primary brake and are not used to stop a train. The parties considered the devices optional features used to save fuel and reduce wear and tear on brake equipment. Therefore, the commenters felt that any decision to equip a locomotive with dynamic brakes and any specific handling instructions as to their use should be left to each individual railroad since their installation and use must be based on an individual economic analysis. Several commuter and passenger railroads commented that they operate with blended brakes on MU cars and, thus, feel that any regulations regarding dynamic brakes need to separate these types of operations from conventional freight service. Several commenters also stated that dynamic brakes do not have a fail-safe feature and can fail at any time. The most common failures reported by these parties occur in brake resistors, traction motors, grid systems, blowers, and control modules and contactors. However, the railroads reported that dynamic brakes are relatively dependable and trouble free. Two railroads stated that they had failure rates of less than three percent. Several commenters stated that the reliability of dynamic brakes is influenced by the degree of maintenance they receive. Several railroads reported that they perform routine preventive maintenance every 92 days. One railroad stated that their routine maintenance includes visual inspection of equipment, inspection of grid blower brushes, verification of trainline continuity, check of MU jumper cable wiring, check of main generator voltage regulation, and verification of previous dynamic brake operation via recording system playback. This railroad and one other carrier also stated that at major servicing facilities set up of the dynamic brakes is verified. In addition, these railroads commented that dynamic brakes are part of the daily inspection and that if enroute failure of dynamic brakes occurs the train crew is to complete a form, contained in the locomotive, detailing the problem. With regard to pre-departure testing of the dynamic brakes, the AAR and several railroads stated that, due to the operating efficiency of dynamic brakes, a standing test of the devices would merely let the engineer know if the dynamic brakes set up, but would not inform him as to whether they will work, and that in order to completely test the devices the train must be moving. However, these commenters also discouraged the use of running tests since such a test would require at least a 10-mph speed, whereas most facilities have 5 mph speed limits and because creation of slack in a train is inadvisable at some locations. The AAR and a number of railroads commented that there is no equipment available today to monitor the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives. These parties also stated that the monitoring of trailing units is really rather useless due to the fact that dynamic brakes can fail at any time. One railroad commented that a prototype device capable of monitoring the dynamic brakes on trailing locomotives has been developed but no production model is available and the cost of the device would be $10,000&hyph;$15,000 per locomotive. The AAR also provided an approximate figure of $100,000 as the cost to retrofit an individual locomotive with dynamic brakes. The RLEA recommended that dynamic brakes be employed on all trains, be in working order, and be tested before all departures and that training be provided on their usage. The RLEA would also like mandatory installation of a device that would monitor the dynamic effort on trailing locomotives. The BLE and BRC did not think that dynamic brakes could be monitored and felt that even if they could, it would probably not be that effective since dynamic brakes tend to fail while in use. The BLE did recommend that railroads be required to maintain the equipment. In addition, the BRC and BLE recommended that if dynamic brakes are present a running test should be required, even if performed at less than 10 mph since such a test would at least indicate whether the dynamic brakes are functioning. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) commented that the railroads are improperly describing dynamic brakes as a luxury. The NTSB stated that railroads preach and encourage the use of the dynamic brake and, thus, should ensure at least from the initial terminal that the system will work.
