FR940913-0-00022 FR940913-0-00005 This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller olives for limited use styles would therefore improve grower returns. On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15&hyph;1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited use size olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of ยง932.52 of the order. The one handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers, due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements are the same as those established during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than were in effect during the 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94 crop years. The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year minimum size requirements. Prior to the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below 1990&hyph;91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size requirements below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives. During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives. Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023 tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024 tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991&hyph;92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259 tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990&hyph;91 season, limited use olive processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers. Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements being established for the 1994&hyph;95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies. Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives.
