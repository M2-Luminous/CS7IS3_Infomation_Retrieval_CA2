He explained that in this process, there is no intention of returning to the past schemes that have now become outdated, "but neither can we allow the market to dictate everything." He also announced that his ministry is prepared to undertake a review of all of the integration agreements the country has signed, with a view to improving those that can be revised, in terms of the international relations situation, to the benefit of Venezuela. Minister Palacios made these points during his brief address following the investiture ceremony and the signing of the pertinent record of investiture by Dr. Gustavo Perez Mijares. The outgoing minister mentioned his brief service in the Ministry of Development, and he expressed his thanks for the support given him by the personnel and the professionals he called upon to work with him in what he called "this process of transition." He noted that the Ministry of Development is an economic ministry, although during his short term of service he gave it the social weight it should have. He said he is satisfied with the work done. "I am aware that I could have done more, but time moves on inexorably." He also admitted that he might have made mistakes. "We are all human." But he added that "we have also had our successes, and that is the important thing." Following the formal ceremony, which included the swearing in of Dr. Werner Corrales Leal as the new director general of development, Dr. Luis Carlos Palacios met with the group of journalists who had attended the transition ceremony. Seated at his new desk, he answered their questions cordially. [Escalante] Minister Palacios, what is the nature of this new industrial policy you have announced? [Palacios] It will be a policy requiring that the action of the state be convergent with the action of the market. It should not be presumed that the action of the state should be allowed to disappear, in the belief that the market will govern everything. [Escalante] Wouldn't this be something like establishing freedom for the market to function, while at the same time imposing norms and controls? [Palacios] Well, there are always norms to which adherence is necessary. Such exist in every institution. Markets can exist because the institutions exist, and the economic agents must conform to their rules and restrictions. [Escalante] What kind of support would this new industrial policy give the manufacturing sector, with a view to its development? [Palacios] You see, the main idea is to encourage growth from the inside out. In addition, this growth must be convergent with all of the other factors in the economy, and, naturally, the sectorial aspect must be taken into account. Both the industrial policies and the specific sectorial aspects must be oriented toward a single goal, which is the development of the country. In this connection, industry, because of its ability to promote and link the technological advances and innovations with the increase in productivity, will obviously play a key role in Venezuela. Palacios then went on to note that Venezuela is an oil-producing country. A large part of the national income comes from this product, but its capacity to generate jobs stands at a mere 1 percent in relation to the other sources of jobs. "For this reason, we have to realize that oil is not everything." In view of this circumstance, he warned that "any country looking toward the 21st century must base its development on the strengthening of its industrial sector, making use of its comparative advantages and developing its competitive advantages." [Escalante] Does this growth from the inside out involve a revision of the current customs system and the establishment of some measures to protect certain areas? [Palacios] While continuing to respect the international agreements signed, we will review all of the integration agreements, in an effort to ensure that our participation in international trade is participation that truly promotes development, rather than merely a naive and indiscriminate involvement. [Escalante] This will be done with regard to the existing agreements with Central America and the Caribbean? [Palacios] With all of them. [Escalante] Including the Andean Pact? [Palacios] Including the Andean Pact, of course. [Escalante] What will be done where the mechanisms already established in the country to combat antidumping measures and subsidies are concerned? [Palacios] All of the existing tools, and how they mesh with the needs, will be reviewed in order to enable us to draft an efficient industrial policy. Minister Palacios made it clear that it is very likely that this policy will be ready by 1995, and that "the role of the government will be to present it to the country." "The industrial policy we will implement will be that which the country produces." [Escalante] On the level of the consumer public, could this new industrial policy mean an increase in the basic market basket and in controlled prices? [Palacios] In his address, President Caldera appealed for compromise and solidarity. In economic policy, this could be reflected in an effort to achieve a price agreement, so as to be able to eliminate the inflationary inertia without causing supply problems or sudden rises in prices. [Escalante] Will there be a specific policy for small and average industries? [Palacios] The new industrial policy that will be presented to the country will include special treatment for small and average industries, as Dr. Caldera indicated in his address. In conclusion, Luis Carlos Palacios, the new minister of development, said that "this will also mean seeking some convergence with the financial sector, in order to resolve the problems of financing and reorganizing the state bodies that are involved with this issue."
