Li Peng said: Through the two countries' joint efforts, Sino- Australian relations are developing with a strong momentum. China hopes the two countries continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations in all fields.' He noted that China and Australia share extensive common interests in upholding peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, promoting regional economic cooperation, and developing their own economies. He continued: In the current international relations, the economic factor plays an increasingly important role. Sino- Australian cooperation in iron and steel, energy, transportation, and communications has a sound foundation and holds great potentials for expansion. Evans said he agreed with Li Peng on this. He said: Cooperation between the two countries has expanded in both size and substance. Australia is pleased to see the big momentum of its trade and economic cooperation with China. Li and Evans exchanged views on the human rights issue. Evans said Australia supports the "Vienna Declaration" adopted at last year's world human rights congress. Li Peng added that China also supports the declaration and made big efforts in its drafting. Li stressed: The declaration has written into it the numerous developing countries' basic viewpoints and demands on the human rights issue. It specifically states that the right to development is an inalienable part of the basic human rights. The declaration, while affirming the universality of human rights, says "the characteristics of each country and region and the importance of their historical, cultural, and religious background cannot be ignored." In other words, people should not neglect the conditions of different countries or confine human rights to only one mold. He said: The declaration states that poverty and foreign debt are big obstacles to human rights. Therefore, the right to development is an undeprivable human right. Li Peng stated: The latest resolution adopted at the recent UN Commission on Human Rights shows that it would not do [shi xing bu tong di 5887 0008 6639 4104] to impose one country's views on human rights onto others. The only correct way is to conduct friendly discussions on an equal footing [ping deng you hao di jin xing tao lun 1627 4583 0645 1170 0966 6651 5887 6062 6158] on the basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences. Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, exchanged views with Evans in the morning on developing Sino- Australian trade and economic relations. Foreign Minister Evans held a news conference in Beijing at noon.
