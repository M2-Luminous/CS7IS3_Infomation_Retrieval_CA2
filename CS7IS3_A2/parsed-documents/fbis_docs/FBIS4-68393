The board of directors invited Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to speak. The meeting proceeded in the traditional American style: The negotiating table doubled as a dinner table. True, after Mr. Shokhin's 40-minute speech there were so many questions about Russian investment legislation that the deputy prime minister did [not] have a chance to "lunch." The American Chamber of Commerce, which has been operating in Moscow only since January, has begun to work with a knowledge of its task. Which is not surprising: Its board of directors includes representatives of the largest companies--from Coca-Cola to Caterpillar, from Johnson & Johnson to General Electric, from Philip Morris to Chase Manhattan. And the communication with Mr. Shokhin shifted from problems of Russian reforms and civil accord (he noted, in particular, that parliament's readiness to reach agreement with the government should be revealed as early as Friday--during the discussion of the draft budget)--to questions related to business in Russia. Here too, as the deputy prime minister noted, on the one hand, Russia cannot use the old Soviet laws, and on the other--business conditions cannot be changed frequently. In this connection he recalled Boris Yeltsin's September edict which introduced a three-year moratorium on changing legislation regarding foreign firms operating in Russia. Other laws will also have to wait their turn--in a couple of days the civil code ("the most productive economic document") will be submitted to the State Duma, and the government's immediate plans include laws on the banking system and foreign investments. From the podium of the American Chamber of Commerce the deputy prime minister presented an initiative to introduce one more moratorium. This time regarding state structures that handle foreign investments and redistribution of duties among them: "Or else we will all be 'improving' the structures but the investor, in confusion, will not even know with whom he is dealing." The questions from the businessmen showed one thing: Americans, even those who have firmly set their feet on Russian soil along with their capital, cannot understand precisely what it is here that does not coincide with their native laws. For example, why their commercial banks and insurance companies are not given freedom in Russia. Mr. Shokhin had to explain that one strong insurance firm from the United States is capable of crowding out practically all similar Russian ones in a year. And in response to the obvious desire to feel at home in Russia (from the standpoint of laws) the businessmen had to hear many reproaches against their own authorities as well. The laws of the United States, according to Mr. Shokhin's estimate, contain up to 260 discriminatory restrictions against Russia. Bill Clinton promised to abolish them back in Vancouver. In Russia they expected that this would be done by a single act ("restrictions regarding the USSR do not apply to Russia"), but "in Congress they decided to study each case individually." One-third of them have been abolished, but the congressmen will have to work another couple of years on the rest of them. So Russian exporters to the United States will not soon feel that they are equal either. [First box, page 3] Some Information from U.S. Investment Legislation --The United States does not require special permission or preliminary registration of investment operations. The national conditions envisioned for U.S. firms, as a rule, apply to joint companies. --Federal laws prohibit foreign investors from owning or holding a controlling block of shares in corporations in the spheres of television and radio broadcasting, telegraph, and satellite communications systems, construction and operation of nuclear power plants and pipelines, extraction of mineral resources, and coastal or maritime shipping. Aid to foreign investors at the federal level is most frequently granted in the form of guaranteed loans. --Supervision of the activity of foreign firms is provided by the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Investments (consultative agency) which is answerable to Congress. Monitoring of portfolio investments is the responsibility of the Department of Finance. --At the level of the states and local agencies the finance department coordinates the activity of foreign capital and leaves monitoring up to the states. A number of states have programs for attracting investments and more than 20 have missions in Europe.
