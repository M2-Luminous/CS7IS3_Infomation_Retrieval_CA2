Shokhin said a number of barriers have already been cleared, but a final accord can be reached only after his meeting with Deputy Chairman of the European Commission Leon Britten, during which trade in enriched uranium will be discussed among other things. Russia has already tabled compromise versions which can be finalised into an agreed upon text. If this is done, it would be possible to initial the agreement before the end of June while Greece is holding the chair in the European Union and sign the agreement when Germany takes over. Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian delegation which was conducting talks with the European Union in Brussels, was appointed to represent Russia at the funeral of the former U.S. President Richard Nixon and subsequently had to cut short his stay in the Belgian capital to just one night. His meeting with Leon Britten will take place in Moscow next Sunday. According to Shokhin, the preparation of the agreement with the European Union took longer than expected because last autumn in Russia, after President Yeltsin failed to attend the meeting with the leaders of the EU countries in Copenhagen, rejected the "lighter-weight" version of the accord proposed by the European Union. That version was signed by Ukraine, whose economy was described as "an economy with a state-run system of trade." Russia continued to work towards greater benefits than those provided for in the rejected version. Speaking about his impressions from the trip to the United States, where he led a delegation to a session of the provisional committee of the International Monetary Fund and the World Banks' development committee, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed to an interesting peculiarity: These world financial organisations are worried more by problems of security and crime than by economic issues in Russia. It means that they no longer doubt that Russia would pursue a normal economic policy and create a favorable investment climate. Shokhin also held a meeting in Washington with representatives of the big seven. His previous meeting with them in February was mainly in the nature of finding out more about the situation in Russia, but in April "we got down to business," Shokhin said. "We discussed the investment climate and soliciting investments." The gathering also discussed questions relating to the forthcoming G-7 Summit in naples. During the funeral of ex-President Richard Nixon, the Russian vice-premier had a conversation with President Bill Clinton, who said Russia would not have any particular problems concerning its participation in the "political Group of Seven." Problems remain concerning the economic format, and these problems must be discussed. The G-7 leaders are prepared to expand the agenda of their meeting in Naples, and Russia proposed discussing not only financial support of economic reforms but also global economic problems in the solution to which Russia is interested and can actually contribute. One is the creation of a non-discriminatory trade order. Along with this the normalisation of the situation on the commodity markets calls for working out measures, on a multilateral basis and with the participation of Russia, to take due account of mutual interests of parties involved. As concerns negotiations with the Paris Club, it was agreed that in late May or early June it would consider a variant of agreement with Russia for 1994 (the four-month extension of the terms of the accord for 1993 is now in effect). In the International Monetary Fund, Russia continues to work in favour of the initiative calling for the additional issuance of the fund currency (special borrowing rights giving access to these resources to Russia and other countries, which did not take part in the distribution of these funds earlier. If the unfair approach is removed, Russia and other Commonwealth, east and west European countries will be able to get about one billion dollars. Russia is working towards partnership relations in handling with universal problems, it is not just asking for help but is upholding universal rules with the help of which both Russia and others can benefit. "This will be our leit-motif in contacts with the Group of Seven and international financial organisations," Shokhin stressed. "It is not aid in exchange for reforms that we want, we want to create universal mechanisms of partner interaction."
