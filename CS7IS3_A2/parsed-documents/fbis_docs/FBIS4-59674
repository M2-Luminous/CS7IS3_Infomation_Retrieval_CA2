During the meeting, discussions dealt with the developments in our country in light of the explosion of the military situation and the rebellion against the legitimate authority by the apostate and secessionist gang in the Socialist Party's leadership. The brother chairman briefed the Arab League delegation on current developments, pointing out the subversive role that has been played by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the Socialist Party's leadership since 19 August 1993, including what happened in Abyan on the eve of the signing of the pledge and accord document, the explosion of the military situation in Harth Sufyan, Shabwah, 'Imran, and then in Dhamar and later in Aden against the central security personnel and the 2d Armored Brigade in al-Rahah in Lahij. He also reviewed what is currently taking place on various axes of combat. The brother chairman held the rebellious, secessionist clique responsible for igniting the war, imposing it on our people and the legitimate leadership, and leading the country into its current situation. He stressed that the secessionist gang represents a small clique that has violated the people's will and national consensus and rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy to implement its secessionist plan and dismember the homeland. He indicated that the security organs recently discovered large quantities of weapons stockpiled by that gang in various parts of Sanaa and other cities to spread chaos in the country, foment sedition among the children of our people, and abort unity and democracy. The brother Presidential Council chairman said he is confident the brothers and friends would understand the reality that what is taking place in Yemen is a domestic affair and a rebellion by the secessionist gang against legitimacy and unity. He also said that the secessionist, rebellious, and adventurous elements which made the decision to go to war should recognize unity and constitutional legitimacy and give themselves up to be fairly tried, or leave the homeland to avert our people and their Armed Forces further bloodshed. He stressed his eagerness for dialogue within the framework of safeguarding unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. He also highly valued the Arab League's role and its concern for legitimacy and safeguarding Yemeni unity, given that it is a national gain for the Arab nation. He said that our country can never do without the role of the Arab League and of all the brothers and friends in standing to the side of our Yemeni people, supporting Yemeni unity, and Yemen's democratic course, and its constitutional institutions. For his part, the brother Arab League assistant secretary general has emphasized the Arab League's concern for Yemen's unity and for security and stability in Yemen. He stressed that the Arab League is ready to play any role that will safeguard Yemen's safety within the framework of unity and legitimacy.
