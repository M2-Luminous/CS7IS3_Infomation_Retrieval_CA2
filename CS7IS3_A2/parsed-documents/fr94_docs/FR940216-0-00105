FR940216-0-00105 FR940216-0-00010 The round-robin testing is to be completed by January 1, 1995, statistical analysis of the test results will be completed by June 1, 1995, the new tolerance will be announced by EPA by July 1, 1995, and the new tolerance will be effective beginning in January, 1996. In the event the round-robin testing program is not completed by January, 1995, the benzene tolerance will be 0.03 vol% beginning in January, 1996, provided that the failure to complete the program is through no fault of EPA. If, however, the testing program failure is EPA's fault, or if the testing program is completed in accordance with the round-robin testing protocol and the testing data is submitted to EPA by January 1, 1995, the initial 0.21 vol% benzene tolerance will continue to apply beyond January, 1996. If, through EPA's fault, the announcement of the tolerance is delayed beyond July 1, 1995, the new tolerance will become effective six months following announcement of the new tolerance, and until then the tolerance of 0.21 vol% will apply. C. Independent Sampling and Testing Requirements In its 1992 supplemental proposal, EPA proposed that refiners and importers would be required to carry out a program of independent sampling and testing of reformulated gasoline that is produced or imported. 57 FR 13445. Only refiners commented on this proposal; without exception, these comments were critical. Nevertheless, EPA has retained the independent sampling and testing requirement in the final rule, with certain revisions based on comments, for the reasons contained in the 1992 SNPRM and in today's notice. In the 1992 SNPRM, EPA explained the reasons for the independent sampling and testing requirement. Independent sampling and testing would flag errors in refiner or importer analysis and allow corrections of either noncomplying product or of the accounting books kept by these parties. These errors could be caused by mistakes in sample collection, sample analysis, by bias in the refiner's or importer's sampling and/or testing system, by inadvertent mistake, or by outright cheating. In addition, EPA expects that reformulated gasolines will almost always be combined in the fungible gasoline distribution system after it leaves the refinery, and in many cases such fungible mixing will occur before the gasoline leaves the refinery or is transferred by the refiner to another party. Once fungible mixing occurs, there is no opportunity to look behind the refiner's or importer's test result records, except for those limited cases where EPA inspects reformulated gasoline at the refinery before fungible mixing of the gasoline occurs. This problem is amplified by the averaging option available for refiners and importers. Once a batch of reformulated gasoline becomes mixed with other batches from the same or different refiners or importers, EPA is no longer able to test this fungible mixture to determine compliance with either per-gallon or averaging standards. EPA can then only sample and test for compliance with the maximum and minimum requirements, and has to rely on the refiner's or importer's records and test results to verify the accuracy of averaging and credit reports that are submitted. Sampling and testing by EPA would therefore normally be a valid check only for maximum and minimum requirements, and will not provide a means of verifying whether the individual gasolines contained in a fungible mixture met the reformulated gasoline per-gallon or average standards when produced. Absent independent sampling and testing, therefore, there would be little or no means of verifying whether reformulated gasoline met standards, or whether reports of credit creation are accurate. Commenters on the proposed rule cited a number of reasons the independent sampling and testing requirements should be revised or not be made final. One commenter stated that independent sampling and testing is unnecessary and redundant to other enforcement requirements included in the reformulated gasoline program, such as penalties for noncompliance, the quality assurance sampling and testing defense element, gasoline quality surveys, recordkeeping, and attest engagements. While these enforcement requirements in the final rule are important, their focus is different from the focus of independent sampling and testing. Quality assurance sampling and testing is a required showing for most parties presumed liable for downstream violations that is intended to monitor compliance with the maximum and minimum requirements, and is not intended to monitor the accuracy of the per-batch properties refiners and importers enter into their records. The recordkeeping requirements do not play a verification role; records kept by refiners and importers are only as accurate as the information entered by these parties. The gasoline quality surveys monitor the overall quality of gasoline being used in a covered area during the survey periods, but the capacity of surveys to detect cheating by refiners and importers is limited. Surveys will take place in any covered area during only several weeks per year. In addition, the gasoline used in a covered area is a mixture of the gasolines produced or imported by a large number of refiners and importers, often hundreds or thousands of miles distant from the covered area. Surveys would not be expected to detect improper deviations in gasoline properties from the properties reported by one or several of these refiners or importers. The procedures specified for attest engagements were specifically designed to not overlap with the independent sampling and testing provisions. In any event, in most cases attests would not be capable of detecting errors or cheating in sample analysis; an auditor only can review the information contained in a refiner's records, and is not able to collect and analyze samples of gasoline produced months prior to the attest engagement.
