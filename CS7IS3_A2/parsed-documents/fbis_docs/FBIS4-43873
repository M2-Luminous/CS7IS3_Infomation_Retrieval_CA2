P. Dhimas from Washington] [Text] Athens could continue the Greek-Turkish dialogue at a low level and on issues that would not concern the Aegean, based on the inactive 1988 summit agreements between Athens and Ankara -- specifically the "Memorandum of Vouliaymeni of 1988" -- signed by Karolos Papoulias and Mesut Yilmaz. Yesterday, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis proposed this to his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, who was quick to express the hope that the Greek Government will deal with the tension in the Aegean with "care and sensitivity." Athens appears to be well-aware that the U.S. Government wants to: a) promote its economic, political, and military penetration in the Balkans and, b) support Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's government. The U.S. Government wants to play a "catalytic role" in the settlement of Greek-Turkish differences. Without wanting to stir up Greek-Turkish relations, the Greek Government does not want an isolated U.S. mediation role. According to government sources, it wants to point out that the Greek-Turkish dispute is also a problem of the international organizations, i.e., NATO. Arsenis told his U.S. interlocutors that Greece also has a NATO responsibility to protect the Aegean airspace (area 41) [not further identified] and called U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's statement about disarming fighter planes in the Aegean "disproportionate." The Greek side reiterated its firm position that it cannot abandon its sovereign rights in the Aegean and that an attempt to resume Greek-Turkish dialogue through the "hot" issues will immediately lead to a deadlock. It is unknown whether the U.S. side has accepted or understood the Greek position on the Aegean, but it appeared receptive. Arsenis also expressed Greek views and plans about broadening cooperation with the United States, even military cooperation in the Balkans within the framework of prospects of the "Cooperation for Peace" treaty. Reviewing the situation, he showed particular concern about border incidents between Serbia and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. The Arsenis-Perry meeting gave the two sides the opportunity to briefly outline the agenda of the talks they will have in Athens during the U.S. defense secretary's official visit in July. According to informed observers, Arsenis passed the "message" that during Perry's visit to Athens, the Greek side wants talks on establishing a headquarters in Larissa. Its said that the Americans received "contradictory messages" from Greece on this issue, because of Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris' opposition. Specifically, according to U.S. military sources, Kouris removed from the agenda of the bilateral defense talks, which were held in Orlando in January, the issue of the establishment of a headquarters in Larissa. The topic was included at the U.S. initiative. Earlier, in December, the U.S. received an "Arsenis message" through Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou that the Greek side wanted to begin talks on the headquarters issue. The distance of views resulted in U.S. accusations about "Greek double-talk" on the headquarters issue. Before meeting Perry and John Shalikaskvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Arsenis had breakfast at the Greek Embassy with U.S. presidential adviser George Stefanopoulos, immediately after arriving in Washington.
