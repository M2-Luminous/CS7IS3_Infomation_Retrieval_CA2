FR941116-0-00168 FR941116-0-00022 (d) Prevented planting requests will not be approved unless all of the following provisions apply: (1) Other producers in the area were prevented from planting the same crop or similar crops; (2) All cropland feasible to plant the crop was affected by the disaster; (3) Preliminary efforts made by the producer to plant the crop are evident, such as discing the land, or seed and fertilizer were delivered or arranged for; and (4) The acreage was prevented from being planted because of a disaster rather than a managerial decision. (e) If the county committee cannot approve the ASCS&hyph;574 for prevented planting without a representative's farm visit, a late-filed ASCS&hyph;574 can be approved only if: (1) The cost of the farm visit to verify the disaster and determine the acreage involved is paid by the operator in accordance with part 718 of this title; (2) The ASCS&hyph;574 contains sufficient information to determine that the prevented planting was because of a recognized disaster; and (3) Evidence of the disaster is still apparent on the affected acreage. (f) Producers who have had irrigation water rationed under one of the following conditions are eligible to apply for prevented planting credit: (1) The irrigation water is withheld by a Government entity or water district and the producer is not compensated for such withholding by the entity or district; (2) The irrigation water is withheld by a Government entity or water district, and the producer is compensated for such withholding by the entity or district; (3) The producers use a combination of ground water supplied by a Government entity or water district and their own irrigation wells; and (4) The producers must have been personally notified by the Government entity or water district that such irrigation water supply will be reduced. (g) Producers who do not have their irrigation water rationed, but choose to sell or lease such water to a Government entity or water district, or have their irrigation water reduced because the Army Corps of Engineers released less water from containment dams under its jurisdiction are not eligible to receive prevented planting credit. (h) Producers who apply for prevented planting credit because of water rationing shall supply the county committee with documentation to indicate: (1) The amount of water reduction; and (2) The normal water allocation received by the producer in past years. (i) Producers who meet the eligibility requirements contained in paragraph (f) of this section may be approved to receive prevented planting credit equal to the percentage of water reduction times the permitted acres of the crop or crops. The percent of water reduction shall be the effective percentage of water reduction before the ending planting date for the crop, as determined by the county committee. Producers who use a combination of Government entity, water district, and their own well water will have the percentage reduction determined by the county committee. Only the amount of irrigation water normally supplied by the Government entity or water district will apply when calculating such reduction. (j) Producers who have their water allocation permanently reduced or cut, and who are approved for prevented planting credit, shall receive such prevented planting credit for the affected crops only in the year in which the reduction occurred. Prevented planting credit for reduced irrigation shall not apply for subsequent years. (k) To be eligible for failed acreage credit for a crop, the acreage must have failed by either of the following dates:
