FR940111-0-00085 FR940111-0-00019 Finally, the NFDA-NSM proposal that the GPL's ``give for retention'' requirement be changed so that only consumers who request to keep the GPL may do so is not supported by the record. The evidence indicates that most consumers value the GPL enough to keep it when it is offered for retention. 150 The Commission might not disagree with the NFDA suggestion if there were evidence that consumers are aware of their right under the Rule to retain the GPL. The record does not contain that evidence, however, and instead shows that consumers generally are unaware of their rights under the Rule. 151 There is no record basis from which to conclude, therefore, that consumers would think to ask to retain the GPL. Consumers, as a result, would be denied the opportunity to use the GPL to comparison shop in at-need or pre-need situations, 152 or to compare authorized selections with final funeral home charges. 150 Eighty-seven percent of RS respondents and 82% of Gallup respondents who were offered a GPL to keep said that they took it with them. See R-B&hyph;2 at Table III&hyph;32, p. III&hyph;46, and HX&hyph;66, Ex. B, p. 7 and Tabulations, p. 29. 151 A majority of consumer respondents to the AARP's ``Excel'' Study were unaware that providers are required to give consumers written price lists when they come in to make arrangements. See Soulas, HX&hyph;76 at 3. 152 Record evidence indicates that consumers may increase their comparison shopping before selecting a funeral provider as the marketing of pre-need funeral services increases, because the time constraints surrounding at-need arrangements are not present to the same degree. See, e.g., Neel, R&hyph;E&hyph;1 at 3. The Commission has amended ยง453.2(b)(4)(i) to effect two changes to its original, preventive requirements. This amendment remedies providers' stated concerns about the timing of the GPL without limiting consumers' ability to use the information provided by GPL disclosures effectively. First, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``timing'' requirements by breaking down the triggering term ``funeral arrangements'' into its component parts, namely, discussions of prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific funeral goods or services. This change should eliminate the apparent provider misinterpretation that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation of preliminary arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. It clarifies, however, that discussions about the overall type of service trigger the GPL requirement, and that providers must give the GPL at the beginning of any discussion involving prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific funeral goods or services. 153 153 Record evidence indicates that some providers have construed the term ``selection'' in the original provision to mean choosing individual items, such as the casket or vault. See, e.g., F. Hunter, Tr. Vol. I, 801 (``as long as before they sign the contract, before they look at the caskets and select the vault and the exact kind of funeral''); J. Hunter, Tr. Vol. III, 604&hyph;605 (``after we have discussed some basic funeral plans, when the arranger has determined a feel for the families' wishes and desires, and prior to the selection of any services and/or goods''); Pierson, R-G&hyph;1 at 2&hyph;3; Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 402; Franzen, Tr. Vol. II, 818). Other providers are reluctant to discuss the GPL until price issues are raised. See, e.g., Hocker, Tr. Vol. III, 1435; Johnson, Tr. Vol. I, 744; Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 402&hyph;403; and Hennessy, Tr. Vol. II, 1024. Second, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``distribution'' requirement contained in an original compliance guidelines interpretation that requires that providers must give consumers the GPL whether discussions occur in the funeral home ``or elsewhere.'' Record evidence shows that arrangements may occur away from the funeral home premises. However, the amendment exempts from the GPL requirement in-person provider requests for prior embalming authorization if the provider makes essentially the same GPL disclosure required by ยง453.3(a)(1)(ii) of the Rule concerning the legal necessity for embalming. 154 154 Any other discussion during that time about price or the selection of funeral goods or services would trigger the requirement that providers give consumers the GPL. Record evidence indicates that providers often may be placed in the uncomfortable position of responding to consumers' requests to discuss selections during removal of remains. If providers are willing to commit consumers to financial obligations at that time by making arrangements, record evidence supports consumers' right to receive a GPL. Record evidence also shows, however, that giving the GPL during removal may be awkward, offensive, and unnecessary if no other arrangements discussions occur at that time. Such evidence further indicates that a provider's request for prior embalming authorization, by itself, may be the most potentially offensive situation for both consumers and funeral directors, because it is a request to perform an intrusive procedure so soon after the survivors' loss. 155 155 See R-N&hyph;1 (SR) at 207&hyph;218 for a full discussion of prior embalming approval issues raised during the proceeding. The original and amended Rule resolve this issue for embalming requests made over the telephone by not requiring any disclosure in that case. But the original Rule required that the GPL must be given if the request is made in person. 156 If no other selections are made when the provider seeks prior permission, arguably the most important information consumers need to make an informed response at that time concerns whether embalming is necessary. The required disclosure that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases should trigger that discussion if the consumer so desires. The Rule's embalming provisions are predicated on that basis. The amendment simply substitutes the disclosure of that information for the provision of the entire GPL, to reduce the burden on providers and consumers and to promote compliance with the Rule. Under the amendment, providers would be in compliance if they either provided a GPL when seeking prior permission, or made the required embalming disclosure. 156 See R-B&hyph;6 at 28078 (Illustration # 8).
