Karadzic bases his modest optimism on the fact that, as he said, the orientation toward peace has prevailed in the world and also because of the superiority of the Srpska army. Karadzic added that the Muslim side would eventually have to sit at the negotiating table because it cannot achieve anything on the battlefield. The international community is tired of the war and is afraid of a Balkan war, Karadzic said addressing journalists. In connection with the situation in Gorazde, Karadzic said that the Serb side had earlier warned of the planned Muslim spring offensive, saying that it would respond with all available forces. If the Muslims do not stop attacking, we will launch a counteroffensive and then let the Security Council save them, Karadzic said in Trebinje where he inaugurated the festival of Ducic's Evenings of Poetry. He was presented the festival's award.
