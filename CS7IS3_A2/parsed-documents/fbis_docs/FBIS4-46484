Makarov and Retired Captain 2nd Rank A. Chirkov: "Reorienting Formations"] [Text] The discussion of the Navy's new strategic concept continued in the June issue of this magazine and the issues associated with the role of strike aircraft carriers, the development of a new type of combat formations and joint utilization of fleet aviation and the Marines were examined. In the articles along with the proposal on the reduction of the number of active strike aircraft carriers, the opinion is being expressed on redesignating them as amphibious aircraft carriers. It is thought that these aircraft carriers must be part of the amphibious forces. Other authors advocate maintaining strike aircraft carriers as part of the fleet and propose ways to increase the combat capabilities of carrier task forces while supporting the operations of forces in coastal areas. So, 8th Special Purpose Group Commander Captain 3rd Rank Katan summarizes the experience of the utilization of a special purpose platoon that was on board the strike aircraft carrier "Saratoga" for four months (June-September 1992) as part of the 6th Fleet. On the aircraft carrier, this platoon accomplished combat training missions: search and rescue of personnel, search and capture of individual enemy facilities at sea and on the coast, special reconnaissance, guidance and adjustment of carrier-based aircraft strikes against enemy coastal facilities, and also peacekeeping functions and participation in the evacuation of the population. The missions cited were rehearsed in exercises and during the course of the carrier task force's daily activities on the Mediterranean Sea. Training of special purpose platoon personnel was conducted from an aircraft, a helicopter, from an aircraft and a helicopter simultaneously, and from a submarine. Based on the experience obtained, the appropriate regulation was developed for the utilization of such groups that are permanently attached to aircraft carriers that are part of the 6th Fleet. While proceeding from the new Naval concept that was set forth in the White Book, the naval forces command authorities view the development and utilization of the new operational-tactical unit, the so-called naval combat group -- MBG -- that is an elementary unit of U.S. sea power. A guided missile cruiser will become the nucleus of this unit. The guided missile cruiser's functions will include collection, processing and assessment of information based on data that is arriving from various sources to obtain a complete picture of the targets that are located in the region's air-surface-underwater space and making decisions on the utilization of electronic systems. Besides the guided missile cruiser, the naval combat group is made up of ships with the Lamps system, a nuclear submarine and a base patrol aircraft. If necessary, they envision reinforcing the naval combat group with land-based reconnaissance aircraft, including AWACS. They think that this composition of the group will be capable of carrying out surveillance, issuing target designation to conduct strikes against assigned targets and conducting defensive operations in the water-air-land space in a 300-mile radius from the center of the group. This group may be deployed in a potentially dangerous area, providing in the process antisubmarine defense, antiship missile defense and air defense and conducting airborne electronic reconnaissance. Coordination of operations will be carried out by a combined coordination center that is located on the guided missile cruiser. The availability of the naval combat group will substantially increase the combat capabilities of carrier forces, increasing the zone of their operations and expanding the circle of the missions being accomplished. This group can conduct delaying combat operations during the initial period and monitor the situation until the arrival of the carrier strike group or other forces. The naval combat group concept was proven during the course of two years (1990-1991) in the Mediterranean Sea. The regulation developed based upon the concept of conducting combat operations by ground forces is the guiding document for the Marines. Its main idea consists of the joint utilization of air and ground Marine forces and fleet carrier-based aviation. Organizationally, this is expressed in the development of the functioning of an air-ground operational formation which must be rapidly deployed to the designated area to conduct combat operations. This operational formation is capable of accomplishing air support missions, including providing direct air support and also of conducting missile-bomb strikes against enemy rear services facilities. They propose including combat aircraft and helicopters and also ground-based subunits to accomplish the assigned missions. A reassessment is being conducted of the possibilities for the utilization of carrier-based aviation as a result of the development of Marine air-ground operational formations. So, the opinion is being expressed that during operations in coastal areas, it must accomplish the following missions: support ground operations by achieving air superiority air in the designated area; conducting strikes against enemy fixed targets that are located in the rear area and also providing direct air support to ground forces. The authors of the articles think that the new Marine doctrine provides the initiative in the conduct of combat operations to aviators, which will certainly increase the effectiveness of the employment of ground forces.
