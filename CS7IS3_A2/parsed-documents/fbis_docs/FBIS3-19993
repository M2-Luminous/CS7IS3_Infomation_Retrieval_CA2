Speaking to the media in Berlin today, he pointed out that the renewal and restructuring of the capital stock had made considerable progress over the last three years. Thus from 1991 to 1993, 342 billion marks [DM] were invested in the new federal states and the eastern part of Berlin. Of this, DM288 billion was allocated to the private sector and DM54 billion to the state. Merk went on to say that in 1993 the per capita figure for gross fixed asset investment in the former East Germany exceeded the level in the former territory of the Federal Republic for the first time. Net investment per capita was as much as 140 percent higher than in the former territory of the Federal Republic. Thus the gap in capital stock between eastern and western Germany had been reduced. Following the deep economic slump, particularly in 1990 and 1991, and the loss of more than a third of jobs, gross domestic product increased in real terms by 9.7 percent in 1992 and 7.1 percent in 1993. This had particularly positive effects on the construction sector. Thus, production in the construction sector had begun to increase again from mid-1991. The president of the Federal Statistical Ofice pointed out that the imbalance on the labor market is still very large. An annual average of 1.15 million people were unemployed in 1993. It was also calculated that the burden on the labor market had been eased by around 1.5 million people due to labor market measures such as training courses, retraining, and job creation schemes. At the end of February 1994, 1.3 million people were registered unemployed. The gap between incomes of private households in the states of the former East Germany and in the former Federal Republic closed significantly, particularly in 1991 and 1992. Disposable income per capita stood at DM1,450 per month in the second half of 1993. This is 62 percent of the West German level. In the second half of 1990 incomes had been 41 percent of the West German level. Gross salary and wages per employee reached almost 71 percent of the level in the former West Germany in the second half of 1993, Merk announced. Compared to the second half of 1990, they had increased by 124 percent. Consumer prices rose by 38 percent over this period in the states of the former East Germany, particularly because of the alignment of rents and several public service tariffs. The price hikes have since settled down. In February 1994 the price index for the cost of living of all employees' households had only increased by 3.5 percent compared to the same month in 1993.
