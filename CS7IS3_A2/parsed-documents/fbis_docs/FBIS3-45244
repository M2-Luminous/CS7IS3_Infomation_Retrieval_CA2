Forty large enterprises and enterprise groups have been listed as the first batch of enterprises in the country to enjoy preferential treatment in adopting the enterprise technical center system. These include Jilin Chemical Industrial Corporation, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, Yatai Enterprise Group of Chemicals for Agricultural Use, and the China Great Wall Computer Enterprise Group. According to the regulations, the listed enterprises will be exempted from taxation in importing meters and instruments, chemical reagents and technical data, which China is not yet able to produce, for their technical centers to develop new technology. The products in trial production developed by their technical centers will be exempted from income taxes for a certain period. The technical centers also enjoy some other preferential treatments. Different from most developed countries, China used to separate research institutes of applied technology from enterprises. Experts noted that the new practice will promote the integration of research with production, thus accelerating the process of research and application of new technology.
