The January jobless rate remained at a high level, following an identical 2.7 percent in October and November and a revised 2.8 percent in December, the agency said in a preliminary report. The December jobless rate was first reported as 2.9 percent, the highest since June 1987 when it stood at 3.0 percent to close in on the postwar high of 3.1 percent posted in may 1987. The January jobless rate represents a decline of 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier. In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, rose to 0.67 in January from 0.65 in December, meaning that there were 67 jobs for every 100 people looking for work. The dismal job reports come as many Japanese corporations are grappling with excessive labor forces in the wake of the prolonged recession. According to the agency's report, the number of jobholders edged up 0.5 percent or 300,000 from a year earlier to 63.26 million in January, a bigger increase than December's 100,000. The number of people out of work jumped 21.1 percent or 320,000 to 1.84 million as the manufacturing sector continues to fall victim to corporate moves to trim work forces. In the manufacturing sector alone, the number of jobholders fell 2.7 percent or 410,000 to 14.84 million for the 15th consecutive monthly dip. The long stretch of decline apparently reflects a growing trend among manufacturers toward shifting production abroad in a bid to cope with the negative effects of the stronger yen. Employment in the agriculture sector also fell but that in the construction, wholesale, retail and food sectors increased from year-earlier levels. Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if tallied by U.S. or European methods as members of the Self-Defense Forces and people working more than one hour in the last week of the month are counted as employed.
