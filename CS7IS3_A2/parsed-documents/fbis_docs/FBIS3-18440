Next to the burned out comets Lothar de Maiziere, Guenther Krause, and Rainer Ortleb, she remained the fixed star in politics: Angela Merkel (39), federal minister for women and youth, the last in the group of the first hour from the east. In the theater of Bonn, Angela Merkel does not dance for the grandstands. She stands so conspicuously inconspicuously in the first row as though applause is rather painful to her. She has laboriously shed her cocoon without turning into a butterfly. She emits a gentle radiance, whereas others try to light up the sky with the brilliance of their ideas. The adjectives for her work range from "inconspicuous" to "persistent" and "unerring" and those for her person extend from "sensitive" and "vulnerable" to "courageous." The truth is that all of them fit. In her three years in the west, the woman from the east has learned to swim in the tank with the sharks: "There are many here who are not as invulnerable as they appear to be." She has developed her sense for the political depths to the point where she can also perceive diffuse signals of power in time. Angela Merket has no desire to "acclimate herself through opportunism"; she prefers to "dress more warmly" against political cold waves. She uses self-irony to protect herself against being ground down in Bonn. "The girl," as Helmut Kohl calls his minister, is the eldest of three children of a Hamburg pastor and a teacher. When Angela Dorothea Kasner was still in diapers, her father took over the pastorate in Quitzow near Templin. The family moved to the March of Brandenburg. The girl knew the names of all the members of the GDR Politburo. But she could also recite "the entire cabinet of Konrad Adenauer and experienced the election of Gustav Heinemann as federal president through the radio in the school lavatory." Angela Kasner majored in physics and graduated from the University of Leipzig in 1978, and received a doctorate in 1986 with a dissertation on "The Calculation of the Velocity Constants of Elementary Reactions With the Example of Simple Carbohydrates." She learned how to tie the knot of the blue neckerchief of the Young Pioneers and perceived herself "as part of the GDR state and simultaneously lived in permanent rebellion against the system." Her motto at the time was this: "Anyone who does not do mischief, becomes stupid." In 1979, she married the physicist Ulrich Merkel. The childless marriage failed. In 1989, as the GDR neared its end, Angela Merkel got involved as a publicity worker with the "Democratic Awakening" of Wolfgang Schnur and as assistant spokesperson of the last GDR Government under Lothar de Maiziere. In August 1990, she found a brief political home with the eastern CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. After unification, she became a member of the first all-Germany Bundestag in Bonn through a direct candidacy in the Stralsund/Ruegen/Grimmen election district, receiving 48.5 percent of the first votes. On 18 January 1991, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl entrusted her with the new Ministry for Women and Youth. The rise of Angela Merkel in the CDU is likewise one of the most abrupt political careers in postwar Germany: she became deputy chairman of the federal party after Lothar de Maziere resigned in December 1991, and she became chairman of the land Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania for the CDU after Guenther Krause resigned in June 1993. The manager of the ministry -- 250 employees and an annual budget of 2.5 million marks -- hurries from nest to nest: "Unfortunately there is no time left for a real home": her political berths are on the Rhine and the Baltic Sea; her infrequent private resting place is Berlin, where her life companion lives. Angela Merkel fights against the cliche of the chancellor's submissive foster daughter: "I admire Helmut Kohl, but that is not a relationship of submission." She allows herself to be used as a party soldier, "but I am not an accommodating woman." She proved that with a number of original initiatives: - In the fight about the rewording of the abortion Paragraph 218, she did loyally join the majority in the Union against the term solution but she set an accent of her own with the motto "help instead of punishment." - She presented the draft of a law on equality of rights, under which firms are supposed to prove that in their hiring they do not prefer male over female applicants, and she suffered the strong opposition of her parliamentary group. - She started the national action "No Violence Against Children" to curb the criminality with the largest number of unknown cases. - She engaged in frank discussion with radical rightist and leftist young people. - She called for "ethnology" as a compulsory subject in the schools because of the continuing violence against foreigners. - She called on the television establishments to limit sex and violence on the viewing screens. - She favored a general legal right to kindergarten spots. The 60-kg woman is the talent that the CDU would like to use in the German east in the super election year. General Secretary Peter Hintze praises: "She is a credible representative of the democratic movement in the former GDR and a convincing performer in the Federal Government." The last person in the first batch loves the soft tones of her favorite composer Mozart, because: "The one who shouts is usually wrong." She is not invulnerable: "If they hit me in the right place, they can really hurt me." By now she can do that too. She thinks: "The discussion about the Stasi files should not be taboo"; there ought to be "no pause in the Stasi files because it happens to be election time." That is aimed above all at Brandenburg's Minister-President Manfred Stolpe (SPD) [Social Democratic Party of Germany], whom she sees as an "obstacle in dealing with the past of the GDR." Stolpe, she demands categorically, "must resign"; he has let himself "into a game with the devil that has led him into extreme situations." The CDU woman with the bobbed hair looks at the framed portrait of Konrad Adenauer. It is the only picture in her new office on Rochusstrasse in Bonn. She then mounts a frontal attack against her opponent, just as the old man from Rhoendorf once did: "I was seldom as angry in the GDR as I was with the passage of the SPD-SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] paper. All of us there considered Hermann Axen and the others to be idiots and social democrats around Egon Bahr got involved with them and appealed to the same intellectual roots." The dismantling of Saxon Minister of Justice Steffen Heitmann, who should have been federal president if it had been up to the chancellor and in accordance with her wishes, "really embittered her" and "was a disappointing experience on the way to German unification." Many in the west, she thinks, "obviously cannot imagine that someone from the east might do something right." The candidate from the east was asked the "sort of elementary questions that would not be allowed for a west German candidate--neither for Mr. Rau nor for Mr. Herzog."
