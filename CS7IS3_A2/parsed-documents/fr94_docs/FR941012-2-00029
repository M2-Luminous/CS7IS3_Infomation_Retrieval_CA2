FR941012-2-00029 FR941012-2-00014 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Restricted Eligibility Support of Advanced Coal Research at U.S. Colleges and Universities AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center (PETC). ACTION: Notice of restricted eligibility. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b), it intends to conduct a competitive Program Solicitation No. DE&hyph;PS22&hyph;95PC95200, and to award, on a restricted eligibility basis, financial assistance (grants) in support of advanced coal research to U.S. colleges and universities. These grants will be awarded to a limited number of proposals selected on the basis of scientific merit, subject to the availability of funds. The solicitation is expected to be available on October 7, 1994, and proposals must be received by the designated DOE office on December 2, 1994. The solicitation will be distributed on 31/2'', double-sided/high density discs in Word Perfect 5.1 format. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Donna J. Lebetz, U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 10940 (MS 921&hyph;143), Pittsburgh, PA 15236&hyph;0940, AC (412) 892&hyph;6206. Requests for solicitation copies must be made in writing or be transmitted via facsimile (FAX) to (412) 892&hyph;6216. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Through Program Solicitation DE&hyph;PS22&hyph;95PC95200, the DOE is interested in applications from U.S. colleges and universities (and university-affiliated research centers submitting applications through their respective university) for research and advanced concepts related to coal science that have the potential to improve our fundamental scientific and technical understanding of the chemical and physical processes in coal conversion and utilization. Eligibility Applications under this solicitation may be submitted in response to the requirements of the (1) University Coal Research (UCR) Core Program, (2) Joint University/Industry Coal Program, or (3) Technical Topic 8 (CO 2 Ocean Disposal Experimentation). Applications in response to the UCR Core Program or the Joint University/Industry Coal Research Program must address coal research in one of seven technical topics: (1) Coal Science; (2) Coal Surface Science; (3) Reaction Chemistry; (4) Advanced Process Concepts; (5) Engineering Fundamentals and Thermodynamics; (6) Environmental Science; or (7) Minimization of Environmental Impact. For Technical Topic 8, CO 2 Ocean Disposal Experimentation, the DOE is seeking applications for experimental research to ascertain the scientific and technical feasibility of promising methods of ocean disposal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Carbon dioxide can be disposed in the ocean as a gas, solid or liquid. The three most economical methods of ocean disposal are thought to be hydrate formation, dense plume formation and unconfined release, at depths of 200m-1500m (``A Research Needs Assessment for the Capture, Utilization and Disposal of Carbon Dioxide from Fossil-Fuel Powered Plants.'' Volume I, Energy Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; pp. 13&hyph;19 (DE&hyph;FG02&hyph;92ER30194.A000, August 1993)). Other identifiable, more costly methods of disposal include dry ice injection and very deep ocean injection. Details on the UCR Core Program, the Joint University/Industry Coal Research Program and Technical Topic 8, eligibility requirements, budget limitations and technical topic descriptions are contained in the Program Solicitation. Awards DOE anticipates awarding financial assistance (grants) for each project selected. Approximately $5.1 million is available for the Program Solicitation: $4 million is for the UCR Core Program and should provide funding for about 21 financial assistance grants (max. DOE funding of $200,000 per award); $0.8 million in set-aside for the Joint University/Industry Coal Research Program, which should support 2 grants (max. DOE funding of $400,000 per award); and $0.3 million is set-aside for Technical Topic 8, which should support one grant. Solicitation Release Date The Program Solicitation is expected to be ready for mailing by October 7, 1994. Applications must be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions and forms in the Program Solicitation and must be received by the Department of Energy by December 2, 1994. Richard D. Rogus, Contracting Officer, Acquisition and Assistance Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25208 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
