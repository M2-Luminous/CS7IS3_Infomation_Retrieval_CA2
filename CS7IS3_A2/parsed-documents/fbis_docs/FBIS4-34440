Some said the country's future looks uncertain, adding that this situation could make the government toughen its position toward the armed group. Last night, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe refused to make any comments on the effects that the resignation of the former foreign relations secretary of state may have on the nation's financial markets. Meanwhile, Capital Bank President Jaime Weiss pointed out the former commissioner's resignation will not affect the nation's financial markets; however, he recognized there could be some adjustments, but these are regular adjustments already foreseen. He added Mexican society is strong and mature and will react cautiously to this incident. Weiss also added Mexican investors still trust the nation's economic progress and have the long-term foresight to keep their capital in the country. The National Association of the Processing Industry (Canacintra) believes Camacho's departure took place when the peace process is at a decisive moment. It stated, however, that this departure will have no effect whatsoever on what has been attained so far, nor will it prevent the two parties from sitting down to discuss and reach peace in Chiapas through a consensus and dialogue. "We do not think this resignation will have repercussions in the economic and financial arenas because the country has suitable people to continue the negotiations that are taking place in Chiapas," the president of the National Processing Industrialists Association (ANIT) stressed. He added: "It is a shame he resigned; I believe he did a great job, taking into account the governmental and nongovernmental limitations he had. His resignation gives leeway to repressive behavior because his role of mediator helped nonrepressive forces assume a passive attitude. Questioned about Mexico's political and economic future, the ANIT president said that "in general terms, it does not look bright." This is why a replacement must be appointed soon. As for economic impacts, he said there will be capital flight, a bear market, and interest rate increases because the resignation has exacerbated the atmosphere of uncertainty that reigns in the country. He also said Camacho faced some difficulties as he waded through pressure exerted from inside and outside the system and from the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He stressed: "Ernesto Zedillo's hard-heartedness contributed to this situation." Aurelio Tamez, president of the Sales and Marketing Executives Confederation, said Camacho's negotiations were difficult despite the efforts he made; his retirement is regrettable.
