He is laughing over [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who let himself "be led by the nose." He is laughing at the politicians and commentators who still believe in an alliance between the Northern League and Forza Italia and consider his intemperances as being the internal squabbles of the phantasmal "pole of freedoms." Nothing could be further from the truth. For the Senator [Bossi nickname], the alliance with His Broadcastness [Berlusconi nickname] is already over. It lasted only one day. On 12 February when he officially shook hands with Berlusconi in Milan. The Northern League secretary wanted to keep the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] candidates from entering the field in opposition to the Northern Leaguers in the uninominal constituencies. And this is what he got. He wanted to present "at least 280 Lombard people with excellent possibilities for success in the lower house and the Senate." And he succeeded. Since then he has one principal enemy: Berlusconi. And he demonstrates this in every way. He calls him a "Craxiano" and an "heir of the five-party coalition." He threatens that which is dearest to him: "his TV stations." He even denies him votes and orders the League members "not to support or present Forza Italia candidates." An unscrupulous game that has been revealed by Roberto Maroni, the Richelieu of the Bandwagon [League nickname], the man that concretely put down the electoral accord between Bossi and His Broadcastness in black and white. Let us listen to what he says. [Gentili] Honorable Maroni, the pact with Berlusconi is over then? [Maroni] It depends. Some are still thinking in terms of proportional representation. They think that everything works like it used to before, when electing candidates depended on the party organs. Now instead, with the majority system, any aspiring senator or representative must personally have the strength and credibility to get himself elected. [Gentili] What does this mean? [Maroni] That we will now see if our militants are right when they say: "The Christian Democrats put forward by Berlusconi will not be elected." Or if Forza Italia and the Christian Democrats of Mastella and Casini are right when they reply: "Do not run under the flags of the League and Forza Italia to be elected." [Gentili] Who do you think is right? [Maroni] Our militants. Moreover, we cannot force the League members to carry out an election campaign for a former Christian Democrat. [Gentili] You are not even trying to. [Maroni] You cannot ask for miracles. [Gentili] Is it not instead because Bossi already considers the alliance with Forza Italia as finished? He has succeeded in keeping Berlusconi, his most dangerous rival, out of the North. And now he is saying: "Enemies like before." [Maroni] I agree. It is more or less like this. [Gentili] Bossi's was a masterly stroke. [Maroni] Are you sure that such an astute maneuver was made by Bossi? [Gentili] By whom then? [Maroni] Think well. Somebody else who works with Bossi did this. [Gentili] You? [Maroni] Good. Do not make me say it. [Gentili] Try to draw up a balance sheet. [Maroni] We have reached our objective. We have succeeded in guaranteeing the League a very strong parliamentary representation which would not have been possible if we had set ourselves against Forza Italia. If everything goes as planned we should bring no less than 200 representatives to parliament. And this is a lot: triple the number we currently have. [Gentili] And what is more, you have your hands free. [Maroni] Right. And I will give you an example: How many chances does Berlusconi have of governing with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]? [Gentili] You tell me. [Maroni] Zero point something. While it is much more likely that the League will enter into an accord with an Occhetto government. We are a political animal whose objective is the realization of federalism. With anyone. [Gentili] And, as you will maintain, you are no doubt closer to the federalism of the PDS than that of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Is this not so? [Maroni] This is so. [Gentili] So, do you confirm that the accord with Berlusconi is definitively over? [Maroni] I would say that the only thing that remains standing is an electoral accord. [Gentili] You forget that Bossi's election campaign is a revolt against Berlusconi rather than against Occhetto... [Maroni] Berlusconi is taking care of the PDS. [Gentili] For Bossi, who is a potential ally in government, [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli or Occhetto? [Maroni] Let us not exaggerate. The Knight for us is something more. We will first try to attain federalism with him. But if he says "no," or if he forges an alliance with the fascists [MSI], well then, we will consider ourselves free to look for other partners.
