The Pullach office has been investigating links between the Russian nationalist leader and German companies since the end of December. One of the bases are photographs the Austrian State Police has made available to the BND. On 22 December an official of the Vienna Interior Ministry, camouflaged as a skier by wearing a ski cap, took photos of the group of entrepreneurs who visited Zhirinovskiy in the Carinthian hotel "Rainsberg" in Reichenfels. "We had businessmen from Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia here," Edwin Neuwirth, owner of the "Rainsberg" hotel and Zhirinovskiy's host said. German Businessmen Visited Limousines with German license plates also arrived in Reichenfels. One of them let out Berlin businessmen Werner Girke and Werner Neumann. According to the trade registry, their company, the Trustee, Administration, and Organization Company (T.V.O.) in Kaiserin-Augusta Allee in Tiergarten, is dealing with trusteeship deals of all kinds as well as the acquisition of companies. In fact, however, until May 1990 T.V.O. belonged to the Swiss holding ORVAG AG, which has multiplied and administered the foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] in Switzerland and Liechtenstein since 1970. Together with the Liechtenstein Corefina company in Balzers, ORVAG established a complicated empire of companies comprised of at least nine financial and real estate companies. As trustee of the "Swissified" SED assets, strings were pulled by the same Werner Girke who has visited Zhirinovskiy. As early as 1990, Girke may have made sure that he need not face his new friend Zhirinovskiy with empty hands. Million-Mark Loans to Unknown Persons BERLINER ZEITUNG has obtained evidence of a transfer of 1 million German marks [DM] to a Swiss numbered account that was carried out by Girke. On 22 March 1990 this sum was transferred from the Corefina account at the Zurich Leu Bank to the Leumi le Israel Bank in Zurich. Some days later Girke sent another DM1.7753 million to three Luxembourg banks. As a reason for payment Girke always cited loans, the recipients of which remained unknown, however. Still, this was not the only smuggling of money that the former SED trustee initiated. At the end of 1993, DM14.2 million were seized from cover accounts in Luxembourg. Girke had received the money in cash at the beginning of 1990 from Mr. Langnitschke, the former financial administrator of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. PDS Treasurer Dietmar Bartsch has denied any ties between his party and Girke and his companies. There are no financial and ideological interlacements, he says. An investigator of the Austrian State Police told WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE published in Vienna today, that Zhirinovskiy's financial adviser Aleksey Vedenkin "is establishing cover firms in West Europe and looking for partners so that he can fully participate in the oil trade." Zhirinovskiy's confidante Neuwirth even says that "Vedenkin has already established 10 companies in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and in Switzerland." Yesterday no one at T.V.O. -- which, by the way, had invited Zhirinovskiy for his failed visit to Berlin in December -- was willing to tell us anything. In the Federal Interior Ministry, too, everything was quiet. The question about Zhirinovskiy's contacts with German companies touches on "an intelligence service background; therefore, the Federal Government will not give any information," the Ministry's press office stated.
