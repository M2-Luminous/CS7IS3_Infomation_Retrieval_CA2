On January 4-5 he had talks there with Serbia's Minister of Transport Zarko Katic, Yugoslavia's Minister of Transport Blagoje Lucic and Serbia's Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic. They agreed on the technicalities concerning the transit carriage by road of Bulgarian goods across Serbia which was allowed by the UN Sanctions Committee in late November 1993. "We discussed the details of organization and the conditions for transit transportation and the necessity of monitors and people escorting the trucks," Mr. Ermenkov said. Bulgarian goods will be carried only in convoys of ten to fifteen sealed trucks, and up to two convoys a day will be allowed to transit Serbia. There will be an escort in each trucks, and trucks will be weighed on crossing into Serbia and on arrival in Hungary. The border check points of entry and exit will be notified electronically. Only goods allowed by the UN Sanctions Committee will be carried: Meat and meat preparations, agricultural produce and medicines. Serbia will charge 50 percent of the road and highway tolls specified in the bilateral agreement for the transit traffic. This percentage may be reduced further, as both countries wish to increase the traffic across Serbia, the minister of transport said. Serbia was given a list of the monitors, employed by the state-owned road hauler So Mat. Representatives of the Union of Private Carriers and the State Automobile Inspectorate will be added to the list in the coming days. A resumption of rail transportation through Yugoslavia was also on the agenda, Mr. Ermenkov said. Mr. Ermenkov would not commit himself to predictions about the effect of the special corridor on the Bulgarian economy. He does not doubt, however, that the losses caused by the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro will be decreased.
