FBIS3-11375 "drlat054__a94004" FBIS-LAT-94-054-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 March 1994 ANNEX Argentina PJ `Comfortably' Ahead of UCR in Election Run Up PY1803011094 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1803011094 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish, in its 13 March issue, carries five copyrighted articles with charts totalling 2,500 words on pages 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving details of an exclusive poll carried out by the Center for Public Opinion Studies, CEOP. The results show that the Justicialist Party, PJ, is "comfortably" ahead of the Radical Civic Union, UCR, in the nationwide voters' preference for the national elections for Constituent Assembly members that will be held on 10 April. The poll was carried out between 16 February and 8 March among 2,450 people in the largest voting districts of the Republic: the Federal Capital, Greater Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Province, and in the cities of Cordoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Tucuman, Santiago del Estero, and La Banda in Santiago del Estero Province. A 700-word article by Maria Seoane published on page 2 states that, less than a month before the elections, 30.8 percent of the voters favor the PJ, and 16.8 favor the UCR. This difference is "overwhelming" in Buenos Aires Province where the list headed by Governor Eduardo Duhalde has 33.5 percent while that headed by Raul Alfonsin has 15 percent. In the Federal Capital the PJ list headed by Carlos Corach, the legal and technical secretary of the presidency, has 26.3 percent while the UCR list headed by Jesus Rodriguez has 16 percent. The results show that five out of 10 voters approve the PJ-UCR pact, while two out of 10 disapprove. The article points out the importance of a "landslide victory" by the PJ in Buenos Aires Province given that it is the district that will elect the most delegates which will give the PJ an absolute majority in the national Constituent Assembly. In third place in Buenos Aires Province comes Aldo Rico's Movement for Independence and Dignity, Modin, with 7.2 percent, followed by the Grand Front headed by Pino Solanas with 4.8 percent. A 330-word unattributed article on page 3 comments on how the UCR has lost voters. It states that the UCR has lost half of those who voted for it in the last October elections. The same page carries another 300-word unattributed article that states that the PJ in Buenos Aires Province is not the same as that of the times of Peron because now it is equally supported by the rich and poor. The middle class, the article states, continues to favor the UCR. In the same district, Modin mainly attracts former Peronists who are disenchanted with the current PJ. A 400-word article by Mariana Garcia published on page 4 describes the voters' preferences in the main polled cities. In Cordoba city the UCR runs slightly ahead of the PJ by 24.6 percent to 24.5 percent, with the Democratic Centrist Union, Ucede, coming third with 5.5 percent. In Mendoza City the PJ leads with 37.9 percent, the UCR comes second with 16.6 percent, and third comes the Democratic Party with 3.4 percent. In Tucuman City, the PJ alliance has 34.3 percent, the Republican Force has 25.6 percent, and the UCR has 12.9 percent. In Santa Fe City and Rosario, the PJ has 28.3 percent, the UCR has 18.7 percent, while the Socialist Union has 6.1 percent. In the cities of Santiago del Estero and La Banda, the UCR runs comfortably ahead of the PJ with 29.1 to 15.1 percent, with Modin in third place with 5.5 percent. Finally, a 500-word unattributed article on pages 4 and 5 states that five out of 10 Argentines -- some 11 million voters -- do not know what they are voting for in the upcoming 10 April elections. A breakdown of this figure shows that 30.4 percent have no idea what they are voting for; 13.9 percent think the elections are to reelect President Menem; 2.1 percent think the elections are to elect national deputies; 1.0 percent think they are to national senators; 1.1 percent gave other answers; and 1.4 percent did not answer.
