The PvdA [Labor Party] spokesman also emerged as an advocate of the extension of military cooperation with Germany to all three armed forces. Closer cooperation with other European armed forces is also called before, because the Netherlands must become more "continental" on the long road to some form of European defense. Ter Beek emphasized all this on Monday evening [21 March] in a speech given to the Atlantic Council in The Hague. Entitled "Past Analysis and Future Outlook," his speech provided a rough outline of defense policy in the near future. According to Ter Beek, closer operational and logistic ties between the three armed forces are in the interests not merely of efficiency, but also of peace operations, which are demanding an increasing amount of cooperation. These advantages are more important than "the maintenance of independence and the specific culture of each of the armed forces." Minister Ter Beek is of the opinion that the latest report by the Advisory Council on Peace and Security (AVV), entitled "Germany as a Partner," contains "valuable suggestions" with a view to extending Netherlands-German cooperation. The First Army Corps is already merging into a German-Netherlands Army Corps, confirmed the minister. The AVV believes that the military links with neighbors in the East must be extended to the air force and navy. In the first instance this must involve far-reaching integration of both countries' naval and air forces and submarine services. Foreign Minister Kooijmans recently said he was less enthusiastic about selective links with the Germans in the area of the common foreign and security policy. Ter Beek's speech before the Atlantic Council was, above all, a call for the continuation of the security policy he launched back in 1990, a policy of internationalization and Europeanization. "The choices we made were the right ones," he said. Completion of the restructuring and rationalization program for the Armed Forces, from 130,000 to 70,000 men, is the central objective. "This requires that it is all quiet on the financial front," said the minister. He reiterated that with a 20-percent reduction in the defense budget since 1989, "the peace dividend has been paid out." In this, Ter Beek has the support of a majority in the Chamber, but his own party, the PvdA, wants to see a further 800 million guilders saved on defense during the following cabinet period. The Netherlands will continue to participate in international peace operations, although there can be no question of it doing so automatically. Like Kooijmans, Ter Beek is not at all in favor of establishing criteria for deciding whether the Netherlands will or will not take part in peace operations. "There is no yardstick for doing so," claims the defense minister. "Strict criteria all too quickly turn into a straitjacket. Whether the Netherlands can and wants to participate will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The fear of some kind of `limitless interventionism' is unfounded," he continued. Yesterday evening it was conspicuous that Ter Beek, contrary to current pessimism, appeared optimistic about international strategic developments. Although the situation in Europe is unstable, there are opportunities and bright spots: With the exception of Yugoslavia, the transformation process in Central and East Europe is running without too much violence; the shadow of a major military threat hanging over West Europe is a thing of the past; and reports on a swift death for NATO have proven to be premature. According to Ter Beek, the Cold War now belongs "definitively to the past," even if the reformers lose out to the nationalists in the long run. If Russia becomes a military threat to its neighbors, "then the countries of Central Europe can be admitted to NATO in the short term."
