FR940419-1-00021 FR940419-1-00006 9. Should OSHA develop an abatement certification form? If so, what information should the form contain? 10. OSHA is proposing in paragraph (f) the use of a tag to be placed on cited equipment to alert affected employees that a hazardous condition exists with the equipment. Specific comment is requested on this particular issue. What information should the tag contain? V.

OSHA Instruction CPL 2.45B_Field Operations Manual (FOM). VI. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis for Abatement Verification A. Introductory Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires regulatory agencies to assess the costs and benefits of intended regulations, to consider the possible alternatives, and to select the most cost-effective form of regulation. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to consider the impact of the regulation on small entities. This regulatory impact analysis presents the costs, benefits (cost savings), and economic impact of the proposed regulation requiring certification of abatement. The impact on small businesses is also presented. The Agency has preliminarily concluded that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866, Section 3, Paragraph (f). The proposed regulation for abatement verification would require employers to notify OSHA Area Directors whether or not cited violations have been abated. It would require employer to notify OSHA Area Directors whether or not cited violations have been abated. It would also require employers to offer documentation of abatement plans and progress reports for multi-step abatement efforts. Based on a survey of OSHA regional offices, OSHA estimates that as many as 70 percent of cited employers eventually certify and document their abatement actions to some degree at the present time. This regulatory action will potentially affect all employers covered by the OSH Act. This regulatory action can impose penalties for non-reporting of conditions even if they have been abated and can also lead to an increase in the penalties that employers face from unabated, violative conditions. Failure to verify abatement on a timely basis is an additional violation. When abatement is verified by the employer but not actually performed, criminal penalties for false statement may apply. Increased penalties give employers an incentive both to abate and to verify abatement, and to do so in a timely manner. Abatement reduces the risk of injury, illness, and death for employees. The Agency has not estimated the extent of injuries, illnesses, and deaths averted by this regulatory action, because abatement itself is already required by the OSH Act. B. Costs of Compliances Certifying Abatement Federal OSHA and State-plan agencies performed about 127,000 workplace inspections in 1991, issuing about 413,000 separate (upgrouped) violations (Table 1). Less than 1 percent of the violations were for failure to abate. About 10 percent of all citations were contested. There were about 9,000 follow-up inspections by OSHA and State-plan agencies in 1991 that resulted in about 4,300 violations, of which 71 were for failure to abate (Table 2). About 18 percent of all follow-up violations were contested. The Agency estimates that it will take firms, on average, 15 minutes to prepare and mail documentation to certify abatement, independent of firm size. The Agency estimates that the managers or proprietors who prepare the certification of abatement earn a total wage of $25 per hour, based on data in the Bureau of Labor Statistics news, June 18, 1993. A ceiling, or maximum estimate, of the cost to employers for verifying abatement, including preparation of abatement certificates and submission of documentation, can be calculated by multiplying the number of violations with the estimated average time to verify abatement (not the time and cost to comply with the OSHA standard cited) and with the supervisory wage rate (annual, including benefits), or 412,707 violations × .25 hours per citation × $25/hour= =$2.6 million annually. Since a large fraction of employers cited for violations now inform OSHA that abatement was performed and sometimes offer documentation, the new additional cost to employers from this regulation is probably much less than the ceiling estimate of $2.6 million annually. Other costs, such as for photocopying, photography, or other documenting activity, are believed to be minimal. The cost of tags for cited equipment is also minor as both the general industry and construction standards already contain accident prevention tagging requirements (See 1910.145 and 1926.200).
