The reason: The need to let the emotions cool, calm down, and think about many things. I found Stanislav Shushkevich at his dacha, 45 kilometers from Minsk. Here he has 450 square meters of land in a university allotment society. Compared to the other buildings here, his looks like a toadstool among chanterelles. "I do not have any other dachas," the ex-speaker explained. "Neither I, nor my family, ever lived in the one issued to me by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. It was only used as a residence for official receptions." Almost everything at the dacha is Shushkevich's own work. He did use the services of the Maintenance and Construction Department attached to the Council of Ministers when he needed welding and plastering work done, and paid for it in full. "If anyone thinks that this department works for cheap, then they are completely wrong. Over the past two years all my wages have been ploughed into this dacha. We are living on my wife's money." When Vice Rector Shushkevich moved out of his two-room apartment in a university block for a new home he did not leave it to his mother-in-law, as was alleged in parliament by Aleksandr Lukashenko, the chairman of the Commission on Organized Crime, but handed it back to the university. It is now occupied by a Mr. Klevchen, a lecturer at that establishment. I deliberately mention this in detail, because one of the allegations made against Shushkevich when he lost his post was of personal immodesty. To my puzzled question of why he is telling me this instead of the Supreme Soviet, the former speaker answered: "That is the way I was brought up. I was taught that there is a presumption of innocence. So I think it below my dignity to get involved in a debate on this dirt. But I also cannot prove that I am not a camel." Stanislav Shushkevich said that if time were to transport him back to his university lecture theater, he would still have taken the same path. "There was a lot I wanted to do, but it was impossible to escape the realities when my options were restricted. My main goal was to create Belarusian statehood, so that a sovereign, democratic, and civilized state appeared in Europe. I really wanted our Supreme Soviet to be democratic, and less polarized, unruly and confrontation-minded, I wanted it to be centrist. But unfortunately, in this I failed." Asked about the true reasons for his departure, the former Supreme Soviet chairman replied: "I do not suit the majority in this Supreme Soviet. It does not want to build a new society, and most of the deputies we have now want to return to the old order. To this day I cannot understand how I managed to get to lead the Supreme Soviet. The Communist majority in Autumn 1991 was fantastically frightened, and my election was a chance occurrence, not an inevitability." Shushkevich acknowledged that he now realizes that he underestimated the bureaucratic games. "It was hugely difficult for me. My first deputy was often ill. On at least 10 occasions I proposed candidates for the vacant post of deputy to the head of the Supreme Soviet, and every time these people, including the current chairman, Myechyslaw Hryb, blocked me. Now I realize that most of them were doing this deliberately, so that I could not rely on an assistant to handle the economic or organizational issues." Two other circumstances were a strong hindrance to the ex-speaker. First, there was no centrist bloc in the Belarus Supreme Soviet, which instead was split into a huge majority and small opposition. Secondly, the Supreme Soviet, which was not made up of professional MPs, became an offshoot of the executive. I asked Shushkevich whether, realizing his powerlessness, he had ever wanted to just quit and slam the door behind him. He answered: "No, I did not, and for one reason alone. I felt that as the Supreme Soviet head there was, nonetheless, a time when I would be able to counter the anti-reformists." Stanislav Shushkevich thinks that the ideal system for Belarus is a parliamentary republic. But mindful of the overall instability and fractiousness, it is essential to temporarily elect a president. Will he run for election? "I have not yet made up my mind," he replied. Asked whether his departure is a precedent for Boris Yeltsin or Leonid Kravchuk, Stanislav Shushkevich said that the events in Belarus should not be compared to those in Russia or the Ukraine. The ex-speaker confessed that he expected to have to go at least a month earlier. The parliamentary majority was strongly against U.S. President Clinton coming to Minsk and recognizing Belarus as an independent European state. "I am delighted that Clinton's visit and the talks between our countries went ahead and that he was able to form an opinion about Belarus," Stanislav Shushkevich said. Comparing the pace of economic reform in Belarus and Russia, the former speaker said that Russia, under the guidance of Yegor Gaydar, for whom he has enormous respect, has moved on ahead. Belarus has noticeably lagged behind its partner to the East. Over 70 years of Communist influence have shown itself to have had a far from good impact on the psychology of the Belarusian people. "If the market reforms are scrapped, then I would have the gloomiest of forecasts for the future," Stanislav Shushkevich said. "The market reforms in Belarus were never properly formulated," Shushkevich commented, which is why he fears that Belarus could fall behind in this process. Stanislav Shushkevich said this of his successor, Myechyslaw Hryb: "We get on normally, although we differed on the Collective Security Treaty. Myechyslaw Ivanovich can adapt to any situation and, I have to think, his candidature is fully to the liking of the present Supreme Soviet." On his plans for the near future, he said, "I have only had 10 days vacation during the past year, and now I want to take a break for a while. I will probably go to Bonn for a week, because I have a long-standing invitation to read some lectures. After that, we will see."
