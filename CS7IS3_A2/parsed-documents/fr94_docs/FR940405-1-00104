FR940405-1-00104 FR940405-1-00013 Microbial contamination can cause significant damage to buildings and equipment and there is anecdotal evidence that damage can be so severe as to make a building unfit for human occupation. OSHA requests comment on the explicit or implicit rental value affected in buildings with such problems. No quantitative estimates are available on the effects of indoor air on equipment. OSHA requests more information on the effects of indoor air on materials and equipment. Indoor air pollutants and in particular ETS contribute to increased maintenance and cleaning expenses. Increased maintenance and cleaning costs include: the need to paint walls more frequently, need to clean, repair and replace furniture, upholstery, carpeting and curtains or drapes that have cigarette burns and or odors; the need to wash windows, showcases, and other surfaces that attract ash and dust; and the need to clean ashtrays. A survey of 2,000 companies that had adopted no-smoking policies found that 60 percent of these companies were able to reduce their cleaning and maintenance costs. The savings have been estimated at about $500 per smoker per year (3). If establishments decide to ban smoking in the workplace, the proposed standard would result in virtually eliminating all smoking related fires, fire fatalities and injuries and direct property damage. Smoking is a leading cause of fire related fatalities. During the 1980's, the National Fire Protection Association reports that smoking materials were the cause of over 200,000 fires per year. This resulted in more than 1,000 civilian fatalities and 3,000 civilian injuries and approximately $300 million in direct property damage. During the period of 1989 to 1990, there was an average of $115 million in direct property damage due to non-residential smoking related fires which resulted in 36 fatalities and 3,212 injuries. OSHA will further investigate this issue and requests available data from the public. E. Technological Feasibility and Compliance Costs This section presents OSHA's preliminary compliance cost estimates for the proposed standard on indoor air quality. The cost analysis covers the major proposed provisions for which data are available. OSHA requests more information on the consideration for the relationship of employers and facility owners. The decision to implement any IAQ improvements will be greatly influenced by the relationship between employers and landlords. Since changes in building ventilation systems will be made by landlords, employers may have to negotiate agreements to ensure that they can meet the OSHA standard. On the requirement for ETS, landlords in turn are likely to pressure employers to ban smoking; thereby, forestalling any need for construction of designated smoking rooms. This section also examines the technological feasibility of complying with proposed regulation. 1. Technological Feasibility As interpreted in the Benzene and Cotton Dust cases, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires that the Agency, with regard to exposure to toxic substances, is to reduce significant risk of material health impairment to the extent feasible. Accordingly, as part of the investigation of the potential effects of the OSHA proposal, OSHA has examined both the technological and economic feasibility of the proposal. The economic feasibility assessment appears later. OSHA's assessment of the technological feasibility is based on an examination of what would be required to comply with the proposal, along with a review of existing practices among affected establishments. With regard to this proposal, problems with technological feasibility, by and large, are not evident. Employers are required to operate their HVAC systems within those parameters originally designated for the equipment. While many employers may choose to provide separately ventilated smoking areas, this is an option, not a requirement, under the proposed regulation. This technology is widespread currently and can be used to achieve compliance with the proposed standard. For example, in some situations, such as hotels and prisons, employees have as their workplace the residence of others who live in that building. Restaurants, bars and other ``public'' places expose employees to customer's tobacco smoke. While it is technologically feasible to ban smoking in those establishments, there may be other problems, legal and economic. While it is theoretically possible to minimize employee exposure to ETS in such a work environment through special ventilation, in the absence of modified customer service arrangements, actually eliminating worker exposure to ETS would likely prove difficult. Consequently, the selection process for one of the smoking policy alternatives for a particular workplace must consider both the physical limitations of the building or firm and the building's use. In addition, some employers may be using their building facilities for purposes for which the original design did not intend, and for which retrofitting might prove difficult. OSHA requests comment on those workplaces for which compliance with the proposed standard would prove technologically challenging. OSHA will consider additional information on the ability of firms to implement IAQ programs. 2. Compliance Costs OSHA estimated preliminary costs of complying with the proposed standard. OSHA's cost assumptions and methodologies are based on information available from the rulemaking record. Further detailed industry analysis will be developed by the Agency. Table VI&hyph;8 contains OSHA's estimates of the annualized first-year and the annual recurring costs of full compliance with the proposed rule. The annualized first-year cost of compliance is $1.4 billion. The cost for eliminating exposure to ETS may range from $0 to $68 million depending on whether establishments shall ban smoking or allow smoking in designated areas. OSHA estimated that the annual cost of compliance with the IAQ standard will be $8.1 billion, of which the most costly provision will be for the building systems operation and maintenance, $8.0 billion. OSHA developed cost estimates for the affected industries using the following categories of information: (1) Provisions of the proposed standard requiring activities; (2) the number of potentially affected buildings, establishments and employees; (3) the percentage of establishments or buildings in each industry currently in compliance with each proposed requirement; and (4) the unit costs for bringing establishments into compliance with the various provisions of the proposed standard. These four items were combined to produce OSHA's estimated costs of compliance. Costs were estimated on an annual basis, with total annual costs calculated as the sum of annualized initial costs and annual recurring costs. All capital costs and non-recurring first year costs were annualized over the service life of the equipment or administrative activity, at a discount rate of 10 percent. (a) Developing Indoor Air Quality Compliance Programs. The proposed standard requires establishments to prepare written operations plans which would describe information required for the daily operation and management of the building systems 9 and maintenance. The plan should provide an overview of the building and system, using a short text description and single-line schematics or as-built construction documents. The operations information would also describe how to operate the HVAC systems so that it performs with the reported design criteria. In addition, the operations information should include: (1) Special procedures like seasonal start-ups and shutdowns, and (2) a list of operating performance criteria such as minimum outside air ventilation rates, potable hot water storage and delivery temperatures, range of space relative humidities and any space pressurization requirements, (3) an evaluation of the need to retrofit the HVAC system when the design occupancy levels are exceeded, and (4) a checklist for visual inspection of building systems. 9 Building systems include but are not limited to the heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the potable water systems, the energy management system and all other systems in a facility which may impact IAQ.
