FBIS4-37934 "drnes123_l_94008" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Ministers, Arab Leaders React Ministers, Arab Leaders React TA2606145794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1400 GMT 26 Jun 94 TA2606145794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Justice Minister David Liba'i says he is at peace with his proposal to appoint a national commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. He says the commission has done a thorough job and submitted a balanced report including wise and practical recommendations. Minister Liba'i added that to the best of his knowledge as a cabinet member, there was no forewarning regarding the possibility of a massacre and it was impossible to predict. He said the commission's findings regarding this issue are of historic significance and he, for one, supported the establishment of the commission. Mr. Liba'i expects the government to fulfill all the recommendations of the commission, which it itself appointed. He further recommends that the police, the attorney general, and he himself increase their involvement in law enforcement in the territories not only when a disaster occurs but also on a routine basis. Minister Liba'i was interviewed by our correspondent Mira Amsalem. Ministers Sarid and Shahal say the government must embrace the Shamgar Commission recommendations. Yosi Sarid says that since it was determined that Goldstein acted alone, there was no need for heads to roll. Minister Shahal said more funds must be allocated to the police's newly established Judaea and Samaria District. The right wing of the political arena welcomes the Shamgar recommendations and considers them a boost to the settlers' status in the territories, whereas the left wing is disappointed by the fact that the commission preferred to deal merely with the massacre while ignoring the political, legal, and security circumstances in the territories that made the massacre possible. The leaders of the Israeli Arab sector expressed disappointment with the Shamgar Commission conclusions. Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that statements issued by Arab Knesset members and mayors say that the recommendations do not resolve the complicated situation in Hebron and that the settlers must be removed from the city. After the report's publication, HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] leaders convened in Haifa and stated that the only conclusion to be drawn from the report is that all the settlers must be evacuated first from Hebron and later from the rest of the territories. The HADASH statement says that the settlers are a time bomb threatening peace. HADASH believes the main cause of the massacre -- namely, the causal connection between the prolonged occupation and the massacre -- does not appear in the report.
