This is stated in a statement published here today by the Armenian Foreign Ministry's press and public relations service. The Armenian side, the statement says, considers that any mediation mission seeking a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh will only bear fruit if it involves plenipotentiary representatives of the lawfully elected authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service issued the statement in connection with pronouncements by Azerbaijan's foreign policy department accusing the Armenian leadership of pursuing a policy of acting from a position of force and of continuing the occupation of Azerbaijan lands. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service statement emphasizes that the republic's authorities support all peacemaking efforts to establish peace in the region, including the CSCE and the Russian Federation initiatives.
