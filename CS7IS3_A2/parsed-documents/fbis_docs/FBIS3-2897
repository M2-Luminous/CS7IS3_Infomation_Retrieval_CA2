However, people must ask how long can Patten "hold out"? In fact, it is not difficult at all to answer this question. As long as we look at how many cards he has, the answer is all too obvious. Let us look at his "homeland card." When Patten came to Hong Kong, the first thing he did was to show this "trump card." At that time, with almost "unanimous" support in domestic political circles and the British press, Patten was in high spirits and vigorous and made a showy display of his abilities. However, he never thought of the "fire in the back yard" which is now occurring, and he has even stopped boasting about "full support in London." On 8 December 1993, Percy Cradock, a former foreign affairs adviser to the British prime minister and a former ambassador to Beijing, and two other former ambassadors to Beijing--Alan Donald and Richard Evans--were present at a public hearing on Sino-British relations held by the British Foreign Affairs Committee. They criticized Patten's political reform package as a policy of "self-destruction" and called on the British Government to immediately stop the "rash and risky policy of unilaterally implementing political reform in Hong Kong." At a Conservative Party meeting held in the middle of January, former Prime Minister Heath blamed Patten for causing unnecessary damage to Sino-British relations." Early this year, former Labor prime minister James Callaghan and former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe also objected on many occasions to Britain's threatening and antagonistic attitude in handling the Hong Kong issue. On the other hand, Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST reported that when the House of Lords debated the Hong Kong issue not long ago, "only one person said he supported Patten," while in the House of Commons, "many people voiced their disapproval of the consequences brought about by Patten's policy." Meanwhile, there are divergent views within the British Government. The FINANCIAL TIMES published an article last December on the failed Sino-British talks. The article quoted high-ranking officials, who said that to everyone's surprise, Patten did not take heed of the fact that in 1990 the Chinese foreign minister and his British counterpart had discussed and reached agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections when he drafted his political reform package. The article also revealed that following the 15th round of talks, the British side had drafted a memorandum of understanding in accordance with the Chinese side's suggestions, but Patten had insisted on adding a clause that a single-seat, single-vote system would also be applied to the Legislative Council [Legco] elections, thus sabotaging the Sino-British talks. The British press criticized Patten in a more candid way. On 20 December 1993, THE SUN published an editorial entitled "Patten--the Most Cynical and Impudent Swindler." The editorial blamed Patten for wrecking Anglo-Chinese relations due to his hypocritical preaching of democracy in Hong Kong, which consequently made it difficult for large firms such as British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce to win contracts in China. The editorial held that what Patten had done was for his own personal honor. Before taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, Patten lost an election in his Bath constituency, and this result even cheered his Conservative Party colleagues. Hence, after taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, he has to try every possible means to rehabilitate himself and his political career. The editorial pointed out incisively that it was "really stupid" for Britain, which had never held any democratic elections in Hong Kong during its 150-years rule, and to antagonize China with less than four years to go before turning over ruling authority was "really stupid." "The price is too heavy if Hong Kong is sacrificed for Patten's personal ambitions." THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH also published a commentary which pointed out: "For those British businessmen who want to get into the China market, they do not understand why the Westminster model of democracy has to be introduced at a time when Hong Kong will revert to China three and a half years later. Hong Kong Governor Patten is engaging in a political gamble, but Britain has to pay a price in employment opportunities and investment prospects." It is even more obvious that British business circles, which always set great store by business interests, are dissatisfied with Patten. Early this year, several British newspapers successively reported that since the British Government had implemented its antagonistic policies toward China, a considerable number of British-invested financial groups had found that their London background had become a "burden" in China trade. Some British firms which are eager to get into the China market would rather do business with Beijing through their overseas subsidiaries for fear that their London background will spoil everything. Hong Kong's MING PAO reported on 29 January that Carter, president of Britain's Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, had told British Foreign Secretary Hurd at a dinner: "British moves in Hong Kong will damage Anglo-Chinese trade." To put it in a nutshell, the very foundation from which Patten received "unanimous" support in Britain has been shaken. Let us look at his "international card." Patten once traveled far and wide to make Hong Kong an international issue so that he could bully people on the strength of his connections. However, he has been disappointed with the response of the international community so far. Former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has publicly exposed, on many occasions, the British Government's and Patten's political aims and has criticized Britain's antagonistic policy towards China. After that, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser wrote an article in THE AUSTRALIAN for the third time not long ago to attack Patten. Fraser said that the fact that Patten was trying so resolutely to build up "democracy" in Hong Kong at a time when British colonial rule was about to end could only be interpreted as "mischief and stirring up chaos," which is "a kind of wanton behavior." He urged the Australian Government to advise "Britain to suspend and for Patten to withdraw this rash and misleading policy." On 6 January, (Chan Chek-yu), head of the Bureau of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Canadian Foreign Ministry and who was visiting Hong Kong and China, publicly denied that Canada had expressed support for Patten's political reform package. He reaffirmed that the Canadian Government supported the Sino-British Joint Declaration. As reported by the HONGKONG STANDARD on 4 February, even the United States, which has a special relationship with Britain, "is not willing to reaffirm its support for the Hong Kong governor." Playing the "public opinion card" is Patten's specialty, but how is Hong Kong public opinion now? Allan Rogers, foreign affairs spokesman of the British Labor Party, said that after listening to views expressed by various circles in Hong Kong, among those whom he came into contact with, most were primarily, and to a far greater extent, concerned about their own lives and the question of whether or not the transition of Hong Kong would be smooth than about reform of the political system. (Adeley), chairman of the Chinese Affairs Subcommittee of the British Parliament, did not even mince his words. He said that Patten had not consulted Legco and the people of Hong Kong at all before he did anything in Hong Kong, so how could there be "public opinion"? After all, playing the "public opinion card" to portray an image of "keeping in close touch with the people" is the consistent work style of a politician. As indicated by an opinion poll at the end of January conducted by an independent market research company which was entrusted by MING PAO, there is a markedly growing number of citizens who are asking for Patten to be dismissed from his post. Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST even reported on 23 January that Hong Kong's Liberal Party, which is "one of the most influential parties in Hong Kong," announced that they are "withdrawing their support given to Patten's package." Perhaps some people praise Patten for his courage, but more and more people understand that this is a kind of irresponsible courage. Just as Craddock, former foreign affairs adviser to the prime minister of Britain, said: "If it is you who bears the consequences of your own act of heroism, your heroism is above reproach. But if you carry out a heroic act at the expense of others' interests, and particularly the interests of those who trust you--as we are doing in Hong Kong--it is precisely a different story." Patten's willful acts will inevitably endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and stability at present, and after 1997, but he will not be the one who will bear such consequences. He will simply go away after 30 June 1997 and the chaotic situation stirred up by him must be cleared up by the people of Hong Kong. So here is the "last Hong Kong governor" who always claims to think about the interests of Hong Kong people but who is not as good as his word. Now, the British Government has been thrown into confusion. The UK correspondent of Hong Kong's DONGFANG RIBAO [ORIENTAL DAILY NEWS] reports that when Patten and senior British cabinet officials discussed the issue of whether or not he should table the remaining part of his political reform draft to Legco, they held divergent views and differences between them were gradually widening. Senior officials in the Foreign Office, including Foreign Secretary Hurd, have leaned towards supporting a prudent direction, saying that the original package must be greatly amended so that the "Chinese side will feel that the British side still strictly abides by the stipulations of the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration." Why has Patten, who was once smug, fallen into such a predicament? Apart from the fact that his unjustifiable moves are unpopular, another important factor is that mainland China, which is full of vitality, is absolutely able to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997, is marching to the world with great strides, and has become a vital force in the international economy. Recently, such key western countries as the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, and France have conformed to the trend of the times and have successively reviewed their policies towards China to strive for friendly cooperation with China and to get into the China market in order to achieve huge economic gains. However, Britain is going against the tide and is inevitably in an isolated and passive position. Patten still insists on "braving the north wind," but how long can he hold out?
