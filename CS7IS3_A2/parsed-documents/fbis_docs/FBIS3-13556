Ms. Raphel, who has become controversial due to her statements questioning the validity and finality of Kashmir's accession to India, and who insists on visiting India shall be extended due courtesies. She will be able to meet officials as well as political leaders during her five-day stay from March 22. She has even sought a meeting with the Prime Minister, which could not be arranged earlier when she left India to take up her new assignment in the State Department. The U.S. Government is currently engaged in a damage limitation exercise following Ms. Raphel's unwelcome pronouncements and has assured the Indian Government that no anti-lndia bias or pro-Pakistan tilt has overtaken the Clinton Administration and that relations with India remain strong and are bound to grow. Some of President Clinton's remarks regarding Kashmir and human rights must be viewed in the context of U.S. domestic policy compulsions and not in that of Indo-American relations, which continue to expand. As regards Kashmir, the U.S. always believed that the issue should be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan under the Simla Agreement and Washington is not projecting itself as a mediator. It has no strategic interests in the State but desires that the problem be resolved in the interest of peace and stability of the subcontinent. The External Affairs Ministry was initially lukewarm to Ms. Raphel's visit and did not agree to any of the dates suggested by her. President Clinton's as well as Ms. Raphel's remarks were appropriately responded to and their criticism rebutted. However, the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, as well as the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, took the view that points of difference should not spoil the otherwise sound relations between the world's two largest democracies and that there are areas where India and the U.S. should work jointly and effectively. Discussions could be held to find common ground and they could even agree to disagree on some points. A discussion could help articulate each other's concerns and remove misconceptions which were often at the root of mispronouncements. It is thus clear that the Indian officials shall be willing to listen to what Ms. Raphel has to say in the hope that she too will be in a mood to hear patiently what they have to say. The Clinton Administration's South Asia policy has been articulated repeatedly by Ms. Raphel and other officials and hence its reiteration is not necessary. Any impression that the present Administration has a closed mind on subjects such as Kashmir, human rights, and nuclear non-proliferation will not further the Indo-U.S. dialogue. Both sides must be prepared to listen to each other's point of view and appreciate mutual concerns. The Indian Government is appreciative of U.S. support for its economic liberalisation policies and feels that there ought to be no reasons for relations between the two countries to be strained on the economic level as these continue to be strong and friendly. U.S. is India's largest trading partner and overseas investor. Therefore, the relations between the two countries should not be determined only on the political level where differences of opinion exist. For a balanced view these should be judged both on economic and political levels. The economic relations could become more friendly and deep and sincere effort made to remove irritants on the political front. Notice has also been taken of Ms. Raphel's recent observation that it is not correct to say that Indo-U.S. relations have soured because of public disagreement over issues, such as Kashmir. "The reality is much beyond disagreements we may have. It also includes close cooperation in education, culture, science and technology and our rapidly growing commercial relations." At the same time the Indian side makes it clear that any arm twisting on Kashmir shall not be entertained. If the U.S. had any doubts about the unanimity of public opinion on this issue those must have been removed by the Parliamentary resolution asserting that Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and Pakistan must vacate the area under its illegal occupation since 1947. No Government can side-step the resolution and negotiate Kashmir's status and still hope to survive. However, agreements are possible on such issues as demilitarisation of the Siachen area and Sir Creek, Tulbul Barrage, nuclear confidence building measures and the like, on which concrete proposals have been sent by India to Pakistan. As regards nuclear and missile non-proliferation in South Asia, notice has been taken of President Clinton's own observation that the U.S. and others "take into account both Indian and Pakistani domestic political concerns and regional security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond the two countries themselves."
