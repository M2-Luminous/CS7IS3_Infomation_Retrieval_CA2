The ceremony was attended by families of dead Croatian defenders, invalids of the patriotic war, high military and civilian officials, and by Corps General Janko Bobetko, chief of staff of the Croatian Army. Sandra Stanic reports: [Stanic] [passage omitted] Speaking about the beginnings of the brigade, Corps General Janko Bobetko stressed that many pages of Croatian history will be written by soldiers and officers of the 114th Brigade. There are many tasks ahead of us, the corps general added, and one of the fateful ones is to preserve what we have achieved, to return to Croatia every inch of the occupied land and to organize ourselves to be a model democratic and happy country. [Begin Bobetko recording] We must thoroughly prepare our army and the Croatian people for the final task. If it is our fate to do that -- and we will do it with pleasure and conscientiously -- there will be no skirmishes, we will go to the end, to the last inch with all our force and all means available. We have let them know this very clearly. We must say and everyone must know that the Croatian state and the Croatian Army have the potential to do that. When and how they will use that potential, that is a question of decisions and estimates. Our task is to be prepared for it and to be up to the task. [end recording] [passage omitted]
