After spending some time in London, Wang Jiaji arrived in New York smoothly on 25 April, as arranged by a human rights organization, and has since begun a new life. Wang Jiaqi, 34, was a graduate student of law at Beijing University before fleeing China. He had worked in Hubei Province's Tangshan City Public Security Bureau for 11 years, taking charge of a large quantity of "state secrets." His escape has allegedly caused a great shock in internal circles on the mainland, and the Ministry of State Security has already received an order to investigate the incident and determine the responsibility of the relevant persons. On 27 January 1994, Wang Jiaqi joined hands with Yuan Honghing, a law teacher at Beijing University, and Zhou Guoqiang, a trade unionist, in releasing an appeal letter signed by various circles regarding the incident of police beating up Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's Congress in Zhejiang Province; the letter asked the public security organs to stop infringements of citizens' rights. A total of 350 persons signed the appeal, including scholars, artists, reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, and standing committee members of a certain provincial people's congress, as well as pro-democracy activists such as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and Liu Nianchun. In early March, the mainland authorities arrested a number of active pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai, and Wang Jiaqi was also detained by Beijing; thereafter, he escaped while being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan, the place of his registered household. Hong Kong has often played the role of a refuge when communist China persecuted dissidents. Particularly at this sensitive time -- when Sino-British relations have deteriorated -- Wang Jiaqi's trip to Hong Kong and his travel to the United States via London will make the already sour bilateral relations even worse.
