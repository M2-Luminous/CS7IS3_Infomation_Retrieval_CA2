FBIS4-59209 "drnes091_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 ISRAEL Ramon on Likely Histadrut-Labor Coalition Ramon on Likely Histadrut-Labor Coalition TA1105080694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0500 GMT 11 May 94 TA1105080694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Knesset Member Hayim Ramon, secretary general-elect of the Histadrut labor federation, by Ya'el Dan; place not given -- live] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dan] Mr. Ramon, is the way paved for a coalition between your list and Labor in the Histadrut labor federation? [Ramon] I hope so. We told the voters that we hope to establish a coalition with Labor. I also said as much to the Labor party chairman. This position is shared by all members of our list. I hope negotiations with the Labor party chairman -- who is also the prime minister -- start very soon. I hope Labor party leaders in the Histadrut transfer power in an orderly way. We must remember that there has been no upheaval in the Histadrut since its establishment more than 70 years ago, so there is no experience in power changes in this organization. I sincerely hope that they intend to implement this changeover in the most orderly and smoothest way possible, thus enabling us to start working. The way for cooperation with Labor in this issue is paved. I assume that I will meet with the prime minister in the very near future. For me the most important thing is that the basis for such a coalition be our platform, as we promised to the voters. Incidentally, large segments of this platform are included in Labor's platform for the Knesset elections. The antiquated Histadrut bureaucracy, however, prevented the prime minister from fulfilling his promises. The best example for this is the national health bill; another important example is the national pension bill. [passage omitted]
