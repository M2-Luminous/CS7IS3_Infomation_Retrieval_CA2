The report comes amid a surge in industrialized nations' claims that their economic hardships can be partly attributed to an export offensive by developing countries in Asia taking advantage of cheap labor costs. Wage levels in newly industrialized economies (NIES) such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have shot up since the early 1970s and the sharp wage increase has helped erode their labor cost advantage, the report said. In the early 1970s, wages in these Asian countries were at a level of about 10 percent of those in industrialized nations, in the mid-1980s at about 30 percent and around 1990 at nearly 40 percent, according to the report. As for 1991, wages in these Asian NIES in the manufacturing sector were at 37 to 40 against the base of 100 for the United States, the report said. The report also compared real wages between industrialized nations and NIES through a means called purchasing parity and calculated the purchasing power of a country's currency in dollar terms. Under this method, the wage gap between Asian NIES and the U.S. was found to be smaller, with wages in Hong Kong and South Korea calculated at 65 percent of those in the U.S. wages in Thailand and the Philippines were tabulated at 20 percent of those in the U.S.
