FBIS4-60997 "drsov085_p_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Press Briefing on Constitution, Karabakh Press Briefing on Constitution, Karabakh 944K1158A Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in Russian 29 Apr 94 p 1 944K1158A Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA Russian CSO [Article by Serob Oganyan under rubric "Briefing": "President Prepared To Submit Disputed Issues to the Court of the People"] [Text] Yesterday the president's acting press secretary Levon Zurabyan held a regular briefing devoted to two topics: First, regarding the adoption of the Constitution, and second, the latest events in Nagornyy Karabakh. The press secretary noted that the adoption of the Constitution, in the president's opinion, is one of the most important problems Armenia will have to solve. In spite of the fact that discussions in parliament regarding the question of the mechanism for adopting the Constitution produced no results, L. Ter-Petrosyan gave a positive assessment to the discussions since the positions represented by the political forces in parliament were determined and their alignment was clarified. This will make it possible for everyone to take a more realistic approach to the question of adoption of the Constitution. "It is obvious," said L. Zurabyan, "that today's parliament is indeed not in a position to adopt a Constitution...." The adoption of the Basic Law was opposed both by deputies insisting on a referendum and by proponents of a Constituent Assembly. Thus, the number of deputies voting against this idea was almost a qualified majority. The idea of a Constituent Assembly was also actually rejected since no more than 50-60 deputies support it. "The debates in parliament showed that the most promising path to the adoption of a Constitution is a referendum," stated the president's press secretary. The Constituent Assembly version can only create another source of tension since the organ granted these extremely important authority would have to be chosen under conditions when there is no national accord in society. In the press secretary's opinion, the draft Constitution developed by the Supreme Soviet commission is more legitimate than the draft of the "six." He reported that the president suggested providing equal conditions for the drafts, placing both versions on the referendum. The readiness to hold new presidential and National Council elections after the adoption of the parliamentary version of the Constitution confirmed that this draft was not created under the power of Levon Ter-Petrosyan. And the latter, the president, through his press secretary, stated that he is prepared to submit all disputed issues to a court of the people. The absence of this kind of approach among the opposition shows their mistrust of democratic methods and the lack of confidence in the notion that they can achieve their goals by setting democratic mechanisms in motion. "In spite of everything, the president is looking to the future with optimism and thinks that the Constitution will be adopted through a nationwide referendum. As for the parliament, even if the constitutional process is slowed up here, this should not be viewed as a crisis. In such a case, in a year there will be new elections to the legislative organ and there will be new deputies to decide this issue... Then the president's press secretary proceeded to a discussion of the situation surrounding the Karabakh problem. After the speaker of the parliament of Azerbaijan, R. Guliyev, met in Moscow with Minister of Defense of Russia P. Grachev and reported his readiness to cease combat activities beginning at 0000 hours on 28 February, the latter had a telephone conversation with President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan, during the course of which he conveyed Azerbaijan's proposal and asked that he render assistance to the Karabakh side so that the Nagornyy Karabakh Republic would also agree to the cease-fire. This request was relayed to the Karabakh leaders by Yerevan officials. The Russian side, in turn, conveyed Azerbaijan's proposal to the authorities of the Nagornyy Karabakh Republic. "What Azerbaijan is proposing now is only a 10-day cease-fire without any commitments," said L. Zurabyan. "And, of course, in this form the proposal is unacceptable to Nagornyy Karabakh..." The press secretary expressed the opinion that Azerbaijan needed these 10 days as a respite and to prepare to resume combat activities and this is why Armenia fully concurs with Azerbaijan's position...
