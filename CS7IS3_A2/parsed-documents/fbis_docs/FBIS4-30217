The Finance Ministry "should take measures in line with the report" submitted in June 1992 that called for special treatment on the timing for lifting the ban on the sector so as to protect foreign-affiliated and smaller insurance firms, the insurance council said in the final report. Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to sell so-called "third-sector" policies covering casualty, diseases and nursing, that combine the benefits of both life and nonlife insurance policies. With the 1992 report allowing both Japanese life and nonlife insurers to enter the new sector, U.S. negotiators have demanded a five-year postponement at ongoing resumed bilateral "framework" talks on the insurance business. The final report gives Japanese negotiators the flexibility to decide on specific dates as the ministry moves to submit bills next year which would otherwise lead to the implementation of revised laws in the fall of 1997. The third sector "can become a panel issue which the administrative side alone can't judge," Hiromi Tokuda, chairman of the advisory forum to the finance minister, told reporters. But uncertainties remain over an agreement in the trade talks as a ministry official, requesting anonymity, said Japan is insisting on lifting the ban in two years and the issue is expected to remain on the table "until the last moment" while an overall agreement on the insurance field is pursued. The advisory panel has been working on concrete steps based on the earlier report to revise insurance-related laws for the first time in five decades. As with the third-sector issue, "staged" implementation is the main feature of the final report's 10-point proposals to spur competition through deregulation while taking measures to protect policyholders. The panel called on the ministry to first liberalize the insurance system, including mutual entry by life and casualty firms into each other's business fields "through subsidiaries," along with "quick legislation" of such measures as "solvency margins" and new management-checking systems to secure "soundness." The solvency margin is a barometer of assets and risks similar to the capital-adequacy ratio for banks. As the next stage, the forum wants the government to allow insurance firms to enter banking and other business areas through subsidiaries, after "ascertaining" the effects of the initial stage. The ministry will submit bills only for the first stage next year, while reserving the second stage, a ministry official said. As for other issues such as allowing banks to sell insurance policies, the panel decided to continue its discussions. Other proposed new measures to check management include obliging disclosure under a set law, giving a right even to one policyholder to take representative action at mutual companies, and adopting a "fire wall" between parent firms and subsidiaries. Japan's life insurers are all mutual companies which policyholders serve as stockholders. But the report paved the way for conversion to joint-stock companies, and also for mutual life insurers to issue bonds to procure funds. As the mainstay to protect investors, the panel proposed establishing a nonprofit industry company similar to the banking industry's deposit insurance company to aid financially troubled insurance firms. On deregulation, the forum recommended partial freeing in setting policy premiums and allowing insurance brokering.
