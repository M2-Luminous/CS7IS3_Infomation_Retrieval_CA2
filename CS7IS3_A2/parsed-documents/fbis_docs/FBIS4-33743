Some 21 months after ousting the first legally elected president in Haitian history, a group of military and civilians who are accustomed to prospering at the expense of those who endure misery and suffering is again jeopardizing the hemispheric security system by trying to disprove Victor Hugo's statement. An eventual U.S. military invasion, supported by a multinational force seeking to establish democracy, is a clear possibility in the not-so-distant-future. Bill Clinton has publicly admitted the viability of such a possibility. It has the unmistakable smell of a prophecy about to come true. The damage caused to the hemispheric system by similar actions undertaken in previous decades -- like in Grenada and Panama -- has yet to be assessed. Assessments were in many cases postponed by the flood of innumerable fantasies that drowned international relations at the end of the Cold War. The main problem is that Clinton invariably contradicts himself, particularly on foreign policy matters. At this stage of his administration, his words have a hollow sound. The Serbs, for example, have every reason to pay no attention when the Clinton administration feels the need to impress them -- the Serbs in particular, but even more so the rest of the World -- by hardening its military discourse. An editorial published a few months ago in one of the intellectual mouthpieces of that strange phenomenon that is "Clintonism" -- THE NEW REPUBLIC magazine -- caused understandable moral anguish. It stated that the United States is willing to fight commercial wars but not genocidal wars. Perhaps the Haitian dictatorship believes it might now avoid a foreign military landing on the island with the same uninterrupted success that successive generations of dominant classes have enjoyed in tenaciously blocking such universal ideals as human dignity, freedom, and social well-being since the slave uprising in 1804 which resulted in Haitian independence. History does not reject the possibility of impunity. The regime -- in which General Raoul Cedras is the master puppeteer and the elderly lawyer Emile Jonassaint is the puppet wearing the presidential sash that sways in compliance with Cedras' wishes -- may succeed in its nefarious actions. Ever since ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide was forced into exile, the international community has gone hoarse demanding the reinstatement of the previous status quo. At the expense of others, the Haitian regime has endured (and continues to endure) successive embargoes; humanitarian organizations state that two out of three Haitian children suffer malnutrition. Moreover, it made a complete mockery of a sensible agreement -- the Isla del Gobernador negotiated by Argentina's Dante Caputo -- which was originally accepted and which would have avoided global ridicule for Haiti. Haiti poses a heavy load on the U.S. conscience. The drama of Haitians drowning at sea trying to reach the U.S. coast and the reality of the horror of another immigration wave -- with its corresponding hunger, willingness to take low-wage jobs, and empty stomachs -- is a controversial issue in U.S. public opinion. Clinton, who seems to have difficulty in distinguishing good from bad, in this case has built around himself and his administration a cobweb of contradictory positions. Although the invasion would be the exclusive responsibility of the "benefactor power," other countries of the Americas would be compelled to contribute in the second stage of this exercise of exporting democracy. With the almost notorious exception of Argentina, no other Latin American country seems convinced of the benefits of such an adventure, which is ultimately aimed more at resolving Clinton's problem than at rescuing tormented Haitians. The Foreign Ministry says the Argentine Government has established the prerequisite that at least one other Latin American country must approve and cooperate in this exercise. This, however, seems to be a mere formal position because the Argentine Government is the only Latin American government that has not objected to this idea. Official sources have asserted that Caputo -- the official OAS negotiator of the Haitian crisis -- is one of the channels through which they coordinate the projects that may be implemented in no more than 30 days. Another version states that the mediator believes only threats will suffice, while Caputo has already notified Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella that he will resign if the threat materializes. Argentina has very little to give and even less to gain from this operation. It would be absurd to analyze the situation without considering Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Grenada, occupied by Ronald Reagan's men, has few reasons to thank the United States for the operation; while Panama -- without Manuel Noriega -- continues to be a haven for the drug traffickers and money launderers the invasion sought to eliminate. In an effort to manage the numerous conflicts he inherited, Clinton seems to have nothing better to do than to act like Bush and resort to the same vision of the world he defeated in the ballot boxes almost two years ago. All this is quite shocking because he seems to be mounting Bush's horse from the wrong side of the saddle. On 1 June THE NEW YORK TIMES published an article by Brent Scowcroft, a security adviser during the Bush administration, warning of the obvious risks that such an invasion entails and issuing a reminder that the United States occupied Haiti between 1914 and 1933. Scowcroft writes: "When we arrived there we found no trace of democracy. When we left, we did not leave any trace of it either."
