Nearly 75,000 such enterprises meanwhile had their licence revoked with an average of 535 each year, according to a national meeting on administration of registration of foreign-funded enterprises which was being held in Hefei, Anhui Province. Among the foreign-funded enterprises registered in China, Sino-foreign joint venture enterprises make up 107,000, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises 25,500, and solely foreign-funded enterprises 34,000. The official in charge of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said that there were a handful of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises in poor condition. Problems facing these enterprises included first, a false joint venture pattern in which a foreign party was only responsible for handling the necessary procedures without offering capital while in some cases the Chinese party provided foreign exchange or the foreign party offered renminbi as capital for joint venture. Second, a few foreign businessmen made use of the preferential policy on foreign investment to commit smuggling, profiteering and capitalizing on the business licence for swindling under the guise of undertaking foreign-funded enterprises. Third, some foreign investors made declaration of high prices which should have been lower while some others promoted the sale of poor quality equipment at a higher price. Fourth, there was still over 40 percent of capital not in place while some investment existed in name only. Fifth, some three types of foreign-funded enterprises ran illegally while some others even undertook pornographic business and gambling. Enterprises in the red accounted for over 40 percent of the total each year since 1990 with the number of enterprises suffering a loss reaching 42.5 percent of the total in 1992. Problems existing in foreign-funded enterprises were partly attributed to the government, the administrative as well as law enforcement departments, because they paid less attention to the quality of foreign-funded enterprises. In some cases local authorities worked out or adopted their own policy in violation of the state policy on and regulations of the foreign-funded enterprises.
