Senator Evans made his comment during a one-day visit to Somalia where he held surprise talks with Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and rival Ali Mahdi. His visit comes as several other countries prepare to withdraw from the United Nations Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM]. But Senator Evans told James Schofield that Australia had no intention of pulling out. [Begin recording] [Evans, in progress] Well, it is a slightly surreal experience to meet someone like General Aidid against the background of what has happened over last 12 months, but I had a long hour and a bit with him in Nairobi and I have met with Ali Mahdi here in Mogadishu. But I have to say that I am reasonably encouraged by the outcome of those discussions because if they are to be taken at face value, what they're saying is that they are both very much committed to consensus and compromise and there is plenty of objective evidence around the place that the pressures are building up for them to engage in such a consensual compromise approach. [Schofield] What can you take at the face value? After all, wouldn't it suit Gen. Aidid's purpose, for example, to lay low until the Americans have gone? [Evans] Well, all I can say is that there is a very widespread perception here being communicated to me by all sorts of people -- presidents of neighboring countries, UNOSOM personnel, others active [word indistinct] on the ground here -- that the people are really fed up to the teeth with the suffering that they have experienced and they are putting pressure on the political leadership of the respective clans to find this kind of accommodation. Each of them, I think, knows because of the messages they're getting loudly and clearly from the international community -- and I repeated those myself -- that they can't expect recognition and financial support or any other support from the international community if they win power by force of arms. They know that there is a huge relief and rehabilitation job still ahead of the country and the only way that is going to be achievable and they are going to keep their own popular support is by engaging in a process of political compromise. [Schofield] When the U.S. pulls out they're going take most of the effective communications and, for example, casualty evacuation support services with them, which will considerably...which will leave the UN position considerably weaker, wouldn't you agree? [Evans] Well, there will still be something over 20,000 troops here and still very substantial backup for them and even in the worst case analyses in terms of other possible drawdowns of troop-contributor involvement, we're still talking about fifteen, sixteen thousand. I know that doesn't produce the capacity for really activist-interventionist military operation, that is still a pretty substantial security (?blanket). I mean, all sorts of things are possible where there is a will to achieve it in this situation. All I can say generally in Somalia is that I had expected to find an absolute nightmare here. It is certainly not a dream run, but it is a better situation than what I had anticipated. [end recording]
