Prince Sa'ud also briefed the cabinet on his impressions of the tour. Prince Sa'ud said the wise directives of custodian of the two holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz at the current critical circumstances facing the region, necessitate continuous efforts, meetings and consultations to be directed with the aim of dedication of peace and stability in the region. Al-Sha'ir said the cabinet also reviewed the latest reports carried by the media on the deteriorating situation in Somalia, Afghanistan and Bosnia. Referring to Somalia, the cabinet expressed regret over the latest and sharp escalations in fighting in Mogadishu between the conflicting factions for the third day running that led to a big number of casualties and the loss of lives.

In this context, al-Sha'ir said, the Saudi Council of Ministers appealed to the conflicting parties throughout Arab and Islamic worlds to put weapons aside, seek rational and amicable solutions for disputes bearing in mind that conflicts between brothers would serve no one except their enemies and will never be in the best interests of the Arab and Islamic nations.
