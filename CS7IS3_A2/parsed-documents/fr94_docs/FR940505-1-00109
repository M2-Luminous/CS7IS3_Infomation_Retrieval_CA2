FR940505-1-00109 FR940505-1-00012 EPA believes that an I/M network run by one or a few private firms will, in fact, be the most cost-effective, convenient option for the State in providing I/M testing. It may not, however, meet other economic and social objectives held by State and local authorities, special interest groups, or the public. Some in California have indicated a desire to continue to involve as many individual businesses as possible in the program; some are also interested in exploring alternative test procedures. The fact that these features do not appear in the FIP proposal does not mean that they necessarily could not be pieces of the I/M program which California ultimately adopts in the SIP. However, if a SIP I/M program with a licensed test-and-repair station element is less effective than the I/M program proposed in the FIP, substitution of the former for the latter would require the addition of compensating increases in the stringency of other measures or the addition of measures not proposed for the FIP at all. Because of the reasons outlined above, EPA is proposing an enhanced I/M program in the FIP. However, EPA and the State are continuing to hold discussions on a program design which would meet the enhanced I/M performance standard. EPA would not finalize the FIP I/M program, should an agreement be reached, if appropriate legislation were adopted and an approvable SIP revision submitted. (b) Retrofit Programs for Mobile Sources. There has been a considerable amount of interest expressed by California air pollution control officials in retrofit/replacement options for highway diesel vehicles, heavy duty nonroad equipment, and locomotives. These are the categories (in addition to light duty vehicles) which contribute the bulk of the NO X emissions in the FIP areas. And, a retrofit requirement could accelerate the emission reductions that would normally result from equipment turnover. In order for a retrofit/replacement strategy to work, however, there are a number of tasks which must be completed. The general knowledge about how and where different types of engines are used must be increased significantly. For each category, there will be different typical lifetimes and rebuild or repower practices as well as differences in current technology and the feasibility of lowering NO X through in-field engine modifications. To estimate the impact of any measure, it is necessary to know the market share for the engines for which low emission models are available and much more about the usage patterns, for example, how much of the VMT in the inventory is due to local operations versus out-county or even interstate operations. It is also important to consider fleet fueling practices and whether or not there might be difficulties in gaining reasonable access to alternative fuels. Some technological modifications may not be appropriate for engines used on nonroad applications if they accelerate engine wear or reduce reliability in the rugged working conditions which are common to the category. Finally, the economic impact to individual industrial segments as well as on the overall economy in the FIP areas is a critical component in the regulatory decision. Nonroad engines are very specialized to their applications, and the costs of re-engineering engines and fuel systems cannot be spread over large numbers of sales as is the case with on-road vehicles. If, after consideration of many factors, a decision were made to require retrofit or engine replacement for NO X , it would be necessary to set emission performance standards for the retrofit/replacement and to promulgate the appropriate test protocols. The fact that there are specialized applications with a very wide range of vehicle duty cycles and engine types and sizes makes it extremely difficult for EPA to develop appropriate test cycles. EPA would also need to devise a process for identifying the individual pieces of equipment to which the requirements would apply, to implement a program in which a fleet operator would certify the efficacy and durability of a retrofit/replacement, and to establish an enforcement system which assured that the emission reductions which were predicted would actually occur. EPA believes that it has neither the knowledge nor the time which would be necessary to develop an effective retrofit strategy for on-highway or nonroad heavy duty engines in the FIP areas. For the locomotive category, EPA is proposing to develop national or state regulations which will address the rebuilds for locomotive engines. These regulations will contain the test protocols, emission standards and enforcement mechanisms to assure that the reductions occur. Although it is not proposing a retrofit program for existing trucks in any of the FIP areas, EPA is proposing a fleet average standard strategy for on-highway heavy duty engines and a growth cap for the nonroad heavy equipment category as part of a 1999 attainment option for the Sacramento area. The necessary standards, certification protocols, and enforcement mechanism either already exist or are being developed for other FIP areas. The specific details of these requirements are discussed elsewhere in this NPRM. (c) Adjustments Based on Local Control of VMT Growth. As discussed earlier, the expected growth in vehicle miles of travel (VMT) by on-highway vehicles in the FIP areas contributes to the stringency and wide applicability of the many emission reduction measures in the proposed FIP. For practical reasons, EPA is proposing only a limited set of measures that can be expected to affect VMT growth, specifically the parking cash out requirement and the employee commute options program in Sacramento. Consequently, there remains considerable opportunity for state and local governments to do more to influence VMT growth, and EPA urges them to do so. EPA invites public comment on what measures in particular could be designed by the state and local agencies which would be less expensive, less dislocating, and more equitable than the FIP's controls. Those measures which make more expansive use of market incentive approaches and those which address land use planning are the most likely candidates.
