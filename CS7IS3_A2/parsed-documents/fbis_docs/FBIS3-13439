Talking to a group of foreign correspondents in Islamabad last night, she said that as long as India refuses to take appropriate steps to make the bilateral talks purposeful, we will continue to raise the issue at the global level. She said that it is her government that successfully raised the Kashmir issue at international forums after the 1940's. I first raised the issue at the Islamic Conference Organization in 1990, and it was my government again that decided to raise it in Geneva, the prime minister said. We made the decision because it was a matter of principle, and it was the only means by which we could highlight the Kashmir issue at the international level, she added. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the Kashmir issue was raised in an unprecedented manner in the past more than three decades. India had to agree to allow, though unwillingly, the Amnesty International and other human rights groups to visit occupied Kashmir. Despite its hesitation, India also had to agree to allow the ambassadors of Western and Nonaligned countries to visit Kashmir. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that regarding the resolution, India had promised us through Iran that it would allow the ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen countries expressed concern over the people of Jammu and Kashmir and violation of human rights when the voting on the resolution was deferred. The prime minister said that India is now reneging on its promises, but we will not let it do that. India has lost any sympathy of the people of Jammu and Kashmir because Kashmir never remained a part of India. The future of Jammu and Kashmir has not yet been decided, and the solution to the issue is not to send Indian troops there. The solution lies in granting the self-determination rights to the people of Kashmir, a goal to which Pakistan is committed. Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister said that the two countries are holding bilateral talks on ways to resolve all their issues. She said that some U.S. officials feel that the Pressler Amendment failed to realize the objective of nuclear nonproliferation, and we want the American people understand the implications of the amendment. Pakistan has displayed patience in this regard, and it should be rewarded for that.
