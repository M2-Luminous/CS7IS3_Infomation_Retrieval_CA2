Damage by the Russian Navy Could Amount to 53 Billion Karbovanets a Year"] [Text] The Ukraine Environment Protection Ministry has issued a report saying that $17.16 billion is required to clean up environmental pollution caused by Black Sea Fleet units located on Ukraine's territory. According to the ministry, in the Sevastopol bay alone vessels dump approximately 1,000 cubic meters of untreated sewage water every day. The main pollution source in the Sevastopol bay is a fuel tank. Underground waters, the soil, and the sea bed are contaminated. In some parts of the bay the depth of toxic deposits reaches 40 meters. The Sevastopol bay is virtually dead. Approximately 30 ships, as well as ammunition and spare parts, are lying at its bottom. One-third of the land occupied by fleet bases needs recultivation. The volume of contaminated underground waters is approximately four million cubic meters. In the event of the fleet's division in the proportions envisioned (18 percent of vessels to Ukraine and the rest to Russia), according to the Environmental Protection Ministry, the Ukraine Main Ecological Inspectorate, and the corresponding services of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol city, the environmental damage from the Russian Navy on Ukrainian territory will amount to 53 billion karbovanets a year. The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry has demanded that the ecological aspect of the problem be taken into consideration in sharing out the Black Sea Fleet because neutralizing the effects of the fleet's activity exceeds the cost of the fleet itself by three to three and a half times.
