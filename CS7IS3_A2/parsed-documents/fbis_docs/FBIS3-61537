In essence, the regulatory documents amount primarily to clear-cut delegation of functions and authority of fund agencies: fund council, expert councils, executive committee, body of experts, and fund management. At present, the procedure of providing expert opinions is as follows. Applications for funding come to the expert council and two experts (let us recall that in the 1993 competition, because of the shortage of personnel we had to limit ourselves to one expert per application), whose names are kept secret. Each expert qualifies a project on the basis of several aspects and gives it an overall rating, using a three-point scale: ``definitely supported'' (1), ``can be supported'' (0), and ``rejected'' (-1). If all three ratings are positive, the project automatically receives support. Each scientific direction (according to the quota approved by the fund council) has the right to a specific share of the RFFI budget. If, after supporting definitely approved projects, it is not exhausted, projects with one zero and two one's come next, and so on in descending order. If there are insufficient funds to support the next batch of applications, they are submitted for consideration by the expert council. Within the quota limits, approval of applications is purely automatic. There has also been a change in structure of the RFFI: there is approval of the composition of the executive committee, which assumes some of the duties of the fund council during the period between its meetings. There has also been approval of expert councils and composition of the body of experts. Experts are allowed to submit applications for grants to the RFFI on a general basis. In the opinion of fund staff, the rules that have just been adopted are theoretically quite capable of resolving any conflicts that may arise. The slogan proposed by its new chairman, Academician Vladimir Fortov, is ``Independent expertise with high intellectual potential.'' In our opinion, everything will depend on how well the new rules we have described will work. And we are assured that they must work well because activities of the fund will be automatic, instead of being subject to influence peddling or the will of superiors. It seems that the fund's affairs are on the rise. Incidentally, it receives funds directly from the Ministry of Finance, rather than through the Ministry of Science, as before. With today's shortage of money in Russia, the fund receives almost everything it is supposed to (as does all of science, about 80 percent): this year, the fund expects to get 24 out of the 30 billion rubles requested (it has already received 13.5 billion), and it will use these funds to complete the bulk of its 1993 programs, and first of all the program for individual and group grants. At the present time, work is in progress on the concept of augmenting the sum in the RFFI account by making expert evaluations of projects having no direct bearing on basic science. Specialists from institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, institutions of higher learning and industrial laboratories have been included among the RFFI experts. True, the fund is not being inundated with orders, although it is already obvious that very large entities require such a service, for example, the VPK [military industrial complex]. Negotiations with customs officials have begun concerning expert evaluation of materials transported across the frontier. On this score, Vladimir Fortov stated: ``There is not a single organization in the country today that could compete with us in intellectual potential and our independence of other agencies.'' Being a nonprofit organization, the RFFI can receive money only from the State budget or in the form of voluntary contributions. I hope that Russian entrepreneurs will hear the latter, and will realize that science is the highest and main potential for the future rebirth of Russia. It is time, finally time to learn that ``gray gold'' is much more precious than ``black gold.''
