The birthday table was conveyed to him on May 21. Born into a poor peasant family in Chongdo County, North Kyongsang Province, he barely eked out his livelihood during the feudal period and under the Japanese imperialist rule as a farm hand, tenant farmer and day labourer. He could enjoy a worthy life and happiness only after the liberation of the country. During the fatherland liberation war he took an active part in the drive for increased wartime grain production and in aiding the front. In the postwar period he was the first to join an agricultural cooperative and worked hard to reap bumper crops every year. Now, he has a big family of nearly 50.
