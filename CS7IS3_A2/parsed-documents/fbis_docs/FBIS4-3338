Economic growth in the first quarter has reached the expected goal of 9 to 10 percent which was the overall target of macroeconomic regulation and control. Giving an account of the first quarter, Ye Zhen pointed out: GNP for the first quarter totaled 862 billion yuan. Viewed from the internal economic structure, the excessive increase in production, construction, and sales has dropped somewhat. Of this, added value of industry amounted to 533 billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the same period in 1993. Energy production also increased steadily. Investment by the state sector in fixed assets totaled 81.5 billion yuan, an increase of 36.2 percent over 1993. The investment set up had the following three characteristics: First, the growth in local projects decreased while that of central projects increased rapidly; second, transportation, post, and telecommunications further strengthened; and third, the confusion in real estate was brought under control and the number of housing projects aimed at improving basic housing conditions increased. The volume of retail sales in the first quarter totaled 352.2 billion yuan, 3 to 4 percent lower than normal years. The overall market situation remained steady with some slack. In the first quarter, average real income of urban and rural inhabitants for living expenses rose by 9.3 and 13.1 percent respectively over the same period last year. Ye Zhen's account of the first quarter continued: First, exports increased sharply and the exchange rates remained steady. The volume of exports in the first quarter totaled $19.1 billion, up 18.2 percent from the corresponding period of 1993; the volume of exports [word as published] reached 29.4 billion yuan, up 18.2 percent, with imports exceeding exports by $1.3 billion. [figures as published] Second, revenue increased steadily and expenditure remained normal. Revenue in the first quarter increased by 21.4 percent and expenditure was up 23.8 percent. Third, the financial situation was stable as was the withdrawal of currency from circulation. In the first quarter, the banks granted 35.1 billion yuan in loans and received 207.2 billion yuan in deposits. The currency put into circulation before the Spring Festival was withdrawn by the end of March. Meanwhile, Ye Zhen stressed that, viewed from the economic situation during the first quarter, we still face serious difficulties and problems and the tasks for the next stage are extremely arduous. The difficulties and problems include: First, soaring prices. In the first quarter, the country's retail prices, mainly of the basic necessities, rose 20.1 percent compared to last year. The highest rates were registered in Haikou, 34.1 percent; Urumqi, 30.6 percent; and Nanjing, 30.1 percent. Moreover, prices rose 24 percent in Beijing, 26.3 percent in Tianjin, 23.3 percent in Shanghai, and 24.3 percent in Guangzhou. Thanks to the measures adopted by the government at all levels, Ye said, price increases eased somewhat in March. Second, difficulties in the operation and production of state enterprises were further aggravated. In the first quarter, state industry increased by only 2.2 percent over the same period last year and both the number of losing enterprises and the amount of their deficits increased. Some 49.6 percent of enterprises suffered losses, with the amount of deficits totaling 15.7 billion yuan. The main reasons include: The failure of enterprises to change their mechanisms; hidden deficits were made public following the reform of the accounting system; and overall losses did not increase but losses in certain enterprises increased somewhat following the tax reform and enterprises which had made small profits in the past turned into loss-making enterprises. Third, there are still hidden worries in agricultural production, the gap in incomes between urban and rural inhabitants further widened, and some households with low incomes could not make both ends meet. Ye Zhen said that macroeconomic control and regulation is now at a crucial stage and consideration will be given to stable prices and economic growth in the future.
