Saitoti made the remarks while meeting visiting Chinese Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who paid a courtesy call on the Kenyan vice-president. Saitoti noted that Kenya and China have shared a good relationship for 30 years, adding that "your country, although a developing country, has been able to render substantial assistance to our country. We Kenyan people consider Chinese the very true friend of Kenya." He cited Arap Moi International Sports Complex built by the Chinese Government as an example of China's aid to Kenya, saying that the Kenyan Government is very much pleased with the assistance provided by the Chinese Government in education, health and other fields. Kenya, he said, is going through a fundamental economic reform. He expressed the hope that more Chinese businessmen would invest in Kenya "either through joint venture or direct investment." Meanwhile, the Kenyan vice-president said that there are thousands of Somali and Sudanese refugees in his country, which have posed heavy burden on Kenya in social and economic respects. He appealed to the international community as well as China to continue the efforts to bring peace to Somalia and the Sudan. In response, Qian Qichen said the Chinese Government is satisfied with the development of the relations between China and Kenya, hailing the importance the Kenyan Government has attached to the relations between the two countries and peoples. "We also appreciate your adherence to the one China policy," said the Chinese vice-premier. "Kenya is a very important country in East Africa," Qian said. He voiced his appreciation to the Kenyan Government, especially President Daniel arap Moi, for the important role they have played in promoting the peace in Somalia and the Sudan. On the trade relations between the two countries, Qian said the Chinese Government is willing to strengthen economic cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. Moreover, Qian expected that his visit will further promote the relations between the two countries. The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here on Saturday [15 January] and this is his second visit to Kenya. He is leaving here tomorrow for Madagascar.
