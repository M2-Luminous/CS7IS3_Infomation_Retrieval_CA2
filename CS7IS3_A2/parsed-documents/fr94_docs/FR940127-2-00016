SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel issued a decision which affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative countervailing duty determination of the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (``ITA'') concerning Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada. The panel remanded the ITA's determination in two respects: (1) For the ITA to explain why, in determining the specificity of the SDI program subsidy, the ITA conducted its ``disproportionality'' analysis on an enterprise-by-enterprise basis rather than on an industry-by-industry basis; and (2) For the ITA to explain why its use of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) depreciation tables for the useful life of equipment in the industry accurately reflects the commercial and competitive benefits received by Norsk Hydro Canada from grants it received for the purchase of pollution control equipment. The panel instructed ITA to provide its redetermination on remand within 30 days (by Sepember 16). The ITA submitted its redetermination on remand on September 15, 1993, which the Panel Affirmed in all respects. The Secretariat was instructed to issue a Notice of Completion of Panel Review on the 31st day following the issuance of the Order, if no Request for an Extraordinary Challenge was filed. No such request was filed. Therefore, on the basis of the Panel Order and Rule 80 of the Article 1904 Panel Rules, the Panel Review was completed and the panelists discharged from their duties effective January 14, 1994. Dated: January 18, 1994. James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, FTA Binational Secretariat. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1775 Filed 1&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;GT&hyph;M
