"We insist on the earliest possible opening of the Hungarian trade and cultural office in Taipei," CDPP Vice President and Member of Parliament mIKLOS hASZNOS said after returning from a weeklong visit to Taiwan. Hasznos and Bela Csepe, leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDPP recently traveled to Taipei to boost bilateral ties between Budapest and Taipei. Hasznos told CNA Budapest that they wanted to discuss how to speed up the opening of the office with Minister of Foreign Affairs Geza Jeszenszky. He said it was in Hungary's best interests to have the office open sometime this year. Hasznos pointed out that development of economic and cultural cooperation with Taiwan should be a natural process and could not be seen by Beijing as an unfriendly step. However, he added, office rent was very high in Taipei, and those costs have not been included in Hungary's state budget this year. Hasznos and Csepe explained to their hosts in Taipei that the Hungarian representative office would be open sooner if the Taipei Government understood the financial difficulties and put government owned real estate at Hungary's disposal or made a cheaper rent possible for the first year. The politicians recalled their visit to Kuomintang headquarters where they had emphasized the similarities between the Taiwan ruling party and the Hungarian Christian Democrats. These similarities would facilitate mutual understanding. "We are both conservatives, nationalists, and anti-Communists," he said. Economic relations should be expanded, he explained. "More exchange of information is needed," stressed Hasznos. In his view cooperations could also explore barter trade because both sides have products necessary to the other one. He thinks that Taiwan tourism to Hungary should also be developed. He will encourage travel agencies to send information to and make bids in Taipei. A good tourism relationship would help boost Taiwan tourists to Expo 96, to be held in Budapest, he noted.
