FR940106-2-00069 FR940106-2-00035 Table 1._ Impact of Delay in the Update of SNF Limits and Elimination of Add-on* 1Fiscal year 1Update delay 1Elimination of add-on 1994 $30 $10 1995 120 10 1996 90 10 1997 10 1998 10 *All figures are rounded to the nearest $10 million. As illustrated in Table 2 below, the delay in updating the cost limits until October 1, 1995, combined with the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs, will result in a small increase in the number of SNFs exceeding the SNF limits in all categories, although we cannot isolate the separate impact of these factors. Table 2 below shows the combined impact of these changes.
