The signing and ratification of this agreement at the Saeima would make the passing of a law of foreigners and stateless persons status in Latvia more complicated, and it would also deteriorate the relations between Latvia and Estonia. In Estonia a similar law, being already in effect, delays initialling of agreement with Russia on military pensioners' social guarantees. After signing an agreement that legalizes occupation army officers' residence in Latvia, there will be no use for the Saeima to ask NATO member countries' parliaments to acknowledge the occupation of Latvia in 1940, said Kirsteins. Kirsteins considers Latvia can sign only those agreements with Russia, that do not concern Russian retired military personnel social guarantees. The faction also considers that before signing the agreement, the public opinion must be taken into account as well, because nearly a half of the Latvia's inhabitants does not support the signing of agreement on Russian retired military personnel social guarantees, said Kirsteins. The faction and the Latvian National Independent Movement board will discuss March 26 the issue and declare their attitude towards the package of agreements, initialled during Latvian-Russian interstate talks.
