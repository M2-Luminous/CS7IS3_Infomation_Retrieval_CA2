These are turbo-propelled, twin-engine planes with a functional capacity of between 44 and 48 passengers. The objective is to include them in the national and Caribbean routes. The Cuban airline is responsible for tourism support and for Cuban national and international aviation, which are currently using Russian-made airplanes; that is, manufactured by the former Soviet Union. These planes are very safe, but they have been rendering service to the Cuban airlines for several years and we have been trying to find an alternative solution to these old Soviet-made planes so that national and international air transport will not be impaired by a gradual reduction of their service. The Cuban airline intends to gradually replace these Russian airplanes by others which are more economic and more comfortable for passengers. These are Netherlands-made planes and their brand name is Fokker F-27-600. They are easily convertible from passenger to cargo planes. Aviaco and Iberia cover all Spanish national routes.
