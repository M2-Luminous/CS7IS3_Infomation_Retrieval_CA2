ACTION: Notice of Extension of Public Comment Deadline on Proposed Rule; and Change in Location of Public Meeting in Phoenix, AZ. SUMMARY: On July 7, 1994, HUD published a proposed rule that would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules defining what are `significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older persons' in such section.'' The July 7, 1994 proposed rule provided for the public comment period to expire on October 5, 1994. This notice extends the public comment period to November 30, 1994. Additionally, on August 9, 1994, HUD published a notice announcing four public meetings to be held across the country to discuss the July 7, 1994 proposed rule and to provide an additional opportunity for members of the public to submit comments on the rule. This notice also advises of a change in location for the Phoenix, AZ public meeting. DATES: Comment Due Date: November 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposed rule to the Office of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34902), HUD published a proposed rule that would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules defining what are `significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older persons' in such section.'' The regulations governing ``housing for older persons'' are codified in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E, and the July 7, 1994 proposed rule (also referred to as the ``Significant Facilities proposed rule'') would amend subpart E to provide the definitions required by section 919. Extension of Public Comment Period The July 7, 1994 proposed rule provided for a 90-day public comment period which is scheduled to close on October 5, 1994. Because of the significant public interest in this rule, HUD is extending the public comment period to November 30, 1994. Change in Location of Phoenix, AZ Meeting Additionally, on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40502), HUD published a notice announcing four public meetings to be held across the country to discuss the Significant Facilities proposed rule and to provide an additional opportunity for members of the public to submit comments on the rule. The August 9, 1994 notice announced that public meetings would be held in Fontana, CA, on August 15, 1994; Tampa, FL, on August 25, 1994; Phoenix, AZ on September 29, 1994; and Washington, DC, on October 6, 1994.
