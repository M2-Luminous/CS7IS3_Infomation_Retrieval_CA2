Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit says when the legislation takes effect, other people will not be allowed to make use of the rice and other crop varieties without consent of the owner who obtains specific varieties through cross breeding. Mr. Churin says the legislation will prevent other countries from taking Thai rice varieties to be further developed in their countries to enable them to become Thailand's major competitors for rice exports. He says Vietnam has a policy to promote the cultivation of Hom Mali variety because of better prices it fetches compared with other varieties. However, the country has been faced with the problem of plant diseases; therefore, its Hom Mali output is still unsatisfactory. Mr. Churin says Thailand and Vietnam have already concluded a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in rice exports. Both countries will later hold consultations on prices of rice exports. They may set the median price to avoid price undercutting.
