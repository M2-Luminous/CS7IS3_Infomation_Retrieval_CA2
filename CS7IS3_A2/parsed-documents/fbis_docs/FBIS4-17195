Russia, he noted in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, has done a great deal and is prepared to continue its efforts to establish a lasting interaction between the Serbian side and the UN in the hope of settling the situation around Gorazde and strengthening the safety zones. It is important to move without delay toward a comprehensive reduction in all hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a draft of which has already been prepared through the joint efforts of Vitaliy Churkin and Charles Redman, the co-chairmen of Russia and the United States. I hope, the minister stressed, that the Serbian President S. Milosevic will this time be successful in putting into practice the policy that was agreed upon during the course of our conversation with him during the night of 16-17 April, because it is precisely this which meets the interests of the Serbs and their traditional relations with Russia.
