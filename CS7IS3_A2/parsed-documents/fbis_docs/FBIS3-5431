He told reporters at the Bishan East PAP [People's Action Party] Women's Wing function: "Whether it is a large group of foreign workers or one individual being caned, it doesn't affect bilateral relations that countries build up over the years. There are broader interests between countries than just the behaviour of individual citizens. Every country looks at relations based on national interests." He added that, ultimately, it was the prerogative of each country to administer the law in its own way. "And that, we expect of America, whose citizens are here. And similarly, we expect the same of Singaporeans when they go abroad." Fay was sentenced to four months' jail, six strokes of the cane and was ordered to pay a $3,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to two charges of mischief and one charge of dishonestly retaining stolen property. The American community, through the embassy and its business council, has expressed concern over the caning sentence.
