The revisions read as follows: §277.18 Establishment of an Automated Data Processing (ADP) and Information Retrieval System. * * * * * (c) General acquisition requirements. _(1) Requirement for prior FNS approval. A State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section when it plans to acquire ADP equipment or services which it anticipates will have total acquisition costs of $500,000 or more in Federal and State funds. However, a State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS for the acquisition of ADP equipment or services to be utilized in an EBT system regardless of the cost of acquisition. A State agency shall also obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans to noncompetitively acquire ADP equipment or services from a nongovernmental source which cost more than $100,000 in Federal and State funds. The State agency shall request prior FNS approval by submitting the Planning APD or Implementation APD signed by the appropriate State official to the FNS Regional Office. * * * * * (e) APD Update._ (1) General sub- mission requirements. The State agency shall submit an APD Update for FNS approval for all approved Planning and Implementation APD's when total acquisition costs exceed $1 million. *␣*␣* * * * * * (g) Conditions for Receiving FFP._ (1) A State agency may receive FFP at the 50 percent reimbursement rate for the costs of planning, design, development or installation of ADP and information retrieval systems if the proposed system will: (i) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food Stamp Act; (ii) Meet the program standards specified in §272.10(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this chapter, except for the requirements in §272.10 (b)(2)(vi), (b)(2)(vii) and (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter to eventually transmit data directly to FNS; (iii) Be likely to provide more efficient and effective administration of the program; and (iv) Be compatible with other such systems utilized in the administration of State agency plans under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). (2) State agencies seeking FFP for the planning, design, development or installation of automated data processing and information retrieval systems shall develop Statewide systems which are integrated with AFDC. In cases where a State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program, FNS may grant an exception to the Statewide integrated requirement. These exceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's ability to meet the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptions to this rule, however, should be capable to the extent necessary, of an automated data exchange with the State agency system used to administer AFDC. In no circumstances will funding be available for systems which duplicate other State agency systems, whether presently operational or planned for future development. * * * * * (p) *␣*␣* (5) Costs. Costs incurred for complying with the provisions of paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(3) of this section are considered regular administrative costs which are funded at the regular FFP level. §277.19 [Removed] 10.
