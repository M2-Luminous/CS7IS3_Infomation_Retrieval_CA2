After the failure of the international community on the test of Gorazde, it seems that Tudjman's hopes are being realized. However, it might be useful to warn the local mediators in the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina of an opposite result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama--Bosnia stays, they fail. While a ceremony for the Croatian-Bosnian agreement was being prepared in Washington, Ivan Bender recommended from Siroki Brijeg, not at all jokingly, that the Croats there will see how "this" looks in practice, and only then decide whether to accept the agreement. Several days after the rainy wedding ceremony in Washington, the Presidency of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] of Bosnia-Herzegovina had already resolved, it seems, all dilemmas and announced actions that will be "louder than you think and different than you expect." Indeed, events followed that are unambiguous, and some really announced "loudly" that the Washington agreement is staggering before it was put on its feet. The first contacts of the two sides showed that they are not in a position to find a common language even for that rare matter that is not fixed by the agreement but is left to their internal decision (the order of the election of leaders of the federation). Not long after Franjo Tudjman gave the usual interview on the eve of the visit of the chief of state to the other country and, quite unusually, announced that the visit to Sarajevo would perhaps--not take place. Finally, 15 days ago, someone very expertly set off an explosion in Livan, leveling the minaret of the 150-year-old mosque of Curcinica. In only a month, therefore, everything occurred that was necessary for the conclusion to be drawn that one side traveled to Washington not with the intention of achieving an agreement under the sponsorship of the most powerful administration in the world, but, under the umbrella of that authority--which was perhaps lulled that everything was ready--of doing just the opposite. Why Curcinica? The incident with Curcinica is too striking and resonant to be treated simply as "just another" mosque that no longer stands erect. First, it was destroyed in a city that at one time was cited as an example of where that doesn't happen; this means that someone passionately wanted to emphasize that not even small islands exist in the sea of Croatian-Muslim hatred any longer. Therefore, if the other side is held to account for much lesser war crimes than its own, although it is claimed at the same time that the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is more a leaderless army of bandits than a real, disciplined army, then the question of the responsibility of the allegedly well organized HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the Croatian police arises with two-fold weight. In truth, they cannot be accused--without firm proof--as directly guilty parties for the destruction of the mosque, but they can be accused of not bringing in criminals and terrorists, because there is already proof of this. For example, it is known who leveled Stupni Do and why (the aim was to "warn" the Muslims, but also to incite them against Croats in Vares in order to resettle them), but that man is still--now under a new name--in his old position in the HVO. Those who are leaving him in freedom are probably projecting through him intimate notions about prohibited, but desirable filthy messes--my God, it's war!--as Slobodan Praljak did several days ago, when he decisively denied that he had ordered the destruction of the Old Bridge.... But he then added, in the same breath and equally resolutely, that, in a situation where military reasons demanded it, he would do the same thing. As you can see, the "dogs of war" are not to be foreseen and tied up, but the chains are long and tight on which they are placed and, one hopes, anyone can easily reach home along them. Here it is interesting to mention that, according to Akmadzic's recent statement, two sides have agreed that each will clean from its ranks those who are hindering the establishment of a joint state, and it is certainly not accidental that right here and only here was "full sovereignty" insisted on. We will not guess who was more interested in this clause, but the conclusion is inevitable in view of the later series of recent actions by both sides. Road Tax Although the facts were different, the Bosnians first roughly activated the staff sieve, having already replaced Safer Halilovic some time earlier, and then mercilessly having eliminated several "warlords" who could no longer be controlled (Caco, perhaps even Prazina). The only thing with which the Croatian side reciprocated was its moving of Boban and the arrival of the moderate Bosanac Zubak. But as nothing beside this happened, it was clear that the aim was not to clean up their own ranks but to blackmail the other side into sweeping them according to what was already swept, or, if it didn't want to--to refrain from everything. The present taking of bids on the election of the first leader of the federation is aiming at that. Croatians do not want a Muslim in that position, claiming that after five or six years it's the Croats' turn, but just when one thinks that it is a case of a stand on principle, he changes into--possibly a Muslim, but not the "belligerent" Izetbegovic. Since we are talking about the leader of a state that, whatever has been said, enjoys the support of a large part of the citizens, the challenged one has evidently been sent not only to Izetbegovic personally, but also to the whole Bosnian people, who are just entering a period of maturity and self-awareness. This is all the more insulting in that, contrary to the internal agreement mentioned, what is exclusively in the jurisdiction of these people is being encroached upon, and at the same time notorious criminals are being tolerated in their own ranks. Moreover, local propaganda has set loose a mill of insinuations about how the Bosnians have abandoned the Washington agreement--it was claimed earlier that they had abandoned Bosnia-Herzegovina--allegedly swayed by Izetbegovic's legal adviser Boyle, who believes that the agreement practically sanctions the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But Bosnia-Herzegovina deputy prime minister Edib Bukvic stated lately that the Bosnian side had an insight into Boyle's opinion even before the signing of the Washington agreement; this means that it nevertheless believed in it, while only some trends in Bosnian policy, claims Bukvic, were submitted to Boyle's analysis. In addition, Bukvic stated that Herceg-Bosna is again assuming the old form of a pseudo-state, which functions well only in a robbery. A road tax has again been introduced, this time with a firm scale of charges, so the shipment of goods over the border is encumbered with levies of 100 to 150 percent (!), and even humanitarian convoys for central Bosnia pay a "road toll." Although one shouldn't doubt the material greed of the leaders of Herceg-Bosna, the aim of the highway robbery described by Bukvic is indeed broader and is directed at provoking Muslims to erect firm borders toward Croats. With this the concept of cantonal division would definitely be destroyed, and a partition into two parts would be consolidated, which Ivo Komsic says is being hastily carried out. A further, more ambitious aim is to leave the Bosnians with the conviction that "their" Bosnia-Herzegovina is impossible and that it has remained only on their shoulders (about which Milovan Sibl recently wrote, in DANAS, an unusually detailed text, having failed to answer only the trifle of whether he wrote it as a journalist in politics or as a politician in the newspaper). This could also be the explanation of why Djapic and his Croatian Rights Party members were recently attacked with tables and chairs in Siroki Brijeg. Although they say that he has often been on Pantovcak recently, where an alliance of the "right" against the "vampire-like left" has been worked out, Djapic nevertheless poured the cup too full. And this, it seems, not so much through attacks against the great (Zagreb) and the small (Mostar) leadership, and not even with charges that Tuta Naletilic is "responsible for destroying the Livanj mosque," as through dreaming by the Croatian Rights Party about the fighting unity of the Croatian and the Muslim people, which has also been supported in recent days by the announcement about a new founding of the HOS [Croatian Defense Force]. Sarajevo Is Far Away If the Bosnians rear on their hind legs at all of this, so much the better! At an SDA [Party of Democratic Action] convention, Alija Izetbegovic recently reduced all the aims of his party to one basic and undoubtedly justified one--"We want all the territory back"--but with this also fell into the trap of national and confessional exclusivity, stating that there would be no more genocide against the Muslim people, because weapons would not be taken from anyone "except criminals." It is interesting that now, when critical repercussions from this should be expected in Zagreb, all of a sudden there are none, although whole tomes were written until recently about alleged Islamic fundamentalism. As if a little real fundamentalism in Sarajevo would be appropriate to the masters of local propaganda, so it would be easier for them to steal away from the Washington agreement, into which they have been pushed against their will anyway. Recent correspondence between Izetbegovic and Tudjman, in which the former is understandably concerned, and the latter not understandably satisfied with what has been achieved, indicates that the Croatian president has favored a tactic of making a resolution difficult (he announced a visit "soon" to Sarajevo, but he immediately mentioned "technical and communications" problems, as if we are somewhere in the middle of 1992), evidently convinced that it is only a question of time until Bosnia-Herzegovina disappears from the map. Taught by experience, he will just not keep making inroads this time, but he will let someone else do the coroner's job, possibly the United States. After the failure by the international community of the Gorazde test, it seems that Tudjman's predictions and hopes are being realized (thus Sibl hurried to be hailed as a journalistic analyst). But both foresee that Bosnia-Herzegovina has been trying to divide itself in quarters, now, for more than two years already, but it isn't working. That this is really a question of an "artificial state," "a colonial creation," and however they have already called it, this would surely happen even without any great effort by Belgrade and Zagreb, and even the United States and Russia together would not be able to prevent disintegration. Thus we are warning the local mediators in the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina to keep in mind the opposite result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama--Bosnia stays, they fail.
