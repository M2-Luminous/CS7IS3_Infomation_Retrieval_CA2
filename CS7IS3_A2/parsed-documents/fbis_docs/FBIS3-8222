[passage omitted] In Naples, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation denied the Bosnia "no-fly" order had been breached Sunday [6 March]. U.S. Major John Jeffrey said the Western military alliance had received no reports of an attack on Maglaj. Any breach of the flight ban would have led to a NATO riposte, he said. An Italian spokesman for NATO told AFP: "As far as we are concerned nothing happened." Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 19,000 was 45 percent Moslem, has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and its residents are said to be living in appalling conditions. Sadic said that 11 people were killed and 24 others recently when the town's hospital was shelled.
