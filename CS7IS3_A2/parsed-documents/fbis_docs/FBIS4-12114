Al-Majali frankly and clearly answered their questions on all issues and events, including the blockade on al-'Aqabah port, relations between Jordan and the PLO, the economic and financial situation, unemployment, the media, and other issues of interest to the country and the people. At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister welcomed the media figures and expressed his happiness for such meetings to discuss all important issues. These meetings are a framework to build bridges of trust between the government and the press and will eventually benefit the homeland. The prime minister reviewed the issue of the blockade on al-'Aqabah port and the efforts exerted by the Jordanian king, government, and people on all levels to solve this problem as a result of which Jordan suffered immense material losses which reflected negatively on the performance of the Jordanian economy. The prime minister noted that His Majesty King Husayn clearly stated that the blockade and harassment of Jordan contravenes its historic role to realize security, stability, and progress in the region and to defend itself against anything that infringes on its dignity and rights. On Jordanian-PLO relations, the prime minister described the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship as distinguished and brotherly. He said that Jordan has supported and will always support the Palestinian brothers until rights are restored on the Palestinian territories. Al-Majali emphasized that Jordanian-PLO ties must be based on the principle of coordination. The prime minister dealt in detail with Jerusalem and its religious importance to both Christians and Muslims, stressing that there can be no genuine peace without Jerusalem. He said that His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed that rule over Jerusalem will be for God alone and that his majesty's call did not materialize from a vacuum but was in answer to Israel's claims of sovereignty over Jerusalem.
