Twenty of the 24 contested seats have been won. The opposition parties are leading with two seats more than the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. [passage omitted] The opposition is already claiming victory. On 21 February, Mr. Yao Agboyibor, Action Committee for Renewal chairman, said that his party and allied groups of the Togolese Union for Democracy had won the absolute majority in the future National Assembly. The Togolese Government immediately disputed the results of the second round of elections in several constituencies where it claims the elections were marred by acts of sabotage. The former sole ruling party, the RPT, has adopted a similar position and is even going a step further by calling for the annulment of the elections in the constituencies where it claims there was fraud. Gachin Ayite Midevor, who is in charge of coordination for RPT and the election campaign, speaks to Raphael Mbadinga on the issue. [Begin recording] [Midevor] At the moment, we are still awaiting results from four constituencies. The RPT has issued a statement on our readiness to cooperate in a broad sense with the opposition in the next government. We have also noticed that there was fraud in certain constituencies and we have referred the matter to the Supreme Court. We are calling for the annulment of elections in the constituencies where there was fraud. [Mbadinga] Are you ready to accept a prime minister who is chosen from the ranks of the opposition? [Midevor] Our Constitution stipulates that prime ministers are chosen from the parliamentary majority. If the parliamentary majority turns out to be from the opposition, we cannot oppose that.
