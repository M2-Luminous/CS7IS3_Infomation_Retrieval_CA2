FR941020-0-00066 FR941020-0-00023 One commenter was concerned about the design, construction, certification, and performance requirements for SCS Class A permanent impoundments since the rule changes deal strictly with SCS Class B and C impoundments. The commenter noted that many permanent impoundments meeting the Class A criteria are constructed in accordance with appropriate specifications and wanted to know what the requirements would now be for these Class A impoundments. The commenter is correct: The regulations for Class A impoundments are not being changed by this rulemaking. Section 701.5␣Definitions: Siltation Structure As proposed, the definition of siltation structure has been moved to 30 CFR 701.5 from 30 CFR 816.46(a)(1). The definition appearing in 30 CFR 817.46 (a)(1) is being removed. This is an organizational change only. Section 701.5 already includes definitions of related terms such as impounding structure, impoundments, and sedimentation pond. Moving the definition of siltation structure from section 816.46(a)(1) to 701.5 centralizes the location of these related definitions. Section 701.5␣Definitions: Other Treatment Facilities Also as proposed, the definition of other treatment facilities, a term related to siltation structures, has been moved to 30 CFR 701.5. This definition of other treatment facilities is similar to the definitions previously appearing in 30 CFR 816/817.46(a)(3) which are being removed. The new definition adds the words ``neutralization'' and ``precipitators'', to indicate common water quality treatment processes, and the phrase, ``to comply with all applicable State and Federal water-quality laws and regulations.'' These additions to the definition clarify that the purpose of an other treatment facility is to comply with water quality laws, as well as to prevent additional contributions of dissolved or suspended solids to streamflow or off-site runoff. Revising the definition does not change the thrust of the performance standards in 30 CFR 816/817.41&hyph;49. Moving the definition of other treatment facilities from §816.46(a)(3) to 701.5 centralizes OSM's definitions and logically follows the relocation of the definition of siltation structure. Two commenters were concerned that revisions to the definition of ``other treatment facilities'' will allow approval of facilities that can not meet effluent limits for sediment. Moving the definition of other treatment facilities to section 701.5 does not affect or alter the requirement to meet the effluent limits which appears in 30 CFR 816.42. Sections 780.25/784.16␣Permitting Requirements for Reclamation Plans: Siltation Structures, Impoundments, Banks, Dams, and Embankments Section 30 CFR 780.25 establishes permitting requirements applicable to the design of each siltation structure, water impoundment, and coal processing waste bank, dam, or embankment within the proposed permit area. Section 780.25 is being revised to add specific references to the SCS criteria for dam classification found in their Technical Release No. 60 (TR-60) and to include editorial changes as described below. These changes, which are being issued as proposed, were needed to ensure that the permitting requirements for impoundments are consistent with the performance standards for impoundments and that both are tied to SCS and MSHA requirements. For editorial purposes, OSM revised the heading of 30 CFR 780.25 and the text of §780.25(a) by removing the word ``Ponds'' and replacing it with ``Siltation structures.'' This revision makes the section title consistent with the broader classification of structures intended to be covered by §780.25 and with similar changes at section 816.46 that will be discussed later. In final 30 CFR 780.25(a)(2), OSM references the SCS dam classification in TR-60 as proposed. This additional language clarifies that the SCS classification criteria as well as the MSHA criteria are components of OSM rules. This approach clarifies that impoundments that do not meet the MSHA criteria in 30 CFR 77.216(a), but are determined to be Class B or C impoundments by SCS criteria in TR-60, must comply with the more rigorous standards that apply to impoundments that meet those classifications. OSM revised 30 CFR 780.25(a)(3) by removing the reference to 30 CFR 77.216(a) and by replacing it with a reference to §780.25(a)(2), where the SCS and MSHA impoundment classification criteria are both now located since both apply. In 30 CFR 780.25(b), OSM replaced the phrase ``sedimentation ponds'' with ``siltation structures'' to be consistent with the revised title for the section. OSM also removed the last two sentences of §780.25(b) because the same requirements already exist in 30 CFR 780.25(c)(1) and (2). In all cases the final rules are the same as those proposed.
