Ryskulova, Zoology Institute at the Kazakhstani Republic Academy of Sciences; UDC 591.553-577.34] [Text] A review of the radioecological conditions in the republic is presented. The problem of animal radio-ecology is considered by studying the organisms and animals from the zone adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. For several decades, the world community has been interested in the effect of ionizing radiation on the animal world. Yet interest in this problem has heightened relatively recently, and this was largely due to the tragic Chernobyl events as well as the growing roar of the newly declassified data on the radionuclide contamination of vast territories in the former union. The natural peculiarities of Kazakhstan, its mountainous landscapes, and numerous deposits of diverse ores, including radioactive and, of course, the nuclear tests which were conducted for many years necessitate large- scale radio-ecological research. Today, there is every reason to regard the radiological conditions in the republic's environment as troubling. This can be confirmed by the data of the brief review of this issue compiled predominantly on the basis of current newspaper materials presented on the pages which follow. Unfortunately, our scientific publications virtually ignore these issues. A similar situation also existed until recently in the former USSR. As Zh. Medvedev noticed in Energiya No. 4, 1991, not a single article appeared about the Chernobyl catastrophe in academic journals, even in Radiobiologiya. The map of the nuclear installations in the former union was published in the first issue of the New York Times of 19-25 Mar 91. The map of nuclear bursts in the republic long promised by the State Committee on the Environment (Ogni Alatau, 25 Sep 91) has not yet been published. Radiation Situation in Kazakhstan Numerous current affairs publications dealing with the nuclear bursts carried out at the test site near Semipalatinsk between 1949 and 1989 have been accumulated in recent years. The so-called ``nuclear shield of the country'' is now known to virtually every citizen of the republic and the former union. Nevertheless, we should focus attention once again on some of the data. According to Vechernyaya Alma-Ata of 11 Feb 92, 1,800,000 ha of land were allocated in the Semipalatinsk oblast for underground and surface nuclear bursts. The radionuclide fission product fallout pattern stretches across numerous inhabited localities and reaches Russia's Altay kray. Given a natural radioactive background of 15-18 �R/h, the maximum total dose on open terrain reached 200 R/h. The territories of the adjacent rayon have been contaminated with fission products dozens of times. A.D. Sakharov said that ``the fallout pattern is one of the principal causes of death, illness, and genetic damage among humans.'' Yet even Chernobyl left its fallout pattern in Kazakhstan territory. China is also making a weighty ``contribution'' to contaminating Kazakhstani soil. The most recent nuclear burst carried out there on 21 May 92 reached 1-2 Mt which exceeds the yield of U.S. and Russian nuclear bursts by severalfold (Izvestiya, 27 May 92). During the period of underground testing, approximately 100 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] of [.sup]239[/]Pu, strontium, cesium, and [.sup]14[/] C and other long-lived isotopes entered the environment (Kazakhstanskaya pravda, 4 Jan 92). During 1961-1969 alone, approximately 38,000 Ci of radioactive strontium and almost 50,000 Ci of cesium entered the Irtysh water and were spread around. As years went by, the soil, vegetation, and water contamination continued to increase. Underground bursts result in the development of camouflets from which radioactive gases seep out and radioactive fragments enter the groundwater. We should keep in mind that for humans, even one fifty-millionth fraction of a Curie is a life-threatening dose. Little is still known about the actual level of environmental contamination from these bursts. In order to paint a realistic picture of contamination, one should take measurements at least every 20 m because of its ``spotty'' pattern throughout. In 1964, a nuclear device was set off in the bed of the shallow Chagan River near the test site which formed a huge crater from which roughly 3.5 million m[.sup]3[/] of ground and ash was ejected, as a result of which a ``nuclear lake'' was formed. Radioactive dust covered an enormous territory with villages, sheep farms, and pastures. In place of snow, black ash covered a territory with an 80-km radius (Izvestiya, 22 Jul 91). Out of the 300 people who were working on the lake at the time, less than 30 survived. The dosage rate on terrain reaches 50,000 �R/h in the areas of traditional cattle grazing and watering. Remote breeding and grazing fields were also contaminated. The concentration of various radionuclides in the milk and meat of agricultural animals exceeds the maximum permissible concentrations (PDK) by hundreds of times according to the report of an interdepartmental commission of the USSR Ministry of Public Health of 17-19 Jul 89. In 1953, a thermonuclear bomb with a 500-kt yield was tested at the test site. The external irradiation dose was enormous (50-60 R/h). Moreover, plutonium isotopes which are a source of alpha particles which are extremely dangerous when ingested into the organism were accumulated in huge quantities. If they enter sex cells, they may lead to birth defects in future generations. Despite the fact that more than 40 years have passed since the start of the early tests at the Semipalatinsk test site, the radiation level at the burst sites remains very high--up to 10,000 �R/h (Gorizont, 2 Nov 91). Approximately 1 million ha of test site lands was returned to circulation in the national economy as suitable for habitation and production of agricultural crops. Yet serious doubts arose in the cleanness of these territories since one cannot rule out the presence of radioactive fragments containing uranium and plutonium in these territories which cannot be detected by existing radiation monitors (Ekspress K, 7 May 92). Nevertheless, animals are still grazing and hay is still being prepared in the areas with a known high radioactivity level even today. Calculations show that on a global scale, the total number of victims from the nuclear tests carried out in the world has reached 1 million and is growing by 200,000-300,000 persons annually (Poisk No. 5, 1991). In his monograph ``Uranium and Life in the History of the Earth'' (Uran i zhizn v istorii Zemli), S. Neruchev wrote in 1982 that three periods of increasing uranium accumulation intensity can be identified in the history of man-caused activity in the world. When these are compared to the history of mankind, one can note extended slowdowns in the development of civilization which coincided with the start of these periods and were accompanied by a decline in culture. In the author's opinion, the anthropological type of the people changed during the radioactivity periods! So what will Chernobyl, Semipalatinsk, Southern Urals, Novaya Zemlya, etc. bring to mankind? In the ``earth-plant-animals-human'' ecological chain, soil is the principal link of radioactive contamination. Furthermore, the most biologically dangerous radionuclide of artificial origin (especially [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs) are even multiplying in Kazakhstani soils. This is the opinion of the expert from the Kazakhstani Hydrometeorological Service (Ekspress K, 28 Nov. 91). They began a careful investigation of the soil in the republic. By the way, we still do not have the maximum permissible concentrations for radioactive contamination of the soil. Russia's Law of social Protection of Citizens extends to a radionuclide soil contamination at levels exceeding 1 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. Fifteen such administrative territories have been identified in Russia (Argumenty i fakty Nos. 16-17, 1992). Yet the public in Belarus and Ukraine are insisting that this level be lowered. As we know, the soil is saturated with living organisms. They amount to 90-99% of the zoological mass in land ecosystems. Many of these forms are highly sensitive to the effect of radiation and may store radionuclides [1]. It has been established that long-living soil invertebrates (earthworms, Dingoflagellata ticks, certain insect larvae, etc.) are prospective bioindicators of radioactive contamination [2]. An examination of the Semipalatinsk oblast soils carried out by the above experts demonstrated the presence of man-made radionuclides in all selected samples (from a depth of 5-20 cm) in five areas under study. It turned out that [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr contamination exceeds the global background by 1.5-8.5 times. At the same time, surface radioactivity in these areas is within the natural norm. Earlier, in Sept- Oct 1990, the Ukrainian corporation Protiy together with the Northern Ukrainian Geology Production Geological Association and the Environmental Problems Center at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences completed activities in radio-ecological assessment of the Semipalatinsk test site soils and the affected area with a territory of 200,000 km[.sup]2[/] (see figure). A number of abnormally high radioactivity patterns related to the test site entities, i.e., surface burst craters, test boreholes, drifts, etc., where the [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination density reaches 50-100 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] in some areas within a 5-cm soil layer was discovered within the test site on an area of 11,000 km[.sup]2[/]. Thus, two independent expert studies confirm that the test site soils are contaminated while radioactivity from man-made sources is distinguished by its high ability to accumulate in living organisms. [.sup]90[/]Sr affects primarily the hematopoietic and osseous tissue while [.sup]137[/] Cs--soft tissues and especially the sexual sphere which has its impact on posterity. Figure Uranium mines are other sources of radiation which contaminate the environment in Kazakhstan. The issue of the republic's uranium industry which supplied more than 40% of uranium to the former USSR became open for the first time after publication of V. Ponomarev's article ``Uranium Empire'' (Gorizont, Jan-Feb 92). Exploration of uranium deposits began in the republic in the 1950s. By 1985, the number of oblasts associated with uranium extraction reached nine. Radioactive waste from this production is being dumped into quarries, dumps, trenches, lake shores, and reservoir banks. At the same time, a serious ecological danger of sulfuric acid discharges arises since uranium recovery from molybdenum and phosphorus ores is realized by treating them with sulfuric acid. Hence the so-called acid rains. Uranium mining productions are periodically experiencing emergencies. As a result of such activities in Chimkent oblast, e.g., 2,600 open pits were formed and numerous cases of epizootic cattle disease were recorded. Moreover, this oblast did not escape nuclear tests. One such test was carried out in 1973. Elevated terrain radioactivity may be attributed to radiation anomalies. For example, more than 100 such anomalies have been discovered in Ust- Kamenogorsk. In the city itself, areas with a gamma-radiation dose reaching 7,000 �R/h have been discovered (Ekspress K, 8 Jan 92). It became known rather recently that the natural radioactivity background may vary within a broad range due to the radon gas escaping from the earth as a result of the uranium and thorium decay. According to 1990 data, up to 15,000 people die annually in the former USSR due to radon-caused cancer (Meditsinskaya gazeta, 30 Mar 90). We know from foreign press releases that approximately 20,000 deaths related to this gas are recorded annually in the United States. In Sweden, 4,600 buildings have been declared inhabitable as of 1989 due to the high radioactivity resulting from the release of radon. In France, the radon level in a number of provinces exceeds the radiation level by 40 times. Radon is released from the rock and enters the rooms with building materials or from the soil on which the building stands. It largely accumulates in unventilated rooms. In our mountainous republic, unfortunately, no serious attention has been given to the radon problem. On the other hand, mandatory testing of all inert building materials was introduced recently in Kazakhstan (Ekspress K, 24 Mar 92). It has been established that an increase in the radon concentration in the inhaled air affects the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland and causes shifts in the entire organism. During these surges of the radon concentration, approximately 30% of the population experienced a sense of alarm, heartbeat, hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. Radon begins to escape actively from the rock when it is subjected to alternating compression and tension during perturbations of the geomagnetic field. This led to speculations that the state of human health is affected not as much by the magnetic storms themselves as by the radon released from the ground and building materials induced by them. Thus, the mountainous landscape in Kazakhstan makes its own contribution to the radiation conditions in the environment. Finally, one more facet of the problem is associated with the radioactive waste and the so-called ``burials.'' Today, more than 17,000 sources of ionizing radiation have been recorded in the republic of which 11,000 are in Alma-Ata. A pavement area with a radiation level exceeding 500,000 �R/h was discovered in the city (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 10 Sep 91). There is no place to dispose of the dangerous soil. The only burial in the republic--at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Kazakhstani Academy of Sciences--has been shut down. This prompted preparations to the development of a network of regional stations for burying substances emitting ionizing radiation (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 22 Apr 92). Speaking about the problems of animal radio-ecology, it would make sense to emphasize that against the backdrop of a certain heightening in the interest in the health and social conditions of the persons living in the elevated radiation zone on the part of the public and the republican government (thus far, we have been talking only about the Semipalatinsk test site zone), the study of the animal as well as plant life has been nonexistent from this viewpoint. Yet it is quite obvious that no matter how accurate radiation monitoring is for measuring radioactivity in contaminated territories, the principal criteria for its assessment are still the biological indicators. Only the living organisms, their reaction, and status may impart biological sense in the most precise physical measurements and give an answer about the suitability of the environment for habitation. Objectives of Radio-ecological Studies of Animals Animal radio-ecology is one of the most recent branches of general radio-ecology. It entails a study of the effect of ionizing radiation from radionuclides introduced into natural biogeocenosis on the animal populations, their communities, and individual organisms [3]. To date, several animal radio-ecology trends have developed: - determination of the qualitative and quantitative radionuclide distribution in animal organisms; - a study of the changes in the structure and dynamics of animal populations and communities living under the conditions of elevated radiation background - and identification of the specific features and long-term consequences of the effect of external and internal (from incorporated radioactive elements) irradiation on the animal organism. Principal attention is given by scientists to the first two trends, e.g., by such domestic researchers as R.M. Aleksakhin, A.I. Ilyenko, D.A. Krivolutskiy, V.Ye. Sokolov, et al. They analyzed the extensive materials published in the form of reviews, monographs, and collections [4, 5, 6]. These publications can serve as ground-breaking sources for formulating approaches to identifying the necessary objectives in studying the ecology of land vertebrates. Foreign sources are not replete with publications in the field of radio-ecology of free living organisms which is probably due to a more orderly radio-ecological situation there than here. A study of the animal organism proper freely living in nature at a molecular, cellular, and systemic levels remains the weakest link in animal radioecology. The diversity of the animal life which includes rare and endangered species and the multicomponent and variable origin of the natural effects as well as the geographical and the climatic differences in the habitats impose their peculiarities on the course of metabolic processes and the level of various biochemical components of the organism. Certain difficulties for researchers are due to the need to capture a sufficient quantity of animals and acquire vast volumes of similar data for mathematical processing. Prior to the events brought about by Chernobyl, the radiobiologists' principal efforts were aimed at the main mechanisms of the course of acute radiation syndrome, i.e., the effect of high radiation doses. Animal radio-ecology presupposes a study of the biological efficiency of low radiation levels since in areas with very high radiation doses, a study of low irradiation doses of low intensity under a prolonged (chronic) impact becomes a priority. Yet the effects of low doses are usually manifested to a lesser extent in contrast to high doses which can be easily reproduced experimentally on laboratory animals. The negative consequences of chronic low doses are accumulated little-by-little and cannot be easily recorded. Furthermore, as stated at the First All-Union Radiobiological Congress (Moscow, August 1989), we feel the insufficient development of accessible efficient methods of indication of the radiation reaction of various organisms and of the arsenal of biological radiation monitoring. There is very little theoretical and practical knowledge about the radionuclide distribution in vegetative and animal organisms and the specific features of the radionuclide contamination of the biocenoses. In the past, a viewpoint about complete safety of low radiation doses figured prominently. Eventually, it became clear that the response to the effect of low doses may turn out to be completely unpredictable. New data on the effect of low radiation doses on humans and animals began appearing in scientific literature only recently. This was also prompted by the Chernobyl catastrophe. Yet it is impossible to replicate the Chernobyl or Semipalatinsk conditions in model experiments, so consequently, their genetic and biological impact is unpredictable. It must be examined directly in the [affected] areas. Moreover, in ecologically troubled areas, the effect of radionuclides is often compounded by the chemical and physical factors of diverse origins. Their combination may result in a nonlinear ecological impact (synergism) which greatly exceeded the harm caused by these factors separately. The problem of synergism of radionuclides and chemical agents assumed a global scale, yet until recently, it has not been explored sufficiently. It is well known that a definitive conclusion about the status of the animal organism's vital activity calls for a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach which is similar to the study of the human organism. Such experiments are based on an examination of diverse systems (circulatory, nervous, muscular, etc.) and structural-functional and metabolic processes at a subcellular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organism level using the methods of biochemistry, physiology, hematology, immunology, molecular biology, as well as environmental indicator methods such as morphometry and morphophysiology. It has been uniformly agreed that the cell containing the genetic material is the decisive link in the reactions of multicellular biological systems to the radiation exposure. It is also beyond doubt that the principal targets of the low radiation doses are the biological membranes which regulate the interrelation between the cell and the environment. Radiobiologists are constantly searching for the methods of biological indication of the effect of ionizing radiation and its quantitative assessments. The solution to this problem is considered from the viewpoint of various cytogenetic, biochemical, immunological, hematological, and biophysical criteria. The principal requirements imposed on the bioindicators of the radiation exposure include the dependence of the effect on the irradiation dose, the sensitivity and specificity, universality and suitability of any organism populations for analysis as well as the simplicity and quickness of the methodological approach used. Chromosomal analysis [7] is regarded as a routine method of quantitative assessment of the radiation dose (as an additional method for physical radiation monitoring data). The cellular pattern of the bone marrow and the micronuclear test [8] are often used for indicating the radiation effects. Determination of the lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood [9] is regarded as promising. A study of the organism of the animals which inhabit the contaminated territories is not limited to formulating the specific test systems. The interdisciplinary approach presupposes a search for the peculiar features and patterns in the process of animal adaptation to the chronic irradiation conditions, manifestations of the relative radiostability of the individuals and the species as a whole, and the possibility of predicting the impact of radiation exposures. The use of adequate control animal populations whose interspecific characteristics are similar and who inhabit the areas which are the closest with respect to the climatic and geographic parameters is an extremely important condition for attaining objectivity in analyzing the resulting data. The fauna of the radiologically unfavorable Kazakhstan regions also calls for specifically zoological observations as one of the most important aspects of the biological variation monitoring in the populations of wild animals. Yet the vast areas of the Semipalatinsk zone as well as many other similarly unfavorable regions in the republic remain outside the sphere of the zoologists' inquiry. Two months after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, the Belarussian researchers conducted observations of the population of small mammals and other animals. They discovered that the number of wolves and forest ferrets declined by fivefold and that of foxes and mouse-like rodents--by twofold. The males of field mice developed excessively hypertrophied testes and thyroid glands [10]. Among the birds, ducks, loons, snipes, and woodcocks were the most contaminated ones. Their principal nutrition are animal benthos, land and soil invertebrates living near the water, macrophytes, and pasture vegetation which, it turned out, accumulate radionuclides [11]. Between 1986 and 1988, 218 wild farmed and hunted mammals were examined within a 30-km zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It was established that the highest [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134 [/] Cs and [.sup]137[/]Cs concentration was in the organs and tissues of wild pigs and foxes which was followed in the decreasing order of concentration by gazelle, deer, moose, and wolf. In young animals, the [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration in the muscles was higher than that in the adults. On the organ-by-organ basis, the nuclide accumulation peaks in the liver and kidneys, the average levels are found in the lungs and muscles, and the minimum--in the wool. No differences between accumulation in the males and females was detected. The relationship between the type of animal nutrition and the level of radionuclides in the tissues was identified [12]. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident not only prompted the study of the flora and fauna on the affected territories which is attested to by the international conference dealing with the biological aspects of its consequences held in September 1990 but also facilitated the development of urgent tasks in the fields of radiation genetics [13] and radiation immunology [14]. New trends are being developed in the area of radiation biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology associated with low doses and long-term consequences of radioecological disasters. In a similar vein, the Radiobiology Laboratory of the Zoology Institute at the Kazakhstani Republic Academy of Sciences has been focusing its efforts since 1991 on the issues of studying the organisms and populations of animals inhabiting the natural zones of Kazakhstan with an elevated and natural radioactivity background. The efforts are being carried out using the populations of wild rodents which, as we know, are characterized by their high number, uniform distribution, and frequent succession of generations. For these reasons, these entities have been commonly accepted for solving the tasks of animal ecology and radioecology [15, 16], while the greatest diversity of radiation effects [17] is noted among the rodents of the mouse species. Even the early data which we obtained from the rodents inhabiting the area adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site provide new and original information and are stimulating interest. In the Chagan River valley where the surface background appears normal (13-15 �R/h), the soil contamination measured with the help of a gamma-spectrometer was higher than the global level and reached 3.5 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. The forest mouse (39 animals) were the most common among the 70 animals representing eight species trapped over this territory. A study of this population revealed an extreme nonuniformity with respect to a number of morphophysiological features, e.g., a high variation coefficient. The animals differed most significantly with respect to their morphometric parameters and cellularity indices of the bone marrow. With respect to these characteristics, adult mice could be clearly divided into two groups. In the first group, the animals had a higher level of bone marrow cellularity and had a greater mass, body length, and tail length. All distinctions are statistically significant. At the same time, it was discovered that one of the most important parenchymatous organs, such as the liver, had an elevated functional activity in the individuals with higher bone marrow indicators which was judged by the activity of a broad range of enzymes used in clinical tests of its status. The cytogenetic studies of the bone marrow cells of the animals under study made it possible clearly to record an elevated chromosomal aberration level. From among the 282 cells examined in the metaphase, 6.74% had various types of aberrations. Yet it is known that as a norm, the bone marrow of mammals contains between 0 and 2% of aberrant cells, depending on the species and age. Based on this, one can draw the conclusion that the significant increase in this indicator among the rodents who for a long time inhabited the area of the former nuclear tests discovered by us directly attests to the serious impairments in their genetic system. Many of the rodents under study were characterized by a large number of erythrocytes in the blood. A leftward shift of the differential blood count, i.e., a predominance of young neutrophile forms over the mature ones, was common to all animals. The fact that there is a change in the red and white blood count under the effect of ionizing radiation is commonly accepted today and is regarded as one of the principal criteria of its biological effect [5]. In our case, the variability of these interesting indicators may determine the extent of long-ranging consequences of nuclear testing among the inhabitants of the affected territories and their adaptation reactions. Activities in the test site area are continuing. In addition to the specifically radio-ecological effects, an analysis of even the early experiments reveals noticeable interspecific and sex-age differences for a broad range of biochemical indicators which is of interest from the viewpoint of understanding the specific features of the rodent organism activity. Such a cellular-tissue approach to studying wild animals is promising for solving the problems of comparative radiosensitivity, radioadaptation, and synergism phenomena and as a whole--for constructing models for predicting the vital activity of populations under varying extreme conditions. In conclusion, we should note that zoologists specializing in all areas must start studying the problems of animal radio-ecology of Kazakhstan in all directions of this field of science. There is no doubt that only a complex of large-scale scientific research activities may become the basis for successfully solving all urgent problems. Bibliography 1. D.A. Krivolutskiy.
