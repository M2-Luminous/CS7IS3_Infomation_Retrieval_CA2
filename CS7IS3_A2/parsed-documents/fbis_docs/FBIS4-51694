[passage omitted on attendance] Than Shwe expressed his pleasure at meeting the trainees and said that the trainees need to act as full-fledged USDA members. He explained in establishing an organization, the structure, procedures, rules and regulations, and programs of the organization have to be drawn up. He said if these structure and procedures only exist on paper and the organization members do not understand these procedures and structure, they will not be able to successfully implement organization programs. He said the training course on objectives, rules and regulations, and programs, of the organization is to enable the executive members to systematically implement, manage, and organize USDA programs. Than Shwe said the central level of the organization would not be able to operate extensively at the grassroots level, and that the course is to enable regional leaders to extensively operate as full-fledged members at the grassroots levels. He explained that the training course is being held to enable executive members to coordinate work systematically among themselves at various levels so that they would not carry out programs on their own initiative. He said the course will systematically train them in office and organizational work. The trainees would also be taught in areas of general knowledge, he said. Than Shwe explained that the courses would be conducted by cabinet ministers, directors general, and managing directors and called on the trainees to study and observe subjects to be taught and to ask questions if they do not understand. [passage omitted] He said once the course is completed, the trainees are to carry out organizational work in their regions and that they need to study in order to master their tasks. He explained that although the USDA is a social organization, they need to master organizational work because if they cannot effectively carry out organization work, their organization would fall apart. Therefore, he urged the trainees to study the curriculum seriously so that they can put it into practice. Than Shwe explained that following the events of 1988, there has been a switch from a one-party system to a multiparty one, and the economic system has been changed to a market economy. He said the USDA is a social organization, which together with the Defense Services, will provide guidance to ensure that the union, which is formed by all national races, remains stable and peaceful. He said the SLORC is currently holding the National Convention, which is aimed at developing a firm state constitution. He said the new constitution would emerge when the time comes and a new nation would then emerge. He added that the SLORC is working for national reconciliation. He explained that there had been no national solidarity and stability and peace in the country since independence. That was why armed organizations in the jungle are being invited to return to the legal fold. The invitation is being extended not because we have difficulties, but because we would like to carry out development projects in areas where the armed organizations have returned to the legal fold and where national races previously had no rights to economic development, health, education, and social development. He said there has been considerable success in introduction of the market economy and that the rate of economic growth was 10.9 percent in 1992-93 and 6 percent in 1993-94. He said efforts would be made to maintain this growth to improve the living standards of everyone, including workers and peasants. He said that while we should strive for political stability and national unity, we should also work for economic progress. He said there should be harmony at the executive organizations at various levels under the leadership of the central organization, in striving to successfully implement the objectives of the organization. In conclusion, he called on the trainees to seriously study the subjects taught in the course. The ceremony ended at 0925. [passage omitted]
