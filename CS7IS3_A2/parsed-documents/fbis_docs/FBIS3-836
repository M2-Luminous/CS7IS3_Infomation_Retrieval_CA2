A new cabinet was supposed to take office today, with members drawn from the interim government, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], just like the council itself, and although that has been delayed, the council has taken important decisions over the currency and over the control of Liberia's natural resources. Miss Nii Nartey Alison reports in this telex from Monrovia: The Transitional Council declared both the old and the new $5 notes legal tender throughout Liberia. Until today's proclamation, the old bank note known as the J.J. -- because it bears the picture of Liberia's first president, J.J. Roberts -- had been primarily used in areas controlled by Charles Taylor's NPFL. The new note, the Liberty, has on its face the seal of the Republic of Liberia and had been the legal tender in areas controlled by the former interim government of Amos Sawyer. Prior to the civil war, the J.J. was the medium of exchange, but it was declared illegal by Sawyer's government when it was discovered that most bank notes in the country had been looted. The move, however, was resisted by Charles Taylor. He declared the Liberty illegal in his enclave. The council also declared that the National Transitional Government had full authority over the country's mineral resources and that only people designated by the state council could engage in the export of minerals. This proclamation is clearly designed to stop the NPFL and ULIMO from exploiting the natural resources within areas they occupy. Meanwhile, the induction of cabinet ministers is due to be held today, but it appears that the controversial posts of ministers of foreign affairs, defense, justice, and finance have not yet been resolved. Appointees of the NPFL yesterday failed to show up at a breakfast time confirmation hearing. Instead, they flew to Gbarnga by helicopter for consultations. [Later in the cast, BBC World Service in English adds the following: "The new transitional council in Liberia has dissolved the three armed factions involved in the four-year civil war and the previous interim government. Although all five council members signed the decree, the two ULIMO members immediately issued a press statement saying it was a violation of last year's peace agreement. They said it was the institutions set up by the factions that were meant to be dissolved, not the factions themselves. The council, which was sworn in last week to guide the country to free elections, also declared all natural resources under its authority. A BBC correspondent in Monrovia said the clause is clearly designed to stop the former factions from extracting taxes and export duties for themselves. The council was expected to install its cabinet ministers today."]
