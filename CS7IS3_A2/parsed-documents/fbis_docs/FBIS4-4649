FBIS4-4649 "dreas064_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 South Korea Wider Market Opening for U.S. Cars Planned Wider Market Opening for U.S. Cars Planned SK0204002394 Seoul YONHAP in English 2328 GMT 1 Apr 94 SK0204002394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Seoul is planning wider market opening to American automobiles and planning to start negotiations with the United States, trade officials said Saturday. The measure comes as Washington showed readiness to launch a full-scale drive into the South Korean market with a warning of invoking 301 trade provision against Seoul. The U.S. National Trade Estimate (NTE) made available Friday criticized Seoul's formal and informal barriers that have "virtually closed Korea's 1.1 million-unit passenger car market to U.S.-built motor vehicle exports." Initial plans include gradually lowering the import tariff from the current 10 percent to around 7.5 percent, the officials said. An inter-ministerial meeting led by vice trade, industry and resources minister is planned on Monday to set the details. The government will start first with improving non-tariff barriers, such as active public message that the government will not impose disadvantages to those buying foreign cars, allowing more and larger show rooms and giving air time for advertisements during prime time slots. These issues are likely to be tabled formally at a meeting between South Korean Trade Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor this month during the signing period of the Uruguay Round [UR] agreement in Morocco, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry has been the main opposer but very recently agreed to consider the auto market opening more positively, according to the officials. Seoul and Washington had agreed to address the issue at the minister level during last December's bilateral UR negotiations. This agreement is included in their record of understanding. U.S. requests include import tariff reduction schedule, revision to the current local tax system where taxes are levied according to engine size, consequently working against larger American models. Washington officials suggest levying taxes according to the level of fuel efficiency instead of engine size. The NTE points out that imported cars in South Korea accounted for only 0.2 percent of Korea's market in 1933. The blatant anti-import campaign of the mid-1980s has waned but similar signals still continue, the report said. "Korea's duty of 10 percent compares highly unfavorably to the 2.5 percent duty assessed Korean automobiles entering the United States," it said. "The U.S. objective is to ensure that U.S. motor vehicles have the same access to the Korean market as Korean motor vehicles have to the U.S. market," it said.
