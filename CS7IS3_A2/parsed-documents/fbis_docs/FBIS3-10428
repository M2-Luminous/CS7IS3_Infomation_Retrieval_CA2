[Begin recording] [Reporter] What information do you have on the explosion at the bridge over the San Juan River? [Unidentified DIDE spokesperson] Once more the URNG has attacked Guatemalan society. This time they have blown up the San Juan Bridge located at the 20-kilometer marker on the highway to the Atlantic area. For the time being, the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers is working in the area to put a Bailey bridge in place. This Bailey bridge costs 2,530,562 quetzales, and repairs to the bridge that was blown up will cost approximately 5 million quetzales. This ungrateful action by the URNG will cost Guatemalans 7,530,652 quetzales. In addition, the action involves costs in the economic, business, and transportation sectors, as well as the threat and danger posed to the Guatemalan people at the time of the explosion. The Guatemalan people are still running a risk while the bridge is being repaired. [Reporter] What type of explosives were used this time? [DIDE spokesperson] The information we have is that strong dynamite charges were used. [Reporter] How long will it take the Army engineers to repair the damage? [DIDE spokesperson] In this case, the URNG destroys while the Army builds. The Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers is setting up the Bailey bridge at this time. Traffic will be restored at approximately 1700 today, but it will take another 48 hours for the bridge to be fully operational. [Reporter] Why did the URNG blow up this bridge? [DIDE spokesperson] Right now we don't know. I don't think that is really important. What is important is that with this action, the URNG is showing how much respect it has for Guatemalans' human rights. [Reporter] What do you think of the URNG's blowing up this bridge in Guatemala while holding peace talks in Mexico? [DIDE spokesperson] This is very contradictory. While it is attending negotiations and holding talks for the benefit of all Guatemalans, at the same time it is acting against our society. The truth is that it is very regrettable. Guatemala is no longer willing to tolerate such actions. Actually, the damage to our country goes beyond all estimates. [Reporter] On another subject, how about the fire early this morning in the former military hospital? [DIDE spokesman] A fire began at about 0200 at the former military hospital in Zone 10. The fire was controlled at 0500. We still do not know the origin of this fire, but it started at the former administrative office, which was destroyed. It was a very old and deteriorated building. That is why the military hospital was transferred to the new building at Zone 17. [Reporter] Was anyone in the building at the time? [DIDE spokesperson] There was no one there. [Reporter] What are the damage estimates? [DIDE spokesperson] The fire was early this morning, and personnel are currently evaluating the condition of the rest of the building. Reporters wanted to enter this morning, but we are first verifying the condition of the building before anyone is allowed in. [Reporter] On another subject, have there been any armed confrontations between the Army and the guerrillas? [DIDE spokesperson] I do not have any information to that effect at the moment, but there were no confrontations on Saturday or Sunday. [end recording]
