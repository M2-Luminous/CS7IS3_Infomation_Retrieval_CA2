The "Happiness Project" aims to help improve the living conditions and the health of farmers, particularly those in remote and poverty-stricken districts. The welfare foundation, a non-governmental organization headed by Chinese celebrities, plans to raise funds from around the country and abroad. Donations are to go toward providing equipment and training to farmers. The foundation also plans activities to challenge the traditional concepts that favor large families and encourage rural families to have fewer and healthier children. State Councillor Peng Peiyun, who is also minister of the State Family Planning Commission, said the government will support the project and called on social institutes and individuals to donate or volunteer their time to the effort. Some rural families, especially those in economically depressed districts, often have more children, particularly boys, to help with field work and support the family. It is a common scene that the poorer a family, the more children it has. Peng pointed out that family planning work must be integrated with improvement of living standards and expansion of social welfare services. She said greater publicity and educational activities should be carried out to teach farmers about advanced production techniques and the state family planning policy.
