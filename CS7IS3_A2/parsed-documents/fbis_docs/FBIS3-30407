Negotiations on European Union's proposal to proclaim Mostar an open city under the protectorate of one of the European states lasted for several days in the UNPROFOR base in Medjugorje, and they were attended by Owen and Stoltenberg's special envoy. Klaric informed General Cot yesterday that the delegation of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] demanded that Mostar be the capital of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna offering that the European Union protectorate only be in the part of the city currently controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina army. The Muslims could not accept this Croat proposal and the negotiations broke down, Klaric informed Gen. Cot.
