"Realising that the ardent desire of journalists to cover the work of our parliament reflects the Russian society's interest in its proceedings, we are doing our best to create proper conditions for the press," she stressed, adding that "this task is far from easy so far". The duty of the Russian parliament's press service "is to provide journalists, in keeping with the press law, with all the information they need". "The Press Centre has been provided with several rooms within the building of the former Council of Mutual Economic Assistance, where the State Duma will be housed, including the smaller conference hall, which will be switched on to the television and radio relaying systems," Lantseva said. "However, these premises will hardly be sufficient, especially for the work of news services," she added. "The question of whether or not meetings of the parliament will be shown on TV and broadcast across the country, as it was the case with the former Supreme Soviet, is to be decided by the MPs themselves," Lantseva noted. The Press Centre is drawing up proposals for contacts with the "Ostankino" TV company and the Russian Television. Today, the press service, which consists of less than ten officials, is preparing equipment and other facilities for the future Press Centre. Accreditation cards have been ordered and will soon be received in Moscow. The Press Centre plans to issue a reference book, listing parliament members with their photographs and other information, including political likings and number of children, similar to the reference manual used in the German Bundestag. "The question of premises for journalists at the Council of the Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament has not been settled yet," Lantseva said. She said it could be raised only after the press building is transferred to the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly.
