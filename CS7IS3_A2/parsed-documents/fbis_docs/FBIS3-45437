With alterations in the management mechanism, the construction bank will see a lot of changes in its business and this will be effected in two main parts. First, its direct undertaking of policy-oriented business and discount business will be handled in a way of being entrusted by the state development bank. Second, the new management mechanism employed by the construction bank will observe the pattern of a commercial bank featuring responsibility for its own management, risks, for its own profit and loss as well as self discipline. The bank will undertake medium- and long-term credit business with no change in its name or status as an independent legal person while the ranking of the staffing remains unchanged. As of late last year the bank registered total general deposits of RMB 372.2 billion [renminbi] while the balance of various loans was put at RMB 32.9 billion. Following the establishment of a representative office in London, the bank last year also set up such offices in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Singapore while preparations for a branch in New York is now underway.
