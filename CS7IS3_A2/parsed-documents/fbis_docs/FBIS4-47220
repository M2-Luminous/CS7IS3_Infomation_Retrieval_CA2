The State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development has been ordered to make the necessary adjustments in the base rates of the appraised sale value of these rights on the basis of the data of the state statistical service on the overall level of inflation. Heads of local administrations, individuals, and legal entities (excepting state agricultural enterprises) of the republic may be sellers of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land, and citizens of the republic may be buyers. A right of heritable life possession of land is purchased pursuant to Article 48, paragraph 3, of the republic Land Code and point 5 of the president's 24 January 1994 decree "On Certain Aspects of Regulating Land Relations." Legal entities of the republic (excepting state agricultural enterprises) may also purchase the right to use or lease a plot of land. Foreign legal entities and individuals are granted plots of land for temporary use on a lease basis pursuant to the regulation on the procedure for granting the use of land to joint ventures, international associations and organizations, and foreign legal entities and individuals, to perform an activity on the territory of the republic, as set forth in the Supreme Soviet decree dated 3 July 1992. Citizens of the republic are granted without compensation the right of heritable life possession of land to operate a peasant farm or private farm, for market gardening, and for construction of a private dwelling or dacha within the limits of the quota established for the respective use, and the right of heritable life possession of land in excess of those quotas may be purchased from the head of the local administration. Local representative and executive bodies fix the size of plots of land to which individuals may be granted the right of heritable life possession for these purposes without compensation. Individuals who, when the president's 5 April 1994 decree "On Further Improvement of Land Relations" took effect held plots of land whose size exceeds that quota retain in all cases the right of heritable life possession of the portion of the plot of land that exceeds that quota. Individuals who previously acquired heritable life possession of plots of land to operate a peasant or private farm, for market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or dacha may sell to other individuals and legal entities of the republic their right of possession of plots whose size does not exceed the established quota. In cases when the total area of plots of land exceeds that quota, before conducting a sales transaction individuals must buy from the head of the local administration the right of possession of the portion of the plot that exceeds the established quota. Individuals granted land to operate a private farm, for market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or dacha may sell the right of heritable life possession of a portion of the plot. Use of that portion of the plot must conform to current legislation. Individuals and legal entities of the republic who have been granted use of plots of land or have leased them for nonagricultural purposes (except for the purposes of construction of a private dwelling or dacha) may sell that right to individuals and legal entities of the republic only when they have purchased that right from the head of the local administration. On acquiring the right of ownership to immovable property, including unfinished construction projects, the individual or legal entity acquires at the same time, by virtue of the purchase, the right of possession, use, or lease of the plot of land on which the property acquired is located. In case of privatization of immovable nonagricultural property, including unfinished construction projects, the individual or legal entity at the same time acquires the right of use or lease of the plot of land on which the property acquired is located, pursuant to the procedure established in a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 9 March 1994. To conduct a sales transaction, the seller files with the regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development a statement of intent to sell his right to the plot of land and the buyer a statement of his intent to buy that right. The regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development verifies that the landowner or land user has documents certifying the right to use the plot of land, measures more precisely the actual boundaries and area of the plot of land, and also defines the terms of sale of the right and its value. In cases of a discrepancy between the actual size and boundaries of the plot and those indicated in documents, the remeasurement data are duly submitted for consideration and approval of the head of the local administration. The costs related to determining the value and terms of sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land shall be paid by the purchaser at the current unit rates for the jobs performed, payable to the special budget account of the regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development which did the appraisal of these rights. The transaction of the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of a plot of land between the seller and buyer takes the form of a sales contract. The map (sketch) of that plot is appended to the contract. The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease passes from the seller to the buyer when the regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development registers the notarized sales contract. Transactions involving the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land may be conducted provided there are no land disputes concerning the plots and no other impediments to conclusion of the transaction established by legislation. Suits to invalidate the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land are taken up in the courts. When the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land is sold, taxation and collection of the state duty are governed by republic legislation. The notarized sales contract is the basis on which the buyer prepares and duly files the document certifying the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of the plot of land. The purpose for which the plot of land is to be used may not be altered without consent of the head of the local administration. The document issued previously to the seller certifying his right to the plot of land is terminated. The decree has determined the appraised value of the right of heritable life possession of a plot of land for operating a peasant farm. Plots located on land dedicated to agriculture in the steppe and arid-steppe zones in the plains will cost from 28 to 11,100 tenge per hectare, depending on the soil quality rating. Plots located on farmland in the semidesert, desert, and foothill-desert areas are valued between 28 and 2800 tenge per hectare, depending on the soil quality rating. The appraised value of the right of heritable life possession of plots granted for operating a private farm, for construction of a private dwelling or dacha, or for market gardening, including land occupied by structures, is fixed at 300 tenge per 0.01 hectares. The appraised value of the right of heritable life possession of plots of land located within city limits or a zone subject to special urban planning regulation is multiplied by a factor of 1.2 in cities with a population from 100,00 to 250,000; 1.4 when the population is between 251,000 and 500,000; 1.6 when the population is between 501,000 and one million; and 2 when the population exceeds one million. Regional agencies of the State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development have the right to double or reduce by half the appraised value of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of a plot of land depending upon its location, the level of building-service equipment, and the level of public amenities of the area, development of the sector of cultural and everyday services to the public, the level of public health and hygiene, and other factors. The appraised value of the right of use or lease of a plot of land is determined in accordance with the procedure whereby an individual or legal entity acquires the right of use or lease of the plot of land when immovable property for nonagricultural purposes is privatized, as set forth in the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 9 March 1994. Proceeds which heads of local administrations realize from the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of a plot of land shall be credited to the republic budget. Individuals and legal entities transferring the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land as their contribution to authorized capital of joint stock companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with foreign participation, relinquish those rights unless the charters of those organizations stipulate otherwise. The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land is reassigned to the aforementioned joint-stock companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with foreign participation, according to established procedure. The donation or mortgaging of the right of heritable life possession of land by individuals and the mortgaging of the right to use land by legal entities shall conform to the procedure established by the republics's Civil Code and Land Code, and by the Law on Mortgages.
