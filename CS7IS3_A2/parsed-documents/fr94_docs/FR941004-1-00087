FR941004-1-00087 FR941004-1-00018 Section 1357.15(k)␣Baseline Information In paragraph (k) we propose both general and specific requirements for the collection, analysis, and use of planning related information. In section 1357.15(k)(1), we are proposing to require that States and Indian tribes base the development of the CFSP goals, objectives, and funding and service decisions on an analysis of available information on the well-being of children and families; the needs of children and families; the nature, scope, and adequacy of existing child and family and related social services programs; and the trends of these indicators over time. We further propose that additional and updated information must also be obtained throughout the five-year period to annually measure the progress in accomplishing the goals and objectives. We do not require the collection of specific measures or indicators in recognition of the variety of kinds of information available to States and Indian tribes. Paragraph (k)(2) requires the collection of specific information about existing family preservation and family support services, because we believe this information is important, widely available, and central to the CFSP development and implementation process. In §1357.15(k)(3), we are proposing that the CFSP must include the information used in developing the CFSP; an explanation of how the information was used to develop the goals and objectives and to determine the specific services to be provided, the populations to be served, and the geographic areas where services will be available; a description of how information will be used to measure progress annually over the five-year CFSP period; and explanation of how information will be used to facilitate the coordination of services. A variety of sources of information on the well-being of children and families and service delivery capability are available. For example, the local United Way agency, Mayor's Offices, anti-poverty agency, other city/county development offices, academic institutions, and other public and private efforts are sources of information. Many States also participate in the collection of information on families and children in the Voluntary Cooperative Information System (VCIS), the ``Kids Count Data Book'' compiled by the Annie E. Casey Foundation which includes county-by-county profiles. State Health Departments also are sources of information on child fatalities, low birth weight in infants, teen pregnancy, and child/youth suicides as well as State and local initiatives such as Healthy Start. State Education Departments frequently have information on children in special education, drop-outs, and expulsions as well as school-based and after school programs. The Census Bureau, Chamber of Commerce, and the AFDC agency may be sources of data on economic status indicators such as the percent or number of children in poverty, and percent or number of families receiving AFDC, Food Stamps, or medical assistance. States and communities preparing applications for the new funds under the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities Program will also have collected useful data. The SACWIS and AFCARS data will be a useful tool in measuring progress including among other data, information on the status of children placed in foster care and those placed in adoption. An additional data collection system, NCANDS, will report information on child abuse and neglect. When fully operational, these data systems will facilitate the quantification and documentation of the improvements expected and achieved, as well as providing information on the status of the goals and objectives. Because we believe so strongly that baseline information is essential to realistic and meaningful planning, goal setting, and progress measurement and yet recognize the variety of data availability in different States and Indian tribes, we have included some suggestions of possible indicators of child and family well being and service delivery status. Some of those indicators will be useful for setting goals and objectives, some for targeting services geographically and to priority populations, some for detailed service planning, and some for assessing progress. (1) Examples of indicators on child and family well-being: Number of initial reports and substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect, percent of children born addicted or drug exposed, child death rate, incidence of domestic violence, number of children in out-of-home care, number of children in psychiatric placements, number of children awaiting adoption, youth in stable living situations after exiting foster care, and length of time spent in substitute care. (2) Examples of indicators related to other services systems: Percent of low birth-weight babies, percent of births that are to single teens, teen pregnancy rate, immunization rate, percent of children in poverty, percent of children in single-parent families, percent of families receiving AFDC, runaway and homeless youth rate, child/youth suicide rates, juvenile violent crime arrest rate, teen violent death rate, percent teens not in school and not in labor force, percent teens graduating from high school on time, high school dropout rate, and percent of eligible children in Head Start.
