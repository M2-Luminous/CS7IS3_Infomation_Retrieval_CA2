He pointed out that in doing economic work currently, we should keep the overall interests in view, implement central principles and policies in line with specific local conditions, focus on ending the deficits and increasing the profits of state-owned enterprises to promote their reform and development, further consolidate the position of agriculture as the foundation, and facilitate coordinated and healthy development in industrial and agricultural production. During his inspection tour in Jilin, Comrade Zou Jiahua heard reports by responsible comrades of Jilin Province and, accompanied by He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, and Gao Yan, provincial governor, went to Changchun, Jilin, and Liaoyuan to inspect the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Group Company, the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, Liaoyuan Coal Mining Administration, and other large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and several enterprises that had suspended production totally or partially. He also visited peasant households to learn about peasants' lives and their preparation for spring farming. After hearing a report by a responsible comrade of the Jilin Provincial party committee, Comrade Zou Jiahua said: Jilin Province has won good results in economic construction over the past few years. It has achieved fairly rapid development in reform, opening up, and other undertakings, improved people's living standard, and maintained social stability. In improving large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation, in particular, it has adopted some realistic and effective measures to conduct beneficial explorations and experiments. Its ideas and measures for the next step of work are also clear and feasible. Making unremitting efforts, it will certainly see the result of new achievements. Comrade Zou Jiahua pointed out: At present, we should regard state-owned enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises' effort to end deficits and increase profits, as an important link of economic work. Governments at all levels and pertinent departments should make active efforts to provide a good external environment for improving large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, do a good job in investigation and study, give different guidance according to different conditions, and work out specific methods for every enterprise. Enterprises should keep the major target of establishing the socialist market economy system in view and focus on market demand in doing work. The key to this is to make continuous efforts to develop the new products that meet market demand, are of high quality, and yield good economic returns and to reduce production cost and improve efficiency. Enterprises should accelerate their technical transformation, which should be carried out in an orderly manner every year. When conducting technical transformation, they should aim at achieving technological advance and never regard expanding floor space and increasing personnel as their purpose of development or continue to adopt old technology, old measures, and old equipment. To resolve fund shortages, they should not rely merely on higher levels. They should raise funds from various channels, succeed in tapping their own potential, increase the proportion of the funds owned by themselves in the circulating funds, and reduce their reliance of banks as much as possible. Meanwhile, they should properly address the specific difficulties encountered by some enterprise workers in the process of deepening reform to safeguard and stabilize the overall situation. Zou Jiahua emphasized: Industry and agriculture should be developed in a coordinated manner. As the raw material base for industry and the market for industrial products, agriculture and the rural economy, if falling behind in development, will restrict industrial development. In current agricultural development, we should first arrange well the development of basic farm products, such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing seeds. Meanwhile, we should guide the rural economic work in such as way that the rural economy is comprehensively developed and peasants' income increased. We should make overall arrangements for agriculture, rural economy, and peasants' income. When agriculture and rural economy are developed and peasants' income is [words indistinct] increased, industrial development will be promoted. In agricultural production, we should restructure crops, encourage peasants to develop livestock breeding, and greatly develop the intensive processing industry and the township enterprises that use farm products as raw materials while stabilizing the acreage sown to grain, stabilizing grain output, and stabilizing [words indistinct]. We should regard the increase of productivity and per-unit yields as an important link in agricultural development. Zou Jiahua said: China's current economic situation is good. The desire of some localities and some comrades for faster development is good. However, they should guide work according to the law governing economic development. They should proceed from the actual conditions in economic work and the national capacity and select proper priorities of development to make the economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Zou Jiahua urged: Local economic development should be based on specific local conditions. All localities should develop the economy that reflects their own advantages and characteristics; and they should support their own pillar and backbone enterprises. Auto and chemical industries are Jilin's advantageous industries, and black earth is its advantageous resource. In its endeavor of development and construction, it should fully develop these advantages to make them still better. Others accompanying Vice Premier Zou Jiahua during the inspection tour were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission; Zhang Kezhi, deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office; and Li Zibin, vice minister of chemical industry.
