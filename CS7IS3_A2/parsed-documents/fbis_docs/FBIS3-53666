MENA says that this claim is not true. The news agency challenges anyone to prove that it is distributing its casts free of charge upon instruction from any side. Such a move goes against its policies and traditions as an independent media institution with a commercial base. Therefore, it does not provide any media services free whether to a Sudanese or non-Sudanese newspaper, or even to an Egyptian newspaper. The news agency affirms to the Sudanese newspaper that published the report that the Sudanese opposition newspaper has no agreements with MENA to provide it with news reports. Therefore, the Sudanese newspaper's report is part of attempts to discredit Egyptian media. MENA hopes that the Sudanese newspaper will confirm its reports before publishing them so that it will not lose its credibility.
