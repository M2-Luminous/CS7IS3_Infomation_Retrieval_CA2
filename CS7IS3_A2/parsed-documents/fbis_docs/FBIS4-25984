"The capital city is rapidly reaching water scarcity and facing limits to further economic development due to the persistent spell of dry weather," said Teng Shutang, the general-engineer of Beijing Municipal Water Resources Bureau. Meanwhile, the municipal Water Saving Office urged residents and institutions to comply with measures aimed at cutting water consumption, which has been steadily on the rise this year. The office pleaded that an acute water shortage will appear in the next three months, saying the supply exceeded its capacity of 1.04 million tons a day last week as the mercury crept above 30 degrees Celsius. Teng has resorted to shock-therapy in trying to get city residents to understand the depths of the drought. He said Beijing has been heavily relying on its only limited water stored in its two largest reservoirs, the Miyun and Guanting. Both are fed only by annual rainfall. Beijing needs at least 1 billion cubic metres of water from the two reservoirs to meet its basic consumption needs each year, Teng said. This sole water source has been forced to yield an extra 500 million cubic metres of water from its reserves as rainfall has decreased sharply in recent years . "The reserve storage of water will be used up in the next few years without effective water-saving measures with the prolonged scorching weather," Teng warned. "Beijing would be at standstill." The reservoirs have seen their supply depleted with the minuscule precipitation of the last three years: 490 millimeters in 1992, only 420 millimetres in 1993 and even less predicted for this year. Consequently, only 1.6 billion cubic metres were retained in the reservoirs in 1993, less than 24 percent compared with levels in the 1980s. This year only 2.68 billion cubic metres, about half of the Miyun Reservoir's designed storage capacity, was stored. Only 1.6 billion cubic metres of the stored water are available for daily use by the city's more than 6 million dwellers as well as tourists and industries. Further, for years water quality in Guanting has been too poor for drinking, he said.
