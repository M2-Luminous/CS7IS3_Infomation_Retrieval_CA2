The witnesses, contacted by telephone did not give details of casualties or damage in the raids in the Ta'izz region, some 150 kilometres (93 miles) northwest of the key southern stronghold of Aden. Southern officials said their troops had pushed back an offensive on the port city, formerly the capital of South Yemen. On Monday a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said southern units were in retreat toward Aden, and troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had reached Darb al-'Amr, just five kilometres (three miles) from the city, having broken through the last southern defences. But Aden residents said the city was calm with no sign of battle on the outskirts. A resident of Sanaa meanwhile said families were leaving the capital in large numbers, bound for villages or the mountains. Southern forces fired two Scud missiles at Sanaa Monday.
