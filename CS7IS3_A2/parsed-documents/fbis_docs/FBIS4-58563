[Shahid] Good morning. [Giesbert] I guess you are quite thrilled this morning, aren't you? [Shahid] Certainly. [Giesbert] Are you thrilled by history in the making? [Shahid] In any case, it is a historic day. A page which is being turned. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Do you feel like thanking Shimon Peres this morning on Europe 1? [Shahid] Yes, yes, yes. In any case, I would like to pay homage to him because I believe that, of all the men who negotiated, he is the one who had -- who has -- a vision of Israel in time of peace, Israel after the Cold War, and I hope that it is this particular vision that will prevail, because up against it, there is another military vision of Israel that still exists within the government. We shall see which one will prevail. [Giesbert] And what do you make of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister? [Shahid] I believe that Yitzhak Rabin was brave when he followed Peres' plan to integrate Israel into the Middle East. [Giesbert] He said what had to be said, didn't he? [Shahid] Yes, he said what had to be said. I hope he will have the courage to continue because this agreement is now faced with the text that has to be implemented. We must not forget that there are many difficulties remaining. There are 120,000 settlers still there, and Mr. Rabin still insists that they should be kept in the territories even though they are risking their own safety. I believe that there many other tests ahead for Mr. Rabin, and I hope he will continue on the way he has started. It is the only way for his people to survive; that is, in peace with their neighbors. [Giesbert] You were talking about dangers, Layla Shahid. But who do you actually fear most? Tell us now, without any jargon. Are you more afraid of the hysterical Israeli settlers or the frantic fundamentalists, the religious fanatics of Hamas? [Shahid] I am afraid of both for different reasons. I am afraid of Palestinian fundamentalists because they support a kind of society I do not support. However, they have everything to gain from peace, namely normal, healthy and free life, and I believe that they will accept the rules of the game, but I am even more afraid of the settlers because they have everything to lose, namely the territory where they live and their special status, and I believe that they will use all possible means to sabotage this peace, but, unfortunately, this is a problem and a duty for the Israeli Government, not for ours. [Giesbert] A Palestinian transitional government will now manage what we call the Palestinian entity until the general elections. How will those Palestinians chosen for the transition be appointed? Will there be people from the Hamas Movement, for instance? [Shahid] They will be appointed in a balanced way between inside and outside the occupied territories to start with. [Giesbert] Do you mean that there will be people from the Hamas Movement? [Shahid] It is possible, if they agree to be responsible for the administration of this territory, yes, why not. They represent a political strength in Palestinian society. It would be stupid politically to try to marginalize them. We have seen what this led to in a country like Algeria. However, the most important ... [Giesbert, interrupting] But they will not work towards peace, will they? [Shahid] That is not obvious. I believe that, in any case, all political forces must be given a chance in a democratic fashion, whether they belong to the right or the left. However, the most important thing is the way the blending between the inside and the outside will take place. This transitional government will probably be balanced with 50 percent PLO leaders and 50 percent local leaders, and I believe the most important thing is the preparation of the elections, which will take place in the autumn since we have missed the date scheduled for July. People will decide through their votes who they want as their representatives. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Layla Shahid, thank you, good luck, have a nice day. [Shahid] Thank you.
