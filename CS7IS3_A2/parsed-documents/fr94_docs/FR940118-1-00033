In any proceeding for the distribution of satellite carrier royalty fees, the Copyright Office shall not require the filing by claimants of tangible fixations of works in whole or in part. In the event that a controversy concerning the actual fixation of a work in a tangible medium of expression as required by the Copyright Code, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel conducting the distribution proceeding shall resolve such controversy on the basis of affidavits by appropriate operational personnel and other appropriate documentary evidence, and by such oral testimony as the Panel may deem necessary. Affidavits submitted by claimants should establish that the work for which the claim was submitted was fixed in its entirety, and should state the nature of the work, the title of the program, the duration of the program, and the date of fixation. No such affidavits need be filed with a CARP unless requested by that Panel. §257.6 Separate claims required. If a party intends to file claims for both cable compulsory license and satellite carrier compulsory license royalty fees during the same month of July, that party must file separate claims with the Copyright Office. Any single claim which purports to file for both cable and satellite carrier royalty fees will be dismissed. 28.
