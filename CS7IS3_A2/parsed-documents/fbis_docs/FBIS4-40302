Apart from representatives of the ministries and departments concerned, delegates from consumer societies from various Russian cities took part. Not only medics are concerned about the noticeably growing mortality of Russians as a result of injuries and poisoning: up 2.35 times over the past six years. For instance, in 1993, 51,000 people died of alcohol poisoning -- 4.3 times more than in 1987. Many consumer goods are becoming rather a menace. Our country is turning into a dump where foodstuffs, consumer goods, and household electronics are being brought from all over the world which do not meet accepted safety standards, with expired shelf life dates. Our own producers are also notorious enough. Many departmental laboratories have been closed "for economic reasons." If a traditional wholesale merchandiser refuses to take a dubious lot, it can be disposed of through small distributors. Cunning entrepreneurs have found ways around bans and obstacles put up by standardization and quality control bodies. What is to be done? Experts with organizations and establishments concerned, primarily the Russian Consumers' Union, consider it necessary to draft a federal program for three years and under this program create a state system to monitor the quality and safety of goods and services, based on a package of laws and government resolutions establishing safety norms for goods and services.... The project proposed by experts is good in all respects, even the idea of financing the federal program from an insurance fund with contributions from suppliers of potentially hazardous goods. Of course, money from the treasury is also needed.... But the main thing is clear: If Duma deputies like the draft, they will put it into action without a second's hesitation, taking a major step towards consumers' aspirations. And will thus justify this parliament's right to exist.
