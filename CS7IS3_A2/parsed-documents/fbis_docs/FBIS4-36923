Referring the recent 'LE POINT' allegations, the embassy said such unfounded reports and commentaries are printed in some Western papers with "quite clear objectives." The embassy in its statement said Iran's clear stance concerning the current developments in the brotherly Republic of Yemen cannot be misportrayed through such propaganda. The Islamic Republic of Iran supports a united Yemen, and hopes that present disputes would be settled peacefully, it said. "National sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of Yemen should be respected in any solution," the statement said.
