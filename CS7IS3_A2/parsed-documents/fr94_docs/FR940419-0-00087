PART 1510_SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS, AND OTHER DESCRIPTIONS 4. Part 1510 is amended by adding section 1510.011&hyph;80 to read as follows: 1510.011&hyph;80 Annual Certification. The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.210&hyph;80 in Superfund solicitations and contracts in excess of the small purchase limitation, where the solicitation or contract does not include EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, Alternate I, or a similar clause requiring conflict of interest certifications during contract performance. This clause requires an annual conflict of interest certification from contractors when the contract does not require the submission of other conflict of interest certifications during contract performance. Contracts requiring annual certifications include: Site Specific contracts and the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. The annual certification requires a contractor to certify that all organizational conflicts of interest have been reported, and that its personnel performing work under EPA contracts or relating to EPA contracts have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The annual certification shall cover the one-year period from the date of contract award for the initial certification, and a one-year period since the previous certification for subsequent certifications. The certification must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after the close of the certification period covered.
