The survey, which appeared in the BERLINGSKE TIDENDE daily, was made between January 17 and 20 -- before last week's mortar attacks that killed civilians in Sarajevo's marketplace and in its suburb of Dobrinja -- among more than 1,000 residents. It also showed that 57 percent of Danes want Danish UN peacekeepers sent home if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) starts bombing operations in Bosnia. Another 34 percent felt the soldiers should remain. A majority 59 percent supported Danish participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world, while 32 percent opposed this and nine percent had no opinion. In all 54 percent felt it right that Denmark had sent soldiers to former Yugoslavia, while 40 percent felt the opposite.
