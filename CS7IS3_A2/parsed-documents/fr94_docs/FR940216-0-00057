FR940216-0-00057 FR940216-0-00010 Given the uncertainty in determining whether a MOBILE4.1-based performance standard or a MOBILE5a-based standard more accurately reflects the in-use conditions in 1998, the potential disruption to refinery operations (even if only for a small increase in the stringency of the fuel reformulation requirements), the fact that a more stringent standard in 1998 was not discussed or envisioned as part of the regulatory negotiation process, and the fact that any risk to the environment is small and of short duration, EPA does not believe it to be appropriate to base the Phase I complex model standards on MOBILE5a and require refiners to meet a more stringent performance standard in 1998. As a result, EPA will retain MOBILE4.1 with basic I/M as the basis for the Phase I performance standards under the Complex Model in 1998. In summary, EPA has retained the VOC and NO X baselines proposed in the SNPRM, including the relevant I/M assumptions, for use with the complex model prior to 2000. The onset of the Phase II performance standards in 2000 will increase the overall stringency of the standards, and a new baseline based on MOBILE5A will not, by itself, be the cause of new investment by refiners. By this time, enhanced I/M programs should be fully operational in nearly all reformulated gasoline areas. Therefore, baseline VOC and NO X emission levels to be used with the complex model in Phase II are based on MOBILE5A's estimate of emissions from light-duty vehicles and trucks with enhanced I/M. Baseline estimates of toxics emissions are not available directly from the MOBILE models. The nonexhaust toxics model bases its estimates of nonexhaust toxics on the RVP and benzene levels of the fuel. Since both of these levels are specified for Clean Air Act baseline (CAAB) gasoline, EPA has used the nonexhaust toxics model to determine the baseline nonexhaust toxics emission level. The exhaust toxics baseline has been estimated by multiplying the exhaust toxics emission level predicted by the complex model for CAAB gasoline by the ratio of baseline exhaust VOC emissions to the average exhaust VOC emission measurement in the complex model database. Since the five regulated exhaust toxic pollutants are all classified as VOCs, this adjustment sets the baseline exhaust toxics level equal to the exhaust toxics levels that would have been observed if the vehicles represented by the complex model database had VOC emission levels representative of in-use vehicles when tested on CAAB gasoline. No comments were received opposing this approach, which is discussed in more detail in Section III of the RIA. In evaluating the performance of simple model fuels, EPA has focused its attention on the average refiner. The need to compensate for differences between individual refinery baselines and the Clean Air Act baseline when the use of the complex model becomes mandatory has been communicated in past proposals, workshops, and the discussions associated with the Agreement in Principle. Hence refiners have been given adequate notice that if their baseline fuel produces higher emissions than CAAB fuel, then they must offset such emissions when the use of the complex model becomes mandatory in 1998. The four years before use of the complex model becomes mandatory is adequate leadtime for refiners. Refiners undertaking investments to comply with the simple model requirements have been made aware of these requirements, and this transition process was inherent in the regulatory negotiation agreement and in prior proposals. EPA recognizes that the precise emissions impact of individual refiner baselines could not be determined with confidence until the Complex Model was promulgated. However, refiners were aware of at least one course of action that would satisfy the requirements of the program under the complex model, namely to alter their baseline fuel to match the Clean Air Act baseline prior to meeting the simple model requirements. Baseline emissions of VOC, NO x , and toxics are given in Table IV&hyph;1 for Phase I and in Table IV&hyph;2 for Phase II. Summer and winter baselines are shown for both phases, with summer baseline emissions for VOC Control Regions 1 and 2 shown separately. The toxics emission baseline shown in Table IV&hyph;1 is applicable only during 1998 and 1999 and for those refiners choosing to use the complex model prior to 1998; the baselines shown in Table IV&hyph;2 are applicable in 2000 and beyond.
