What impact will this reform have on the development of China's foreign trade? [Wu Yi] In line with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the state will mainly apply such economic means as exchange rates, taxation, and credit to regulate economic activities with foreign countries. Exchange rates -- an economic lever -- are playing an increasingly important role in regulating our country's foreign trade. The State Council's decision to further reform our country's foreign exchange control system beginning next year is very important. Because it is crucial to the deepening of reform of the foreign trade structure, such reform will have a major, positive, and far-reaching impact on the development of foreign trade in our country. In line with the overall plan for reform of the foreign exchange control system next year, we will eliminate the double-track exchange rate system; introduce a unitary market-based manageable floating exchange rate system; introduce a system under which foreign exchange settlements and selling of foreign exchange are conducted by the banks; and abolish the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange while delivering the rest to the state. This is of tremendous significance to further reforming the foreign trade structure. In my opinion, all these reforms will create a good environment for fair competition by all types of export enterprises, will greatly speed up transformation of the operating mechanism of foreign trade enterprises, and will allow foreign exchange rates to play their function more effectively in regulating foreign trade, thus playing a very important role in expanding the import-export trade. Reform will bring our country's foreign exchange and foreign trade structures closer to the requirements of a socialist market economy; is conducive to establishing an operating mechanism suited to the rules and customs common in international economic activities; and will play a positive role in restoring our country as a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It can be said that deepening reform of the foreign exchange control system, and establishing a new foreign exchange mechanism in which the establishment of a socialist market economic structure is being accelerated and in which opening up to the outside world is being further widened, have created a hard-to-achieve opportunity for China to expand its foreign trade. We must have a firm grasp of the situation, seize the opportunity, strive to expand our foreign trade in 1994, and undertake foreign economic and trade work in a better manner. [Correspondent] How can foreign exchange needed by import enterprises for regular use be guaranteed after the system of foreign exchange conversion is introduced and after the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange is abolished? [Wu Yi] Some are concerned whether export enterprises will be ensured of the foreign exchange they need for their regular use following the introduction of the foreign exchange conversion system and the abolishment of the system for retaining a portion of foreign exchange. In fact, such concern is unnecessary because, first, the system of examination and approval for the use of foreign exchange will be abolished on the basis of the system for foreign exchange conversion and of the system for selling of foreign exchange by banks under which the renminbi is convertible on a conditional basis. Any enterprise wishing to use foreign exchange may use a valid certificate to convert renminbi for foreign exchange, provided its operation meets the requirements of the state industrial policy. This makes it easy for all types of enterprises to operate their business. Second, as a transitional measure to ensure foreign exchange for export enterprises, it may set up a counter account at the designated foreign exchange bank with renminbi equal to 50 percent of the total amount of foreign exchange it needs. The bank will guarantee the supply of foreign exchange to the enterprise, within the limit of the counter account, for its needs in expanding export trade, such as the import of materials for processing, packing materials, export base expenses, settlement of claims, freight charges and insurance, after-sales services, and subsidiary expenses. The export enterprise can still buy additional foreign exchange at the designated foreign exchange bank by showing valid certificates, to meet needs which the balance of the counter account is insufficient to cover. So, the normal needs of export enterprises in foreign exchange are reliably guaranteed. Of course, problems may happen during the shift from the old to the new system. We should further deepen reform, formulate concrete operational procedures, and promptly solve any problems. [Correspondent] How will the reform of the foreign exchange management system affect the foreign exchange currently retained in the hands of export enterprises? To put it more clearly, will the enterprises be allowed to continue to use it? [Wu Yi] All export enterprises are concerned about this question since it involves their vital interests. Here I can unequivocally tell everyone that the current reform of the foreign exchange management system has taken the interests of enterprises into full consideration. First, enterprises are permitted to keep and continue to use their current retained foreign exchange accounts and their current foreign exchange cash accounts. Second, enterprises are permitted to continue to use the balance in their retained foreign exchange accounts which were set up before the elimination of the double-track exchange rate system, and the balance shall be converted according to the official exchange rate of the day before the double-track exchange rate system was eliminated. If the retained portion of foreign exchange earnings has not yet been deposited in the account, the enterprise is required to deposit it within one month and is permitted to continue to use it in accordance with the aforesaid principle. Third, while enterprises are permitted to keep their foreign exchange cash accounts and continue to use them in making normal payments or sell the foreign exchange to the bank, no new deposits may be made to the accounts. [Correspondent] How will the current reforms of the foreign exchange management system and the foreign trade system affect foreign-funded enterprises? [Wu Yi] This is an important question and the answer is simple. 1) The way to manage foreign exchange for foreign-funded enterprises remains unchanged. 2) The elimination of the double- track exchange rate system benefits foreign-funded enterprises, because it resolves the contradiction caused by the fact that their registered capital is converted according to the official exchange rate, while the profits they remit home are converted according to market regulatory rate. So, the change will help attract foreign investors. [Correspondent] After the reform, China's foreign exchange management will adhere to the market norm. However, it is reported that people in some foreign countries often take anti-dumping measures against our export goods on the grounds that our government manipulates exchange rates. Do you have any comments on this issue? [Wu Yi] By further reforming the foreign exchange management system and the foreign trade system, China will manage foreign exchange business in accordance with market norms. At the same time, the unitary, well-managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand will no doubt further enhance the effects of market regulation on our foreign trade activities. Anti-dumping measures against our goods, which you have just mentioned, indeed exist abroad. In my view, as our economic system, including the foreign exchange management system and the foreign trade system, has undergone profound changes and we will continue to deepen reforms, the allegation of so-called exchange rate manipulation is groundless. We advocate promotion of exports in accordance with international trade norms. As a developing nation, we do not have the strength to dump goods abroad. We also oppose the practice of increasing exports by means of dumping. The prices of our export goods are relatively lower mainly because our labor is cheaper. The low prices are not caused by the exchange rate factor. Here I would like to reiterate that we oppose the practice of increasing exports by means of dumping, and we also oppose anyone who practices protectionism on the pretext of taking anti-dumping measures. [Correspondent] What are the main contents of the reform of the foreign trade system in the next stage? [Wu Yi] According to the State Council's overall plan, the reform of our foreign trade system in 1994 will keep abreast with the reforms of the finance and taxation system, the banking system, the investment management system, the planning system, and the foreign exchange management system. Major steps will be taken in reform. In order to deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, we should firmly keep to the reform orientation of unified policies, open operation, fair competition, integration of industry and trade, promotion of the agent system, and enterprises assuming sole responsibility for their own profit and loss. The objective of reform is to build a foreign trade operational mechanism which conforms to the general practice of the international economy. The main contents of the reform of the foreign trade system in the next stage are: 1) The state will further improve macroeconomic management of foreign trade, and mainly use economic means, such as exchange rates, taxation, and credit, in regulating foreign trade activities. We will reform the import-export management system, abolish mandatory plans, and reduce administrative intervention. We will control the total amount of a small number of commodities; manage them in accordance with the principle of efficiency, fairness, and openness; and distribute them by open tender or auction, or according to specific rules. We will pursue the policy and measures of encouraging exports, improve the export duty refund system, and practice a credit policy which is conducive to the development of foreign trade. We will establish a set of feasible systems for managing our enterprises abroad. We will accelerate foreign-trade legislation and manage foreign trade according to law to maintain orderly foreign trade operations. 2) We will deepen the reform of foreign trade enterprises and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises in accordance with the modern enterprise system. We will explore a new mode -- "large-scale economic cooperation and trade" characterized by the integration of trade with industry, agriculture, technology and commerce, as well as the integration of foreign trade, foreign capital, and economic cooperation. We will speed up the process of giving foreign trade power to qualified productive enterprises, scientific research organizations, and certain commercial and materials supply enterprises. 3) We will build and improve a foreign trade coordination service mechanism, and give full play to the coordination and service functions of the chambers of commerce for various import-export trades. 4) We will maintain the unity of our foreign trade policies and systems, and we will enhance their transparency.
