Among the neighborly countries, Turkey benefited the most from the exportation of Iraqi oil. Furthermore, it was more secure than the other countries because its borders with Iraq were under the control of the central government [in Baghdad]. Such security does not exist at all now because of the miserable situation in northern Iraq. Turkey's attempts to coordinate with the so-called Kurdistan Front as well as its relations with al-Talabani and Barzani did not save it from terrorist operations, explosions, and assassinations. These acts are U.S. and Western commodities that are exported to the closest friends, not out of revenge, but to maintain their subservience. Diplomatic sources said that the Turkish prime minister was serious in presenting its country's problem to the leaders of the UN Security Council permanent states. In fact, she presented Turkey's economic problems and damage resulting from the sanctions on Iraqi oil exportation. It seems, however, that the efforts of the prime minister either cooled down or were confronted by U.S.- Gulf obstacles. Turkish journalists, whom we met in Baghdad, ask the following question: How long will Turkey's hand remain extended to the Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the rulers of Kuwait? Can these emirates feed Turkish citizens and provide them with basic needs and a secure life? The violence that prevails in Turkey, particularly in Anatolia, demonstrates the feeling of humiliation, poverty, and subservience. The Turks, who live along the international highway that leads to the Iraqi borders, are now regretting the time when they were their own masters. They planted their lands and sold their commodities and agricultural products to the neighborly country with dignity and a feeling of reassurance about their future. The Turkish citizens know full well that their country's future lies in a firm trade exchange with Iraq and in common historical interests between the two countries. No donor state can resolve the problem of a country like Turkey because it is an economic-security issue to which Iraq is a direct party. Turkish officials know well that Iraq spares no effort to promote its relations with its neighbors, provided that those neighbors are free in adopting their decisions and take into consideration the interests of their own people, not other objectives that are dictated to them from outside. Mrs. Ciller raised Turkey's suppressed cry regarding the effects of the economic blockade. Others should understand that the entire Turkish people will raise a louder cry if the disregard of Turkey's relations and historical relations with Iraq continues.
