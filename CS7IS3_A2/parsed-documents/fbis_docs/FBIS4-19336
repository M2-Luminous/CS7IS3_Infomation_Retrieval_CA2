The new 11-member board includes Giampiero Pesenti (Italmobiliare), Roberto Gavazzi (Allianz-Ras), J.G.T. Carter (Commercial Union), Achille Maramotti (Max Mara), Franz Schmidt (Nippon Life), Leonardo Del Vecchio (Luxottica), Wolfgang Graebner (Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank), Leopold Henri Jeorger (Societe Generale) and Roberto Bertazzoni (Smeg). The two other board members, Lucio Rondelli and Egidio Giuseppe Bruno, on Monday will be elected formally chairman and managing director, respectively, it was announced. Aside from the two top board members, the nine others account for an estimated 223 million shares of Credit stock, for a total market value of between 600 and 650 billion lire (up to 397 million dollars). The bad weather apparently kept away many of the 5,800 Credit shareholders expected to attend and the meeting in the end saw a total of 3,316 shareholders represented (personally or through mandates), accounting for 32 percent of company stock. The total number of company shareholders in the books on February 28 was 56,737. The 1993 financial report showed profits increased 5 percent in 1993 to 219 billion lire (133.8 million dollars) from 208 billion lire the previous year. Gross operating profits grew 96 percent to 1.336 trillion lire (816 million dollars) and dividends were unchanged at 85 lire per ordinary share and 100 lire per savings share. For this year, Bruno forecast higher profits because of lower taxes and illustrated the bank's four-point strategy: increasing the number of low-cost branches, more managed savings, a higher production rate (with about 200 job cuts a year) and expansion into merchant banking activities.
