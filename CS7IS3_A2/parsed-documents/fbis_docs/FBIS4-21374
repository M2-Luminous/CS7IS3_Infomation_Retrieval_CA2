It would hardly be possible for 150,000 hectares of mangrove swamps to be devastated, leaving only 40,000 in Ancon de Sardinas: National Chamber of Aquaculture. Guayaquil Staff: The National Chamber of Aquaculture has expressed concern and constant support for the creation of a system for surveillance and monitoring of the mangrove swamps and the ecosystem. This also entails a revision of the penalties in effect under the present regulations. The institution's executive director, Harold Muller, gave explanatory reports on the statistics for mangrove swamp depredation ascribed to shrimp production. According to statistical data from the Remote Sensor Integrated Surveys Center (Clirsen), the distribution of mangrove swamps in Esmeraldas covers 32,032 hectares. The Coastal Resources Management Program (PMRC), in its series of management plans for the special management zones (ZEM) of Atacames-Sua-Muisne, indicates that, between 1969 and 1987, the reduction in the mangrove swamp area surface totaled approximately 1,000 hectares. This decline compounds that caused by shrimp nets, removal of mangrove piles, and charcoal production, which amounts to 1.2 million pounds per year in the Muisne area alone. Muller proved with documentary evidence that the mangrove swamp reserve is nearly intact. He declared that there is an error in the claim that 150,000 hectares of mangroves out of a total of 300,000 have been felled. There has also been a claim that, in 1986, the Esmeraldas mangrove swamp was declared a protective forest and that, despite this, over 150,000 hectares have been felled since that date, leaving at present only 40,000 in the Ancon de Sardinas estuary. Muller gave a reminder that the shrimp industry in the country as a whole occupies approximately 133,000 hectares. He added that 150,000 could hardly be devastated, leaving only 40,000 hectares on the Ancon de Sardinas estuary: something that is not true. He stressed that it was at the sector's initiative that the national government was requested to cease granting new concessions for the construction of shrimp ponds, and noted that these authorizations have been suspended. On several occasions that institution has asked the government to exercise strict control over the indiscriminate felling of mangroves on the national territory, so as to prevent unscrupulous persons from continuing their deforestation work. This is especially necessary since the sector has been fully aware that the mangrove swamp constitutes a fundamental element in the ecosystem, primarily in the development of shrimp itself. "Therefore, we are the first to take precautions and oversee the good condition of our resources." Although the shrimp sector, and particularly the National Chamber of Aquaculture, have been the first to report, and to give constant cooperation to the authorities, it is regrettable that our laws do not call for example-setting penalties. Because of this situation, the efforts expended by shrimpers, fishery authorities, and the navy are being constantly thwarted by the land traffickers. Minimal, and even ridiculous penalties are imposed on those engaged in the repugnant task of destroying mangrove swamps. The Aquaculture Chamber is also concerned about proposing a revision of the penalties in effect in the regulations. Muller emphasized that the shrimp industry accounts for over 31 percent of private exports and, more than an environmental impact, is having a significant economic and social effect. It generates foreign exchange in an amount equivalent to $525 million. Moreover, it employs over 200,000 full-time workers directly, and over 90,000 persons indirectly. This means that 7.2 percent of the country's economically active population makes its living largely from the shrimp industry. During recent times especially, many private and state organizations have come out in defense of the Ecuadoran mangrove swamp. The shrimp sector, in particular, is accused of being the main cause of the deterioration of vast riparian areas of the Ecuadoran coast.
