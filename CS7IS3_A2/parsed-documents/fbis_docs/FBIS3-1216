The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000 policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and an investigation into corruption among senior police officers. Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South Africa take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana. The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that two administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council would appoint one administrator and the government the other. The TEC said that the administrators would be assisted by the chief secretary of NEHAWU [National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union], the director general of foreign affairs, and the minister for administration. The policemen on strike are demanding that their pensions be paid out and that steps be taken against administrative corruption.
