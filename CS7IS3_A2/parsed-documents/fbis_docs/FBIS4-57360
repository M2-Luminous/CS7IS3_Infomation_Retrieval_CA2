The Sandinist leader said that he favors the existence of several candidates for the post of FSLN secretary general but emphasized the need to protect the methods and mechanisms to protect party unity. Ortega also called for a change in mentality within the FSLN to promote more initiatives within the rank-and-file organizations. [Irias] Why did you announce that you were giving up a possible presidential candidacy in 1996? [Ortega] I can understand why people are so skeptical but I have maintained that I did not enter the FSLN to hold a post in the FSLN or in the government. I did not join the FSLN to become president. In this stage of much discussion, some people have been spreading the notion that I covet the presidency again. I think this should be clarified. To me, this is an ethical and moral issue. I do not desire to be president. I have said this before and I reiterate it now. This is the true reason, more so than national considerations. In addition, to speak of running as a candidate is premature. Yes, I think the 1996 program should be of national unity. It is the only thing that can save the country, regardless of whether or not there are very polarized forces in the country. [Irias] What do you think should be the mechanism used to select the FSLN's presidential candidate? [Ortega] The most important consideration should be the program, which must be debated and approved democratically. The program must be discussed with mass participation. This is even more important than the mass participation in the election of the candidates themselves. The people will vote for a program. The decision for a candidate is a very important complementary issue. The candidate will have to be selected according to the political circumstances. It will be necessary to decide whether or not the FSLN will run by itself or as part of an alliance. After the congress, the Sandinist Assembly will meet to stimulate a broad policy of alliances by inviting meetings with different sectors, including COSEP, workers, producers, and businessmen to draft a countrywide plan or program that goes beyond electoral campaigns and party interests. We will later consider the formula, who will head this proposal, who will hold posts in the National Assembly or municipal governments. [Irias] Would you agree that FSLN candidates be selected in the departments? [Ortega] I agree completely. The candidates should be selected in a process headed by the Sandinists but which should involve the largest possible number of followers and friends, so our candidates can have or win the support of the majority of the population. [Irias] What about consulting with the rank and file regarding the FSLN candidates? [Ortega] The ideal thing would be for the formula to emerge from intuition and political savvy. But this would be insufficient if the rank and file are not consulted. This is very important to consolidate the candidacy. A mechanism such as the one used in Costa Rica, based on primaries, was considered when the party statutes were debated, but it was ruled out for material reasons. Anyway, the candidate must be consulted with the rank and file. [Irias] Why do you regard as risky the existence of other candidacies, Henry Ruiz in this instance, for the post of secretary general? [Ortega] This is by itself a healthy principle. It is a way such candidacies can be established, which requires careful attention. If these candidacies lead to confrontations or maneuvers typical of traditional parties, this is not healthy because it conspires against unity. It is like prodding others to fight, like sowing discord. The FSLN statutes establish the right of active members to run as candidates. Therefore, there can be several candidates for secretary general. The important thing is that this electoral process take place in a friendly and constructive manner, protecting the Sandinist unity. [Irias] Would you back Commander Tomas Borge's candidacy if he ran for FSLN president? [Ortega] We have broached this topic on previous occasions. In the First Congress we analyzed whether the post of FSLN president, such as in other parties, was convenient or not. I believe Commander Borge's qualities, a historic FSLN cadre, an FSLN founder, an anti-Somozist, and an anti-imperialist who spent time in jail after Somoza -- and Carlos Fonseca campaigned for his release -- give him unquestionable merits and if he were FSLN president he would enhance Sandinism. [Irias] Would you back that candidacy? [Ortega] Yes. Differences in the Opposition [Irias] How do you perceive the concept of self-defense? [Ortega] The things that happen in Nicaragua are not common in other parts of the world, such as our 216 comrades who were murdered in Jinotega. When a government or appropriate authority does not have the capacity to protect its citizens, the population not only has a right, but has a duty to create the self-defense mechanisms to survive. [Irias] Any other social group could use this argument to arm themselves. How would you resolve this situation? [Ortega] The ideal situation is not that every person should seek a self-defense mechanism. We cannot encourage that. We have to exert pressure on the government to ensure that the appropriate institutions maintain citizens' order and security. We cannot encourage self-defense, but we cannot condemn it in the cases such as I mentioned. [Irias] What are the in-depth differences in this FSLN internal debate? [Ortega] The in-depth differences have to do with the contradictions in Nicaraguan society, which are then blamed on Sandinism. This causes a break-up with smaller groups each going their own way. That is why the main theme in this congress has to do with the interpretation all Sandinists have to make on the concept of opposition. This is a key issue -- to agree among us how to face government policies -- this has to do with methods of struggle and each sector will struggle the best it can. We are obliged to stir awareness so as to ensure that people defend their own interests. [Irias] Is the FSLN secretary general not concerned that the constitutional order, the legality that your government created, may be adversely affected at some time by groups making claims? [Ortega] We have to defend the institutions, the legal state, it is a principle. This is so governments do not create policies that generate greater tension and serve as a culture medium for violence. The original sin is government policies. Forefront Party? [Irias] The FSLN has enormous political power and institutional power quotas, and can use them to influence the government to reduce institutional violence. Will the FSLN wield this political influence quota on the other aspect of the problem? [Ortega] If the FSLN had used its influence in a coherent and coordinated manner we could have avoided a series of events that the government has caused. The government feels safe with what it can do because the FSLN is unwilling to make true opposition. If we leap in that direction the outcome will be favorable for the country because it is a way to avoid violent behavior. Provided the FSLN defends the institutions and policies in favor of the people, conditions will be right for the people to trust these mechanisms and not be forced, in desperation, to seek violence. [Irias] Do you hope to rebuild the FSLN as a vanguard party? [Ortega] It seems to me that the term vanguard made sense when we fought Somoza, when the FSLN was clearly a vanguard, a very small political-military detachment that was at the forefront in the struggle against the dictatorship. Afterward, when in government, the FSLN became the party of the masses. We need a revolutionary party that is organized in accordance with how we currently live. The most important thing after the congress is the FSLN opening and a deep change in our mentality and in ways we organize and communicate with the people. We need to break away from the concept of directorate organizations that dictate lines of work. We need to be agents of change to encourage decisionmaking among grass root organizations. We need to ensure that leaders possess proposals made by the rank and file. [Irias] Would you eventually back General Humberto Ortega's candidacy in 1996? [Ortega] It is too early to speak of candidacies. It seems risky to speak hypothetically. I have to be very careful because it could be assumed that I am backing certain candidacies.
