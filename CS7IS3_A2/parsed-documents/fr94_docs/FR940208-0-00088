FR940208-0-00088 FR940208-0-00031 Summary of the Exclusion Process To determine whether or not to exclude areas from the designation of critical habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires determinations of: (1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat, (2) The benefits of including an area, and (3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species extinction. This process consists of estimating the benefits of retaining or excluding CHUs, weighing those benefits, and determining if exclusion of an area or areas will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area or areas from critical habitat will result in eventual species extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act. Extinction Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that are essential to the conservation of a listed species. However, the exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction. Conservation (recovery) and extinction are separate standards. Recovery and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to the recovery end of the continuum. It may be more difficult to predict the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine where recovery may occur. Each such determination may be different for different species and may vary over the range of a species. It may be related to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive success. Extinction of a wide-ranging species such as the desert tortoise would most likely occur as a result of increased fragmentation of its habitat (affecting quality). Portions of the species' range would no longer support tortoises before the species would become extinct. Cumulatively, reductions in range would inevitably lead to the species' extinction. The focus of the analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues and included consideration of the condition and location of habitat. Criteria and Decision The Act specifically prohibits consideration of economic effects when listing species as threatened or endangered, but requires an analysis of the economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. Therefore, economic costs and benefits of critical habitat designation were defined as the economic effects that: (1) Exceed those that resulted from listing the desert tortoise as a threatened species in April 1990; and (2) Are above those economic effects resulting from the previous implementation of tortoise protection measures by Federal land management agencies. In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns over economic effects, the Service used the following process: (1) Areas were identified that are essential to the conservation of the species based upon the criteria described in this document; and (2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated economic consequences of designating areas as critical habitat, using the county as the basic level of economic analysis. Exclusion After considering the economic and other factors that may be pertinent to any decision to exclude areas from designation as critical habitat, the Secretary of the Interior has determined that no exclusions are appropriate. Biological Modifications to Boundaries Based on information received during the proposal process, the Service refined boundaries of six CHUs based on biological information that these areas did not contain constituent elements and that deletion of them from critical habitat would not compromise the function of the CHU or its reserve design. These areas included: (1) Approximately 2,000 acres in the Chocolate Mountains in the Chuckwalla CHU in California; (2) Approximately 20,800 acres within and adjacent to the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base in the Ord-Rodman CHU in California; (3) Approximately 13,200 acres in the Newberry Mountains in the Piute-Eldorado CHU in Nevada; (4) Approximately 76,300 acres on both the northern and southern borders of the Mormon Mesa CHU in Nevada; (5) Approximately 80,757 acres around the Gold Butte-Pakoon CHU in Arizona; and (6) Approximately 8,100 acres north of St. George, Utah in the Upper Virgin River CHU in Utah. In addition, based on information and a request submitted from the BLM, the Service included an additional 1,920 acres on the southern border of the Beaver Dam Slope CHU in Arizona. This request was accommodated because:
