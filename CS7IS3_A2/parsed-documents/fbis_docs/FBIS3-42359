[passage omitted] The evening attacks affected four bank offices, two of which are the Banco de Credito and Interbanc. The explosions injured six pedestrians and partially destroyed the facade of the offices. Special police units alerted by telephone traveled through different parts of Lima and defused packages containing explosives near two state banks. A vehicle was found in the populous Yerbateros neighborhood, east of Lima, with a homemade rocket launcher inside that was about to go off. At least five explosions were registered in the outskirt districts of San Juan de Lurigancho and Comas, according to police reports. Police stations increased their security in light of the possibility of Shining Path attacks and police patrols in strategic areas of the capital have been doubled. The acts of violence reported Monday coincide with leaflet advertisements, which were delivered to editorial rooms of various Lima dailies, stating that the Shining Path is preparing to launch a wave of attacks in February.
