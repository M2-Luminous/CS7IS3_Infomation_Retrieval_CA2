She declared: The time has come to erase the fact that the PKK is being sheltered under the Assembly's roof. Addressing the True Path Party [TPP] assembly group meeting today, Ciller began with the issue of Sarajevo and said that the result attained is a first step towards peace. She said: [Begin Ciller recording] This morning I was pleased to learn that all heavy weapons have either been withdrawn 20 km outside Sarajevo, or they have been handed over to the United Nations. I welcome this development and the official information we were given. This is what should have been done a long time ago. As we declared during the NATO summit and in other platforms, especially as I personally stated during the NATO summit, it is possible to achieve results without bloodshed if the necessary force is attached to diplomatic moves. This is what was done here and it was possible to control the weapons in the hands of the Serbs or distance them 20 km outside the city without resorting to bloodshed or conducting any air strikes. We cannot, however, consider this sufficient on its own. This is only the first small part of the first step towards peace. The problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very extensive and the same situation prevails in a series of other regions. The same determination must be displayed in all these other areas. The same approach must certainly be utilized urgently in Gorazde, (Zeba), Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. The same situation applies to these security regions. Whatever was done for Sarajevo must be implemented in full in these areas as well and under such an atmosphere, the sides must immediately sit at the negotiating table for a lasting solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We reiterate that this is a topic that concerns the entire world public opinion. Turkey, for its part, will immediately appeal for the same approach to be applied and for the same measures to be adopted in the other regions as well. I once again declare that we are by the side of the Bosnians and we stand by their just cause. [end recording] Commenting on this morning's meeting with Catherine Lalumiere, secretary general of the Council of Europe, Ciller recounted that she clearly explained the reason for Turkey's determination in the struggle against terrorism. The TPP leader stated: [Begin Ciller recording] The Council of Europe secretary general asked me if there was any other way to fight terrorism. This is what I told her clearly in return: What is this other way you are talking about? Our people are dying; mothers and children are being massacred. We are channeling the biggest investments in the country into this region. We are doing everything possible to invest in these areas and open the way to these investments. Moreover, our compassion for the people in this region is demonstrated in the force used to protect their lives. Despite all this, if a separatist organization in your country opposes investment in these regions and vows to stop it; if it asks for democracy, but still attempts to oust all parties as well as the press; if it obstructs every service designated for the region; and if it openly declares its goal as separatism, then can you ask the same question of your country? In other words, there is no question of what else we can do at a time when separatist terrorist wishes are evident. [end recording] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller stressed that the government is exerting efforts to expand human rights and democracy not only to one region or as a concession to the terrorists, but to the entire country. Ciller noted that one matter on the public conscience recently is the widespread belief that the PKK is being sheltered under the roof of the parliament. Pointing out that such a thought is as disturbing for the government as it is for the people, the prime minister continued: [Begin Ciller recording] Neither the lofty Assembly, nor the TPP can tolerate the PKK being sheltered by the Assembly. We will not allow this. If persons, whose hands are still wet with babies' blood, are being protected in any way by any kind of immunity, then this does not conform with democracy. [end recording] Ciller declared that the immunity files concerning deputies who act in this way have passed from committees and have been referred to the Assembly. The Assembly will do whatever is necessary under the leadership of the TPP, Ciller underlined. Ciller also criticized Democracy Party [DEP] leader Hatip Dicle's description of the bombing of Tuzla station as a consequence of war conditions. At the mention of Dicle's name, deputies shouted that he was a traitor. In response, Ciller said: That is correct. That is exactly it. By targeting the young students attending the Tuzla Infantry School, Ciller remarked, Dicle has blatantly violated his parliamentary oath. Ciller said Dicle did not keep his word of honor given at the Assembly regarding the indivisible unity of the country and the nation. False actions aimed at eroding the state and its institutions, hiding behind parliamentary immunity, cannot be explained through the concept of democracy, Ciller added. She noted that those who act against sacred territories and the indivisible unity of the nation will certainly receive the necessary response from the state. The government is very determined on the matter, she declared. Pointing to the people's sensitivity on the subject, Ciller continued: [Begin Ciller recording] The time has come to eliminate the fact that the PKK is being sheltered under the roof of the Assembly. Be that as it may, I would like to declare that I regret the bombing of the DEP headquarters in Ankara. We are opposed to terrorism, whatever the reasons. It is not right to bomb or try to achieve a goal through terrorism for any reason at all. Therefore, I am warning all my citizens again: Do not, under any circumstances, be deceived by any schemes. [end recording] Ciller stated that the country's strength lies only in its unity and solidarity and asked that the necessary response be given to those who wish to damage this strength. Referring to the Cyprus question, Ciller announced that the Turkish side will continue to support the confidence-building measures. Noting that views were exchanged last night with the president and prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], Ciller went on: [Begin Ciller recording] I observe that the TRNC will continue to support the confidence-building measures. Despite our positive initiatives, it is clear that this matter cannot be concluded through our initiatives alone. As it is, Greece has failed to adopt a positive attitude regarding this issue despite the UN Security Council resolution on the subject. Similarly, the Greek Cypriot side has failed to display such determination. Furthermore, while the Turkish side accepted the principle of not piercing the package, the Greek Cypriots posited certain additional demands which actually pierce the package. This again demonstrates to the world our determination on the subject and the fact that we will not benefit from a lack of solution. [end recording]
