Grigoriy Yavlinskiy Answers Questions from the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Editorial Board"] [Text] Requesting him to express his opinion regarding Nazarbayev's proposal on the creation of a Eurasian Union, we remembered that in the recent past Grigroiy Yavlinskiy more than once was a first-hand participant in the preparation of multilateral economic agreements between the republics of the USSR. For the first time the idea of a similar agreement was presented as a section of the "500 Days" program in August 1990. At that time Kryuchkov, Pavlov and Abalkin succeeded in convincing Gorbachev that such coordinated action of the republics would deprive him of real political power. This became the main reason for Gorbachev's rejection of the "500 Days" program. The second attempt was undertaken after the August 1991 putsch. In October of 1991 an all-encompassing agreement was worked out which ten republics of the former USSR signed. During the course of working on it, 25 specific economic agreements were prepared--on monetary and financial policy, a customs area, free trade, migration, social issues, extraordinary situations, etc. However, the extemely sharp political strugge at that stage overshadowed any kind of economic expediency. The agreement, which was not successfully implemented then, is today the foundation of the organization of an economic union. [Question] Nazarbayev's proposal, expressed during his Moscow visit, sounded unexpected for many people. For you too? [Yavlinskiy] Nazarbayev is the kind of leader who politically understands economic processes. His position always proceeds from the interests of the matter, and not from ambition. It is precisely why in 1991 he supported in every way possible the work on creating an economic union, he always strove to act not as a destroyer, but as a creator. That is why the Kazakh president's statement did not strike me as unexpected. [Question] Nazarbayev's proposal detailed such features as a unified economic space, a common parliament and a defense union. How much do you share his specific proposals? [Yavlinskiy] It has at first the intent of reestablishing an economic union on the basis of that which was already worked out. When the economic union begins to yield positive results, then it is possible to discuss other elements. [Question] What time frame do you see for this process? [Yavlinskiy] The union is first of all a common market. This should result in a viable working condition during 1994. The main obstacle to this is the long known disregard toward integration tendencies on the part of many of our "reformers." Let's recall, for example, Gaydar's use of the process of unifying the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus as one of the grounds for his resignation. [Question] In the last issue of our newspaper we published an interview with Shakhray, where he was in some measure a follower of Nazarbayev's idea. [Yavlinskiy] Sergey Mikhaylovich united himself with this idea because the more supporters it has, the better. But we must not forget that earlier he spoke out very fervently against an economic agreement. Now it seems that supporting an economic agreement has become politically beneficial, it is delightful. [Question] How do you evaluate the prospects of support and rejection of Nazarbayev's proposal by Russia's political elite? [Yavlinskiy] Nazarbayev makes such statements because he was always a consistent supporter of the idea of integration. As regards politicians from other states, in Russia, for example, it is not simple for all of them to move away from their former positions. This, in my view, explains Moscow's silence following Nazarbayev's statement. [Question] What do you think about the positions of other states of the Commonwealth? [Yavlinskiy] It's not necessary to think about Belorussia [Belarus]: the desire for integration is very strong there. In Ukraine all the elections revolve around this question. There Grinev and Kuchma support the position of drawing closer. True, there are opponents. As far as I know, in Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and in other states they are looking for various ways to get closer to this idea. [Question] As a result of the disintegration, a large circle of leaders has come to power who in essence advocated this idea. Today evidently the striving for unification is the wish, perhaps, of every stratum of society. Does this mean that this most recent idea will triumph in reality only after all the actors are replaced? [Yavlinskiy] In any case it would be desirable if the politicians who support integration processes were sincere and no one would be able to reproach them for the state of affairs. It seems to me that in the end, the essence of support for Nazarbayev's proposal is not in the words which I am now saying in this interview, but in this, apparently, I can add myself to those people who prepared popular opinion for integration.
