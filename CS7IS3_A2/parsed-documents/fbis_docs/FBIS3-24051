Udaltsov, editor in chief: Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, you were one of the most prominent personalities in our first (then all-Union) parliament. Tell us please, what is your opinion of the current Federal Assembly? A. Sobchak: Frankly, it hurts that a great power has such a parliament. Unfortunately, many people who made it there are absolutely unprepared for parliamentary work. There are also people with a simply criminal mentality. We know that so far the parliament has not adopted a single positive decision. It is engaged in internal score-settling, endless rallies, petty internal scandals, and defining its own status. At the same time--and I have already said this more than once with different audiences--we are not seeing the results of the 12 December elections in the correct perspective. After all, we did get a new Constitution and, for the first time, completely different relations between citizen and state. Unfortunately, very little is being said about this. Most importantly, for the first time we held elections in an environment of a multiparty system, by party lists (other than elections in single-seat districts). Now about the results. In order for the results to be different, we should have avoided mistakes--the government, the president, and the political parties. But it was clear from the very beginning that the new parliament would be a motley crew. Nevertheless, the elections did take place. There is a new parliament. What its fate will be depends to a large extent on itself. For me, the important part is that we will no longer be in the same political dead end we have been in for more than two years. Looking back at the elections today, what remains to be done is to analyze honestly, harshly, and objectively why the outcome was completely different than that we had hoped for. When I say "we," I mean politicians and organizations of a democratic orientation. Nevertheless, we have taken a giant step down the road of establishing democracy in Russia. O. Moroz, editorial board member: It appears to me that over the past two years you have faded as a politician. How do you explain this? Are you counting on a second wind? Do you intend to run for president in 1996? In your opinion, who will be president? A. Sobchak: Relatively faded... I myself do not feel that I have faded... Because I have lived the last two years at the limit of my abilities. I worked perhaps more, and more actively, than previously in the parliament. When I came to the parliament from academia, teaching seemed like leisure to me. Now I am responsible for the life of a 5-million-strong city, parliamentary work seems rather easy and free of responsibilities. Here, the responsibility is different: You are responsible for the life of a city where something happens every day. Today it is a fire in the Admiralty; tomorrow an entire rayon--300,000-400,000 people--is without heat, light, and water. Or, for instance, the situation with purification systems... City residents are not even aware of the situations we encounter in the old city with decrepit communications. That is why I perhaps do not participate in political life as actively as I did when I was a member of the Supreme Soviet and the Congress. But I am involved in the work of the government, the Presidential Council, and in drafting many decisions. Being in power and having responsibility for the state of the city I could, of course, build up much greater popularity for myself by criticizing decisions I disagreed with. Had I said in the press and on television everything I say in the government or at the Presidential Council, it would have given me much greater popularity. There are things I could say and tell. But I believe I should not do so. Because we are going through a very difficult time. To hand over to the irreconcilable opposition my own analysis of the mistakes and wrong decisions that have been made, and are still being made, is to pour water on the mill of the counter-reformers, the enemy (the latter definition is simpler and more precise). Over the past two years I have been asked many times whether I intend to run in the presidential elections. And I have said repeatedly for two years that I have a much simpler and more modest task. I am facing reelection in 1996--the day the president's term expires, my term as mayor also expires. Until then I do not intend to go anywhere. I promised the people of my city when I was running for mayor that I would work in the city honestly and conscientiously for five years. O. Moroz: What if Zhirinovskiy becomes president? A. Sobchak: In the event the impossible does happen and the country goes to Zhirinovskiy, I will do everything I can to have Petersburg secede from Russia. Now, about elections of a new president. Of course, we have to start preparing for them now. As for myself, I am not preparing for these elections for a number of reasons. One of them is a superstitious feeling of self-preservation. Not a single political figure from Leningrad or Petersburg fared well after moving to Moscow. Most often their life ended prematurely and violently. A. Udaltsov: How, in your opinion, did a change of course take place in connection with Gaydar's departure? Was this course correct? A. Sobchak: In principle, Gaydar's course was absolutely correct. There is real proof of this. I will not compare our economy with the Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any other. Today we have already reached the point where the Russian ruble is no longer termed "wooden." While other republics consider their currencies "wooden" in relation to the Russian ruble. I realize that 100 percent foreign currency convertibility, at least in relation to these "semi-currencies," coupons, and such, is small consolation, but still. When I went with the president to sign an agreement with Georgia, it was as if we had returned to the end of 1991, except even worse: The same distribution of basic foodstuffs by coupon, bread lines, empty store counters... Returning to St. Petersburg, I deliberately asked many people: Would you like to go back to that today? Yes, many people are unhappy about prices. But would you like to go back to December 1991, when there was a shortage of everything? Everything except lines? I am convinced that not a single person in Russia now, now that we have experienced store saturation, is dreaming about the past, unless he is playing political games. The reform course had been chosen correctly. It was impossible to make it without certain elements of shock therapy. But from the very beginning a mistake, typical for Russia, was made. While implementing the reform it was necessary to make realistic adjustments to it. The idealistic straightforwardness in the implementation of the reform was obvious. In St. Petersburg our radical democrats accused me of conservatism, shouting that I was shielding the nomenklatura. All because I kept as advisers in the mayoralty many people from the old nomenklatura who know how to work. I also advised Gaydar: Have as advisers people who know the national economy. The kind you can wake up in the middle of the might to tell you what a plant in Nizhniy Tagil makes, what is produced in Sverdlovsk and Petersburg, or where production of some or other item can be set up. They are not being utilized today in any way, but they have tremendous experience. Yuriy Shchekochikhin, member of the editorial board: I am interested to learn about the chief of the Baltic Steam Line, Kharchenko. He was arrested for taking bribes. Then he was let go. I know that considerable pressure was brought on this "case." There was a letter of support from Rostropovich, although I do not think they are acquainted. I know that you, too, spoke in defense of Kharchenko. I think this is not quite proper for a city mayor. It resembles the old party obkom [oblast committee]. I am generally uncomfortable about a class approach to corruption. If he is one of ours, he can do anything... A. Sobchak: I think the entire definition of the corruption issue is completely incorrect. I remember all those conferences on corruption, Rutskoy's appointment as the man in charge of combating this evil--before those 11 suitcases surfaced. And mutual accusations? All this creates an absolutely abnormal, distorted atmosphere of public life. It fogs the environment, and then those who truly are corrupt, who take bribes, remain in its shadows. While such people as Rutskoy and Shumeyko slug it out. By the way, I am convinced that neither one nor the other is corrupt. They, of all people, did not take bribes. Meanwhile, the ordinary citizen, a Philistine, gets the impression that they are all from the same lot. Corruption is the main topic played up by the counter-reformers, those who are fighting against democracy in Russia. Their goal is to destroy confidence in the new authority. This situation seems absolutely abnormal to me. Wherever we are dealing with crime and corruption we have to have concrete facts. Instead, people are pushed out of politics by talk and rumors. Now about Kharchenko. I took a very definite position on this matter because from the very beginning it acquired political overtones. There were attempts to use it against the city mayoralty and against me personally. I know that it was organized at the directive of Moscow, because they needed an example. This case came up right after the conference in the Kremlin on combating corruption and crime. Comrade Rutskoy proposed: Let us stop the idle talk; organize a few cases so that people can see who steals and how. And suddenly, without rhyme or reason, proceedings are initiated, and a man is arrested right on the train. Why is it that all the repressions in Stalin's time started in Leningrad? It is the most convenient place to attract attention and give an example of what to combat and how. I believe, however, that when a criminal case gets political overtones, I, as the mayor of the city, as a political figure, as a citizen, and as a jurist, have an obligation to speak up. And not only with respect to Kharchenko. As to his particular case, we will wait and see. Let us see how this case ends and what kind of charges are brought. There are no bribes involved there. He has nothing to do with corruption. For my part this is not a class approach--it is the position of the mayor of the city in which the chairman of the Union of Entrepreneurs and State Enterprise Directors is arrested. Economic managers turn to me: Why are we again being arrested, grabbed in the street? Also, a taste has suddenly developed for arresting... academicians. It is dangerous to fight gangsters. An academician, on the other hand, especially on an economic matter, on charges that he has allegedly set up an illegal structure, may be taken right on the street, by people brandishing submachine guns and pretending that they are fighting mature criminals. Unfortunately, today all talk of corruption is phrase-mongering. I am telling you as a jurist. Until I see in the Russian Criminal Code the words that corruption is a crime consisting of such and such, as a jurist and a citizen I do not want to discuss this evil altogether. Yu. Kulikov, deputy editor in chief: In September of last year, when Edict No. 1400 came out, could you foresee the consequences it would lead to? After the events of that fall the situation in the country, in my opinion, remained as unsettled as before, if not worse. So was it worth it, as they say, to start the scuffle? A. Sobchak: Such a method of resolving a political situation is altogether unacceptable. They could have, and should have, done it without tanks shelling the parliament building. Thus avoiding national shame. Of course, when you do not know how to play chess, and the opponent starts winning, you can take the chess board and slam him on the head with it. This is the same: They could not win the game, so they slammed the opponent on the head. I was not the one to make this decision, however. The Presidential Council is a consultative body. At its meetings we only express our opinion, and the president has the right to follow it or disregard it. I want to emphasize, however, that when it got to the point of armed rebellion, which is precisely what was happening in Moscow, I did not have any doubt that force had to be used to suppress the rebellion. Therefore, on my own initiative, I sent two OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] regiments to Moscow, leaving my city practically exposed. Since approximately 1600 on 3 October it was clear to me that this was a matter of life or death. And of the future of the country. I gathered my staff together; we discussed what was going to happen and what we have to do if power in Moscow fell into the hands of the rebels. I believed then and believe now that one has to fight for his ideas rather than wait to be hanged on the first available lamppost. Yu. Solomonov, deputy editor in chief: If fascists come to power in Russia, St. Petersburg can, of course, secede. But do you not think that lumpenization of the population in the city on the Neva is proceeding even faster than in Moscow? I mean the numerous pro-fascist publications there, the mood, and most importantly, movements and organizations of this bent. A. Sobchak: Thank goodness, over the past three years our city has not experienced the same kind of political battles as other places. I consider it one of our main achievements--the city lives a calm political life. We do not prohibit anyone from holding rallies or demonstrations. And they take place in a somewhat different key in our city... Now about how we are fighting the spread of pro-fascist attitudes. First and foremost, we are trying to restore Petersburg as a spiritual and cultural center of Russia. Much has already been done. For instance, not a single theater has closed down. On the contrary, many new ones have opened. We try to have cultural events take place in the city each day; we want to turn it into a center of international festivals, meetings, seminars. In addition to everything else, it may become one of the distinguishing features of the city and one of the main sources of revenue. Today I am doing everything to ensure that no more plants are built in Petersburg. We are trying to move production facilities away from the center, especially hazardous ones. I think that most military-industrial complex enterprises will die out. First and foremost because there are no people in Petersburg today who would wish to do such hard unskilled work. Take the Kirov Tractor Plant, where in the past a man--as a rule covered with tattoos and rippling muscles--sat there and tightened nuts on Kirovets wheels. Where did such a guy come from? The general director would come to the obkom and say: I need a residence permit for 5,000 "nut-tighteners." The Leningrad Chief Construction Administration also brought in about 20,000 construction workers a year, who were housed in dormitories. This is where Zhirinovskiy's supporters come from. They are well aware of this in Moscow. In place of the defense sector, dozens of enterprises should arise, which will produce all sorts of products for people. This is our future. By the way, there are no factories in Paris... I think it is in our common interest not to let the country become the Russia of Zhirinovskiy. And this should not happen. Such provincial fascism, a provincial political snow job at an unbelievably primitive level... Russia will not allow it to happen. Yu. Solomonov: Germany also thought highly of itself. A. Sobchak: Still, history does not repeat itself. People do learn from the mistakes of others or from tragedies of the entire humanity. Therefore, what could happen in Germany at the end of the 1920's-beginning of the 1930's cannot be repeated in Russia at the end of the 1990's and beginning of the next century. Yu. Solomonov: All this is interesting to listen to. We have to get rid of hazardous production. But is there not an attempt at a certain social selection in all this? Your colleague Yuriy Luzhkov put restrictions on the entry into Moscow of persons of Caucasian ethnic origin. You put restrictions on "nut-tighteners." This is not the way to improve the quality of society and not the way to fight crime. You can, of course, create "oases." But this milieu will exist somewhere else and will coagulate into seats of social tension. At the 101st kilometer, perhaps? A. Sobchak: Do not interpret me in such a primitive way. We say that the city's profile needs to be changed--not that Kirov plant workers should be thrown out on the street. They must start doing other things. It is a job for a robot to tighten nuts. A worker must move to another job that will have more content, spirit, will transform him. A. Sabov, commentator: You said that there are no factories in Paris. There are factories in Paris. In Rome, however, there is only one plant--it makes gas lighters. Rome is completely a city of intelligentsia. But it is also a city of strong right-wing traditions. The fascist electorate there is very great. Therefore, ridding the city of proletarians does not insure it against fascism. How many people in your city live below the poverty line? As city mayor, what do you do above what the central authorities do? A. Sobchak: I would like to get rid right away of such a formula as "getting rid of workers, of the proletariat." We do not intend to get rid of anyone. I repeat once again: The meaning of the program is to give these people different jobs. So that they may do other things in the city. In particular, in Paris, too, the Reno plant is not in the center of the city. As for people living below the poverty level... This is one of the main problems and difficulties of transition from one system to another, building a principally new economy. The state may succeed only if during the transition period it provides a proper standard of living for the people and proper social programs. Journalists reproached Luzhkov for not wanting to let people from the Caucasus come to Moscow. But this is not Luzhkov's problem--it is a problem of a state that does not have borders. When Russia sets up its borders and begins letting into Russia only those it wants to let in on business or as tourists, then it will be a different matter... Until Russia has borders, it will be very difficult to fight crime. Now about social protection. Our city is special. Even Moscow cannot be compared with it. One and a half million out of 5 million of our population are pensioners, disabled, and survivors of the blockade. These are the people who have found themselves practically below the poverty level. And we were the first in Russia who had to introduce allowances for them, spending almost half the budget on it. Every quarter we determine the subsistence minimum. And make up the difference to those whose salaries or pensions are below that minimum. Of course, because of this we build less housing, or do less of some other things. But when I speak to the citizens of the city, I always say that I cannot do otherwise. If you believe that this is wrong--please, you have this right, collect enough votes and recall me. As long as I am the mayor of the city, I cannot stop caring for these million and a half people. Thanks to some social measures, the city remains stable. Our bread prices are still much lower than those in Moscow. Perhaps this is the reason Zhirinovskiy came in only fourth in our city. And the democrats as a whole took 65 percent of the vote. D. Molchanov, commentator: You have said the word "enemies" several times. This is a very strange trend. Do you not believe that the authorities today deliberately are building up the image of an enemy? And do you not think that this is happening because, as experience shows, this authority can only operate effectively in extreme situations? A. Sobchak: I do not think so. The authority is not creating the image of an enemy. It is simply that during the transition period there are people who do not accept this authority and are ready to fight it--not by political methods but with arms. Which they have said many times. The same Zhirinovskiy is already threatening to put many in "Sailor's Rest." This is all much more serious than you think. For instance, a few days ago in Petersburg a whole underground munitions plant was liquidated. There are also armed groups pursuing specific goals. By the way, we have already seen this in the example of 3-4 October. This is not the image of an enemy--these are real enemies. Perhaps those who take up arms are not strictly speaking enemies, just confused people. But those who are behind them are real enemies of Russia going the way of democratization, of Russia becoming a democratic instead of militaristic state, a state that works for its citizens. You are mistaken if you think that someone is creating this image. Here is the reality--in Petersburg as late as 1989, 76 percent of the economy was working for defense. This set the stage for a real confrontation of interests. People who are fighting to preserve this status are enemies of our society. We should not be afraid of this word. If they really come to power, they will shoot, root out all elements of democratic life. Because they do not need it; it is against their interests. Therefore we should say these things straight. The Moscow events in October showed that the irreconcilable opposition has well-armed, organized structures. And arms, and money, and trained people. You cannot dismiss this. And I cannot agree with you that the authority is effective only in extreme situations. Had that been the case, today we would be like Georgia. We do live somewhat differently. A. Rubinov, commentator: As is known, you have already been president... of the Consumers Union! So how can you allow the offensive against the consumer to come from Leningrad of all places. Your city, for instance, was the first to raise public transportation rates. And yesterday there was a report that in your city one has to pay now to get information on the train schedule. The whole perestroyka started with charging for the use of public restrooms. A. Sobchak: In Norway it costs a dollar to use a public restroom. The minimum wage there is $2,500, however... Anatoliy Zakharovich, as a former president I will say this to you, the former vice president of the Consumer Union. First, your information regarding Leningrad introducing this is somewhat incorrect. We always watch to make sure that our prices are not higher than those in Moscow. In our city, for instance, those who use public transportation pay only 14 percent of the real cost of the ride. The real cost of a subway ride in Petersburg today is R210. But the passenger pays only 14 percent. A. Rubinov: Are there examples in the world where public transportation is self-sustaining? A. Sobchak: Everywhere. A. Rubinov: Nowhere! Nowhere in the world! A. Sobchak: Everywhere. Because the cost of using public transportation in all developed countries is extremely high. One subway ride in Norway costs $7... Now, about fees for information. A journalist's ear is built somewhat differently than that of other people. This information was reported this morning. I heard it. This is what it said: We have learned that the October Railroad administration is considering introducing fees for information beginning next month... But you should know that the Leningrad Station in Moscow also belongs to the October Railroad. Therefore, if this is introduced, it will be in effect not only in Petersburg but also in Moscow. As mayor, I will try to interfere. To which the railroad chief will tell me: I plan to make R200 million a year on this. I will tell him: All right, I will pay you this R200 million, but do not disgrace our city in front of the rest of Russia. That is all. But I cannot order him. A. Rubinov: If the MPS [Ministry of Railroads] begins to charge for information, it will be more profitable for it to keep changing the schedule than to stick to it. This way the MPS will show a wonderful bottom line, while the trains will be late even more often. G. Tsitrinyak, commentator: A purely practical question. The last time I saw ground attendants was about 15 years ago in the Maksim Trilogy movies. They were dispersing a demonstration there. How is the situation with ground attendants now? And the second question. Do you not believe that people who get maimed on city streets should get compensation from the city treasury? A. Sobchak: The second question is easy to answer. We have legislation which assigns each city street to housing offices and enterprises, which are legal entities. Therefore, there is always someone to sue. The important part is to prove that the accident was a result of appropriate measures not being taken, or violation of existing regulations. Then the court will award you compensation for damages. I happen to be a specialist in this area. In almost all cases, those who turn to the court get compensation for traumas received on the street. Regarding grounds attendants. We have lost them, and normal care of buildings along with them. Generally speaking, we will have to do a lot to get things in order. For instance, the mayoralty has appropriated R100 million to put lights in all arch passageways in the center of the city. We have practically completed this work. We are also restoring the position of grounds attendant. Although this is a very costly undertaking. It will cost the city budget about R10-15 billion. Yu. Kulikov: In your future book, which LITERATURNAYA GAZETA recently referred to, you maintain that the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and its leader are a creation of the KGB and the CPSU Central Committee. However, Gorbachev immediately refuted your statement... A. Sobchak: Yes, I am writing a book "There Once Was a Communist Party..." It will contain quite a few little-known facts and details. In particular, this story. Mikhail Sergeyevich says that Sobchak was not present at that particular Politburo meeting, and that it did not adopt a decision regarding the LDPR. But this is not what I am saying. An opinion, as they say, was floated, an idea--to take the process of formation of a multiparty system under control. And the first party that was officially registered after Article 6 had been repealed was the liberal democrats. It was organized quite quickly, efficiently, and yes, with the participation of these organs. When I publish this book, it will tell all of this in detail; I will quote documents, materials, persons. Because I realize that if I do so without substantiation, I will be facing lawsuits. A. Udaltsov: Of course, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA also took part in preparing society for democratic changes. But then we saw how much blood was spilled. In Tbilisi, Vilnius, the Dniester Area, Tajikistan, Karabakh. Was there a different way to democracy--bloodless? And do you have any new viewpoint on those events in Tbilisi? A. Sobchak: The first question, I think, belongs to the realm of scholastic reasoning. Life, politics, consists of realities. If we study the real experience of other countries we can see that a different transition was possible. With less blood, fewer losses. But let us recall how the transition from a totalitarian regime to democracy was carried out in postwar Germany or Japan. They lived in an occupation regime. The disciplined Germans, those who had been members of the Nazi party, were simply ordered to join parties of a liberal and Christian democratic orientation. They did so. In the final analysis it was all accomplished without bloodshed. I am not sure that without an occupation regime there they would have managed without bloodshed. But if there are no renewal processes in society, it will simply perish. If Genscher thinks he destroyed communism, it is because he wants to think this of himself. The communist system destroyed itself. It was not the democrats who overthrew this regime in 1991. Because if you read what we were writing and saying as late as the summer of 1991, you will see that our plans assumed many years of existence of the Communist Party. But it all collapsed, and not because of some CIA intrigues or Genscher's activities--it imploded. Because it could no longer exist. That is all there is. About the Tbilisi events. I recently met with Boris Nikolskiy, a former secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia Central Committee. He is still convinced that the main mistake was that the action was not tough enough. Had it been tougher, more decisive, everything would be in order. This is a tremendous delusion! And the impotence of the authority. Patiashvili and other Georgian leaders instinctively felt their impotence. All the rayon and lower level party committees apparently function, but then suddenly some people appear out of nowhere, gather a rally, and people follow them. The authorities can do nothing about it. This impotence of the authorities begets fear. And fear begets an inclination toward violent solutions. Had the massacre not taken place in Tbilisi on 9 April, I am convinced that we would not have this provincial fascism Gamsakhurdia brought with him (it is Georgians themselves who found this very precise description of this regime). There would be no Gamsakhurdia. On the wave of that massacre, however, he grew into a political figure of major proportions and managed to convince the entire nation over a very short period of time that they do not live well because Russia is squeezing all the life juices from them. Georgia has everything, he said. As soon as we close the border with Russia, separate ourselves from it, the nation will recover and live well. Only a man who is absolutely sick or completely ignorant in economics could say that. He was both--sick and ignorant. And he still convinced the people that Georgia would survive without Russian oil, gas, grain, and many Russian things. But the fact is that many republics had been subsidized by Russia. Just like in Russia many autonomies are subsidized by Petersburg and Moscow, Tyumen, and about 10 other regions. What is happening is that the excess emotions to which people are prone are being played on. We have been conditioned by all our history to create idols for ourselves. This is where our serfdom, slavery, manifests itself. We cannot do without idols. Both Georgians, and we, Russians. When we become a civil society, it will live without idols. It will not talk endlessly about the president and chairman of the government. This should be the last thing to interest people. And it is all because a free man lives with less dependency on the state than we, unfree people, live today.
