"So far, we do not think that certain countries in Southeast and East Asia which recently acquired new armament, have a tendency to be offensive. But I have no idea about what will happen to (?them) 20 years from now," the minister told legislators here on Tuesday. The retired general said that the arms purchases were only intended to replace old weaponry and to keep up with new technology. "Just like us, we bought a few F-16 fighters with the purpose of keeping abreast of new technology," he said, adding that the number was actually far from sufficient compared with Indonesia's concrete defence needs. Sudrajat said that rapid economic growth in the two regions was among the major factors that had prompted the arms purchasing actions. He said that some East European as well as Central Asian countries were very aggressive and innovative in offering products of their weapon industries. "Although in technological terms the arms they offer cannot compete with those made by Western countries, some Asian countries with limited funds for armament seem very interested in the East European and Central Asian products," he added. The minister rejected the suggestion that the arms purchasing activity of the Southeast and East Asian countries amounted to an "armament race." During the hearing led by the chairman of the commission dealing with security affairs, Mrs. Aisyah Amini, the minister also touched on the "single majority concept" which had of late become a widely-debated topic in the country.
