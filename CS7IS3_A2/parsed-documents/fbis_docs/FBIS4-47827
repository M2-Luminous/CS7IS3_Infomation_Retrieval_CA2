The only problem was "one or two" counting stations which had requested help with reconciliation, she said. Asked why there was a breakdown in the flow of results, Mrs Suzman responded: "It is because there is a delay all over." Reliable sources said earlier a halt to all further election results issues had been called, and might last 24 hours.
