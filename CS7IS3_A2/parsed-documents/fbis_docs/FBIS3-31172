He said Meciar had placed his party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), before two alternatives: Either a referendum on the expulsion from parliament of the "maverick" HZDS deputies or early general elections in June 1994. The first alternative is undemocratic, the second unrealistic, he said. The increasingly united opposition also has two choices in his view: Either a government without Meciar, for which one parliamentary vote would be lacking, or early elections but it is unlikely the opposition alone would succeed in passing the necessary constitutional law, Miklosko said. KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky said Meciar was the only politician it was impossible to agree with. In the course of time Milan Knazko, Rudolf Filkus, President Michal Kovac, Lubomir Dolgos have all fallen out with him, he said, adding that Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik also were defectors. The various parties of the opposition, however, were able to agree on solutions to Slovakia's problems, voting together for instance on the law on large privatization, he said. Carnogursky said it would not be responsible of the opposition to use the crisis situation in order to attempt a vote of no confidence in the government. When asked if the opposition parties would arrange "round table" talks in the near future, Miklosko said "everything depends on today's results of the HZDS talks" in Casta-Papiernicka, west Slovakia.
