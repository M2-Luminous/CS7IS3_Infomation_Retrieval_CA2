The problem should be handled by people responsible for this specific sphere, who will look into particulars, collect comprehensive information and make appropriate decisions. The Russian minister was referring to the case of the former CIA counter-intelligence department leader Aldrich H. Ames and his wife whom the U.S. Administration accused of spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia. According to the Russian minister, Russian-American relations have reached a very high level of partnership and cooperation for "cases like this one" to overshadow them. Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Andrey Kozyrev admitted that "espionage stories" do crop up, regrettably, in relations between different countries from time to time, even if they are NATO allies, or between the United States and Israel. Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that the "Ames problem" is in no way linked to the Russian president's latest initiative concerning Bosnia. It would be better, he said, not to politicize or ideologize the situation but let relevant services of the two countries handle it. What is most important is for us "to continue cooperation and not to attach undue, hypertrophied significance to this case", Kozyrev said.
