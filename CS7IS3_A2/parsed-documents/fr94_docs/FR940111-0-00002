FR940111-0-00002 FR940111-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Parts 253 and 254 RIN Number 0584&hyph;AB67 Definition of ``Indian Tribal Household'' AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule broadens the current regulatory definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and the Food Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma (FDPIHO). First, this change mandates that all households which pass the program means test, reside in designated areas near a reservation where an Indian Tribal Organization (ITO) or State agency provides program services, and include a Native American be eligible to participate in the FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's tribal affiliation or age. Secondly, it also makes such households which lack a Native American adult, but which include Native American children, eligible to participate in the FDPIHO. Finally, this rule clarifies that all households which pass the program means test and live on a reservation where an ITO or State agency administers the FDPIR, are eligible to receive benefits regardless of whether they contain a Native American. DATES: This interim rule becomes effective February 10, 1994. Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Philip K. Cohen, Chief, Program Administration Branch, Food Distribution Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 502, Alexandria, Virginia 22302&hyph;1594, telephone (703) 305&hyph;2662.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification Executive Order 12866 This interim rule is issued in conformance with E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12). Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has certified that this interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since this rule will not result in significant changes in participation for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Food Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma, the impact on Indian Tribal Organizations and State agencies which participate in these programs will be minimal.

Paperwork Reduction Act This interim rulemaking imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to Office of Management and Budget review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520).
