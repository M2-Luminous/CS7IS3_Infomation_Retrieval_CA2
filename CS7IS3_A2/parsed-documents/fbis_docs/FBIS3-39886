Former Bavarian Minister-President Max Streibl had met secretly with Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber last November. [passage omitted] Streibl acted "stupidly," said Juergen Ruettgers, Christian Democratic Union [CDU] parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group. It is "completely idiotic" when leading politicians meet with the Republikaner chairman, CDU Deputy Horst Eylmann said. However, one should not overestimate Streibl's action. Guenther Mueller of the CSU called for dealing politically with the Republikaner. "However, the question arises of whether this must be done on one's own sofa at home." Last Saturday [12 February], Streibl called his CSU chairman and told him what had happened. Finance Minister Theo Waigel was assured of the private nature of the meeting and, outwardly he reacted with Bavarian calmness. The CSU's attitude toward the Republikaner has not changed: There will not be any cooperation with them. Asked whether it is prudent to meet with Schoenhuber at this time, Waigel said that everyone has to justify this to himself; the party cannot decide this. Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair viewed the action as a temporary clouding of his party colleague's political instinct. Streibl will "come to his senses again," his deputy of the Upper Bavarian CSU said. Zehetmair ruled out the idea that his party colleague might join the Republikaner. "I think he is too smart for that." Zehetmair called the Republikaner the "declared opponents" of the CSU. Schoenhuber announced: "Streibl did not give me any internal CSU information." In the same breath, he yesterday rejected the accusation that he had told DER SPIEGEL about the meeting. "I state categorically and unambiguously that I did not talk about the meeting, which took place months ago, and that I strictly adhered to the agreed confidentiality." Yesterday Alliance 90/Greens in the Bavarian Landtag demanded that Streibl be watched by the Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Anyone who cultivates friendly contacts with the chairman of a right-wing extremist party and fans hatred of foreigners must be counted among the sympathizers of this party, which is hostile to the Constitution. Interior Minister Beckstein, who is officially responsible to such requests, did not want to comment. He is on vacation until Ash Wednesday, it was said in his office.
