FBIS4-13757 "drnes079_j_94011" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Official Denies YSP Claims; Army Attacks Kidnappers' Site Official Denies YSP Claims; Army Attacks Kidnappers' Site JN2204183094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1700 GMT 22 Apr 94 JN2204183094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Text] A northern Yemeni official denied in Sanaa today that military reinforcements were sent to the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade which is stationed in the south, saying planes are transporting only food and medicine to troops stationed in the area. The Yemeni official, who asked not to be named, said northern planes are now assuming this task because supplies for the al- 'Amaliqah Brigade were cut off by the southern 20th Brigade in Mukayris, the point from which these items reached the Abyan area north of Aden where the al-'Amaliqah brigade is stationed. The north Yemeni official was responding to a Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] statement issued last night accusing northern forces of sending reinforcements to the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in the south of the country. The YSP statement said seven helicopters carrying arms, military equipment, and troops landed at the al-'Amaliqah brigade's military camp and that at least 10 tanks and missile carriers were brought to beef up northern army positions in the central part of the previous border between the two parts of Yemen. On another level, the Yemeni Army today attacked a site where the Jahm tribal elements have been detaining for one month three Netherlands nationals in a mountainous area, 200 km east of Sanaa. The Ma'rib district governor left for the site in an attempt to release the three captives, who had been working in a project to supply the capital with water. The kidnappers are trying to force the Yemeni authorities to employ members of the Jahm tribe in oil companies and the army.
