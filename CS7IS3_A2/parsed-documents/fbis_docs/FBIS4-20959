Authorities have confirmed that Bolivian and Peruvian coca crops are being moved to Colombia and that the number of coca plantations has increased 100 percent in the past four years. This prompts a new and distressing situation in our country. [Begin Colombian Drug Director Gabriel De Vega recording] We are becoming a country that produces coca and are very close to supplanting Bolivia for second place, after Peru, as a coca producing country. [end recording] The situation is developing as a result of Peru's struggle against the aircraft that transport coca base from that country to Colombia to be processed into cocaine. The large number of planes downed by the Peruvians has caused pilots involved in drug trafficking to decide to leave the business or to charge too much. [Begin De Vega recording] Confronted with this situation, for example, they prefer to shift coca growing to Colombia, even if it is not as productive as in Peru. They would rather increase the number of crops to compensate for the loss in productivity. [end recording] This situation is making Colombia not only a cocaine processing and marketing country, but also a coca grower as big as Bolivia.
