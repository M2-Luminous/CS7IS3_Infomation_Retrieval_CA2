Although he rarely gives interviews, this one, he said, was, as it were, uncontested, and after the observation given above as the original title he continued with a serious, almost leaden, expression and a quiet, even-pitched voice. "As I said, I have spent quite a bit of time in the capital of Yugoslavia, and I keep on wondering: What happened? What happened to the environment in which people were the first and most free in raising their head against the tyranny of the former regime. I know that there have been attempts at clustering of groups and individuals, statements against the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, but all of that is surprisingly little and feeble." [Banjac] What happened here in Bosnia? [Silajdzic] Should I say that what happened here was war! That 200,000 people have been killed, that people here murdered, raped, and massacred... mainly non-Serbs -- Muslims. In any case, there seems to be an erroneous idea of Bosnia, especially of Muslims. It is one thing to lie to someone else and something else to lie to yourself. As though knowledge of this republic never went beyond jokes and consideration of it as a twilight zone. This corresponds to the notion that the officers force-fed into many people's minds. Not much is known even about Sarajevo. You people there are still associating us too much (exclusively) with good sausage and music. Sevdah [lover's longing] and merak [lover's sadness], which are also close to the Serbian spirit and mentality, but that falls short. [Banjac] What is that other dimension of Bosnia? [Silajdzic] Cosmopolitanism, it is inherent here, there is a cultural polyvalence here which gave rise to a historic quality which people there are not aware of. At the same time, suddenly faced with am opponent they could not defeat with tanks, they were astonished. Faced with an opponent who defends himself with his spirit, his intelligence, his ability to represent himself and find friends. They are confused in the face of those facts. Today all doors are open to Bosnia (but look at Serbia and Belgrade, which a decade ago was on the way to becoming a regional center and developing, and now it is imploding). We are received and respected by everyone. In world capitals I meet hundreds of intellectuals from Serbia, young men and women who are melting away in a kind of bitterness, in some kind of unproductive nihilism, in the belief that the best years of their lives have been taken from them. Because of an archaic view of the world in which blood and violence to territory take preference over much more important things. As though we came out of the cave yesterday. [Banjac] Nationality is an obsession of many people at the moment? [Silajdzic] Yes, but that is not clear to me. People are born Serbs or Bosnian Muslims without doing anything about it. If they do not go beyond that, if they do not add any values above that, this means that they have wasted their lives. Another problem is that many are aware of this and want to add some meaning, some value per se, to that flight of theirs as a Serb, as a Croat, or as a Bosnian Muslim. By the very fact that I am a Serb, there is nothing more in life that I need. Or possibly the murder of non-Serbs in order to prove oneself as a Serb. Where is the logic here, the sense of the future? This has never been altogether clear to me. Second, conquering territory as Bosnia was conquered after an archaic model -- the lobbing of steel into cities -- makes no sense at all today. [Banjac] Who has had what part in destroying Bosnia? [Silajdzic] On the territory controlled by Karadzic's Serbs there is no longer a single mosque (they have been keeping livestock in them, destroying them, some they have used as parking lots), all the way from Foca to Banja Luka; on the territory under control of the government and the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina the churches are not being demolished. You have seen for yourself that the other day we repaired the Holy Transfiguration Church in New Sarajevo, which the Serbian forces had destroyed from the hills. The money was furnished by the government. [Banjac] The horrible institution of the camp has also been revived in the Bosnian war.... [Silajdzic] Manjaca and Omarska are Treblinka and Auschwitz in our eyes. I have talked with the raped women -- they were raped by men from Serbia. We held about 40 people in Tarcin, prisoners of war from Karadzic's military units near Sarajevo. (In Kula the Serbs are holding Bosnians, 22 people were taken out from there and murdered in the woods near Rudo. They were natives of Doboj.) As far as Tarcin is concerned, there has been a great deal of manipulation with the break into the prison, but the entire truth is that recently a group of refugees from Gorazde broke into the prison and took away three people. Here in Bosnia there is much from the Stone Age in any case. No one knows what is happening to the Bosnian Muslims in Prijedor, in Banja Luka. [Banjac] How do you view the Washington agreement? [Silajdzic] The agreement did not come about overnight. It was talked about back last year (Izetbegovic, Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, Miomir Zuzul, Ivo Komsic, and I), but the United States role was decisive. However, there is a big job to be done in the field, since quite a few people were caught by surprise. When someone asked why the United States is so important, I reply: Whenever we have been in a situation of correcting the injustice imposed by adoption of the embargo, as was the case, for example, with Igman or Gorazde, we call the United States. We know that the Russians are backing Serbia, and only a political illiterate would fail to seek a balance from the United States. [Banjac] What do you think about President Izetbegovic? There is talk about certain differences of opinion? [Silajdzic] I think that he is humane, that he tolerates differing opinions. That has of course occurred, and as far as the two of us are concerned, we resolve those things directly and openly. From him I am learning patience, which I otherwise lack in my approach from a reasonable and tolerant viewpoint. This is a man who has given his all in the struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is not a conventional politician. In a way Bosnia is identified outside, in the eyes of the world, with my insignificance. There is no difference in how we see Bosnia. To be sure, a few people have obviously been trying to rig some kind of disagreements between us and to bring me artificially into confrontation with the president, by spreading stories and by lobbying. This is done by people who have time on their hands, and none of it has to do with the future and the building of this state. [Box, p 5] If Need Be, We Will Defend Ourselves for Decades [Banjac] What is the future of Bosnia and of the Serbs in the part you have been fighting and striving for? [Silajdzic] As far as we are concerned, Bosnia remains within its international borders. There are no tanks or fascists to keep us from that. If need be, we will defend ourselves for decades. As far as the Serbs are concerned, those are with us are not in dispute. As for the others, there are Serbs, as far as I know, from Banja Luka to Pale. I hope that they will find sufficient strength to reject that fascism that is leading them to ruin. Ask them whether Serbs are floating down the Miljacka, are Serbian children being thrown to the lions? Call in newsmen from Belgrade to come and see what is happening here. The best thing you can do to help your people is to be with them here.
