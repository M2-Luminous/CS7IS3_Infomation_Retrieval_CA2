The two-day meeting, called by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) ministerial conference in Rome last December, is discussing ways of helping countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Hungary, Romania and Ukraine which have been hard hit by the UN-imposed sanctions. The European Community offer, in line with its programme of economic assistance to East Europe, aims to help set up a special transit corridors between these countries for trading. The corridors, which could be set up next summer, would include special customs clearance at borders for priority-rated heavy goods vehicles. One corridor could link Austria to Greece and Turkey, another Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the Ukraine. Each of the countries would offer special border crossing facilities to speed up the movement of non-Yugoslav-related freight. An international conference might be held to organize the details of such a set up. The European Commission has also suggested looking for new routes around Yugoslavia to free up present clogged roads. Countries affected by the embargo either border Serbia and Montenegro -- under UN sanctions because of their perceived role in fomenting the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- or are affected by restrictions on traffic on the River Danube.
