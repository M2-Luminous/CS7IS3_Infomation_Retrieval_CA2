Javier Solana highlighted the Spanish Government's decision to take part in cooperation agreements reached by the Western allies with Central and East European countries. Javier Solana: [Begin Solana recording] The government wants to play an active role in these cooperation activities linking the allies to Central and East European countries. Our country has already signed several cooperation agreements with Central European countries, which establish bilateral military cooperation programs; we will try to strengthen these programs. Spain has achieved -- in several cases -- development in certain fields that is comparable to that in these countries. We think that we can add experiences in the defense field that can be particularly useful to these countries. At the same time, and more specifically in the PFP framework, we will also take part in other multilateral cooperation activities with other Alliance member countries. [end recording]
