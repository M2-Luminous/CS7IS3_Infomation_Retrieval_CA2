The fact that over four million of their fellow citizens do not have jobs is one of the greatest challenges for society and the state, since the founding of the Federal Republic, Rexrodt said today in response to the latest labor market figures from Nuremberg. This is not one of the usual economic crises, but "a deep structural crisis." Rexrodt resolutely rejected "political demagogues" with "patent prescriptions." Rather, it is necessary to embark "upon the stony path of structural renewal." The economics minister called upon companies and unions to keep a sense of perspective in pay disputes. "Both sides in the current [engineering] pay dispute can signal common sense."
