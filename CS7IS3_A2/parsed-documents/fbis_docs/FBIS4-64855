The object of the exercise, in which representatives from EU [European Union] Member States, international organisations and experts from some Central and East European countries will take part, is to test the implementation of different emergency plans provided for in case of a nuclear catastrophe; it is also intended to encourage an exchange of views and experiences between those responsible for emergency services in the different countries, so as to guarantee a maximum amount of cooperation and communication in case of a real catastrophe. The European Commissioner responsible for European policy in matters of civil protection, Ioannis Paleokrassis, stressed the importance of such an exercise.
