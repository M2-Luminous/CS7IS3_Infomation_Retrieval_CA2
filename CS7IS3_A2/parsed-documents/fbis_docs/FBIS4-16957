After a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, a news conference was held for the mass media representatives. We invite you to listen to the speech by Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. [Begin Radetskyy recording] We have an opportunity to welcome Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik on the land of Ukraine. This visit is a symbol of developing friendly relations between our countries. The signing in 1992 of the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between our countries became the first official step in this direction. However, in my opinion, our peoples' good feelings toward each other extend far beyond the limits of official documents. It may not be out of place to recall that Ukraine and the Republic of Estonia recognized each other's independence and sovereignty as far back as 1921. The fact that this independence was later crossed out mercilessly was not our predecessors' guilt, but their bad luck. Today, we must remember this to prevent numerous tragedies of the past from happening again, and, unfortunately, there are too many of these in the historical memory of our people. It is with this very aim that both Estonia and Ukraine strive to join the family of European nations as fully-fledged members, and show concern for the consolidation of security and stability on our continent. Already now, after the first exchange of opinions with the minister, I can make a conclusion that our views of the future architecture of European security coincide in their majority. In particular, we see great prospects in the implementation of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. This is a real chance to establish genuinely partnership relations with the countries of the West and East, and prevent the return to the times of military-political confrontation. We do not see any substantial reasons for which any country, if it is guided by good will, can be denied access to this program which does not contradict the national legislation of the countries-participants, respects their sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is exactly on these grounds that we are trying to solve the painful for Ukraine issue of the future of the Black Sea Fleet. Already, we have firm intentions in the near future to come to an understanding with Russia as far as this complicated issue is concerned. Ukraine has always been against the deployment of foreign troops on the territories of other states without their clearly expressed consent. Our stand on this issue is clear regarding both purely domestic problems facing Ukraine and international precedents. This is exactly why we show understanding of Estonia's stand concerning the withdrawal of the Russian troops from their national territory. In my opinion, the current year must become a decisive year in solving this problem. I am deeply convinced that the development of good-neighborly and sincere relations between countries of Eastern and Central Europe, within the context of the all-European processes, allows the future to be viewed with optimism. The deepening of the Ukrainian-Estonian dialogue is part of this future. With Mr. Kannik we signed an agreement on military cooperation. This is an important and far-reaching document. It lays down a basis for military-scientific cooperation, mutual interaction in the military education sphere, retraining of troops, social protection of servicemen, and other issues. We felt the desire of the Estonian side to build these relations on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. I hope that during the meetings with government officials and with Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials our Estonian partners will have an opportunity to concrete these principles essentially. I am convinced that the development of bilateral contacts between the military departments of Ukraine and Estonia is useful for our states and peoples.
