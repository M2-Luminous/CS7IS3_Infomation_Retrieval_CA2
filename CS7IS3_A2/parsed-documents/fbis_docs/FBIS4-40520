"The Russian Federation now admits that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. We are quite satisfied with this approach. However, Ukraine should play a leading part in solving the problems of the Black Sea Navy," Kravchuk said. Touching upon differences between Russian and Ukrainian approaches to these problems, Kravchuk pointed out that Ukraine cannot accept the formulation which Russia wants to force upon it, namely that Sevastopol is a base of the Russian Navy. "Sevastopol cannot be a base of the Russian Navy," he said. Ukraine proposes another formulation: "A base of the Russian Navy in Sevastopol" rather than "the Sevastopol base of the Russian Navy." "The whole thing should be adopted in accordance with international principles and agreements. Naturally, it may be a matter of other bases of our country, too, where ships of Russian and Ukrainian Navies may be placed," Kravchuk added. When in the division's quarters, Kravchuk familiarized himself with the servicemen's combat readiness, their way of life and watched them taking part in demonstration exercises. Kravchuk will leave Izmail for Odessa late at night.
