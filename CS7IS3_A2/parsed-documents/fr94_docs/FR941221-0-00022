FR941221-0-00022 FR941221-0-00009 In response to requests for clarification, these temporary regulations differ from the previously proposed regulations in two ways. First, the previously proposed regulations would have required the electronic system established by the employer to document occasions of employee access. The temporary regulations provide that the system need not document all such occasions; the system need only document those occasions of employee access that result in a change to the Form W&hyph;4. Second, the previously proposed regulations would have required the employer to supply the IRS with a hard copy of the electronic Form W&hyph;4 upon request. The temporary regulations clarify that, while the hard copy must contain exactly the same information as the paper Form W&hyph;4, it need not be a facsimile of the paper form. One commentator expressed concern about the requirement that the electronic filing contain exactly the same information as the paper Form W&hyph;4. This commentator stated that such a requirement would be unduly burdensome if it encompassed the worksheets accompanying the form as well as the Form W&hyph;4 certificate itself. That result is not contemplated. The worksheets are intended merely as a convenience to the employee, to assist the employee in completing the form. The IRS therefore does not anticipate that the worksheets would be included as part of the information in the electronic filing. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information: The principal author of these regulations is Russ Weinheimer, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
