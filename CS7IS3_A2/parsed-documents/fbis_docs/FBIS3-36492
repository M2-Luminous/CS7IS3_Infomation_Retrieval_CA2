The video report shows clips from the visit of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in Serbia; a brief interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic; and scenes of fighting and Geneva talks. The program also includes short interviews by unidentified correspondents with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev; Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy, the commander of a Russian battalion in the UN forces; and Presidential Council member Sergey Karaganov. No indication was given when or where the interviews were recorded. A correspondent asks Kozyrev what the chances are for a peaceful settlement in Bosnia in the "foreseeable future." Kozyrev replies: "First, there is no other way. Second, foreseeable future is a fairly elastic concept. I think that there is still a chance -- perhaps even in the immediate future, perhaps after another round of exchanging blows -- the sides will return to Geneva and, in general terms, 95 percent of the plan could be agreed very quickly, and about 5 percent, we believe, could be handed over to international arbitration. This is one of the special features of the Russian initiative on Yugoslavia, that is, for that 5 percent. That's not very much in terms of territory." Commenting on the possibility of air strikes against Serb positions, Col. Voznesenskiy says: "The selective air strikes planned in the interests of protecting UN forces won't, in general terms, solve the conflict that has arisen in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, I believe that it will entail stepped up activity by the sides against UN forces, which will entail losses among UN forces and their being taken hostage. And, of course, there will be retaliatory measures, mass strikes that will lead to great human losses, and destruction, and it cannot be ruled out that the conflict that exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina will spread far beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia." A correspondent asks Presidential Council member Karaganov: "Where will the Bosnian crisis end and when?" He replies: "I think that it will last another year or two, until the sides exhaust their moral, economic, and other resources and then perhaps the most unpleasant thing that can happen will occur. The former Yugoslavia, and primarily Bosnia, will be divided by force of arms. One of the main postulates of the new European politics over the last few decades will be finally breached, maliciously and irrevocably -- the inadmissibility of changing borders by force of arms. Bosnia will be carved up by Croatia and Serbia, and the Muslims will get what they are given -- but this will be a deeply unjust solution. To my great regret I can say that the world will reconcile itself with this."
