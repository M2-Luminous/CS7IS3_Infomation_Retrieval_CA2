This praiseworthy pledge came amid predictions that the country's gross domestic product would grow by 8 to 8.5 percent next year, up from anticipated growth of 7.5 percent this year. But achieving the worthy goal of progress without pain and pollution is going to take a lot more than mere words. One major weapon at his disposal is the Environment Protection Act--a legacy of the Anan Panyarachun administration. It provides the mechanism and opportunity with which to curb the activities of greed-obsessed, influential proponents of development at any cost. But awareness of the spirit behind the act, as well as the law itself, has yet to make much of an impact on the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it. There is a crying need to educate the educators and launch a well-coordinated environmental awareness campaign among government units and members of the general public. The Act can provide a national blueprint for cleaning and preserving our natural environment, but this will require the kind of firm central direction that Mr Chuan seems to have in mind. To put it even more simply, its provisions must be enforced. The environment--our air, water, land, forests and other natural gifts of our country--belong to all of us. As we have said before and will stress again, this includes not only the Government and profit-making businesses but also the farmers and the assembly-line workers, city-dwellers and rural villagers, military and civilian. No one among any of these groups has exclusivity. All of us have the responsibility of using resources without wasting them. Like most people in the world, we have become aware in recent years that the richness of our country is not infinite. There is still, however, little which could be called a meeting of minds on how to deal with this growing problem. To some, it appears that each step forward on environmental matters is met with two steps backwards and there is a disconcerting lack of public debate on many issues which affect us all. Too often they tend to be presented to us as a fait accompli and then the avoidable agonising and demonstrations begin. The saga of the Pak Mun dam--rarely out of the headlines for long--provides a classic example of this. Although we have a ministry of science, technology and environment there is a feeling that this government body does little more than pay lipservice to major environmental concerns. A broad segment of the population would welcome a ministry with the mandate to monitor and regulate all developments which fall under the general heading of environment but there is little evidence that this exists in an effective form. All concerned agencies should be gathered together under a single roof so they can coordinate with each other and work together, rather than against, each other. A World Bank report recently noted that pollution in Asia is growing faster than the region's economies. Our economy doubled in size from 1975 to 1988, but industrial emissions grew 8 to 12 times worse, the report says. No clearer indication is needed that it is time to stop the establishment of industries which pollute, and to force present-day polluters to clean up. There is no need for new laws or regulations in most cases. These exist in abundance. The problem is that they also exist in limbo, far too often. Enforcement of existing anti-pollution regulations and those governing illegal building would perform a near miracle to the beginning stage of a true, national environmental awareness campaign. At present we seem to support the principle rather than the act of conserving the environment. Take, for example, the concert outside Khao Yai National Park in October supposedly to promote environmental awareness. The irony was that afterwards the ground was strewn with rubbish. A ministry or department charged with responsibility for the environment must not only have the powers to enforce these laws and regulations, but be willing to do so, even when this pits them against powerful special interest groups. If the Government is unwilling to use this power, then it cannot claim to be truly concerned about the environment. Such an entity must also be made to be responsive to the will of all Thais because the essence of democracy is that a government is answerable to its people. For a ministry of environment to be effective it must invite public debate. Such transparency would not only be "environmentally friendly"--it would also bring a breath of fresh air to the workings of government in a democratic society. Only by adopting these measures can Mr. Chuan achieve his commendable goal.
