Criticality is the point at which the reaction in the reactor's fissionable material is sufficient to sustain a chain reaction. It was attained at 10:01 A.M. when workers at the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen) in Monju pulled the last of 19 control rods to a point just short of its total removal from the reactor. Gradual removal of the last rod, at the center of the reactor, began in four stages from shortly before 9 A.M., allowing the reactor to reach criticality with it 70 percent removed. The goal was achieved eight years and six months after construction of the plant got under way in October 1985 and after three postponements. Start-up of the 600 billion yen plant was delayed for a third time last October because of a technical malfunction in fuel production facilities last July. The reactor is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide. Japan has made fast breeder reactors, which produce more fissionable material than they consume, a cornerstone of its nuclear power policy. The power industry intends to have two fully operational fast breeder reactors built by 2003. The Monju reactor has the capacity to produce 280,000 kilowatts of electricity. The Monju core contains a total of 1.4 tons of reactor-grade plutonium and 4.5 tons of depleted uranium. Monju represents the third stage in the government's plan to develop a fast breeder reactor, beginning with an earlier experimental reactor "Joyo" which reached criticality in 1977 in Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture. Scientists say Monju-style reactors use fuel 60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. One of the features of Monju is its use of liquid sodium coolant which has a high heat conducting capacity. The reactor is scheduled to go on line supplying electricity from April 1995 and become a commercially operating supplier by December the same year. Several industrialized countries which were developing fast breeder reactors have shut down their projects, citing high costs and safety factors. Some international critics say that since the Cold War is over, Japan should not rely on fast breeder reactors for energy self-sufficiency because they produce fuel that can be diverted to nuclear weapons. Residents near the reactor are still fighting suits in the courts against Donen and the government urging a halt to the construction and running of the reactor. But the power industry has welcomed the criticality of Monju as a step toward the commercialization of fast breeder reactors. A meeting of the heads of nine of the nation's major power suppliers in January outlined plans for producing 6.6 million kilowatts of power from fast breeder reactors, the first of which would begin construction soon after 2000 in time for commercial operation by 2003. A fully operational fast breeder reactor costs an estimated 400 billion yen, about 1.5 times the cost of a light water reactor. At present, some 30 percent of Japan's electricity is generated by 42 nuclear reactors throughout the country. Japan by 2010 will be annually using some 50 tons of plutonium mixed with uranium for light-water reactors and about 35 tons more for fast breeder reactors, according to the country's energy plan.
