There was an urgent need to consider upgradation of the MiG-21 being flown by the Indian Air Force, said Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, Chief of Air Staff here. India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), which would replace the MiG-21s, would enter operational service only around 2005, the Air Chief Marshal said at a press conference at the Bangalore air show today. The budgetary cuts had also made it necessary for the Air Force to prioritise its requirements. As a result, the upgradation of the MiG-21s, which the Air Force has used for over three decades, assumed importance. By upgrading the aircraft, it was possible to get enhanced capabilities with a smaller outlay. There had been offers from various vendors and countries, he said in reply to a question. All the offers were being looked into. No decision had yet been taken, he added. Full scale mock-up: Many of the companies which would be involved in the upgradation were present at the air show. The Russians had a full scale mock-up of the upgraded MiG on show. `We can offer India the option of Russian or Western avionics,' said a spokesman for MiG. The company had tie-ups with French companies, such as Thompson-CSF, and could offer Western avionics but at a higher cost. The improved MiG-21 would have significantly increased combat capabilities against air and ground targets. It would also be able to use the most up to date air-to-air missiles. The Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) too is offering to upgrade the MiG-21s and had a mock-up of the improved cockpit on display. `We can provide the F-16's avionics capabilities for the MiG-21,' said an IAI spokesman. The cockpit would be completely modernised and the IAI upgraded MiG-21s would be able to carry both Western and Eastern weapons. the upgradation of each aircraft would not cost more than $3.5 millions. HAL in fray: The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) too is in the fray. `Apart from the Russians, we are the people best acquainted with the MiG-21,' said a company official. HAL too has a mock-up of its upgraded cockpit on show. HAL had already carried out several improvements on the MiG-21, and could offer the best mix of Indian, Russian and Western systems for upgradation, he said. It may be possible to use some of the electronic systems developed for the LCA in the MiG-21 upgrade. French avionics suppliers may well be major beneficiaries if either HAL or Russia gets the contract for the upgradation. The French companies have turned out in strength for the Bangalore air show and include the Thomson group and Sagem. Both companies point out the suitability of their systems for upgrading the MiG-21. HAL already manufactures under licence an inertial navigation and attack system of Sagem, for its Jaguar strike aircraft.
