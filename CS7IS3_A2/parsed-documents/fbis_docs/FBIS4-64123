Liberals say there is no need to appoint new members to the Cabinet before the upcoming general meeting of the senior party in the ruling coalition, the Pro Patria. "A status quo should be retained in the government until the Pro Patria general meeting, and the vacancies should be filled with acting ministers," said Eero Tohver, adviser to the faction of the Liberals. The Moderates, however, insist that the opinion of Pro Patria as a coalition partner should be trusted. "We are not going to bring any dissenting opinion with respect to the nomination of new ministers," Moderate faction chairman Toivo Jullinen said. Prime Minister Mart Laar Tuesday [24 May] proposed to the council of the governing coalition the nominations of Urmas Arumae as the new justice minister and Raul Opik as the defense minister. Arumae, 37, has graduated from Tartu University, faculty of law. He wrote his Master's thesis in international business administration with San Francisco University in 1992. Arumae set up his own law firm, Concordia, after resigning as vice president of Silves Enterprises Ltd. Arumae is the president of the Estonian Lawyers Union. He was failed as Pro Patria's candidate for the Tallinn mayor's office in last year's local elections. Raul Opik, currently officer at the Estonian Central Staff, graduated from Tartu University as biologist. Has worked as a teacher and gone in for amateur flying. Opik participated in the 1993 World Championship of Glider Flying. He completed a training course in Sweden for staff officers of the UN peacekeeping forces last year and took part in UN operations in Croatia.
