Earlier requests by the German ambassador in Damascus had so far been met with "partly irritated and partly negative" responses from the Syrian authorities, Hartmut Hilldenberg of the German foreign ministry said Monday [21 March]. He is a witness to a court hearing dealing with the 1983 attack on the French cultural centre in West Berlin, Maison de France, in which one person died and 23 were injured. The Syrians have denied involvement in the incident. However, a Syrian diplomat admitted that Damascus supported the Carlos group in the early 1980s. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Chareh, in Bonn Thursday to express the German demands for the extradition of Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos and his German associate Johannes Weinrich. Investigators believe those who carried out the attack wanted to free another one of Carlos' associates, a German woman named Magdalena Kopp. In 1982 she was sentenced to four years imprisonment in France for possessing explosives.
