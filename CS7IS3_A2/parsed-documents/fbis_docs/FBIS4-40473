This document consecrates the "indivisible land" of the existing collective farm-cooperatives and makes it impossible to allocate a plot (a share) of land to a collective farmer who wants to break away. The peasant's unconditional right to freely determine his own fate is replaced by whatever decision is reached by a general meeting, which is easily manipulated by our rural feudal lords. In approving the law the deputies were not deterred by the fact that many articles in the above law contravene the Russian Federation Civil Code which earlier also passed its first reading in this same Duma. Igor Lukhashev, a deputy in the "Yabloko" faction, described the passing of the draft law as "perpetuating the basis for feudal relations in agriculture." In the voting, the document was supported by 248 deputies, with 50 voting against. Such is the real value of the present attempts by people in the Duma to pose as fighters for human rights.
