He granted Russia a $30-million line of credit for Argentine exports. Di Tella told EFE that this mechanism ensures that credit and debt columns are closed and the difference is paid. Argentina currently owes Russia about $150 million and therefore wants to resume exports to Moscow. The foreign minister added that the $30-million line of credit is not included in the compensation mechanism that Argentina wants to implement. Di Tella stated that during today's political talks with Kozyrev, on the first day of his three-day official visit to Moscow, that he indicated the time has come to maintain complete and fruitful relations because Russia has a greater trade "focus." The foreign minister stated earlier that Russia and Argentina are a part of the new world process in which rapprochement between nations is made on the basis of peace, cooperation, and mutual respect. The Argentine foreign minister expressed surprise over the situation in Russia which is much better than what one reads and hears from afar--especially the remarks of the ultranationalist Vladimir Yirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic Party won the most recent parliamentary elections. "One can see that this country is moving and it will have a lot of influence" when it overcomes its crisis in less time than most people believe, Di Tella said. The foreign minister stated that Russia is "a great power with problems," but when it overcomes them "there is no doubt" it will be one of the world's great powers. Di Tella will meet with Vice Premier Alexandr Shojin on 17 May. During the meeting he will again discuss the economic agreement and the viability of increasing Argentine exports to Russia. "I am discovering that no one is against reform," Di Tella said, although they differ over time spans and tactics. During his meeting today with the architects of these reforms--Yegor Gaidar and economist Grigori Yablinski, who is the leader of the moderate opposition--Di Tella plans to find out "the depth of the dangers facing the reform." Following his 14 May meetings with the progressive mayor of Saint Petersburg and with his Russian colleague, Di Tella said that "when one speaks with (Anatoly) Sobchak and Kozyrev, one can see that they are sensible people."
