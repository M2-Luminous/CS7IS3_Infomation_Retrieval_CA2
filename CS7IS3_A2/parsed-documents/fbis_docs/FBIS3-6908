Such a suggestion was based on a selective reading of statements by Crosby Securities analyst, Manu Bhaskaran, to the Internal Security Department, he said on day 37 of the Official Secrets Act trial. He was referring to the prosecution's written submissions which had mentioned Bhaskaran's "admission of a direct communication of the flash estimate" to BT journalist Kenneth James. Mr. Khoo described this as a "phantom admission", saying it did not exist in his client's statements. Bhaskaran, he noted, had told James that he came arross the 4.6 percent figure inadvertently and did not know it was the official flash estimate. He had doubts about it because he thought the figure was too low. This did not amount to an admission that he had communicated official data, Mr. Khoo argued. Attorney-General Chan Sek Beong countered that the lawyer had taken his submission out of context. The prosecution's argument was that whatever Bhaskaran now said, he had sighted the 4.6 percent figure, which turned out to be the official flash estimate. Mr. Khoo replied: "It may well be that the 4.6 figure was the flash estimate. But my client is not charged with having made a good guess of what it was, but with communicating it. The fact that it turned out to be the flash estimate is irrelevant." Bhaskaran faces one charge of receiving the official flash estimate and two of communicating it. Continuing his submission yesterday, Mr. Khoo said there were other instances in which the prosecution had relied on parts of his client's statements, while ignoring others. This was wholly untenable, he said, urging the court to read the statements in in context. He also maintained that the prosecution had failed to produce evidence to prove that Bhaskaran was BT's source of the data. The information was widely known among BT staffers and could have come from elsewhere, he said. James could have been mistaken when he told a colleague that Bhaskaran was his source. He had told Bhaskaran that he woke up one night with the thought that the analyst "was not the one", the lawyer noted. Besides, noted Mr. Khoo, Bhaskaran is alleged to have told James about the flash estimate for the overall economy only. But, after speaking with one of its reporters, chief statistician Paul Cheung had concluded that BT knew about the growth figures for various sectors of the economy as well. It was possible some other source, and not Bhaskaran, had leaked both the sectoral figures and the official flash estimate to BT, he said. BT correspondent Anna Teo had also told Mr. Lai Seck Khui, the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, that BT had obtained the information from government sources, he added. The prosecution is expected to respond to his submissions later this week.
