The presiding judge was Le Thuc Anh, deputy chief judge of the Municipal People's Court; the prosecutor was Truong Hoang Minh, chief of the security investigations bureau of the Municipal People's Organ of Control. Defendants Trinh Van Thuong, Nguyen Thanh Van, Nguyen Duc Loi, Nguyen Van Trong, and Nguyen Huu Son were military officers under the former regime. In 1978, while undergoing re-education, they created the so-called Vietnam People's Party under the leadership of Trinh Van Thuong with objective of overthrowing the "revolutionary government." After leaving re-education, they helped Nguyen Thanh Van flee to contact reactionary groups overseas in order to organize forces to oppose and sabotage the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In November 1990, Van returned from the United States, re-established contact with Thuong, Loi, and Son, and helped set up the "Hung Gia Dai Viet United Front," chaired by Son. They launched their "Nguyen Trai campaign" but did not achieve the desired result. Next, Thuong discussed with Loi the idea of exploiting some unresolved complaints about ricefields by a number of peasants from Gia Tan 3 Village, Thong Nhat District, Dong Nai Province, to incite them to oppose the authorities. In May 1991, Van returned to Vietnam and planned with Loi and Thuong to organize the Gia Tan 3 peasants to demonstrate in Ho Chi Minh City. Van intended to photograph the demonstration as evidence that he could take abroad in order to seek support from exile groups. On 16 June 1991, Nguyen Van Chinh and La Thi Na organized about 100 peasants who gathered at Office 2 of the Council of Ministers; Van, Thuong, and Loi were also there to observe and take pictures. All three were uncovered and arrested afterwards. The Municipal People's Court ruled that Van, Thuong, Loi, Son, and Trong were reactionaries who had carried out many acts against the people's government. Chinh and Na, though knowing the five were "bad elements", had cooperated with them to organize two demonstrations. After discussing the defendants' roles and degrees of guilt, the court handed down prison sentences: Nguyen Duc Loi, 11 years; Trinh Van Thuong, 10 years; Nguyen Thanh Van, nine years; Nguyen Huu Son, six years; Nguyen Van Trong, three years; Nguyen Van Chinh, 32 months; La Thi Na, 30 months.
