In Belgrade, the capital of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Kozyrev "will take part in talks on Bosnian settlement," the sources said. The talks will also be attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy in the region Vitaly Churkin, who also is deputy foreign minister. According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, both Kozyrev and Churkin persuaded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to cancel plans for new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs who, as NATO said, had shelled the town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned Kozyrev on Saturday morning to tell him that NATO aircraft were ready to launch new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs, the ITAR-TASS said. Kozyrev immediately informed Churkin, who was in the Serb- controlled city of Pale near Sarajero, about his telephone talk with Christopher. The Russian envoy soon contacted Bosnian Serb leaders and reported back that there was no artillery shelling of Gorazde. In addition, Bosnian Serb army commander General Radko Mladic assured Churkin that his troops will not storm Gorazde or shell it. Moscow quickly relayed this information to Washington and preparations for new air strikes were cancelled, the ITAR-TASS said. However, the news agency reported, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka on Saturday that Serb troops have not entered Gorazde but have seized all strategic heights around it.
