This briefing was attended by my colleague, esteemed Andriy Chyrva. Chyrva: [passage omitted: introductory remarks] You may be aware by now of the situation where some of the mass media, in particular REUTERS and the Voice of America, reported yesterday that Ukraine had taken 17 SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles off combat alert. This issue, naturally being of great interest to journalists, they wanted to hear the confirmation of that fact from Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Borys Tarasyuk, who took part in the briefing. I would like to say that this issue is quite complex and I would like to be precise and quote precisely what Borys Tarasyuk said. Announcer: Please do. Chyrva: He said that the early deactivation program did not only cover the SS-19 missile systems. This was due to the complexity of these installations, consisting of not only missiles, but nuclear warheads subject to guaranteed maintenance terms of their own. Thus, what it concerns is not separate types of missile systems, but exactly those where the term of guaranteed maintenance is running out, that are being taken off combat alert or are subject to the early deactivation program. This, as it were, is what Mr. Tarasyuk officially stated. Announcer: So this is the first report that somewhat contravenes the one carried, in particular, by the REUTERS agency. It adds quite essentially to the accuracy [of what is at issue] too, in my view. That is to say, what concerns is that only those ballistic missiles are at issue that have already become lifeless, as it were, or not combat ready. Is that so? Chyrva: Yes, of course. Tarasyuk said that work was under way in Ukraine to carry out the so-called deactivation of missile systems. In essence, it is to remove the warheads and store them in Ukraine at a considerable distance from the missile sites. This is what, in my view, the issue is. The second important issue, raised by Borys Tarasyuk, was that of the participation of the Ukrainian delegation at the consultative meeting with representatives of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] member countries. [passage omitted: Chyrva reporting on Tarasyuk's account of government measures to control the export of strategic materials] Chyrva: Another interesting issue: Mr. Tarasyuk produced quite a large folder or file containing materials on the list of commodities and technologies prohibited from being transferred or traded to Ukraine by Cocom member countries. You know that this issue was very sensitive for us at the time of the Cold War and there were restrictions -- and very extensively so too -- that were in the way of our trade with the West, and that between the West and ourselves. That is why this whole issue now -- and Mr. Tarasyuk spoke about it -- should be raised and somehow agreed so that our relations in trade and economic relations with the West could, after all, develop properly and so that we could trade, including trade in high technologies and dual-purpose technologies. [passage omitted: announcer reiterating the above] Chyrva: What I would also like to mention in conclusion is that (?the last) question asked, that of course concerns and interests everybody, was on arms trade, i.e. whether Ukraine trades in weapons. Announcer: Which weapons? Chyrva: I mean conventional weapons, I do not mean nuclear weapons but conventional weapons. So Mr. Tarasyuk said that on the issue of arms trade Ukraine proceeded from existing principles, and was governed by those bans on trade with those countries in respect of which there were relevant United Nations Security Council sanctions. We all know, and our foreign listeners may know, that these are such countries as the Republic of Yugoslavia, Libya, the Republic of South Africa, and Iraq. These are those countries where we [word indistinct]. As for that, I have already said that it is strictly governed by existing principles. As for where and whom arms [are being sold], it was not (?discussed). [passage omitted: announcer contemplating on Ukraine's stance on arms trade]
