The total direct investment for production over the last two years has reached $1.619 billion, while commitments for the short and medium term, through contracts with 14 foreign companies, have reached $6.75 billion. During the same period, another $1.922 billion entered the Peruvian stock exchange, especially the Lima stock market, with investments involving 1,312 foreigners (768 Chileans, 338 Americans, and 84 British). Most of the investments were made through the sale of state companies and granting mining and oil concessions to companies from Argentina, the United States, Spain, Canada, China, Chile, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and others. Those with the greatest impact were the sale of the National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru and the Peruvian Telephone Company for $2.002 billion and the signing of a contract to put into operation the largest Peruvian natural gas deposit, Camisea, with the Anglo-Dutch Shell Company with an initial investment of $2 billion. According to experts, the great participation by investors is attributed to the incentives granted by Peruvian laws, which are considered by some people to be the most liberal in Latin America. In the post-coup period, Peru was also able to return to the financial international community after reaching agreements with the IMF and the World Bank, although it has not yet been readmitted by the commercial banks. The IMF and the World Bank had virtually alienated Peru from their institutions since 1985 when then Peruvian President Alan Garcia unilaterally restricted the payment of the foreign debt. Talks with the Bank Committee of creditors began last year, but are at a standstill due to a lawsuit by the U.S. Chemical Bank for a debt of $72 million, which will apparently be resolved soon. Peru needs to reach an agreement with the private banks, to which it owes about $6 billion, so as to allow alternate financial sources that would give greater impulse to the plans for modernizing its economy. A choice proposed by Peru is to sign an agreement based on the Brady Plan, by which it would pay $1 billion in exchange for being forgiven 50 percent of the debt, about $3 billion. The economic and financial stability obtained by Peru is also based on the harsh blows dealt to the terrorist groups, mainly the Shining Path, which in 1992 was about to destabilize the Peruvian Government. The downfall of this gang began in September 1992 with the capture of its chief, Abimael Guzman, and it fell even further when he asked for a peace agreement. The Shining Path, although divided and weakened, is, however, still active, and every so often tries, each time with less force, to spread terror in an effort to scare away investors. In the political field, the Fujimori government has become internationally legitimate after holding three elections which were endorsed by observers of the OAS and other organizations. The unanimous international repudiation of the "Fujimori coup" has also been left behind, and now Peru is normalizing its relations with the rest of the world. The internal political opposition, however, has not forgiven Fujimori for the coup. It still accuses him of being a "dictator," and is trying to form a single front headed by former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to prevent his possible reelection in 1995. The preelectoral polls indicate that Perez de Cuellar is the favorite candidate for winning the elections next year, but Perez has not yet decided to run. Some analysts believe Perez de Cuellar can guarantee the continuity of the economic model, but others, like former Economy Minister Carlos Bolona, fear that Perez, with the support of the left and the right, will be pressured by those sectors, and that his eventual government will be "unviable."
