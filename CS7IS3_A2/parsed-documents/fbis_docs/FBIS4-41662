The Azerbaijan president said that in spite of his busy schedule he always, and with great pleasure, receives guests from Iran, also expressing profound condolences over a recent tragic incident in Iran: an explosion at the Mashhad mosque. The Iranian guests spoke about their visits to the Ministry of Culture and Press, the TV and Radio Company, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry the sides came to the general conclusion that the situation in the region is extremely unstable and calls for more intensive interstate contacts, discussions, and joint political actions because what is going on here noticeably impacts on world politics. In this respect Geydar Aliyev's upcoming visit to Iran is very important. Sarmedi stressed that the close friendly links that have been established between the two states should be thoroughly strengthened because these interrelations influence the whole region. President Aliyev for his part said that he is making serious preparations for his visit to Iran, attaches great importance to it, and hopes that the negotiations there will substantially help consolidate friendship and cooperation between the fraternal peoples. The meeting then went into a closed session, as was the case with the meeting between Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev and UN representative to the republic Mahmud al-Said [name as transliterated]. After a brief welcome speech the journalists were asked to go, leaving them, as usual, to guess at the content of the upcoming talks. Journalists from Habar-Service only managed to learn from a foreign diplomat that the UN appropriates to Azerbaijan $31-32 million in humanitarian aid while local UN officials want to have this sum increased to $40 million.
