These matters were included in the budget speech delivered by President Suharto on Thursday [6 January] in Parliament. First, Indonesia's population should reach 258.1 million by the end of the year 2019, and by then the country's work force should total 147.9 million. This total is based on the assumption that the country's population growth rate can be reduced to 0.88 percent from the current 1.6 percent by the end of the PJP II. Second, Indonesia's annual average economic growth for the next 25 years was projected at 7 percent due to the ever-increasing population. As an early measure, the target for the country's economic growth was projected to stand at an annual average of 6.2 percent during the Sixth Five-Year Development Program. Third, with the ever-increasing population, it was hoped that Indonesia's per capita income would reach U.S.$2,631 by the end of the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. This figure is calculated on the basis of price consistency during the 1989-90 period. Nominal prices will definitely be higher. By looking at the three factors, we would like to say that it was truly a difficult undertaking to draft the 25-year plan. Moreover, the plan had to be based on the achievements of the First Twenty-Five Year Development Program -- from 1969 to 1994 and by taking into account the people's capability in ensuring continuity in development, the ever-changing and rapid global economic situation and the numerous domestic or external difficulties that could possibly arise. The government performed an extraordinary service by simultaneously presenting all three programs to the parliament on Thursday -- the 1994-95 Budget, the Sixth Development Program, and the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. It is obvious that the three programs are interlinked. The 1994-95 budget should be a part of the Sixth Development Program while the latter should be a part of the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan or PJP II. In drawing up the Sixth Development Program and the PJP II, the government definitely focused on growth in the economic sectors (agriculture, production industries, non-gas production industries, trade, and so on). It may be observed that the agriculture sector's role will decline while the role of the industries, trade, and services will rise dramatically. However, what we wish to emphasize concerns a 69-million-person population increase from the current 189.1 million to 258.1 million by the end of PJP II and the demanding responsibility of making preparations toward providing the basic needs -- food, basic amenities, and accomodation. The most difficult task will be in ensuring adequate food supply. With the present population of 189.1 million, the annual rice production, which stands at 36 million tons -- including an insignificant amount imported as a "security" measure -- food sufficiency, particularly rice, is adequate to meet general requirements. However, a more precise calculation will be needed in trying to meet the requirements of a population of 258.1 million people by the end of the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. It will be difficult to ensure an adequate and consistent rice supply if we take into consideration our resources and capabilities. On the other hand, greater attention should be given to food sufficiency (which not only means rice but also some other kinds of food). We need to consider the importance of importing a greater volume of our basic food requirements, including rice. This would mean that Indonesia should increase its exports so that more than adequate foreign exchange will be available for importing food. Indonesia's textile production industries should make relative preparations to clothe a population of 258.1 million people. The industries should have appropriate manpower to satisfy the people's ever-changing demands. Therefore, there will definitely be an increase in the import of raw materials such as cotton. Meanwhile, there will also be an increase in the need for construction materials to build houses. Relevant services and precise estimates will be needed to eliminate every obstacle in the effort to provide housing facilities to people -- regardless of which group they belong to. It was felt that, apart from the market economy mechanism, other sectors should also participate in the construction of houses if we wish to see the lower groups possess their own houses. To sum up, the task of ensuring the adequacy of food, clothing, and accomodation for the total population is a mammoth one even though such efforts were to be carried out in stages. The average economic growth for the oncoming 25 years has been targeted at an annual rate of 7 percent. This is only a slight increase of 0.2 percent if compared to that of the First 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. It may be asked why the economic growth rate should not be at 8 or 9 percent. Why shouldn't the growth rate be similar to that of Malaysia, Thailand, or South Korea? Probably the problem can be traced to the issue of Indonesia's population, which now registers at 189.1 million and which could possibly rise to 258.1 million by the year 2019. But an opportunity and possibility exist for Indonesia's economic growth to attain a higher rate after the Sixth Development Program -- an annual average growth rate of more than 7 percent during the 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. There is one more issue we would like to raise. An economics expert, Dr. Irwan Jaya Azis, stated that the government's investment contributions in the 1994-95 budget only represents 26.8 percent of overall national investments. As such, its impact on economic growth is less than that of the 1970's. In other words, the attaintment of better economic growth lies in the hands of the business sector through their various economic and business activities. These activities have no connection whatsoever with government funds. During the upcoming 25-year period, the role of the business sector will be heavier regarding the development of economic growth. That was why the government, in its clarification at the Information Department last Wednesday, stressed the need for the business sector to conduct its business and economic activities smoothly. As such, the government emphasized its commitment to more deregulation and debureaucratization, continuously eliminating protectionism, and upgrading Indonesia's efficiency and competitiveness in the economic field. We truly acknowledge that it will be a very demanding task to try to achieve all these objectives. The government, as an institution, will definitely and undoubtedly face obstacles from the business circle and the community. However, we are confident of one thing. Only one way remains in trying to achieve an annual overall 7 percent economic growth and the per capita income of U.S.$2,631 during the upcoming 25-year period by the year 2019. Our aspiration to achieve these goals will definitely disappear if obstacles that remain in our paths are not removed.
