FR940302-1-00019 FR940302-1-00006 40 CFR Part 52 [FRL&hyph;4844&hyph;3] Notice of Cancellation of March 3, 1994 Public Hearing Scheduled in Connection With the Proposed Imposition of Statewide Sanctions on California Under Clean Air Act Section 110(m) for Failure To Submit a Complete SIP Revision for an Enhanced Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of cancellation of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is cancelling the public hearing that had been scheduled for March 3, 1994 in Los Angeles to receive public comment on its proposed imposition of discretionary sanctions on the State of California. The sanctions had been proposed because of failure by the State to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as required by the Clean Air Act for certain ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Calkins, Chief, Air Planning Branch (A&hyph;2), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105, (415) 744&hyph;1500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 3534, January 24, 1994) EPA proposed a rule for the imposition of discretionary sanctions on the State of California under section 110(m) of the Clean Air Act for failure to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle I/M Program. In the proposed rule, EPA announced its intention to finalize sanctions on California on May 15, 1994 if sufficient progress had not been made by the State toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational on or before January 1, 1995. The proposed rule announced a public hearing on the proposed action on March 3, 1994 to be held in Los Angeles. Following the January 17, 1994 earthquake in California, on January 24, 1994 EPA Administrator Carol Browner sent a letter to California Governor Pete Wilson advising him that in light of the earthquake in California and the resulting damage to the state's highway system and economy, EPA was cancelling the May 15, 1994 deadline contained in the proposed rule for finalizing sanctions on California. Based on Administrator Browner's January 24th letter, EPA is cancelling the previously scheduled public hearing of March 3, 1994. At this time EPA is not accepting public comment on this proposal. The public hearing was scheduled to be held on March 3, 1994 in the auditorium of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 111 North Hope, Los Angeles, California 90012 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Dated: February 23, 1994. David P. Howekamp, Acting Regional Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4755 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
