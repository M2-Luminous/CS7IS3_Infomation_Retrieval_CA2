FR940414-1-00061 FR940414-1-00010 b. Lines that handle dry or emulsifiable concentrate products. On lines where emulsifiable concentrates were formulated and packaged, wastewater generated from cleaning equipment interiors was assumed not to be reusable in the product. Since it is impossible to determine the portion of water generated on the line which is due to only these emulsifiable concentrate products, EPA assumed that all the water reported for those lines could not be reused. Therefore, formulation and packaging lines producing either emulsifiable concentrate or dry products were costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. c. Toll or contract formulating. Facilities that generate water during cleaning and are toll or contract formulators (i.e., the facility provides the formulating and packaging of the pesticide products as a service) may not have a consistent base of production. EPA assumes that they may not make a product more than once in any given time period and therefore may not be able to reuse cleaning water directly into product formulations. Therefore, toll or contract formulation and packaging facilities were costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. d. Lines that have a break in operations greater than 90 days. Wastewater generated from cleaning equipment interiors that will not be used to formulate that product for more than 90 days (i.e., the facility reported that the line was not producing pesticide products during four or more consecutive months in 1988) could be affected by RCRA or similar state storage rules. EPA assumed that a portion of the water generated on the line is unable to be reused in product formulation. This was costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. Some lines produced pesticide during only one period in the year. In these cases, EPA assumed that equal volumes of water would be generated for each cleaning; therefore, the total volume was divided by the number of occurrences to determine the volume of water generated during each cleaning. This volume was used to estimate the cost of treatment and reuse or off-site disposal of the last cleanout performed. The remaining volume of water was costed for storage and direct reuse back into the product. Some lines may be unable to reuse untreated water. All interior cleaning water from these lines was costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration along with the facilities' non-interior process wastewater. e. Lines that have special cleaning operations. Some facilities generate wastewater from special cleaning operations, as opposed to routine or product changeover cleaning, and have more than one product on the line. (Lines with only one product are assumed to be able to reuse water directly in the product formulation.) In situations where these lines handle the same active ingredients in all the products, EPA assumed the cleaning wastewaters could be reused directly in the product formulations. Other facilities may have some difficulty reusing water from these operations directly into product formulations with their current practices. Special cleanings are presumed to be unplanned and may result in large quantities of wastewaters that are contaminated by multiple products. In these cases, the special cleaning water was costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. f. Lines that generate more volume than could potentially be reused in the product. Based on the available information, EPA believes some facilities may generate more water from cleaning operations than could be reused. EPA used the following approach to estimate this under the following conditions: (1) The pounds of active ingredient reported to be in the product were calculated. The percent of active ingredient(s) provided by the facility in Section 3 of the questionnaire was used to determine this value: (Total Pounds Produced × Total % Active Ingredient)=Total Pounds Active Ingredient. (2) The calculated pounds of active ingredient were subtracted from the total pounds of product to determine the pounds of inert ingredients (especially diluent): (Total Pounds Produced ^ Pound of Active Ingredient)=Pounds of Inert Ingredients. (3) The pounds of inert ingredients remaining were converted to gallons: (Pounds of Inert Ingredients/8.34 pounds/gallons)=Gallons of Inert Ingredients. (4) Assume that cleaning water could be used to make up 50 percent of this volume: (Gallons of Inert Ingredients × 50 percent)=Gallons of water that can be reused. (5) Compare this value to the volume of interior equipment cleaning wastewater generated on the line: For: Gallons of water that can be reused > Total interior equipment cleaning, water is costed for reuse in the product. For: Gallons of water that can be reused " Total interior equipment cleaning, water is costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. Other conditions were reported in the questionnaires and were costed in the following ways: •Lines with multiple cleaning sequences and different steps in each sequence, often mixing water with other steps such as abrasives or detergents, were costed for off-site disposal or treatment and reuse. This is because the effect of using the abrasives or detergents along with water to clean equipment results in adding a contaminant to the wastewater that is not a constituent of the product and could thus render the wastewater incompatible for direct product recovery and reuse without treatment. •Lines with detergent solutions used to clean the interiors of equipment were costed for treatment and reuse. •Lines in which the water used to clean equipment interiors becomes contaminated with solvents also used on the same line were costed for treatment and reuse. All other wastewater streams (``non-interior streams'') are assumed to be treated and reused on-site or hauled for off-site incineration, depending on the option costed. EPA's cost model for wastewater treatment was initially based on the model used to estimate costs for the pesticide manufacturers rulemaking effort. EPA refined that model to enable costs and loadings to be estimated for all water-using pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in the surveyed population.
