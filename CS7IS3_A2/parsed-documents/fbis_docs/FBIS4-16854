Replying to journalists, he said that the republic "firmly abides by the position of pooling the monetary systems of Tajikistan and Russia". This notwithstanding, bank notes with national symbols will appear in the republic in May. According to the premier, they are called upon to serve the needs of the domestic market. This measure is temporary, Samadov stressed, and the reason for it is "that Tajikistan is now at an intermediary stage of pooling the monetary systems of the two states". The meeting with journalists was arranged in connection with the opening of a national strategic research centre which is called upon to prepare true information on the situation in various spheres and to carry out examination of the most important decisions taken by the republican leadership. The centre is also instructed to work out the government's position on major economic projects.
