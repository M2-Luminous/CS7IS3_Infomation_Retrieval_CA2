Speaking during a press conference in Gbarnga today, Mr. Taylor said it is of crucial importance to remove all external threats presently being caused by the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] with the help of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] from the Cotonou peace process in order for disarmament, encampment, and demobilization to commence. Mr. Taylor said the LPC and the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG pose a continuous threat to stability in Liberia. The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader said if Nigeria must remain a part of the peace process in Liberia, Nigerians must shape up or else they will have to ship out. President Taylor said there are some good elements within the Nigerian ECOMOG contingent but Nigerian soldiers with bad peacekeeping records must be withdrawn from Liberia. The former president reiterated the commitment of the NPFL to the current peace process but warned of the danger plan by AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] commanding General Hezekiah Bowen to unleash a Kigali situation in Liberia. He cautioned all factions to exercise restraint and follow the South African example in order to restore peace to the people of this country suffering in and out of Liberia.
