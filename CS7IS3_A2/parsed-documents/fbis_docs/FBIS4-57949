FBIS4-57949 "drlat103_b_94015" FBIS-LAT-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 Barbados St. Lucia Antigua and Barbuda PM Lester Bird Addresses OECS Antigua and Barbuda PM Lester Bird Addresses OECS FL2705021294 Castries HTS Caribvision Television in English 1945 GMT 26 May 94 FL2705021294 Castries HTS Caribvision Television English BFN [Text] Today, the leaders of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States [OECS] got down to their first working session of the 23rd Authority meeting in Castries, St. Lucia. The meeting is scheduled to come to a close tomorrow. Today began deliberations on a host of issues, including the preparation of maritime boundary delimitation negotiations, World Bank reports, and the follow-up on the just concluded Global Conference in Barbados. The Authority meeting, which was attended by all but one OECS leader, namely Prime Minister Nicholas Braithwaite of Grenada, yesterday welcomed its newest family member in the person of Antigua's newly elected Prime Minister Lester Bird. Mr. Bird addressed yesterday's official openings in his capacity as representative for the delegations. While noting that this time his role was different, he did, however, indicate that the task was not new, having had years of practice. [Begin Bird recording] I wish to thank the chief minister of Montserrat and the prime minister of St. Lucia for the warm words expressed by both of you on my election to the prime ministership of Antigua and Barbuda. As many of you are aware, I have been attending conferences of heads of government of the OECS from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me the distinct honor of allowing me to be the first chairman even though I was not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the last 14 years in this council impersonating a head of government. And many of you spent the last 14 years in complicity. I am pleased that by (electing the government a party) which I have the honor to lead, the people of Antigua and Barbuda have chosen to relieve not only me of the role of impersonator, but you of the role of collusion. On a serious note, I have placed on record my profound thanks to OECS heads of governments past and present, who over the last 14 years, have treated me with such great consideraton. Mr. Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of government conference I should attend as prime minister is held in St. Lucia. For on this island, (around) your wise and mature guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many practical decisions which have advanced the economic and political interests of our subregion.
