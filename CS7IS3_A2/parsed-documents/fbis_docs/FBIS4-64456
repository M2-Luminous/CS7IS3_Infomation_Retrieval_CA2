One and a half weeks ago, the Foreign Ministry asked its representative in Colombo to start discussions on the subject with the authorities in Sri Lanka. This move was a response by the Foreign Ministry to a request by Netherlands State Secretary for Justice Kosto. The Justice Ministry believes the discussions should lead to an agreement in principle on the return of the Tamils, in the manner of similar agreements concluded with Sri Lanka by Switzerland and India. If the Netherlands and Sri Lanka are able to reach such an agreement, the repatriation will take place under UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] supervision. The Justice Ministry believes that some 20,000 Tamils are living in the Netherlands. The size of the group which would be liable for compulsory repatriation is not known. Civil war is still waging in the north of Sri Lanka where armed Tamils are fighting for their own state. The Foreign Ministry considers the south and center of the country to be "safe." "The internal refugee situation has improved," a Justice Ministry spokesman reported. The Netherlands has previously concluded a repatriation agreement with Vietnam.
