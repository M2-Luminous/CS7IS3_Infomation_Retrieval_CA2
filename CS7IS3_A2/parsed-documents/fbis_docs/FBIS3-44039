Our Nampula correspondent says the withdrawal was ordered by the regional Cease-Fire Subcommission following a decision made by the Cease-Fire Commission. [CCF] The withdrawal was supervised by the United Nations and monitored by government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] representatives. The troops were deployed in Sangage by the Angoche District Military Command. A communique issued by the regional Cease-Fire Subcommission says the decision to deploy the troops was designed to ensure order as Renamo moved its forces in the area. Meanwhile, Major Mario Semo, head of the government delegation to the CCF- Northern Region, said Sangage has never been disputed by the government or Renamo.
