FR941028-0-00080 FR941028-0-00009 OSM agrees that an opinion of counsel should not, in itself, be considered ``evidence.'' Indeed, opinions of counsel constitute legal analysis based upon factual information. Both proposed and final regulations require that such opinions ``be supported by evidentiary materials.'' Nevertheless, OSM must disagree that such opinions should be excluded. By providing an opportunity for the submission of such opinions, OSM is seeking to encourage counsel to conduct a diligent investigation of the facts and to assist regulatory authorities by presenting the fruits of such investigation_the factual materials_along with counsel's legal opinions as to the import of such evidence. The decision as to the weight to be given to the evidentiary materials and the persuasiveness of the counsel's opinions remain with the regulatory authority considering the challenge to the ownership or control link. Lawyers routinely argue their clients' positions to triers of fact and law. Such argument does not invade the province of the decisionmaker which retains the authority to make the decision. OSM has decided to allow for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position as part of final §773.25. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true. Whereas the proposed rule only provided for such opinion when counsel made a personal investigation of the facts, the final rule incorporates language to provide for opinions where such investigation has not been made. The basis for this change is to reflect that, under certain circumstances, attorneys might not choose to conduct a complete personal investigation of the factual representations made within the opinion. See Formal Opinion 346 (Revised), Tax Law Opinions in Tax Shelter Investment Offerings, Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, American Bar Association (January 29, 1982). Such opinion is similar in type to that provided by counsel to an adversary party as to title, tax issues, or environmental compliance in real estate transactions. The indicator of reliability in this document is that the attorney is offering his or her opinion subject to professional standards provided by national and local bar associations and possible sanctions for the violations of such standards which may be imposed by applicable rules of conduct governing attorneys. In addition, under the final regulation, the attorney's opinion by itself is not enough to challenge an ownership or control link. Evidentiary materials need to be submitted along with such opinion. In addition to the substantive change noted above, OSM has made non-substantive changes to the provision which clarify the requirements of the final rule provision. Accordingly, OSM has adopted the proposed rule with the changes noted as paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final §773.25. As described above, paragraph (d) of proposed §773.26, required proof for the rebuttal of ownership or control presumptions, represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have established what must be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current §773.5(b) of this title. Proof of the type of facts set forth in the proposed regulations would have established that the presumed owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b). OSM has determined not to go forward with paragraph (d) of proposed §773.26 and has, therefore, withdrawn that portion of the proposed rule. In substance, OSM believes that ownership and control determinations are inherently a case specific process. Each ownership or control matter turns on the totality of circumstances in a given case and whether the evidence presented demonstrates that the presumed owner or controller does not or did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted. See 30 CFR 773.5(b)(1). The pragmatic focus of such an inquiry will continue to be whether a presumed controller actually exercised control over an entity or had the substantive power to exercise control over an entity, even if he or she chose not to actually exercise such power. As OSM has stated previously in the preamble to 30 CFR §773.5(b), ``To the extent that a coal company controls or can exercise control over a contract operator, it should be held responsible for any outstanding violations of the Act which it should have prevented or corrected.'' (Emphasis added.) See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38877 (October 3, 1988). In effect, a person challenging a presumption of control must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that neither of these two circumstances is applicable. While it might be initially attractive for the agency to create a standard containing three or four elements, the proof of which automatically rebuts a presumption, OSM is unwilling to impose such potentially rigid substantive tests upon the process of analyzing ownership or control cases. OSM believes that such rigid standards do not serve the interests of the States, industry, or OSM, because they might be taken to preclude consideration of other rebuttal evidence not listed or, conversely, might force a State regulatory authority to accept a rebuttal which conforms substantially to OSM's model but which, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, does not in fact rebut the presumption. OSM's experience has taught that each ownership or control rebuttal requires an analysis of the presumed relationship within the complete factual context. Accordingly, in analyzing the ownership or control profile of an entity, OSM will look to the totality of circumstances_with the view to understanding how a particular entity operates and operated_to determine the true owners or controllers of a surface coal mining operation. Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups asserted that the rules should provide that any documents submitted by persons challenging presumptions of ownership or control be considered part of the public record and part of the permit file. On the other hand, industry commenters argued that the rules are deficient because they do not contain a provision by which documentation submitted could be held confidential. They further asserted that there was no means for a challenger to obtain a protective order with respect to confidential materials submitted in support of a challenge.
