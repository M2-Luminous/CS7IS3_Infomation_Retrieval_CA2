This assessment came Tuesday from president of the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank [CDB], Sir Neville Nicholls, who said the impact of the minimal progress of the larger economies will be felt by the whole region. Sir Neville said: "With regard to the actual economic outturn in the 17 borrowing member countries, the Gross Domestic Product of seven of these was higher than in 1992. In five others, there was positive growth of the GDP, although less than in 1992 and mainly marginally so. Three countries registered no change from the previous year; and in the last two, there was no growth, only declines in 1993 GDP." The CDB president suggested that a return to buoyancy by the main economies would have considerable meaning to the region as their markets were critical to the restoration of some prosperity to intra-regional trade. Trinidad and Tobago retreated from very marginal growth in 1992 to a negative position in 1993 with a - 1-percent growth rate. The Bahamas stagnated at the 1992 level which was itself half a percentage point below the level attained in 1991. Jamaica recorded a 1.5-percent growth which, while better than the 1.2-percent in 1992, was still extremely low; and Barbados, after three years of significant decline, turned itself around with just a 1-percent growth. Sir Neville revealed: "The information available so far shows the year's top performers to have been Anguilla with 7.5-percent growth; Guyana, between 7 and 8 percent; Cayman Islands, 4 percent; St. Kitts and Nevis, 4 percent; Belize, 3.9 percent, which is a substantial drop from the 7.4-percent of 1992, and the British Virgin Islands, 3.5 percent." The CDB president offered a number of reasons for the less than stellar performance of the Borrowing Member Countries (BMC's), which did little to offer any relief for the 200,000 thousand unemployed in the region. He said: "With the exception of Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, the others are fairly strong tourist-oriented economies. And last year, the region, insofar as tourism is concerned, continued to suffer from the slow recovery from the recession in North America." In addition, many of the European countries, because of the depreciation of their currencies in relation to the United States dollar, and their own problems with the global recession, did not provide the Caribbean with many visitors. As well, Sir Neville explained that "some of the countries in the region, particularly Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, are suffering from what can best be termed as foreign-debt overhang." A substantial proportion of their financial resources, especially with their earnings of foreign currency, continues to be spent on servicing foreign indebtedness. Another problem for these countries is that manufacturing entities are beginning to feel the effects of trade liberalisation. This in turn has resulted in reduced output and increased unemployment. "This is in many respects an inevitable process that is taking place. The trend towards liberalisation of trade is a worldwide one and our countries, this region, is finding it increasingly difficult to protect their industries, particularly manufacturing industries, from competition from outside," Sir Neville told reporters at a news conference. The overall position with most of the major economies of the Caribbean is a relative shortage of foreign exchange. "Once you have that situation," Sir neville said, "governments find it virtually impossible to stimulate the economy because of the shortage of foreign exchange." An analysis of the main performing sectors of the region's economy offers some hope contingent upon a resumption of sustained growth in the global economy, and on restructuring of individual economies to enable them to respond competitively to the new situation they face. In tourism, for example, figures show that the number of stopover arrivals and cruiseship visitors in the tourism- oriented BMC's increased in 1993. Sir Neville explained that "as would be expected, consequent upon the recovery in North America, tourism growth was strongest in those economies which traditionally get the overwhelming majority of their tourists from North America." As far as the banana industry was concerned in 1993, a number of factors adversely affected it. Principal among these was the exchange rate of sterling which depreciated, giving producers less in domestic currency for every pound sterling earned. The bank president said: "Moreover, uncertainty about the future deepened as a result of significant changes in the arrangements for marketing Caribbean bananas in the European Union." Belize and Jamaica had offsetting effects of the lower prices by expanding output through production efficiencies. Although like Jamaica, Belize experienced a fall in unit earnings, it nonetheless was able to increase total earnings. For St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, there were substantial declines in both production volumes and export earnings. Sugar production dipped by about 3 per cent from 732,000 tonnes produced in 1992, with St. Kitts and Nevis alone recording an increase in production by about 4 percent, while Barbados suffered a falloff of approximately 10 percent, continuing the slide in the industry for this island over the past few years. Jamaica's production was 7,000 tonnes less than in 1992. As far as Guyana was concerned, production fell slightly compared with previous years, but was still 50 percent above the 1991 level. Belize also recorded a drop in sugar production, but this was deliberate since a greater percentage of its increased output in sugarcane was used for the production of molasses. And in Trinidad and Tobago, sugar production was estimated at 4 percent less, although there were quite remarkable increases in other areas of export agriculture, such as cocoa and citrus. With regard to bauxite production, figures up to the end of September suggest that the decline was about 1.2 percent. Guyana recorded a slight increase, but this was offset by the decline in Jamaica, which is the bigger producer. The industry's prospects continued to be affected by weak international markets although the CDB approved a U.S.16.5 million dollar loan for the industry in Jamaica. There were also disappointing performances in the region's petroleum industry. The decline continued in Trinidad and Tobago during 1993 with output falling by about 8 percent. In Barbados as well, there was a decline of 4 percent to nearly 460,000 barrels.
