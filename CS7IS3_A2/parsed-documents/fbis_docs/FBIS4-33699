It is called the 16 December Democratic Camp, or K-16 [Kan Demokratik 16 Desanm]. The FNCD congratulates all organizations that have united to defend the principles of the 16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 elections. The FNCD says it has taken this opportunity to tell the population that the solidarity ... [pauses] the political unity called K-16 has not preempted the autonomy of the organizations that have joined this movement. According to a press release issued by the FNCD on 9 June, K-16 is an assemblage of all organizations that deem it necessary to unite the people in order to reach an acceptable solution to the serious crisis the country has been experiencing since the 30 September 1991 coup. FNCD says it encourages all people's and peasant organizations, unions, students, pupils, women, socioprofessionals, and staunch political parties throughout the nine geographic departments of the country to cooperate with K-16 in order to activate, and together support, peaceful political activities so the crisis can be resolved and so Aristide can return to the country soon, in order to put an end to the de facto practice. The FNCD explains to everyone that peaceful political activities include nonviolent actions, steps that do not threaten lives and private or public property. Once again, the FNCD asks General Cedras and his colleagues to resign to release the country from its suffering and the danger of an invasion by foreign forces. Friends, day has dawned. Get up! The cock has crowed. This must change, the FNCD concludes in a press release signed by Dr. Turneb Delpe and Evans Paul. [passage omitted]
