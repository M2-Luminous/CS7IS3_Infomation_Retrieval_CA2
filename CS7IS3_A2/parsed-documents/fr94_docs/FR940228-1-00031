FR940228-1-00031 FR940228-1-00003 (5) Has demonstrated competence in the use of the licensee's radiographic exposure devices, sealed sources, related handling tools, and survey instruments; and (6) Has demonstrated understanding of the instructions in paragraph (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section by successful completion of a field examination. (b) The licensee may not permit any individual to act as a radiographer's assistant until the individual_ (1) Has received copies of and instruction in the requirements described in NRC regulations contained in this part; in §§30.7, 30.9, and 30.10 of this chapter; in the applicable sections of parts 19, 20, and 71 of this chapter, in applicable DOT regulations as referenced in 10 CFR part 71, in the NRC license(s) under which the radiographer's assistant will perform radiography, and the licensee's operating and emergency procedures; (2) Has demonstrated competence to use, under the personal supervision of the radiographer, the radiographic exposure devices, sealed sources, related handling tools, and radiation survey instruments that the assistant will use; and (3) Has demonstrated understanding of the instructions provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by successfully completing a written test and a field examination on the subjects covered. (c) The licensee shall provide annual safety reviews for radiographers and radiographer's assistants at least once during each calendar year. (d) The licensee shall conduct an annual inspection program of the job performance of each radiographer and radiographer's assistant to ensure that the Commission's regulations, license requirements, and the applicant's operating and emergency procedures are followed. The inspection program must: (1) Include observation of the performance of each radiographer and radiographer's assistant during an actual radiographic operation at intervals not to exceed 12 months; and (2) Provide that, if a radiographer or a radiographer's assistant has not participated in a radiographic operation for more than 6 months since the last inspection, the individual's performance must be observed and recorded when the individual next participates in a radiographic operation. (e) The licensee shall maintain records of the above training to include certification documents, written and field examinations, annual safety reviews and annual inspections of job performance in accordance with §34.79. (f) The licensee shall include the following subjects in the training required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section: (1) Fundamentals of radiation safety including_ (i) Characteristics of gamma radiation; (ii) Units of radiation dose and quantity of radioactivity; (iii) Hazards of exposure to radiation; (iv) Levels of radiation from licensed material; and (v) Methods of controlling radiation dose (time, distance, and shielding); (2) Radiation detection instruments including_ (i) Use, operation, calibration, and limitations of radiation survey instruments; (ii) Survey techniques; and (iii) Use of personnel monitoring equipment; (3) Equipment to be used including_ (i) Operation and control of radiographic exposure equipment, remote handling equipment, and storage containers, including pictures or models of source assemblies (pigtails). (ii) Storage, control, and disposal of licensed material; and (iii) Maintenance of equipment. (4) The requirements of pertinent Federal regulations; and (5) Case histories of accidents in radiography. (g) The licensee may, until (Insert date 2 years after the final rule is published in the Federal Register ), allow an individual who has not met the certification requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section to act as a radiographer after the individual has received training in the subjects outlined in paragraph (f) of this section and demonstrated understanding of those subjects by successful completion of a written examination that was previously submitted to and approved by the Commission. §34.44 [Removed] 34. Section 34.44 is removed. 35. Section 34.45 is added to read as follows: §34.45 Operating and emergency procedures. (a) Operating and emergency procedures must include, as a minimum, instructions in at least the following: (1) The handling and use of licensed sealed sources and radiographic exposure devices to be employed such that no person is likely to be exposed to radiation doses in excess of the limits established in part 20 of this chapter ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation''; (2) Methods and occasions for conducting radiation surveys; (3) Methods for controlling access to radiographic areas; (4) Methods and occasions for locking and securing radiographic exposure devices, storage containers and sealed sources; (5) Personnel monitoring and the use of personnel monitoring equipment; (6) Transporting sealed sources to field locations, including packing of radiographic exposure devices and storage containers in the vehicles, placarding of vehicles, when needed, and control of the sealed sources during transportation (refer to 49 CFR parts 171 through 173); (7) The inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices and storage containers; (8) Steps that must be taken immediately by radiography personnel in the event a pocket dosimeter is found to be off-scale or an alarm ratemeter alarms; (9) The procedure(s) for identifying and reporting defects and noncompliance, as required by part 21 of this chapter; (10) The procedure for notifying proper persons in the event of an accident; (11) Minimizing exposure of persons in the event of an accident; (12) Source recovery procedure if licensee will perform source recovery; and (13) Maintenance of records.
