The commander appears to have retired those thick glasses that used to cover his oriental eyes. He arrived in Spain last week on an invitation from the University of Castellon, and he has taken the opportunity to meet with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and various opposition leaders. [Rico] In the past year, Nicaragua has undergone an escalation of actions by armed groups leading to political tensions. Is the country becoming polarized again? [Ortega] Politically speaking, despite the confrontations, the polarization that led to the war has gradually subsided. There is better understanding than there has been in years. Nevertheless, we are going through a period of radicalization as a result of the economic policy, unemployment (we have a 60 percent jobless rate), poverty, pressure on the productive sectors.... In the past four years, the neoliberalism of Violeta Chamorro's government has aggravated the recession. [Rico] What alternatives does the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) propose? [Ortega] We would have to begin with a national gathering of all political, business, and labor organizations at which the government would present the preliminary agreements it has entered into with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, so that the various sectors can express their opinions. What is being negotiated with these agencies are structural adjustments that will be binding on the country in future years. [Rico] The honeymoon between the Chamorro government and the Sandinist Front has been eclipsed in recent months. Has the "cohabitation" arrangement that emerged after the 1990 elections been abandoned? [Ortega] The situation has not been so linear; there have been ups and downs. The Sandinist Front has engaged in an opposition of constructive criticism, of coming down hard on the government when it proposes destabilizing measures and supporting it when we agree with its proposals. Right now, for example, we agree on the need to make common cause vis-a-vis the international organizations and on promoting constitutional reforms. [Rico] Yet Violeta Chamorro has accused you of destabilizing the country: She has even said that you went through a "psychosis" because you could not accept your electoral defeat. [Ortega] (Ortega smiles.) She said I was crazy. And she has said that several times. You have to understand that Mrs. Chamorro is not involved in the internal affairs of the country. She is a symbolic figure, the widow of Pedro Joaquin. It is the members of her cabinet who are in charge, and they are in the best position to assess what we Sandinists have done. We have cooperated when they have not asked us to. [Rico] The game of alliances among political groups in Nicaragua has evolved since 1990: The pact between the Sandinists and the government has given rise to recent contacts between you and the National Opposition Union (UNO), leaving the government out. Everyone talks of the need for a general accord for the good of the country, but in fact it looks more like a dance for the distribution of power. [Ortega] You have to look at the results. We have in fact been in contact with the UNO, not secretly, but in the open. And in November we began discussing constitutional reform with them. That step laid the groundwork for UNO deputies to rejoin the National Assembly. The results have been positive. [Rico] Some groups of former combatants (Sandinists and Contras) are still active. Has the policy of reintegration failed? [Ortega] These outbreaks are linked to the economic-social crisis. These people are ex-soldiers and demoralized peasants. The government signed agreements with them for land grants and aid, and it has reneged. The only way to solve this problem is to fulfill these commitments. [Rico] One of the issues that has raised the most hackles in your country is the government's desire to remove the Army from the Sandinist orbit, which entails forcing your brother, General Humberto Ortega, to step down as defense minister. [Ortega] That is a matter that has already reached the point of inflection, because we are pushing it through legislative channels so that it will not be influenced by external pressure. A bill to amend the law on the Army has already been sent to the executive branch, which will determine the time frame for changes in the Armed Forces. I estimate they will begin early next year. [Rico] Will they accept this law? [Ortega] Yes. No one denies that the comrades who are in the Army and the police are Sandinist comrades and revolutionaries, but they subordinate their actions to the Constitution and the government. [Rico] Nicaragua will hold elections in 1996. Could Somozism reemerge as positions become radicalized? [Ortega] The Somozists in fact already have something going in the form of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, led by Arnaldo Guzman, which is very powerful. The Somozists were in power for more than 40 years; they established a social base and grew out of a historic party, the Liberal Party. And now they are reemerging under the banner of liberalism. They are Sandinism's principal adversaries. That is why we feel we must promote a very broad policy of alliances, a program of national unity. [Rico] Would this alliance include the moderate sectors of the UNO? [Ortega] Yes. It would include all sectors who are willing to strengthen the continuity of the revolutionary program, with the necessary adjustments, but always with a view to democratizing the country. [Rico] Given what has happened over the last four years, is a pact of this nature possible when the presidency of the country is up for grabs? [Ortega] Nicaragua has to come first, and any personal interests have to come second, or last. [Rico] Is that possible, then? [Ortega] Sure it is possible.
