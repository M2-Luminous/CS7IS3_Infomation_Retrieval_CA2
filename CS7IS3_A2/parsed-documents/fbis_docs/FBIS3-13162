Palestinian sources reported that seven Palestinians were injured in the Gaza Strip" while "the Palestinian sources also reported that one person was wounded during stone-throwing incidents in Ramallah." The report adds that a resident of the al-Burayj refugee camp "was injured yesterday by police gunfire when he tried to avoid a police roadblock" in the Gaza Strip. Another report by Shlomo Dror and Gabi Zohar on page A5 of the same HA'ARETZ issue adds that "Palestinian sources reported that 20 people were injured" in riots in Jerusalem yesterday, "but East Jerusalem hospitals reported that only several people came in for treatment and were discharged later." According to the report, "police sources maintain that external elements have been causing agitation in Jerusalem. Last week, messages were sent to local leaders of Fatah, rejectionist front organizations, and religious organizations saying that 'the eyes of the world are currently on Jerusalem, which is why riots there are to be encouraged.'" The report goes on to say that "several hundred Golan Druze yesterday staged demonstrations marking the Syrian revolution day and the Ba'th Party coming to power. The demonstrations ended quietly, and no arrests were made" as the police "avoided entering the villages and clashing with the demonstrators."
