As has come to light, according to the conditional agreement, out of the future government's 12 ministries, three will be headed by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. It can be taken as certain that Gabor Kuncze will be the interior minister and Ferenc Wekler will probably be his state secretary. Karoly Lotz, who was a deputy for the SZDSZ in the previous Parliament, too, is expected to head the Transport Ministry. It can be taken as certain that Gabor Fodor is to head the Ministry for Culture [and Education], and probably MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi will be his Socialist political state secretary. Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the former Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, will head the Foreign Ministry in the next cycle. The political state secretary in the Foreign Ministry will also be a Socialist. The name of Ferenc Somogyi, a former administrative state secretary, was raised but, according to our informant, his nomination is not yet clarified. Laszlo Bekesi will head the Finance Ministry. Laszlo Pal is the likely industry minister and, according to our information, Tatabanya deputy Gabor Szalay will be the Free Democrat political state secretary. The former Expo commissioner Etele Barath is expected to head the Environmental Ministry and the MSZP will also provide the political state secretary, parliamentary group expert Katalin Szili is a possible candidate. The Socialist Laszlo Lakos is certain to head the Agricultural Ministry. The SZDSZ will provide the political state secretary, possibly Zoltan Kiss. Mrs Kosa, Magda Kovacs will probably be the labor minister, and MSZP executive member Sandor Csintalan could be her state secretary but, according to our information, he has so far refused the nomination. The renamed Health and Welfare Ministry [Egeszsegugyi es Szocialis] will be headed by Pal Kovacs. MSZP executive member Mihaly Kokeny could be his state secretary. The situation at the Justice and Defense Ministries is somewhat unclear. According to some of our sources, Kalman Kulcsar is still a serious candidate for the Justice Ministry, and in this case, Pal Vastagh could head the Defense Ministry. Bela Katona could also get a position in the Defense Ministry's leadership. According to our information, the MSZP has not yet found a nominee for the position of minister without portfolio supervising the secret services; the fate of this position is unclear at the moment. We have also acquired information regarding the chairmen of parliamentary committees. The Constitutional Committee would be headed by Peter Hack of the SZDSZ, the Defense Committee by Imre Mecs (SZDSZ), and the Foreign Affairs Committee by Istvan Szent- Ivanyi, also of the SZDSZ. Of the committees headed by the Socialists, Judit Csehak will probably be the chairwoman of the Welfare Committee, Csaba Tabajdi the chairman of the Human Rights Committee, Sandor Orosz of the Agricultural Committee, and Ivan Vitanyi of the Cultural Committee.
