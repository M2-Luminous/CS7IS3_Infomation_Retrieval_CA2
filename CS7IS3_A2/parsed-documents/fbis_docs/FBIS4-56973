The analysts added that under the present circumstances, there is bound to be a struggle for the control of drug trafficking areas in Padre Abad, Ucayali; Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal in the Pasco jungle; and in Chachamayo and Satipo in the jungle area of Junin Department. The analysts explained that it is essential for the two extremist organizations to keep their control over coca-growing areas because that is where their dollars come from. This income ensures the survival of the two armed groups, and keeps them ready for combat. The experts, however, pointed out a significant difference between the two groups. The information obtained from a repentant soldier indicated that Shining Path leaders keep resources and funds under tight control, and issue rations to their men that keep them hungry. Shining Path extremists are poorly fed, and get the same food ration for months. "Jairo," one of the first repentants who surrendered at the Mazamari military base two years ago, made this decision because he was tired of the rampant corruption among the leaders. According to "Jairo," the "lower ranks" ate corn mash while the leaders ate canned food and drank whisky, which they obtained from drug traffickers in the jungle area of San Francisco, Ayacucho Department. The internal situation of the MRTA is different. The MRTA pays salaries to its militants to stop them from running away, which turns them into paid mercenaries. Thus, the two groups clearly rely on support from drug traffickers, but there is a difference between them. The MRTA structure seems to be more fragile. As soon as the flow of drug money is cut, the organization will collapse because the combatants would refuse to fight if there is no booty to share. The Shining Path is probably not as dependent on drug money because the leaders can actually force the soldiers to fight, but the involvement is much more deeply rooted. The Shining Path is seriously jeopardized by the way in which drugs and drug money have corrupted its political and military leaders, who some time ago used to take pride in their austerity. According to the sources, when Shining Path militants showed up in Padre Abad, fleeing after the defeat of the Mar Rojo battalion on the banks of the Huallaga River, and joined other Shining Path forces in the province, the MRTA started having problems, and must now unleash a sustained offensive. The analysts even predicted that the MRTA will oust the Shining Path from Padre Abad Province and will take over Shining Path hideouts in the region. The analysts also announced the MRTA will try to do the same thing in Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal, in the jungle area of Pasco, where the MRTA has a platoon (one platoon has between 20 and 30 men), and in Pichis Palcazu. Another MRTA platoon is operating in the area attacked a convoy with draftees near Villa Rica a few days ago. The analysts explained, however, that the largest MRTA contingent is operating in Satiop, Perene, and Parihuanca in the jungle area of Junin Department. There, the MRTA has three well-armed platoons that have been stopping and robbing vehicles along the Marginal Highway and killing people. It would seem that these groups manage to blend with the local population after their raids. The analysts confirm that the MRTA apparently managed to set up an operation in Huancayo to push out the Shining Path, which was again trying to extort money from farmers. In fact, on 26 April the MRTA called a two-day "armed strike" in three jungle provinces, according to information received. The Huancayo police reported that strike "announcements" were painted on city walls. The provinces where the MRTA is trying to compel the people to "strike" are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, and in Oxapampa in Pasco Department. In the past only the Shining Path used to organize "armed strikes." Even though certain analysts, whom the news agencies quote, seem to believe that this could mean a possible merger of the two subversive gangs, everything indicates that at least in the central jungle area, a clash between the two groups seems to be inevitable.
