FR940224-1-00044 FR940224-1-00010 Statement of the Problem Both the fishing and processing sectors of the whiting fishery continue to be overcapitalized, which means there is more capacity than needed to take and to process the entire harvest guideline. The at-sea processing sector is more mobile and thus able to follow whiting that migrate from south to north during the March&hyph;October/November fishing season. Catcher/processors and catcher vessels delivering to motherships do not lose fishing time by having to return to shore to offload. Until 1994, there have been more at-sea processing vessels (as many as 26 in a given year) than shore-based plants (10&hyph;12 major plants). The at-sea processing fleet generally prefers shorter, intense seasons to minimize operating costs, and to ``fill in'' between other fisheries, particularly the pollock fisheries off Alaska. The shore-based plants clearly are not mobile and are limited by the availability of whiting as it migrates within range of local ports. Shore-based processing plants tend to prefer a longer, slower season to maintain their work force and markets when other fisheries are less productive. Even under limited entry, the potential exists for the at-sea processing sector to preempt the shoreside sector's opportunity for a longer processing season if enough at-sea processing capacity enters the whiting fishery. Although limited entry may reduce the number of catcher/processors that harvest whiting, it has no effect on the number of at-sea processors that may choose to offer at-sea markets to catcher boats. The shore-based fleet and processing plants now are established components of the whiting industry, not likely to be totally preempted by the at-sea fleet. They are, however, vulnerable to severe economic impacts should landings be precipitously reduced by unrestricted at-sea processing taking much of the harvest guideline in a fast, early fishery. The Council believes that even partial preemption of shoreside processing opportunities will result in an inequitable redistribution of economic benefits between sectors of the industry. The greatest change in the fishery in 1994 will be due to implementation of the limited entry program. Even though the traditional catcher vessels might appear to be protected from the rapid and intense competition of the catcher/processor fleet, concern remains that market opportunities might be severely restricted by an at-sea processing fleet consisting of motherships (including former catcher/processors acting as motherships) or of catcher/processors accumulating enough permits to operate in the fishery. The mothership fleet provides a viable market for the traditional catcher vessels, and to this extent is beneficial to the catcher fleet. However, if the mothership fishery attracts a large number of catcher/processors acting only as motherships, and if they are able to process whiting almost as rapidly as when they acted as catcher/processors (which is expected), the harvest guideline still could be taken in a matter of weeks (as early as May 31, 1994, according to Table 7&hyph;2 in the EA/RIR). The Council believes the traditional catcher fleet's market opportunities are enhanced when there are viable, competing markets both onshore and offshore over a longer period of time, and therefore a less intense, slower fishery appears to benefit market choices for these vessels. The Council also is concerned that preemption of harvesting opportunities for whiting catcher boats will result in those vessels transferring additional fishing effort into the traditional groundfish fisheries for rockfish, sablefish, and flatfish, which already are fully utilized. Increased effort in the non-whiting groundfish fishery could result in shortened seasons and more restrictive trip limits for all groundfish fishing vessels, could economically disadvantage many fishermen, and could exacerbate the current problem of excessive discards and wastage attributed to restrictive regulations. To the extent that the Council can maintain employment for the traditional joint venture fishing vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery, adverse impacts on the other groundfish fisheries will be lessened. In addition, the Council and the industry desire stability in the regulatory process. For each of the last 3 years, the Council submitted recommendations for allocations to the Secretary. Uncertainty as to what the allocation would be and delays in announcing the allocation prevented participants in the whiting fishery from planning their harvesting and processing operations prior to the season. The industry was unable to plan ahead because it did not have a firm foundation on which to base its business decisions. In summary, the problems the Council has identified and is seeking to solve are: Too much fishing and processing capacity and not enough fish; inequitable distribution of economic benefits among the competing sectors; and regulatory instability that has prevented the industry from making timely business decisions.
