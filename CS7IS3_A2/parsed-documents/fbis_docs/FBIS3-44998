If the decision goes into effect officially, it will: Cause a loss of $1.2 billion to the mainland's textile exports; affect Hong Kong, which plays an entrepot role for the mainland's trade; and will affect Taiwan businessmen who have invested in the mainland. It will also affect Taiwan's textile exports. As the mainland's traditional major export commodity, textiles occupy a decisive position in overall foreign trade. Thanks to the vigorous development of mainland China's economy, its textile exports to the U.S. market rank first among other textile exporters. According to statistics, the volume of mainland China's textile and garment exports to the United States totaled $4.7 billion in 1993, an increase of more than 100 percent over the $2.2 billion in 1988. The U.S. market absorbs a large amount of Chinese textiles, showing that there is indeed such a demand. Over the past nine months, however, the United States has failed to reach agreement with China after four rounds of talks. Eventually, the United States decided to unilaterally cut mainland China's textile export quotas by 25 to 25 percent [numbers as received] commencing 1994, under the excuse of China's "illegal textile shipments." The textile quota cut involves an export volume of $1.18 billion. If the decision goes into effect on 17 January, it will not only incur serious losses in mainland China's textile exports but will also adversely affect China's overall foreign trade and economic development in 1994. Meanwhile, the U.S. decision to unilaterally cut China's export textile quotas will also affect Hong Kong and bring losses to its entrepot trade. According to statistics, the volume of China's export commodities via Hong Kong totals $50 billion annually and textiles account for a large proportion of this total. Although the textile cut will not immediately affect Hong Kong, it will bring losses to China's textile and garment exports to the United States via Hong Kong. At the same time, it will dampen the enthusiasm of Hong Kong manufacturers for investing in the mainland. Two possible conflicts of interests may occur in Taiwan. Although the textile export quotas obtained locally by Taiwan investors in the mainland are limited, they will also be indirectly affected because of the sharp cut in textile quotas. On the other hand, Taiwan manufacturers based on the island may benefit from the move. According to analyses from Taiwan, following the cut in mainland China's quotas, the United States will have to get more sources from other regions. As a result, Taiwan manufacturers will get some unexpected orders for their textile production and this will benefit Taiwan's industry.
