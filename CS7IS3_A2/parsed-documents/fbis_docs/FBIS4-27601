In its recent audit of the Ministry, the BAI found that between June 1993 and March this year the Ministry used 186 million won (about 230,000 U.S. dollars) in work-drive funds, 30 percent of the 502 million won appropriated as such funds during the period, without the treasurer's prior approval and then notified the treasurer of such use up to 100 days later, the announcement said. Moreover, the Ministry used 64 million won in work-drive funds to treat officials working overtime to special food, though the funds cannot be used to pay for food. In addition, last year the Ministry issued, through overseas missions, passports to two citizens subjected to government administrative action for wrongdoings, which is in violation of the rules. The Ministry failed to advise the missions concerned of the information about the persons in question. The BAI also found that the Ministry issued in December last year and February this year multiple-use passports to two citizens whose administrative action was temporarily suspended, though such citizens must be issued a single-use passport.
