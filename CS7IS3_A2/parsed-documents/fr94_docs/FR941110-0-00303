FR941110-0-00303 FR941110-0-00018 Koster's curse, a noxious shrub native to tropical America, was first reported on Oahu in 1941. It had spread through much of the Koolau Mountains by the early 1960s, and spread to the Waianae Mountains by 1970 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). It poses a serious threat to two populations of Plantago princeps var. longibracteata in the Koolau Mountains. Koster's curse is widespread in Honouliuli and threatens two populations of Flueggea neowawraea that occur in that area of the Waianae Mountains. This prolific alien plant has recently spread to five other islands, including Kauai, where there are at least five small infestations totaling about 40 ha (100 ac) (Cuddihy and Stone 1990); one of these poses an immediate threat to one population of Adenophorus periens in Waioli Valley (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Lantana, a native of the West Indies, became naturalized in dry to mesic forests and shrublands of the Hawaiian Islands before 1871 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This shrub often forms thick cover and produces chemicals that inhibit the growth of other plant species (Smith 1985). On Kauai, lantana is a major component of the vegetation at Paaiki Valley and Waimea Canyon and is rapidly becoming established in Pohakuao. It poses a threat to populations of Flueggea neowawraea in those areas (HHP 1992d13, 1992d17, 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31). One population of Bonamia menziesii on Lanai and one on Maui are also negatively affected by this invasive plant (HHP 1992b1, 1992b24). Koa haole, a shrub naturalized and often dominant in low elevation, dry, disturbed areas on all of the main Hawaiian Islands, threatens to degrade the habitat of six of the species. Koa haole is one of the major weeds found at Polihale on the island of Kauai, growing in the vicinity of a population of Sesbania tomentosa (HHP 1992j33; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). In the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, koa haole is one of the primary weed threats to half of the Bonamia menziesii populations and all of the Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. mokuleianus populations found in the area (HHP 1992b12, 1992b19, 1992e23; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Most of the Molokai populations of Sesbania tomentosa and one of the Kahoolawe populations of Vigna o-wahuensis are also negatively affected by koa haole (HHP 1992j13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Maui, koa haole poses a threat to Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei and Spermolepis hawaiiensis in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, and is probably also a threat to Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei and Sesbania tomentosa elsewhere on West Maui (HHP 1992e3; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Kiawe, a deciduous thorny tree that can grow to 20 m (65 ft) in height, overshadows other plants and competes with associated vegetation for available water and space. At Polihale, on the island of Kauai, it is the primary alien plant threat to Sesbania tomentosa . Two Molokai populations of Sesbania tomentosa compete with kiawe for water and space on Moomomi's beaches. The primary alien plant threat to Vigna o-wahuensis on the island of Kahoolawe is kiawe (HHP 1992m21). Australian red cedar is a fast-growing tree that was probably introduced to Hawaii for lumber. It is now found in many of Hawaii's extensively planted lowland forests and has become naturalized in mesic to wet forests (Wagner et al. 1990). Today, this tree is a definite threat to at least one population of Bonamia menziesii and most of the plants of Flueggea neowawraea in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Buffelgrass forms continuous cover in dry habitats and provides excellent fuel for fire, from which it recovers quickly. Its seeds are easily dispersed by wind (Smith 1985). Buffelgrass threatens the habitat of two populations of Sesbania tomentosa on Molokai, and at least one population of Vigna o-wahuensis on Kahoolawe (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Prickly Florida blackberry was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1800s (Haselwood and Motter 1983). The fruits are easily spread by birds to open areas where this plant can form dense, impenetrable thickets (Smith 1985). The Kauai population of Adenophorus periens , which is located at the boundary of Hono O Na Pali NAR and Na Pali Coast State Park, is threatened by this noxious weed (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).
