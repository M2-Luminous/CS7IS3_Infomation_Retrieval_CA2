In a television appearance, he ridiculed Menahem Begin, saying that his ceremony at Camp David was not marred by an incident like that orchestrated by 'Arafat in Cairo because Begin gave everything to Anwar al-Sadat, whereas Rabin was not so generous toward 'Arafat. Why should Begin be derided? Faced with giving in to U.S. pressure and going for the chance of peace with Egypt on one hand, or caving in to the rage of the settlers and extreme right-wing demonstrations in the territories on the other, Begin decided to uproot the Sinai settlements, and this was a reasonable decision. Rabin already knows that the establishment of the Qatif Bloc was an act of political madness on the part of former Labor leaders. He would prefer it to be abandoned, because the presence of the settlers in the Gaza Strip increases unnecessary friction in this test period of neighborly relations between the two nations. The prime minister, however, still lacks the courage to tell the settlers that the refrain "do not uproot what has been planted" is only a prayer and not an expression of hard political reality. It is true that it is hard for any Zionist to uproot trees or fences. But this myth must not blind us to reality: Even during the period that all Israeli ideologues like to invoke nostalgically, settlements were dismantled on the Golan and in the Galilee. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the spiritual father of all right-wing ideologues, opposed the establishment of Tel Hay [a settlement in upper Galilee stormed by Arab attackers in 1920]; Yosef Trumpeldor had to die before Jabotinsky adopted his name for his own newly formed youth movement [BETAR, Brit Yosef Trumpeldor]. There is a serious contradiction in Rabin's attitude toward this issue. On one hand, he had the courage to tell the United Kibbutz Movement that in exchange for peace with Syria, he will disband settlements on the Golan; on the other, he refuses to explain why this logic should not apply to the Gaza Strip as well. If it is possible to disband Merom Golan, it should also be possible to relocate Kfar Darom. Were it not for Rabin's obsessive stubbornness, which prevents him from relocating any settlements even a few meters away, many issues could have been solved without planting an explosive device right in the middle of the festive Cairo ceremony. The maps with the problematic attached signatures are, to a large extent, the result of a settlement concept that forced the two sides to put the solution of the problems off to a later stage. Have we forgotten the Taba affair, which placed so many obstacles on the path of Israeli-Arab diplomacy, before being solved with a clear victory for the Egyptians? Rabin's adamant refusal to soften his position regarding some of the settlements raises serious doubts about his confidence in his ability to insist on issues he really considers paramount -- perhaps even that of the 'Etzyon Bloc, which he considers absolutely vital. The prime minister is afraid that he will not be able to keep this bloc of settlements intact. As a result, he is entangling himself in a self-made impasse regarding all the settlements, both the vital and the insignificant ones. Rabin's adamant position regarding the settlements has hurt the Oslo and Cairo agreements, because it is a mistake to leave a large Jewish population in the Gaza Strip under physical and psychological conditions that are a breeding ground for Jewish terrorism. It is also a mistake to insist on leaving Na'ama in its present location, because this makes it difficult for Israel to evince even modest generosity regarding the size of the Jericho autonomous area. The stubborn decision to keep these settlements in their present location fails to placate the turbulent right wing in any event. The right wing considers the Gaza-Jericho agreement "the beginning of the Palestinian people's redemption," and if this is indeed the case, it is regrettable that the government is denying instead of confirming it. Does Shim'on Peres really reject the establishment of a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip with a federative link to the West Bank and Jordan? I believe it is high time the government admitted this reality. All the ministers, however, refuse to acknowledge this possibility. This will force them to again fall back on Peres' fertile imagination to produce another original and helpful -- albeit partial -- solution. It is reasonable to assume that in the near future, Peres and 'Arafat will raise the possibility of a mini- interim arrangement in the framework of which another city and town will be transferred to Palestinian authority every three months. Qalqilyah, Janin, Nabulus, and Qabatiyah, and another year will have passed.
