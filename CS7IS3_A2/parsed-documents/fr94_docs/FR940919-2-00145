FR940919-2-00145 FR940919-2-00059 4. The applicants represent that under the Agreements, assets of the Funds will be managed with the investment objective of obtaining current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through investment directly or indirectly, in real estate and interests in real estate, including without limitation fee simple interests, interests in partnerships and joint ventures having an interest in real property, mortgages, options to purchase real estate, leaseholds, leasebacks, and investments in real estate funds, real estate investment trusts or other entities with assets which are invested, directly or indirectly, primarily in real estate. Assets potentially to be subject to the Arrangements include the following: (a) investments selected or recommended by an asset manager after an Agreement is executed, in accordance with investment guidelines established by the Agreement; (b) pre-identified investments which are particular properties which have been identified by the asset manager for investment (or recommended for investment) prior to the execution of the Agreement; (c) pre-existing assets which are already held by a Fund prior to the execution of the Agreement; and (d) combinations of the foregoing. 5. As proposed by the applicant, the performance fee payable to an asset manager under an Agreement (the Performance Fee) is a fee payable after net proceeds (Net Proceeds) from the assets under management pursuant to the Agreement exceed a certain amount (the Threshold Amount). 4 Net Proceeds, with respect to an Arrangement, are the aggregate amount of cash and other assets (valued at fair market value on the basis of independent valuations 5 ) which cease to be assets subject to the Arrangement. Each Agreement establishing an Arrangement will specifically identify the assets to be subject to the Arrangement, and the basis upon which income and earnings on such assets will cease, or continue, to be subject to the Arrangement. For example, the applicant represents that an Agreement might provide that the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement plus all earnings and proceeds thereon will be reinvested and remain subject to the Arrangement until the Termination Date, whereupon all such assets will cease to be subject to the Arrangement. In such case, there will be no Net Proceeds during the term of the Arrangement, and therefore no Performance Fee would be payable until the Termination Date. Alternatively, the applicant represents that an Agreement might provide that all net income and other proceeds generated by the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement will cease to be subject to the Arrangement and will thereby constitute Net Proceeds. In such case, Net Proceeds will be generated as and when the initial assets generate net income or other proceeds, and a Performance Fee would be payable once the amount of these Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount. The Threshold Amount is defined as an amount equal to one hundred percent of the Fund's capital investment plus a pre-specified annual compounded cumulative rate or rates of return each of which is at least a minimum rate of return as determined by a formula based on the consumer price index, as required in Part III, Sections (q) (1) and (2) of the proposed exemption. The proposed exemption provides that the Performance Fee is payable (a) after Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount, and/or (b) on the Agreement's termination date (the Termination Date, defined as the date on which the Arrangement will terminate by reason of the passage of time, as the same may be amended from time to time with the approval of AT&T), either upon termination of the Arrangement or in the event of the prior removal or resignation of an asset manager. The Performance Fee will be equal to a pre-specified percentage, or several pre-specified percentages, of all Net Proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount, or Threshold Amounts, subject to such limitations as AT&T may impose. In this regard, AT&T represents that there is a possibility that several Threshold Amounts may be established with different percentages being utilized to determine the Performance Fee, depending upon which Threshold Amount has been exceeded. AT&T states that this structure will allow AT&T to negotiate an arrangement on behalf of a Fund pursuant to which the amount of the Performance Fee will increase as the level of investment performance increases. AT&T states that, as an example, AT&T could negotiate a Performance Fee whereby an asset manager would receive ten percent of all Net Proceeds in excess of an initial Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus an eight percent annual return), and twenty percent of all Net Proceeds once a second Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus a twelve percent annual return) has been achieved. Both the annual rate(s) of return used in determining the Threshold Amount(s) and the percentage(s) used to determine the amount of the Performance Fee will be negotiated between AT&T and the asset manager prior to the application of any Arrangement to assets under management of the asset manager. 4 The Department herein is proposing an exemption only for the payment by AT&T Investment Funds of Performance Fees for services rendered to the Funds pursuant to the Agreements, and is not proposing any exemption for any other prohibited transactions or any violations of Title I, Part 4 of the Act which may arise from any other elements of the fee structure established under an Agreement. 5 Under the proposed exemption, the term ``independent valuations'' means valuations based on independent and objective third party sources acceptable to AT&T (including without limitation NASDAQ, newspapers, or other general publications, or brokers which are independent of the Asset Manager and its affiliates). AT&T represents that the assets of AT&T Investment Funds to be subject to the Arrangements will consist primarily of real estate or interests in real estate which will be valued, as a general matter, by independent appraisers. However, a portion of an AT&T Investment Fund's assets subject to an Arrangement may consist of real estate-related securities, such as shares in real estate investment trusts, that may be valued using independent sources other than appraisers, such as NASDAQ and the other sources described in the definition of ``independent valuations''.
