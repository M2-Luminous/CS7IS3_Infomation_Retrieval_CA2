FBIS4-4714 "dreas065__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. F-15 Fighter Crashes in Okinawa U.S. F-15 Fighter Crashes in Okinawa Governor Ota Reacts OW0504062994 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 5 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0504062994 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Governor Masahide Ota's regular unofficial meeting with reporters at 1100 [0200 GMT] on 4 April suddenly became an emergency news conference on the crash of the U.S. Forces' F-15 fighter. The incident has seriously shocked the prefectural government, and Ota has issued direct instructions to his Base Affairs Office to confirm the details of the accident. Prefectural Policy Coordinator Choko Takayama, and Tatsuo Matayoshi, director of the Governor's Office, are now busy arranging the lodging of a protest with the U.S. Forces Okinawa area coordinator, and Kadena Air Base commander. They are also demanding an investigation into the cause of the crash. The accident happened during Ota's preparations for the visit to Okinawa of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on 10 April. He is now working on how to petition Mondale for solutions to the prefecture's base issues. Ota said at the news conference: "It is extremely unfortunate and regrettable. Time and again, we have asked U.S. Forces and the U.S. Consulate General to take measures to prevent accidents. Each time, we are told that they are looking into the causes. Does this mean that as long as there are military bases in Okinawa, there will be no way to prevent accidents? We will exert even greater efforts in asking for the return of the bases." He reemphasized his position that the return of the military bases forms a major pillar of the prefecture's administrative policy. The latest accident demonstrated once again that Kadena Air Base is inherently dangerous. Ota is scheduled to visit the United States in late May to discuss base issues. During this visit he will probably demand in strong terms that the U.S. Government take firm measures to "prevent any more accidents." At present, takeoff and landing exercises at Kadena are conducted over civilian residential areas every day. The crash site of the F-15 fighter on 4 April was within the vicinity of the Kadena Arms Depot. One slip could have led to a major explosion, and brought about a disaster. The F-15 fighter crash occurred with Kadena Air Base still unable to publish the findings of its investigation into the helicopter crash in September 1993. For this, the prefectural government is greatly dissatisfied with U.S. Forces.
