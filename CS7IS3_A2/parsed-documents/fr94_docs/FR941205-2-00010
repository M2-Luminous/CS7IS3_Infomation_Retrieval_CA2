FR941205-2-00010 FR941205-2-00009 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of extension for submitting Showcase Demonstration project proposals. SUMMARY: On Friday, October 7, 1994, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice inviting participation in Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects (59 FR 51186). DOE is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity, and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S. Todays notice announces an extension for the submission of Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Project proposals. DATES: The extended dates to guarantee consideration are: preliminary proposals must be received by March 1, 1995. Preliminary-proposals shall be considered as meeting the deadline if they are either: (1) received on or before the deadline date or, (2) postmarked on or before the deadline date. Preliminary-proposals which do not meet the deadline will be considered late applications and may not be considered. The preliminarily-accepted Showcase Demonstrations are projected to be announced by approximately April, 1995 and will be asked by DOE to provide final-proposals. The final proposals scheduled due date is approximately May, 1995. DOE is expected to finalize Showcase Demonstration project selection by approximately June, 1995. The initial Showcase Demonstration Workshop is scheduled to take place in June, 1995. It is envisioned that selected projects will have a duration of no more than 18 months, and therefore, projects are expected to be completed (the project's costs and benefits defined and validated) by November, 1996. ADDRESSES: Preliminary-proposals and MOTOR CHALLENGE Partnership applications should be submitted to the MOTOR CHALLENGE Information Clearinghouse: MOTOR CHALLENGE Information Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 43171, Olympia, Washington 98504&hyph;3171 . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To receive further information on the MOTOR CHALLENGE Partnership, to obtain application forms for the Partnership, or to make inquiries related to the Showcase Demonstration projects, call the MOTOR CHALLENGE Hotline at 1&hyph;800&hyph;862&hyph;2086. Issued in Washington, DC this 22nd day of November, 1994. William P. Parks, Acting Director, Industrial Energy Efficiency Division, Office of Industrial Technologies.
