FR940926-1-00038 FR940926-1-00011 Appendix A to the Preamble: Summary of Proposed Decisions Refrigerants_Proposed Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions 1End-Use 1Substitute 1Decision 1Comments CFC&hyph;12 Automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning (Retrofit and New Equipment/NIKS) HFC&hyph;134a, R&hyph;401C, HCFC Blend Beta Proposed acceptable when (1) used with unique fittings and detailed labels and (2) all CFC&hyph;12 has been removed from the system prior to retrofitting. Refer to the text for a full description. EPA is concerned that the existence of several substitutes in this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant refrigerant cross-contamination and potential failure of both air conditioning systems and recovery/recycling equipment. In addition, a smooth transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the continued purity of the recycled CFC&hyph;12 supply. For the purposes of this rule, no distinction is made between ``retrofit'' and ``drop-in'' refrigerants; retrofitting a car to use a new refrigerant includes all procedures that result in the air conditioning system using a new refrigerant.

Documentation of such measures must be available for review upon request. The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have high GWPs and long atmospheric lifetimes.
