Lobkowicz thus reacted indirectly to German Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel's statement of Wednesday [4 May], in which he called the issue of the deported Germans' freedom to settle and property rights an "unsolved and open" problem in relations between the two countries. According to some sources, Kinkel's statement is proof that Bonn wants to discuss the Sudeten German issue at government level. "The Czech Republic regards the issue of the Sudeten Germans as closed. This is not some optimistic assertion, it is our position," Michal Lobkowicz stated literally. "I do not consider it highly probable that the German side would wish to reopen the Sudeten German problem," he added. The senior director of the cabinet of the minister of foreign affairs refused to specifically comment on Kinkel's statement on the ground that he had not yet received its exact wording. "However, the Ministry has already taken steps to obtain more detailed information about the whole matter. This information should become available within the next few hours or days," Lobkowicz went on to say. At a meeting on Thursday [5 May] with a group of politicians from the Bundestag group of the ruling Christian CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] parties who represent expellees' organizations, Minister Kinkel said, furthermore, that the Federal Government would continue to stand up for the interests of Germans who had been expelled from eastern countries after the war. It will also do everything it can to support the interests of those afflicted and to bring about an interstate dialogue on this problem. At the same time, however, Kinkel said that Germany's foremost task in relation to its eastern neighbors was to support and assist in the reforms and in stabilizing the situation in those countries.
