Pyongyang told the IAEA Monday that the IAEA's request to inspect a 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, is inappropriate, the TONG-A ILBO said. The IAEA is insisting that North Korea allow a full check of North Korea's nuclear stockpiles, in addition to monitoring replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear plant. In a front-page story dispatched from Vienna, the daily quoted North Korean diplomat Yun Ho-chin as saying that he notified the IAEA it would not be granted permission to conduct eight tests when the fuel rods are exchanged at the nuclear reactor. The IAEA says the inspections would reveal the current level of North Korea's nuclear program and how much plutonium has already been recovered from the spent nuclear fuel. Yun, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Austria, said the IAEA can ensure that nuclear materials are not being diverted to military purposes when it observes the removal of the reactor core, according to the report. North Korea has nothing more to say to the IAEA, Yun was quoted saying. The Yongbyon reactor was started up in 1986. Its fuel rods are almost exhausted and are due for replacement. The reactor was previously shut down for 100 days in 1989 for unknown reasons. The nuclear complex at Yongbyon has been the focus of Western allegations that North Korea is engaged in a covert nuclear arms development program.
