At the same time, he also said: "We are making appropriate preparations to face outcome of the experiment." In this way, he suggested that the government, from the viewpoint of Japan's security, is ready to strictly deal with the situation if North Korea carries out the experimental launching. What the Defense Agency is strongly concerned about is the type of missile North Korea is preparing to launch. A government source points out that "there is a strong possibility that North Korea may deploy missiles, which can reach Japan, for actual warfare" if a missile, which will be used in the experimental launching, is "Nodong-1" medium-range missile, which is capable of flying 1,000 km and was launched in May last year, or another type with longer flying capability. Defense officials are increasingly worried that depending on outcome of the experiment, Japanese security may face a dangerous situation.
