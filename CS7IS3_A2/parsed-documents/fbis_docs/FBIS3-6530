The Japanese Government will offer such provisions as 811 tons of condensed milk, 2,581 tons of vegetable cooking oil, 1,165 tons of canned mandarin oranges and 1,082 tons of canned pork meat, the ministry said. The 11 cities include seven in the far eastern region such as Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Yuzno-Sakhalinsk, and four cities in east Siberia, including Irkutsk and Ulan Ude, it said. Japan will first implement the monetization on March 28 in Vladivostok and move on to other cities until the end of April. In Russia, people classified as socially weak, such as pensioners, are facing difficulties because of inflation, the ministry said. And since local administrations are short of sources of revenue for implementing social welfare projects, it is useful to implement the monetization system, it said. Japan implemented the monetization last year in nine cities in Russia. The 4 billion rubles accumulated through monetization have been used to build hospitals and medical facilities and to purchase medical equipment, the Foreign Ministry said.
