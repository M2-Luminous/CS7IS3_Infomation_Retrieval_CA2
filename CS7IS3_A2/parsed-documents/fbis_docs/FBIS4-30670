He said that he had come to explain the details of the money-laundering law as a course of action for Thailand. In principle, the central bank feels that the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages. Three points where submitted for consideration: 1. Disclosing the account figures of customers. Consideration must be given to promulgating a law to protect those who make disclosures, because this could pose a danger to financial institutions that enjoy the trust of depositors. 2. Using special or fictitious names in making deposits. Concerning this, in actual practice, the bank knows the real identity of depositors who use fictitious names. 3. Reporting unusual account transfers.
