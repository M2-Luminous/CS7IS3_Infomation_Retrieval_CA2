The Greek European affairs minister, notorious for his opinions which are often outspoken to the point of being brutal, not content with the violent polemic which broke out two days ago with Italy over some scathing remarks of his on the Right's electoral success, again returned to the attack. Despite the official note which [Foreign Minister] Beniamino Andreatta had immediately addressed to the minister's office, requesting him to maintain "a respectful and reserved attitude toward internal developments in Italy," yesterday Pangalos again expressed his "concern" at the outcome of the Italian elections and the possibility of "a fascist party joining the government." "There is nothing wrong in the fact that a member of the European Union takes an interest in the matter," he explained in Athens, after meeting with the Spanish European Community affairs undersecretary. "We have the situation in Italy very much at heart, and it is in our interest to see a democratic government in Italy. All our parties have condemned fascism, and the involvement of a fascist party in the government worries us," he added. "Clearly, the instability of Italian politics may create problems. We hope," he went on to say, "that Italy will have a democratic government, guided by the European ideal" and capable of "making an important contribution to the Union." Finally, he concluded his latest statement by asserting that the Greek political community, which recently experienced a military dictatorship, "condemns fascism and neofascism." The Greek comments were considered inappropriate in diplomatic circles, considering also that the Athens government currently holds the European Community's presidency. Pangalos, however, wished to minimize Andreatta's firm intervention. It was a "friendly action," he explained, "motivated more by his concern over internal developments than by concern over my statements." However, according to some sources at the Farnesina [Foreign Ministry], Pangalos is now trying to tone down the meaning of the comments he made on Wednesday [27 March], and, in any case, "Andreatta's intervention was firm, and there is no need now for further clarification." Following instructions from the Italian foreign minister, yesterday Italian Ambassador to Greece Giovanni Dominedo addressed a note of censure (in diplomacy, this is somewhat less than an official protest) to the Greek Government. [Radical leader] Marco Pannella also made a statement yesterday concerning the polemic: "Given that the Greek European affairs minister insists on commenting on Italian political problems (which, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing), including arbitrary ideological judgments on this or that `fascist' danger or shame which could result from the new political situation in Italy, Athens should also bear in mind that the key question that must be judged, in Europe and for Europe, is that of the European or non-European nature of the policies pursued by the various countries and the Community's various political forces." According to Pannella, "if Italy and Europe were to compare the policies of the Greek Left with those of the Italian Right, they would not hesitate to consider the Italian Right as the most genuinely European and Community-oriented of the two."
