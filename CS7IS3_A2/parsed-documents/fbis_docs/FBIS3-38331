Mario Segni has many sponsors [preceding word in English], but in an area that is not very homogeneous. And Bossi--or even Berlusconi--might come to the fore. The left says: "There is a candidate, but his name is not being spoken." Do you recall the story of the Horatii and the Curiatii? It used to be taught in school. They were three against three, and at the end only one remained standing. Something similar is occurring a couple of centuries later, also in the region of Rome: three "champions" per team, and in the end only one will be prime minister. The "moderate" or "center-right" team--also referred to as the "freedom axis"--consists of Mario Segni, Umberto Bossi, and Silvio Berlusconi. The "progressive" or "left" team--also referred to as the "reformist axis"--counters with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Achille Occhetto, and Giorgio Napolitano. The voters will decide who will be the Horatii and who the Curiatii, that is to say, who will be the victors and who the vanquished. Many other factors will play a role in determining who of the six will be the last to remain standing. Let us try to identify the factors involved. Mario Segni is the first--and, in fact, the leading--anti-left candidate. Yesterday, he received the support and homage of the "lay members of the Pact for Italy," as former PLI [Italian Liberal Party] Deputy Secretary Patuelli and the well-remembered former Cultural Heritage Minister Bono Parrino now call themselves. Segni also received an expression of support yesterday from Martinazzoli (now a daily occurrence), on condition that he not cast his lot with Bossi, and from Bossi, on condition that he turn a deaf ear to Martinazzoli. Despite these minor problems that remain to be solved, quite a few people favor Segni as head of the future government, including the newborn Italian Popular Party [PPI] (Martinazzoli); the rising Forza Italia party (Berlusconi); the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], in its initial endorsement (Mastella and friends); and Lega, in its initial alliance with the "politicians." They all want Segni and are pledged to support him. Segni does have a problem, however, and it is a big one: as his supporters increase in number, so also do those who have faith in him only up to a certain point. Also increasing in number are those supporters who, because of certain resentments, are themselves more or less silent candidates and will change sides at the opportune moment. An older--and spiteful--gentleman such as Senator Miglio yesterday explained why. "Segni has vacillated on too many occasions," Miglio said. "He has made it plain that what he seeks is power, and above all to become president." As anyone can see in photographs and on TV, Miglio has good ears; he must have heard a few things and concluded that Segni will have to win the elections by a large margin, for otherwise the prime ministerial candidate who gets the greatest exposure and highest approval ratings before the elections, in fact, will be the least likely to become prime minister. Lega, Forza Italia, the Popular Party, and their entourage may indeed band together and run a kind of super ticket under the slogan "Better dead than red" (the phrase is Giuliano Amato's). In that case, Segni will be prime minister if the super ticket obtains a clear majority of seats in Parliament. If the ticket falls only a few dozen seats short, however, deals would have to be made with different groups and the flag would perforce have to be lowered. Would Fini come to the rescue? The MSI [Italian Social Movement] secretary does not, in fact, appear to be very fond of Mario Segni. Commenting on the most recent "Pact for Italy" platform, he delivered the MSI's statement of annoyance and disapproval. "All that the platform lacks," he said, "is a promise that with Segni in Palazzo Chigi, there will be no more rain." But perhaps there will be no super ticket, and Lega and Forza Italia will go their own way, without the Popularists [members of the PPI]. They would then need a different standard-bearer. Perhaps Bossi himself, but that would be like the time when the PCI [Italian Communist Party] sponsored Terracini for the Presidency of the Republic: It was to pay him homage and issue a challenge, and afterward the real negotiations began in earnest. Or it could be Berlusconi himself, inasmuch as he is already out of control--acting as party secretary, holding meetings, negotiating, mediating, and giving orders. Moreover, if you take at face value the polls that are concocted at Fininvest, Berlusconi could even win the elections; with all due respect, however, to go from president of Milan [soccer team] to prime minister of Italy would be a giant step indeed. What will become of Segni if the right decides to compete with the center? He would remain the candidate of Martinazzoli and Pact for Italy. It would then be necessary to make deals--perhaps with the "progressives" who, however, would not accept Segni. The Popularists would not mind that; some of their supporters have already made note of the fact that it was Segni who moved them to the right, and some also point out that Segni had previously moved them to the left. They have already let it be known that they will not forget. And what of the other camp? At least for now, Achille Occhetto is not accepting the urgent invitation from Confindustria President Abete to announce the name of the left's prime minister-designate. Failure to do so, Occhetto said, will cause the left's candidates to lose credibility among the voters whose support they seek. In an interview appearing in L'UNITA, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary said that "a law that does not exist should not necessarily be imitated," namely, a law mandating that a candidate's name be announced and publicized. And yesterday Abete made a further explanation. "If there were such a law," he said, "we would hold primaries within our electoral alliance. Inasmuch as such a law does not exist, I say this to anyone who votes for us: There are three possibile candidates, if we are victorious. They are: The leader of the strongest party in the alliance; a prominent figure in the alliance who would represent it; or lastly, a prominent figure whom I would call democracy's backup player." Outside of the IdentiKit, however, there are three other possibilities: Occhetto himself, Napolitano, and Ciampi. The progressives are having some difficulty in choosing their candidate before the election, and also some embarrassment. Occhetto's candidacy is a somewhat frightening (and somewhat disappointing) prospect; Napolitano's candidacy has the appearance of a banner that would subsequently be lowered; and Ciampi's candidacy could emerge at the end of the process but not at the beginning. Can you imagine Orlando as the nominee, in view of the fact that he is already tempted to send his Rete party to the polls alone in order to gain strength in Sicilian electoral districts and campaign for Ciampi? And can you imagine Cossutta in that role, notwithstanding all the political realism that the Communist Renewal party has manifested in recent days? And although Ciampi took himself out of the race, we can speak to him about it again, but only after the elections, when the voting results themselves might suggest him--or impose him--as the solution. Ciampi is the right man for the progressives if they win but do not win decisively. D'Alema and Occhetto have already said this, but how does one go about shouting it? And so it is the Horatii versus the Curiatii, with Miglio, as usual, cutting the ground from under the feet of his own people by saying: "The moderates do not have a real leader," and with the progressives having perhaps more than one leader but not knowing whether--or how--to bring him to the fore. Lastly, there is the ultimate possibility: the prospect that, contrary to what the story tells us, this time the Horatii and the Curiatii will kill themselves off so that no one really wins the elections. Those who predict a center-left that is oriented toward the year 2000--a government that is an enemy neither of the progressives nor of the Popularists but rather a friend to both--are proving to be correct. In that case, there is a seventh possibility: Romano Prodi. Prodi is more acceptable to Martinazzoli than Segni is and would perhaps not displease the progressives either. But what really is the center-left? Is it a factor for equilibrium in Italy or a ghost of those who will never return? The answer will come on a night in the month of March. [Box, p 8 (Photo captions)] Two Teams and Six Candidates 1. Umberto Bossi: The Lega's strongest leader. 2. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi: A leader for a broad progressive sector. The moderates also like him. 3. Mario Segni: The moderate front is united behind him, but if it suffers defeat, the current consensus could become a boomerang [preceding word in English]. 4. Achille Occhetto: He is head of the strongest party in the coalition that may well win the elections. In other countries, this would be sufficient qualification to become prime minister--but in Italy will it be enough? 5. Silvio Berlusconi: He has already found politics to his liking. It is a long way from being president of Milan to being prime minister, however. 6. Romano Prodi: Martinazzoli and the progressives like him. He is a potential leader of a "center-left [government] of the year 2000."
