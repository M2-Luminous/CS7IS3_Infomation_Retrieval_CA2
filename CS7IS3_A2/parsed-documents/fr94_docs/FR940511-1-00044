FR940511-1-00044 FR940511-1-00011 This rule would not establish a preference or set aside for the Great Lakes. Availability of U.S.-flag service would continue to be determined on a national basis. The amount of cargo reserved for U.S.-flag vessels overall would not decrease because the cargo to be moved on foreign-flag feeder vessels to Canadian transshipment points would not be ``subtracted out'' from the 75 percent of cargoes reserved for U.S.-flag carriage. This proposed rule recognizes the operational limitations of the St. Lawrence Seaway and makes it possible for U.S. ports situated on the Great Lakes to compete with ports located on the other coastal ranges of the United States for the shipment of bulk agricultural product cargoes. It would not guarantee that cargoes will move through Great Lakes ports, but would only allow the Great Lakes ports an opportunity to compete for such cargoes. Movements out of the Great Lakes would still be required to be cost competitive with U.S.-flag service from the other coastal ranges in order to attract cargoes. This proposed rule would not interfere with the concept of ``lowest landed cost'' contained in the regulations of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a unit of the Department of Agriculture responsible for obtaining agricultural products for shipment under various foreign aid programs. The CCC regulations, at 7 CFR 1496.5, provide that the lowest combined total cost of the commodity, plus transportation charges to the port of destination calculated on the basis of U.S.-flag rates and availability, will prevail with regard to awarding contracts. The proposed combined transportation originating at Great Lakes ports would compete on the basis of lowest landed cost with U.S.-flag vessel availability from the other port ranges. As for determining a ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this mixed carriage, the U.S.-flag component would be considered under the existing regulations at 46 CFR part 382 or part 383, as appropriate, with the cost for the foreign-flag component incorporated into the U.S.-flag component in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used in lightening operations in the recipient country's territorial waters. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). It is not considered to be an economically significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, since it has been determined that it is not likely to result in a rule that may have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. Since this rule would affect other Federal agencies, is of great interest to the maritime industry, and has been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, it is considered to be a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. The abbreviated time for comment on the one-season trial period is necessitated by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway System on April 5, 1994. MARAD projects that this rule would allow the movement of up to 250,000 to 300,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities from Great Lakes ports, with a reduction in the shipping cost to the sponsoring Federal agencies of up to $2 to $3 per metric ton ($500,000 to $900,000). This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Federalism The Maritime Administration has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that these regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Maritime Administration certifies that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Environmental Assessment The Maritime Administration has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Paperwork Reduction Act This rulemaking contains no reporting requirement that is subject to OMB approval under 5 CFR Part 1320, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 381. Freight, Maritime carriers. Accordingly, MARAD proposes to amend 46 CFR part 381 as follows: PART 381_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 381 would be revised to read as follows: Authority: 46 App. U.S.C. 1114(b), 1122(d), and 1241; 49 CFR 1.66.
