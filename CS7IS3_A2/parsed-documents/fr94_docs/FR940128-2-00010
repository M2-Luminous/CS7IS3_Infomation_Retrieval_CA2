FR940128-2-00010 FR940128-2-00005 On December 23, 1993, KT submitted revised sales, COP, constructed value (CV), and concordance databases, correcting minor errors discovered at verification. On January 5, 1994, petitioners submitted a letter requesting that the Department reject this submission because it contained revisions to KT's data which were unsupported by the record of this investigation. On January 7, 1994, KT replaced its COP, CV, and concordance databases in order to correct clerical errors made in its December 23, 1993, submission. We reviewed this submission and confirmed that it contained no new information. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is welded austenitic stainless steel pipe of circular cross section (WSSP). WSSP is produced according to standards and specifications set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The designations for this product include, but are not limited to, ASTM A&hyph;312, ASTM A&hyph;358, ASTM A&hyph;409, and ASTM A&hyph;778. Welded pipes are generally used as conduits to transmit liquids or gases. The major applications for WSSP are: Digester lines; blow lines; pharmaceutical lines; petrochemical lines; brewery process and transport lines; general food processing lines; automotive lines; and paper processing machines. This product is classified under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheadings: 7306.40.1000, 7306.40.5005, 7306.40.5015, 7306.40.5045, 7306.40.5060, and 7306.40.5075. These subheadings are defined to encompass welded stainless steel tube as well as WSSP; however, the only product subject to this investigation is WSSP. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is September 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that the product covered by this investigation comprises a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise. We made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of: (1) ASTM or equivalent specification, (2) grade of steel, (3) nominal size, (4) hot or cold finish, (5) wall thickness schedule, and (6) end finish, as described in Appendix V of the questionnaire. We made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of WSSP from Malaysia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. United States Price We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and because exporter's sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated. After correcting the data used in our calculations for errors and omissions found at verification, we calculated purchase price based on packed F.O.B. prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, marine insurance, and containerization expenses. Regarding marine insurance, KT paid an insurance premium plus a commission to one of its marine insurance suppliers. At verification, we found that KT had inconsistently reported its marine insurance expense for this supplier ( i.e. , KT included the commission in one observation yet excluded it in another observation). KT explained that this commission was an intracompany service fee which its parent company charged KT for holding the group policy with the insurance company. However, KT could not substantiate at verification that it had properly excluded this commission. As a result, we resorted to the use of best information available (BIA), in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act. As BIA, we have made an adverse assumption and increased the amount reported for marine insurance to account for this commission for all transactions (except those we found at verification to be correct) by the amount of the commission.
