The onslaught of dividend cuts which began with second regional banks has spread to credit unions and shows signs of extending to a portion of the city banks. The purpose of such dividend cuts is to preserve internal financial strength and assign priority to the disposal of bad debt. Currently, little adverse reaction is being voiced by shareholders, but allegations have been made of insufficient disclosure of information. Akira Takai, chief of the First Business Research Department of the Daiwa Research Institute expresses a paradoxical view concerning the stock price of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank by saying, "The stock market has reacted favorably to actions taken by the bank." When the news was announced on 23 March that the bank would cut its dividends, its price rose 4 yen, and the ensuing days witnessed a gradual rise in the stock price. The moves did not reflect stock price action which is typical following the announcement of unfavorable news. The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank has officially denied that "any decision has been made by the bank" relative to a dividend cut. However, there is no denying that the bank is conducting internal studies which consider a dividend cut and expectations are that in the latter part of April, it will announce "a 1 yen dividend cut together with a cost-reduction plan and disposal of bad debt." Ever since announcement of earnings reports for the March 1993 year, many second regional banks either reduced or eliminated dividends. They included the Hyogo Bank, Taiheiyo Bank, Hanwa Bank, Osaka Bank, and Fukutoku Bank, having been affected by adverse conditions occasioned by the bursting of the bubble economy. There are signs that March 1994 yearly earnings reports will reflect cuts in dividends by credit unions and associations on a nationwide basis. Many leading credit unions, such as Jonan and Asahi have already announced that they will cut dividends two points to 6 percent. It can be said that changes in dividend policies, which began with the regional financial institutions, have finally spread to city banks. However, conditions at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are not as serious as they are at the second regional banks. Hokkaido Takushoku Bank still holds undeclared paper profits of about 300 billion yen. Otherwise, if undeclared appreciation of land values and bad loan reserves are considered, adequate financial resources exist to avoid dividend cuts even if provision is made for write offs associated with Kabuto Decom Inc. stock. According to Daiwa Research Institute, investors have taken the view in the market place that "Banks such as Hokkaido Takushoku Bank have reduced dividends as the result of a full-scale write down of bad loans and have thus established the basis for a clean slate for future operations." It appears that Hokkaido Takushoku Bank stock price did not decline because of such considerations. On 14 and 15 March, the Quick Research Institute conducted a questionnaire survey of asset managers at financial institutions and asked them for their reaction in the event of a theoretical announcement of deficit earnings reports and dividend cuts by selected leading banks. Only 1 percent of the managers responded that "the news would be interpreted in an adverse manner and result in unstable movement in stock markets or financial stocks as a whole." The largest group of 43.9 percent responded that, "even if such news had a temporary shock effect, such actions will lead to an improvement in financial strength of the firms involved." The leading regional Ashikaga Bank, which reduced dividends effective with the September 1993 midyear earnings report, reacted to controversy over its dividend cut by saying, "The dividend was cut back to its former level of 5 yen because of a 50-percent drop in earnings. Dividends should rise and fall along with fluctuations in earnings." The Ashikaga Bank has taken action to improve the soundness of its operations by liquidating its nonbank subsidiary known as Wing Finance and effecting internal bank restructurings. The idea is to reduce dividends and concurrently bring an end to retrogressive operating methods. Such policies to revise dividend policies by banks seem to reflect banks' tendencies concerning pride and the pursuit of uniformity in behavior. In the case of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank which is a city bank, it cannot reduce its dividend below 5 yen because that is the rate of payout maintained by leading regional banks. It can increase its retained earnings by only about 900 million yen annually--by reducing the dividend by one yen--a figure which is incomparably small relative to its bad debt figure and would have very little accounting impact. Even in the case of the Ashikaga Bank, it was able to reduce its dividend by 1 yen because only a few regional banks, such as the Shizuoka Bank, were paying a 6 yen dividend. Ashikaga Bank admits, "An annual dividend payout of less than 5 yen is not possible." They are admitting that a stable dividend payout is unavoidable. Chief Takai of Daiwa Research Institute takes the view that the move to reduce dividends among financial institutions will not spread to the leading city banks. The reason is that when the major effects of relations with shareholders and bank customers, recognition by society and responsibilities associated with management are considered, many management officials believe that "adequate undeclared asset values exist and dividend cuts would not be advisable from a cost-versus-effect standpoint." Chief Eiji Hirano of the Financial Section, Operations Bureau of the Bank of Japan voices criticism by saying, "Banks are not aware that the days of uniformity in behavior are gone. They should become more conscious of the management control mechanism reflected in stock market actions." He's saying that the public utilities aspect of financial institutions is limited to their financial settlement systems and that banks should be treated like any other industrial firm in other respects. Needless to say, dividend cuts are not the only action to be taken. The reason is that, as reflected in the questionnaire survey conducted by the Quick Research Institute, market reactions reflect the bold restructuring actions taken after a cut in dividends. According to officials of the bank, the Bank of Tokyo was "unable to keep up with the dividend increases of other city banks" from fiscal years 1983 to 1990 because of the accumulated debtor nation problem, but implemented a personnel reduction of about 1,000 and, in connection with its September 1993 midyear earnings report, restored dividends to the lowest levels maintained by city banks. Shareholders, no doubt, will demand decisive management actions on the part of banks which effect dividend cuts. It is also necessary to take bold action relative to public disclosure of information. Bank stock prices fell sharply during March and April 1992. The drop in prices was directly triggered by massive sales of bank stocks on the part of European and U.S. hedge funds. According to the Quick Research Institute, "No progress had been made on the public disclosure of bad loans, and the fear that banks were holding unlimited quantities of bad loans exacerbated the selling trend." The reason why stocks of the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Ashikaga Bank have assumed a firming trend is that public disclosure of bad loans has progressed beyond levels of prior times and undisclosed bad loan information has been widely covered by the mass media. It is also said that the Ministry of Finance, which fears that dividend cuts and deficit earnings reports will serve as a cause for instability in financial systems, has recently assumed a flexible stance. Although premature action should not be taken on dividend cuts, we should take action to make public disclosure of operating conditions and appropriate dividend payout levels permanent fixtures of Japanese financial institutions.
