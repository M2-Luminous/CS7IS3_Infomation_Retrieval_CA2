This four-star hotel, operated by the German firm LTI, is a highly successful venture. Its average occupancy is 92.2 percent during peak season. It has 233 rooms with ocean views right on the beach. It also has atmosphere: Tourists are greeted by a stone Aztec calendar as they walk into the lobby, which is decorated with borders and figurines made out of precious woods, reproductions of archeological pieces. Its discotheque, "La Bamba," is famous because, in the interest of "providing atmosphere," it does not prevent local Cubans from gaining admittance. Bufete Industrial designed this hotel in the Mexican style of architecture, but all of the construction was done by Cubans. As with other hotels, the government offered 50 percent of the shares for sale. In May 1992, the DSC group of Guadalajara, led at that time by Jose Giral (former director of the Xabre group), bought the stock. Indecision about how the purchase would be carried out resulted in delays, however. In 1993, it was agreed that it would be done by means of swaps. The amount of the investment was $15 million. The second project was the El Mariel cement plant, located in the port of the same name, 20 kilometers from Havana. It is the largest of the six cement factories on the island. After the demise of the Soviet Union and the European Socialist bloc, they were left without raw materials, and no one had the money to buy them. According to a study by Donna Rich and Michel Kaplowitz of Johns Hopkins University, these plants have the potential to produce 5,500 tons of cement a year. Lorenzo Zambrano, the majority shareholder in Cemex, came to the rescue. He formed a joint venture with the Cuban Cement Union for a total investment of $80 million. Cuba provided half of that amount in the form of the facilities; $20 million took the form of swaps, and $20 million was in fresh money from the Mexican Foreign Trade Bank. Cemex is marketing the cement on the international market. The third project, in the petroleum sector, was announced by Mexico's ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello Macias, in a sidewalk interview at the end of a ceremony in Cuba commemorating the birthday of Benito Juarez last 21 March. "I do not know the technical details," said the ambassador, "but I understand that Mexpetrol and a Cuban company will work together to rehabilitate and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos. They will process Mexican crude oil and other products there." The Cienfuegos refinery, located in the southern part of the island, has the capacity to process 3 million tons of crude a year, according to data supplied by the Cupet company of Cuba. At present it is partially shut down because Cuba does not have any petroleum or any money to buy it. Moreover, the plant was built with Soviet technology and needs renovation. According to sources close to the negotiations, Mexpetrol (of which Pemex is the majority shareholder) and Cupet of Cuba signed a "letter of intent" and will sign the agreement in two months. The investment amounts to $200 million, $100 million from Cupec in the form of the facilities, and $100 million from the Mexican side, as follows: $50 million in swaps, with stock in the refinery itself, and $50 million in fresh money. Although Mexpetrol is heading up the negotiations for the Mexican side, the Mexican Petroleum Institute (which will provide the scientific studies) and the private construction firms ICA and Protexa are also involved. Bancomext will provide the credit. This new Cuban-Mexican firm will pay for the credit in cash, but there is also the possibility that it may make some payments in refined Mexican crude. Cienfuegos has one advantage in refining petrochemicals and by-products: It is directly connected to a supertanker base in the port of Matanzas, in the western part of the island, by a 187-kilometer pipeline. IUSA vs. Telmex These three investments mark the beginning of Mexico's swaps in Cuba. Other Mexicans are apparently looking for similar opportunities. In the case of IUSA, owned by Alejo Peralta, his son Carlos Peralta offered the Cuban Government an investment project to modernize the island's telephone system. The current system is in a state of deterioration, and has 1950's-era technology. His idea was to bring in satellite communication systems for international and local calling. As a prelude, he donated to Castro's government two rural phone systems valued at $300,000 each. They are now in use in the Provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana to link up various agricultural camps. The younger Peralta's representative in Cuba was Manuel Cerrillo, who negotiated an investment project amounting to more than $1 billion, 25 percent in swaps. The deal involved paying approximately $200 million, equivalent to two-thirds of Cuba's current debt to Mexico. Thus, it was the biggest investment project between the two countries. A "protocol agreement" was even signed. Suddenly, to the Cubans' surprise, Carlos Peralta said nevermind. He argued that his envoy, Cerrillo, had gone beyond the authorized limitations in the negotiations and had signed on to terms that Peralta had not agreed to. Havana officials were surprised and irritated. It was revealed, however, that the investment is not a lost cause, and there is hope that an agreement can be reached. In response, Carlos Slim, majority shareholder in Telmex, stepped into the fray. He also submitted a proposal to modernize the Cuban telephone system, and during the first week in March he came to Havana to negotiate a deal. Slim and Peralta are not the only ones vying to win this contract from the Cuban Government. Several Spanish and English firms and a Canadian one are also hoping for a nod from Castro's government. Castro has formed a special group to study the proposals. For the time being, only two other Mexican businessmen have made direct investments on the island: Luis Nino de Rivera, in a cellular telephone system that he has operated in Havana and Varadero for two years; and Monterrey businessmen Mauricio Fernandez and Danny Tafich, who made a joint investment with the Castro regime to breathe life into 15 Cuban textile plants that had been practically idled for lack of capital and inputs. Other companies have announced investment projects, but nothing has come to pass yet. One example is Infra, which belongs to Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, former president of the National Association of Manufacturers (Canacintra), and which tried to set up a plant to produce solder. Another is Bancomer, which talked about introducing credit cards to Cuba and offering other banking services. Other examples are the Vitro group, which tried to build a plant to produce glass and plastic containers; and Bufete Industrial, which intended to participate in the construction of the Villa Cuba Hotel in Varadero. Mexico: Most Favored Nation "Mexico is the most favored nation," stated Ernesto Melendez, president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation (CECE), last year during a meeting with businessmen in London. "But," he added, "the investment is still at a low level, considering the two countries' potential." So far, most Mexican businessmen have confined themselves to the commerce sector. Some 200 companies of various sizes and product lines are exporting everything from canned food to intermediate manufactured goods to Cuba. The volume is small, however. They do not account for as much as 5 percent of Cuba's imports. Trade between the two countries reached $125 million in 1992. This is such a tiny proportion of Mexico's exports that Cuba does not appear in its annual statistical reports on foreign trade. "We must be more aggressive about participating in trade (with Cuba) so as not to be edged out by other countries," asserted Gutierrez Camposeco in October, when he was still president of Canacintra, in a lengthy interview with the Mexican business magazine EXPANSION. But Mexican businessmen appear timid and slow to act. "Many national goods that are sold on the Cuban market are not brought in by Mexican firms, but by Spanish ones. In other words, the Spaniards are eating our lunch in Cuba, and with our own products," said Carlos Sanchez Lara, then Mexico's commercial attache in Cuba, in June of last year to a delegation of 15 businessmen who had come to the island to look into the possibilities for joint ventures. "We cannot allow that to continue," he declared emphatically. Furthermore, "Mexico is squandering investment and trade opportunities in Cuba because it is not up to date on that market, and it has failed to take into account the very favorable objective conditions: geographic proximity, stable economic and political ties, common cultures, favorable market...." In the Cuban business world, Mexicans have gained a reputation for "always saying yes, but not saying when." Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina acknowledged in February that commercial relations with Mexico "are not as intensive as we would like. Mexico knows this," he stated, "and we regret it." He admitted that the economic ties are not commensurate with the political relations the two countries have maintained, and he expressed the hope that the situation would change as the Cuban economy opens up more and more to foreign capital. On 21 March of this year, Ambassador Carlos Tello stated that commercial ties between the two countries "are growing, and I have been instructed to maintain them, strengthen them, and expand them." As if to dispel any doubts, he added: "There will be fresh money, financing, and investment."
