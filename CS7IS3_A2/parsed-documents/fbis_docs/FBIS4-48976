Liu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said if the national flag carrier fails to implement the instruction demand within a specific period, the government may suspend some of its routes. Li also said the government will take some disciplinary measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday crash. Earlier in the day, President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) that a special committee has been set up within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines in the aftermath of the crash. All but eight of the aircraft's 271 passengers and crew, mostly Japanese and Taiwanese, were killed in the crash of the Airbus A300- 600R, arriving in Nagoya from Taipei. Two of the survivors are Taiwanese. It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 11th since 1969, giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of crashes per flight hours than the world average. Many of the crashes, in which a total of 410 people have died, involved human error.
