According to officials with the Guangzhou Railway Administration, by this morning, the station had cancelled 44 passenger trains to other cities across the country since June 15, when it first stopped operating the No. 142 passenger train to Chongqing city, Sichuan Province. Some 100,000 passengers' trips in all were affected by the cancellations. The officials said they had to cancel more passenger trains to Tianjin, Hangzhou and Kunming today and tomorrow. Almost all the passenger trains now starting from Guangzhou going southwards have arrived later than scheduled. They predicted that train services at the station would not be fully back to normal for several days. For the past week the station has been staffing three extra counters round the clock to deal with returned train tickets. The number of passengers using the local civil air service also plunged sharply compared with normal times. Many groups who had planned to travel here for sightseeing or business returned their air tickets and cancelled their plans. But officials with the Guangzhou Baiyun Airport of China South Airlines said that, in the past several days, the number of air passengers seemed to be climbing again, as more and more people switched to air travel from rail. Water transport from Guangzhou to other areas was also forced to stop, until the water route from Guangzhou to Huizhou resumed the day before yesterday. The flooding on the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers has driven the water level in the Pearl (Zhujiang) River up swiftly, causing some areas of Guangzhou to be flooded and affecting local transport.
