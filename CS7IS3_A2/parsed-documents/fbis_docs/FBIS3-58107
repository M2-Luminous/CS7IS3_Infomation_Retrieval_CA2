By a succession of little touches, Francois Mitterrand is undermining the polite cohabitation which has hitherto reigned between the Elysee and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]. The head of state, who yesterday afternoon received the "nation's vital forces" at the Elysee (employers, trade unions, charity organizations, community movements, and so forth), spoke at length about his proposal for a "new social contract." In his New Year's wishes, the president of the republic described 1993 as a "black year of unemployment" and urged Edouard Balladur, without naming him, to "help" the employers and trade unions to combat this scourge. Speaking on Tuesday evening [4 January], the prime minister had reaffirmed his desire to include the struggle against the increase in unemployment on the top of his agenda for 1994. "With regard to the social pact," he reaffirmed that "for the first time in many years, the government which I head twice brought together the two sides of industry, the employers' and workers' organizations, in April." "This Is A High Price To Pay" The whole question here is whether or not this is cooperation or organized consultation. "The question is whether we can sit down at a table and reach an agreement," the prime minister replied with extreme caution, "I am in favor of this in principle but that is not enough. The employers' and trade union organizations must be ready for it too." To verify this, Edouard Balladur has decided to establish "a number of contacts with some of them." Francois Mitterrand probably judged the reply to be inadequate. The term "social pact" mentioned by Balladur was judged to be "irritating and disagreeable with regard to the past." The head of state thinks it is appropriate to "help revive a contractual policy which has been in abeyance for all too long." "I think that the contractual policy should help to form the social foundation for any social action in France." But the head of state did not stop at this "encouragement." In front of a prime minister very busy counting the lights on the chandelier in the hall, he listed four courses. The first relates to the use of credits in the sphere of job creation: "We must consider that 300 billion francs [Fr] are devoted to it... That corresponds to 3 million jobs paid at the minimum wage!" "It is conceivable that such sums could be used to push back the evil rather than maintaining it," he stressed. The second is a criticism of the government's policy which seeks, through the enterprises, "pools of jobs." "Oh, what a wonderful expression!" he said sarcastically: "I have noted that this year Fr80 billion have been transferred to the enterprises without any effect on employment. Heads of enterprise, this is a high price to pay!" Balladur looked down at his feet. These are only possible courses: "I am not an inventor." But the president of the republic expressed the hope that the governmnent will "set to work" without delay. "This contractual policy, the foundation of any social policy, only requires a little imagination and time." Turning to the prime minister, he added: "I am not asking for an increase in state intervention (Balladur smiled -- LE FIGARO editor's note) but simply a transfer of funds to make them useful." This is certainly not the end of cohabitation, but after his criticism of the repeal of the Falloux Law, it is clear that the head of state thinks that it is time to return to his role as a "spur." Through this "new social contract," Francois Mitterrand wants to force the government to expose itself more on the employment front. The Elysee is aware that, although Edouard Balladur's popularity is reaching great heights, a majority of French people disapprove of his policy. By placing the emphasis on the employment issue, the president of the republic stresses this apparent paradox and thus gives the measure by which the public will gauge the success -- or failure -- of Balladur's policy. It is true that, in this sphere, he is helped by the promises made -- and not kept -- by the government. These "digs" are being made at a time when the prime minister is observing some signs of economic recovery. What is more, Mitterrand is not content with a stabilization in the number of people seeking work: "We must achieve a reduction in unemployment, a reabsorption of long-term unemployment," he said yesterday. If the Socialist Party were still in any doubt, the head of state's capacity for initiative remains intact.
