FR940414-1-00056 FR940414-1-00010 EPA has identified zero discharge of wastewater pollutants as achievable with the best available technology, and this translates to 100 percent removal of active ingredient pollutants, which is considerably greater than the removals achieved by biotreatment under laboratory conditions for the active ingredients. For each of these active ingredient structural groups, the DSS shows that average BAT removal efficiencies are considerably greater than the average active ingredient removals achieved by biotreatment under laboratory conditions for each of the active ingredients (100 percent removal by the technologies identified as BAT versus an optimistic estimate of 50 percent or less removal by the POTW as reported in the DSS). Accordingly, all active ingredients were deemed to pass through the treatment systems at POTWs. The active ingredients that are formulated, packaged or repackaged into pesticide products at a given facility are expected to always be present in the process wastewater. Since EPA's pass through analysis indicates that all active ingredients pass through, and the facility would be required to achieve zero discharge of the active ingredient, it would be inappropriate to exempt phenol or 2,4-dimethylphenol (or any other priority pollutant) from regulation on the basis that they do not pass through a POTW (as EPA did in the recent pesticides manufacturers rulemaking). This is because these two priority pollutants, which have been determined to be compatible with well-operated secondary treatment, will never be the only pollutants present in a wastewater stream resulting from pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging. PFPR facilities often generate wastewater on multiple production lines. Because the wastewater volumes are usually small, however, it is not practical to operate dedicated wastewater treatment systems to serve individual lines. Recognizing the need for operational simplicity, EPA believes that centralized wastewater treatment is more appropriate and has conceptualized a single BAT treatment system for PFPR facilities that the Agency is terming the ``Universal Treatment System.'' As envisioned by EPA, the Universal Treatment System would be sized to handle small volumes of wastewater on a batch basis and would combine the most commonly used treatment technologies for pesticide active ingredients, hydrolysis, chemical precipitation, chemical oxidation, and activated carbon, with one or more pretreatment steps, such as emulsion breaking, solids settling, and filtration. The BAT performance of the three active ingredient treatment technologies is well demonstrated and they serve as the full or partial basis for most of the manufacturers' active ingredient limitations. The pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging wastewater is expected to contain the constituents of the pesticide product being formulated. It could be possible that a facility would formulate and package, for example a product containing an active ingredient that is best treated by hydrolysis and another product that contains an active ingredient that is best treated by chemical oxidation. The Universal Treatment System is expected to be flexible in that it can handle these diverse treatment requirements. This system can treat pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater with hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, chemical precipitation and activated carbon or a combination of these technologies depending on the active ingredients needing to be controlled. The Universal Treatment System also can accomplish chemical/thermal emulsion breaking, which controls emulsifiers and surfactants that are added to some pesticide products as inert ingredients. Emulsion breaking may be needed as an initial step to improve the treatability of the wastewater. As described previously in Section V of this preamble, the Agency conducted a treatability study using pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging process wastewater from two facilities to demonstrate the performance of the Universal Treatment System. EPA envisions the Universal Treatment System as being a flexible treatment system that can treat for a variety of active ingredients, be sized to handle the small volumes generated by pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities, and be operated on a batch basis. EPA expects that the majority of facilities needing treatment will need less than the full array of control technologies provided in the Universal Treatment System. EPA believes the Universal Treatment System including pretreatment for emulsifiers/surfactants where needed and pollution prevention practices and water conservation that lead to the recycle/reuse of the treated wastewaters, reflects the best available technology for this PSES rulemaking. However these are by no means the only technologies available to achieve the proposed standards. For example, as described previously in Section VIII of this preamble, three of the facilities sampled employed an ultrafiltration membrane separation technology or cross-flow filtration that operates in a similar manner in combination with activated carbon technology. The full Universal Treatment System may not currently be available on a commercial basis as an off-the-shelf system, but EPA believes that in many cases there are commercially available systems that will be suitable for a specific facility's needs. Many of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that do have treatment have purchased off-the-shelf treatment units such as ultrafiltration or cross-flow filtration membranes and activated carbon systems.
