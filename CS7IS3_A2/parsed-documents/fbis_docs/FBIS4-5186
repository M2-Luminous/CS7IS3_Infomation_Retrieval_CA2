They fought against the invading forces and the war materiel that has been brought in to prepare for successive offensives in the area between Routes 69 and 68 and the area east of Route 68. Here are the preliminary results: I. Liberation and destruction of positions: 1. The Banteay Chhma position was completely liberated and destroyed. Two big warehouses containing weapons and ammunition have been burning for five hours already. All the villages around Banteay Chhma have been liberated. 2. The big garrison (?at Soeng) and the Kouk Mon township have been liberated and destroyed -- all the way from Beng and Kou to Rumchang townships -- along with all the positions in the surrounding communes and villages. Two big warehouses at (?Banteay Soeng) were burning throughout the night, until 0900 on 7 April. II. Liberation and [words indistinct] people: 1. Nearly 2,000 families -- a total of over 90,000 people -- have been liberated. 2. Eighty-nine villages have been liberated. 3. The people -- who have been the victims of the war of aggression by the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets for three years, particularly victims of the two-headed government and UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and of the burn- all-kill-all campaign of August 1993 -- have risen up and cooperated with the NADK. They have attacked the invading forces and enlisted as soldiers by the hundreds. The people are moving in throngs to meet the NADK. They have embraced the NADK with tears flowing to express their sentiment at meeting with them. It was as if they had been reborn. III. Seizure of weapons: 1. According to preliminary reports, two T-54 tanks, a 37-mm antiaircraft gun, a 122-mm D-30 gun, a 100-mm gun, and a 120-mm gun were seized at (?Banteay Soeng); 2. A DK-82 gun, an 82-mm mortar, and a 12.7-mm gun were seized in Kouk Mon. 3. A DK-75, a DK-82, an 82-mm mortar, a 12.7-mm gun, a big central field radio, and so on were seized in Banteay Chhma. 4. A fully-stocked warehouse with assorted ammunition was seized, including AK's, AR-15's, B-40's, B-41's, grenades, 12.7-mm ammunition, and so on. The people are taking this ammunition out of the warehouse. A BM multiple rocket battery was also seized. IV. Nhoek Bunchhai's [government general] villa was attacked, destroyed, and reduced to ashes. The people say they fed him for over 10 years, but he became a U.S. mercenary following the July 1993 merger of the Para soldiers and the communist puppet troops. He has been biting and cutting the throats of countless people. The people are looking for Nhoek Bunchhai to try him for his great crimes. V. Our forces control all strategic roads. The people and the NADK are in control of all strategic roads and are waiting to ambush the invading forces' reinforcements. On the morning of 7 April, two tanks left Samraong accompanied by 40 soldiers. When they were east of Tonle Sar, we ambushed them and forced them to retreat. Leaders of the communist Vietnamese puppets such as Nhoek Bunchhai and other Para leaders are shouting in panic. They shout: The United States, France, Australia, and Japan have gathered dollars to buy over 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition from communist Vietnam and Russia so Nhoek Bunchhai and Dien Del can continue fueling the war against the NADK. Now the people and the NADK have taken everything. A quantity of this ammunition has been reduced to ashes. They talked to one another in panic over the field radio, saying that this attack by the people and the NADK has affected Divisions 3, 9, 7, 8, 11, and 12. The people shouted these insults back: You are all mercenaries waging war to kill the people. You have sold yourselves to foreigners to kill Cambodians. Countless people -- the old, the young, men, and women -- have been killed by warmongers. Villages, cattle, paddy, and rice have all vanished. You do not even spare baby diapers. You have undressed and raped hundreds of our daughters like animals. Each of our daughters was gang-raped to death. You bayonetted and pumped bullets into the girls after raping them. You are evil! You are Cambodians; how can you kill Cambodian people like this? Your blood is so dark! How similar your blood is to that of the black-tooth communist Vietnamese and the blood of communist Vietnamese puppets Hun Sen, Chea Sim, Sin Song, Sin Sen, and Sar Kheng! The anger of the people will become as strong as a prairie and bush fire; nothing can stop it.
