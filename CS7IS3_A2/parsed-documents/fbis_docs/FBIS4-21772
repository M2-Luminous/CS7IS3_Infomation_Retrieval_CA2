More from No'omi Segal:'' ``What emerged in testimonies on the failure of security arrangements to work properly on the morning of the massacre was a broken chain of command. In contradiction to an earlier testimony by head of Central Command Dani Yatom regarding the stationing of a policeman at the Cave of Patriarchs, commander of the Judaea District Police Moshe Mizrahi testified there was no standing order for a police officer to be present at the site. An alternative arrangement called for a police van to patrol the area, Mizrahi said, but on the morning of the massacre the police scheduled to patrol were unaware it was their turn.'' ``Eli Moyal, the Border Police duty officer the night before the massacre, answered questions on why three Border Police failed to reach their posts. I prepared a list of who had to be working, Moyal said, but the morning duty officer changed it. By the time three other Border Police were awakened, it was too late,'' he said. ``Qiryat Arba' resident Eli'ezer Spitzer, who was in the jeep that gave Barukh Goldstein a lift to the Cave of the Patriarchs, also appeared before the commission. Spitzer said he noticed nothing unusual about Goldstein's behavior and, in response to the judges question, could not recall what kind of weapon Goldstein had.'' ``The commission tried to verify contradictions in testimony by a Muslim worshiper who was in the Cave of the Patriarchs at the time of the massacre, 'Abd-Rabbuh al-Atrash. He told the judges he heard two explosions and then firing, not one explosion, as he earlier told police.'' ``At this hour, Pinhas Eidelstein, who is the duty communications officer in Qiryat Arba', is appearing before the commission. Miryam Goldstein called Eidelstein minutes before the massacre, urging him to contact her husband. The judges are trying to clarify if there was anything in her tone that indicated alarm.''
