Forty-seven United Nations military and civilian personnel were diagnosed HIV positive in Cambodia, but UNTAC's chief medical officer Colonel Dr. Peter Fraps claims the real number of HIV cases contracted in Cambodia could run as high as 150. "I know that there are some nations where each soldier repatriated is tested and I know that they find a lot of positive cases," Dr. Fraps said. "I know that there are contingents that had up to now five or eight cases of HIV in-country, and I heard in the meantime they found an additional ten cases when they tested the soldiers at home." "I think the figure will be much higher than the 47 we found here. I can just guess and I would say up to 150. But this is just a rough idea." When the number of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) being diagnosed among United Nations personnel began to skyrocket towards the end of last year, finally peaking at 666 for the month of December, Dr. Fraps decided something had to be done. An AIDS awareness campaign was launched involving videos and booklets, more than a quarter of a million condoms were distributed to UNTAC personnel and compulsory HIV testing on all patients suffering from a sexually transmitted disease was introduced. "We had people come five, six or seven times with a sexually transmitted disease," Dr. Fraps said. The German medics then began an AIDS education campaign among prostitutes and the local population as part of their civic action program, but when they offered free HIV tests the World Health Organizsation stepped in and asked for it to end as there were no trained AIDS counselors in Cambodia and it was regarded irresponsible to tell people they had a life-threatening disease if you could not provide adequate counseling. Dr. Fraps agreed and the testing was stopped. In February this year counselors were trained and now local HIV victims are told of their condition. He also issued a directive in September last year that all patients with serious injuries undergo HIV tests as a measure of protection for the German doctors performing surgeries. "You can say we did everything, but you cannot change the mentality and this is the problem," he said. "When we had the first cases of HIV in September/October 1992, I asked headquarters in New York -- the medical director -- what the U.N.'s policy is. I asked specifically what to do with HIV positives here in the mission area and I did it twice and I never received an answer, therefore I pursued the policy of many armies: That a soldier who is found positive will not be dismissed, although he can be dismissed if he asks for it -- that's the policy in the German army." "As long as he is HIV positive and has no symptoms -- no pain -- he will stay in the army." Although Dr. Fraps admits he really wanted all HIV positive UNTAC personnel repatriate for the safety of their colleagues who might unwittingly administer first aid to them in an emergency situation and contract the disease themselves, no HIV positive UNTAC employee was repatriated before their time. Dr. Fraps said former Eastern bloc countries figured high on the sexually transmitted disease file and blamed this partly on ignorance and the new-found freedom of soldiers from these countries. While the number of UNTAC employees reporting in with STD was always high, Dr. Fraps believes still more cases went unreported because the victims were afraid of being repatriated, or as in the case of one contingent STD, statistics for its soldiers were altered before any reports were sent to the Phnom Penh headquarters. "The opinion was, because I was talking with someone from this contingent, that it shouldn't be interesting for headquarters how many cases of sexually transmitted diseases they had and it's absolutely not necessary to talk with them about HIV." Dr. Fraps added that other countries like Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan seemed to have a "national policy" of reporting a much lower STD rate than they actually had. "And you have no means as chief medical officer to make pressure, it's impossible," he said. "I think there should be an open handling of these things because everybody is concerned it's a worldwide problem, and therefore to hide cases is absolutely stupid and it's dangerous." "For many of the soldiers here it was an event that was to be seen under monetary viewpoints. They earned a lot of money for staying here one year, or six months, or eighteen months. Each of the soldiers got more money for staying here than in his home country. "Most of these soldiers were coming from third-world countries, some of them were earning ten times more than in their home countries, therefore the policy of each soldier was to stay as long as possible in this mission area. And if you know that commanders in some nations said "If you are treated for a sexually transmitted disease you will be sent home", then you can imagine what happended. Many cases didn't see the doctor, just to avoid the situation that they would be sent home, because this was the promise of the commander," Dr. Fraps explained. More than 5,000 treatments were provided to UNTAC personnel suffering from STD during this mission. But Dr. Fraps estimates another 1,500 cases went unreported. About 3,000 HIV tests were conducted on UN personnel while serving in Cambodia. Dr. Fraps readily admits UNTAC personnel have probably helped spread the HIV virus in Cambodia, but he is adamant that UNTAC is not responsible for the HIV virus in Cambodia and he is backed up by other health experts in Phnom Penh. "We have soldiers in the mission area from countries where HIV is epidemic therefore it's absolutely likely that soldiers coming from these countries contributed to the contamination in the area. Also we had a lot of personnel going to Thailand on holiday, and it's also possible there was contamination caused by sexual intercourse with Thai prostitutes." "But it is absolutely not true that Cambodia before this mission had no problems with HIV or they had no problems concerning sexually transmitted diseases." "It's not fair to say that due to this UNTAC mission the first contamination came to Cambodia." Following Dr. Fraps education campaign efforts and the end of the UNTAC mission, the number of reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases among UN personnel is on the decline. In July 284 cases were reported, in August it was down to 177. The average age of HIV victims in UNTAC is 25. Dr. Fraps would like to see the United Nations implement compulsory HIV testing for all soldiers going on future missions. He said all nations should have a mission preparation course that discusses how to avoid contracting STD and HIV. He also thinks UN headquarters should require all countries to report all HIV cases believed to have been contracted in Cambodia, including those found on repatriation, to aid policy planning for future missions.
