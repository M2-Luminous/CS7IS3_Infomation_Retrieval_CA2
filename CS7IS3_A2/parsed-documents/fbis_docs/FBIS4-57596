Determined to make the best use of the days left in May and however many work shifts it takes June, Cuban sugar producers at their daily tasks confirm that the harvest battle can be won with less than half the resources required in previous years. Sugar workers confirm with their daily actions during this tense and difficult final, lap that the commitment to fulfill the sugar plan is irreversible and will be maintained. Good examples of this are Havana and Guantanamo Provinces, the first to fulfill their respective sugar production plans. Other good news is that Sancti Spiritu Province, one of the country's largest, is about to join the vanguard with its stable and secure work. Rain, blessed when in season, has not beat down the Cuban sugar producers' will to win. They understand the urgent need, for the sake of the country's economy, to cut and mill all available sugarcane and to not stop until the projected volume of sugar has been reached. Cuban sugar producers are aware that working in a very humid environment is not someone's whim and that there is no alternative but to further increase efforts and organization to process raw material that still remains in the fields, doing so with maximum efficiency. The strategy now is to not limit industrial capacity, maintain a high level of productive combativeness, and not become frustrated with the rain, no matter how heavy it seems. The harvest, as Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres has said, must be viewed as a whole and unique industry which belongs to Cuba. That is why available resources are assigned to the center with the milling capacity. Together with this battle, which is of unique economic importance to Cuba, there is intense work in sugarcane agriculture, especially in sowing and cleaning fields. A satisfactory national amount was reached during January to April, when approximately 6,000 caballerias of gramineae were sowed, with Camaguey Province standing out in this priority task. The amount of hand cutting during this stage is also worth noting. In Cuba, sugarcane recovery is something like the main dish on the sugar menu. It is only logical that the increased yield per hectare should attract all the attention at this time of the year. But now, more than ever, these jobs must be carried out without neglecting what belongs to the sugar industry after more than 160 work shifts of daily work. Cuban sugar producers, in cooperation with support groups, fight, invent, recover, work. They do not fold their arms; they see in old spares that were previously considered useless everything that can be made useful once again. This is the picture that has been painted; this is the reality of a period that demands attitudes such as these. Hard days pass, but the number one priority is victory.
