Papinin; place and date not given] [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has admitted that the incidents in Santiago del Estero Province were due to the fact that the province's intelligence services lacked adequate information. In an interview with LA NACION, he also denied that he had said that Shining Path was active in that province. Camilion described President Carlos Menem's 12 January meeting at the Olivos residence with civilian and military officials responsible for the country's internal and external security as "a preventive measure." According to the minister, no reports were submitted, and for the most part, the discussion concerned the need to hone the work of the services by synchronizing them and making them work at full capacity because there are continental and national difficulties that can be taken advantage of by activists. Camilion indicated that the president understands that up-to-date information must always be at hand in order to prevent social outbursts and thus be on the alert to prevent a major calamity if an outburst does occur. He admitted that there are rumors that foreign subversive agents had been in the country, but there is no strong evidence that this happened. The minister denied that Peruvian subversive agents had been active in Santiago del Estero. "The difficult situations that have been caused by the reform are well exploited by the activists and misfits who exist in the world and who mobilize with drastic measures those who wish to express their discontent peacefully." He stressed that in Olivos the president pulled the intelligence services out of their lethargy and urged them to work in coordination, "and, that was all that happened and no one should be alarmed, because what has happened in Mexico has no relation to what happened in Santiago del Estero, where the situation took a serious turn due to the passiveness of the policemen, who had not yet been paid their salaries." The following are the main parts of the conversation: [Papini] What is the role of the Armed Forces in collecting information? [Camilion] You know that the Defense Law does not allow them to carry out intelligence activities within the country. Their field is information about the external situation. Currently we have a very real situation, which was discussed at Olivos, in which drug traffic originates abroad and then enters our country. This is where matters become somewhat confusing. On the other hand, the Internal Security Law establishes that the Armed Forces can be asked to carry out actions within the country if the security forces are overrun. The Armed Forces did participate in the Santiago del Estero incident. The Air Force and Navy used their planes to transport members of the Federal and Border Police Forces. [Papini] Moving on to another topic, do you agree that Argentine military men should help remove the mines from the Malvinas Islands? [Camilion] No. The fact that Argentine soldiers would help remove the mines from the Malvinas was never discussed. The country offered to make an economic contribution in removing the mines as an act of good will because those mines are harming the civilian population. The offer was made in accordance with the Madrid Protocol, which condemns the use of those artifacts by the belligerent parties. [Papini] Will you do anything to prevent the promotion of the naval officers who have been objected to by some political sectors? [Camilion] No, in no way. The matter is now in the hands of the Senate.
