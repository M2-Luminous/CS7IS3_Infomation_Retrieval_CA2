"In August 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev was badly ill both in the physical and morally-psychologic aspects," former Soviet Deputy Defence Minister Valentin Varennikov told the trial on Wednesday. Varennikov is the only coup organiser who rejected the Duma-proclaimed amnesty and insisted that his case be investigated by court. Gorbachev's alleged illness was used by the coup plotters to explain the isolation of the president. Gorbachev himself had rejected the allegations. Varennikov admitted that communications with the state residence in Foros in the Crimea where Gorbachev was staying had been cut off, but explained it by the desire not to disturb the president during his talks with the coup plotters. "Constant calls could have distracted Gorbachev" from talks with the ringleaders who arrived to Foros to get a go-ahead from the president for the introduction of a state of emergency in the country. Varennikov rejected the accusation that the communications had been cut off to isolate Gorbachev.
