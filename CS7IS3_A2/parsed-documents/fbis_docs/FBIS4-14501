They have also managed to authorize presidential power, and adopt legislation on the Constitutional Court. In my opinion, however, economic issues have not been resolved. The Republic still does not have its own, concrete economic program. We are going into the future blindfolded, and looking for a shining path in the darkness. The so-called personnel issue, which was addressed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, chairman of the Interim Commission for Combating Corruption, proved to be conclusive at the current session. Yesterday, the interim commission handed over to the deputies a draft resolution on dismissing National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw and Stanislaw Bryl, Uladzimir Radkevich, chairman of the State Committee for External Economic Relations, and Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski. All in all, Alyaksandr Lukashenka accused more than 60 state officials. Today, following a debate on miscellaneous matters, the discussion on the report delivered by Lukashenka continued. The floor was taken by People's Deputies Syarhey Antonchyk, Viktar Kuchynskiy, Henadz Lavitskiy, Frants Minko, all of whom were members of the interim commission, and as a sign of protest, they announced their intention to leave the commission headed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Later, the floor was taken by Bahdankevich, Bryl, Kostsikaw, Radkevich, and Kazlowskiy. They all refuted the accusations presented by Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Attorney General Vasil Shaladonaw provided a legal assessment. Alyaksandr Lukashenka delivered the concluding speech. [passage omitted] This concluded the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet.
