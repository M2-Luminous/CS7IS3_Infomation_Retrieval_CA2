FR940930-1-00013 FR940930-1-00005 Consequently, ATF approved the industry member's request to use urease enzyme derived from Lactobacillus fermentum to reduce levels of naturally occurring urea in wine to prevent the formation of ethyl carbamate during storage. This approval was given pending final action on urease enzyme as a result of the rulemaking process. This approval is also contingent upon the industry member using urease enzyme at a level not to exceed 200 mg/L and that the enzyme preparation is filtered prior to final packaging of the wine. ATF is requesting all interested parties to comment on whether the use of this enzyme preparation in wine to reduce ethyl carbamate formation is in accordance with ``good commercial practice.'' We are also requesting comments on whether the maximum usage rate of 200 mg/L is appropriate. Based on the comments received, we will determine whether the use of urease enzyme for the above stated purpose is in accordance with ``good commercial practice.'' If so, we will add this new wine treating material to the authorized list in 27 CFR 24.246. In the meantime, if other industry members wish to use urease enzyme in their wines at a maximum usage rate of 200 mg/L to prevent or reduce the formation of ethyl carbamate, they should submit a letter application to ATF requesting permission to do so. Public Participation Comments to this notice may address any one or all of the proposals. Comments received on or before the closing date will be carefully considered. Comments received after that date will be given the same consideration if it is practical to do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to comments received on or before the closing date. ATF will not recognize any material or comment as confidential. Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material which the respondent considers to be confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the public should not be included in the comment. The names of commenters are not exempt from disclosure. Written comments will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following address: ATF Reading Room, Office of Public Affairs and Disclosure, Room 6480, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Regulatory Flexibility Act It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation is liberalizing in nature and will allow winemakers more flexibility when producing their wines with no negative impact on small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required because the proposal, if promulgated as a final rule, is not expected (1) to have secondary, or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities; or (2) to impose, or otherwise cause a significant increase in the reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance burdens on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12866 It has been determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. Accordingly this proposal is not subject to the analysis required by this Executive Order. Paperwork Reduction Act The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to this notice because no requirement to collect information is proposed.

Authority and Issuance 27 CFR Part 24_Wine is amended as follows: PART 24_WINE Par. 1. The authority citation for Part 24 continues to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 5001, 5008, 5041, 5042, 5044, 5061, 5062, 5081, 5111&hyph;5113, 5121, 5122, 5142, 5143, 5173, 5206, 5214, 5215, 5351, 5353, 5354, 5356&hyph;5357, 5361, 5362, 5364&hyph;5373, 5381&hyph;5388, 5391, 5392, 5551, 5552, 5661, 5662, 5684, 6065, 6091, 6109, 6301, 6302, 6311, 6651, 6676, 7011, 7302, 7342, 7502, 7503, 7606, 7805, 7851; 31 U.S.C. 9301, 9303, 9304, 9306. Par. 2. Section 24.246 is amended in the table by revising the entry for enzymatic activity, by indenting the 13 enzyme entries immediately following enzymatic activity (ending with Protease (Trypsin)) to show that these entries all come under enzymatic activity, and by adding the new enzyme, urease, immediately after and directly under Protease (Trypsin), to read as follows:
