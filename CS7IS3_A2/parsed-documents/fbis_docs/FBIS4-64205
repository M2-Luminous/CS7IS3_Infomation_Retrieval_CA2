Most statements by the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], therefore, generously brush aside the more pessimistic predictions of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) even sees the chance that the growth rates could be a bit higher than predicted by the institutes. However, the coalition should beware of succumbing to all too great an optimism about the economic development now. Even the majority prediction, which is at the upper limit of all predictions so far, does not permit that. Only exports are relatively certain as an economic engine so far. Private consumption continues to lag behind because of the fact that real incomes will go down again this year, and the recovery of investments will make only gradual progress despite brighter expectations for profits. Above all, however, unemployment will continue to rise for the time being. Here there remains only the hope for a change in employment next year. The institutes, too, did not have any new ideas on this matter, apart from the well-known prescriptions against this problem. Their loquacious philosophizing that structural unemployment is "not a phenomenon inherent to the market economy" does not help much. While the institutes praise the parties to the wage negotiations almost excessively -- even though only for the wage agreements in western Germany -- they are once again very critical of financial policy. Even though they corroborate the FRG treasurers that they are following a thrift course, they point out that the consolidation threatens to become a "fiscal purpose in itself" because of the "massive tax increases." This does permit the reduction of deficits, but, at the same time, private households and companies are deprived of "an unprecedented level of financial means" at the cost of the economic development. The majority of the institutes therefore demand a strong tax reduction despite the high state debts, including a gradual reduction of the solidarity surcharge as of 1996. They clearly reject the cost-neutral tax reform that Waigel is planning for the next legislative period: "Tax reductions are not the apex of economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively development of the economy." The institutes are convinced that tax reductions finance themselves via more growth. However, this calculation need not always be correct. Therefore, Waigel should take this proposal into account with caution. Otherwise, one day, the institutes will reproach him or his successor for even higher deficits.
