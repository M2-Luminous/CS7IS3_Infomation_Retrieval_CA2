The total issues and pages of newspapers printed in the first half of the year were respectively five and 18 percent more than those of the same period in the previous year, setting a record high. At present, more than 700 newspapers have adopted laser photo- composition technology. The advertisement business of newspapers has also developed rapidly and income from advertisements of more than 10 newspapers exceeded 100 million yuan each in 1993. This official pointed out that with the prosperity of newspapers, some partial problems and symptoms of undesirable tendencies have also emerged. Some newspapers have made false reports, replaced news information with created or fabricated stories, and cheated the readers by using "Mr. A and Mr. B" and "City A and City B" to evade the tests of truth of the information. Some are still using various ways to publish "paid news reports." Others have made use of the "weekend editions" or the "enlarged editions" in pursuit of "market effects," paying no attention to social benefits and doing harm to readers with low-taste and bad-style reports, articles, and photos written or prepared in a rough and slipshod way. Still others have damaged publication order and the market of newspapers and magazines, seriously violated state laws, decrees, regulations, and rules, irresponsibly used false information of overseas media, and even made mistakes in political issues and guidance for public opinion. These problems should attract the attention of all newspapers throughout the country and should be corrected.
