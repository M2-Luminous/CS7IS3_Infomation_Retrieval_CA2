In the past few weeks this radio station has been responsible for the anti-Belgain witch-hunt. The Hutu station says that the rebels are still 80 km from Kigali. There are only some 500 rebels in the capital, a Radio des Milles Collines journalist says. According to him, the government army can deal with them without difficulty: [Begin unidentified correspondent recording, in French] Some of them have been killed by us, some have hidden. To be frank I can assure you that there are no more than 500 of them [words indistinct] the groups retreat, they shoot at night. Well then, we will seek them out and crush them. There is another group which has retreated and is hidden but there is no battle which it has engaged in, there is no assault. The Patriotic Front has come from positions. [end recording] Radio des Milles Collines is managed by a Belgian from Liege. Minister Clases has already protested against the station's anti-Belgian broadcasts.
