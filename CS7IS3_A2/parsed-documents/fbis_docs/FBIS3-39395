Drug smuggling will actually decrease if Sweden joins the EU [European Union]. So said European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel (Moderate Coalition Party), quite contrary to all the fears expressed in the past about increased drug smuggling. Yesterday Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg (Liberal Party), Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik (Moderate Coalition Party), and Ulf Dinkelspiel made public the government's program for combating drugs in the event of EU membership. "The aim is not to compensate for the removal of border controls and achieve the same results as today; the aim is to be better," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. This will happen through increased cooperation and an improved exchange of information among the policemen of the EU, and through the increased scope to exert pressure on countries like the Netherlands. In addition, the customs service will be given more resources for investigation and spot checks, since EU membership means that the customs service will not have to carry out checks on trade between Sweden and the EU. "Membership will free up major resources in the customs service. That is why the government is taking the initiative for an overhaul of the customs service to produce better coordination with the police and the coast guard in the field of combating drugs," Gun Hellsvik said. Ulf Dinkelspiel also stressed that it is only a small part of the narcotics that are confiscated that get caught in the customs filter [sentence as published]. "Nor do we want to tie our hand but want to try new methods. The British, for example, have introduced narcotics surveillance on their ferries with some success and this is perhaps worth trying." The increased international cooperation will take place within the European criminal police bureau, Europol, which is currently being set up. Europol will be a center for criminal intelligence services. "Europol will chiefly concentrate on narcotics and we can be involved if we are not members of the EU," Gun Hellsvik said. The ministers also declared that Sweden's restrictive narcotics policy would remain in place in the event of membership of the EU. Bengt Westerberg stressed that Sweden's narcotics policy has been a success when compared with the rest of Europe. Bengt Westerberg also commented on the tendencies toward liberalization that exist in a number of European cities with regard to cannabis. "This trend has no support at government level. Not even in the Netherlands where people are becoming wary and are tightening up their view of hash," Bengt Westerberg said.
