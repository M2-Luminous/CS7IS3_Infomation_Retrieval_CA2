We say this because of the conflicting reports coming in from Cairo regarding the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and their faltering over the question of who should control the crossings leading to Gaza and Jericho. It is clear that Israel is insisting through its delegation that full control of the crossings remain in the hands of its security forces, and that all it can offer to the Palestinians is a symbolic presence limited to formalities only. This conflicts with the stipulations of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which talks openly and clearly about a complete withdrawal from these areas and their handover to the Palestinian national authority and the security forces belonging to it. Israel interprets the agreement as a redeployment of its forces in the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- that is, remassing them in areas remote from the overpopulated towns. And it believes that the security of Israeli settlements must remain in the hands of Israeli forces. And it is bans the Palestinian forces from moving close to these settlements or arresting any Israeli settler involved in terrorist actions against Palestinians. This Israeli interpretation conflicts completely with the Palestinian interpretation, which understands the withdrawal to mean evacuating all Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, exactly along the lines of the withdrawal from Sinai conducted under the Camp David accords. If the Palestinians in the occupied territories welcomed the agreement and supported those who signed it, this sudden support was the result of their belief that it would lead to an Israeli withdrawal and the restoration of Palestinian sovereignty over the liberated areas. And when we talk about Palestinian dignity, we mean stopping all the insults to which the Palestinians are exposed at the crossings at the hands of Israeli security sources, namely body searches, confiscation, and waiting for a long time under a burning sun or in unbearable freezing conditions. What Israel is proposing in the negotiations is merely an attempt to keep the painful reality as it stands, on the pretext of preventing weapons and "subversives" from being smuggled through the crossing points so as not to threaten Israel's security in the future. It is difficult for us to understand how the smuggling of weapons to an area like the Gaza Strip can pose a threat to Israel's security when the occupation forces are building an electronic fence along the strip's border. It is impossible for those whom Israel calls subversives to smuggle tanks or heavy artillery through the crossings, which will be watched by the other parties. What could be smuggled is pistols and rifles, and these are already in abundance in the strip and will be part of the armament of the Palestinian police forces to assume security in the strip and Jericho. Israel, which has always wagered on rejection, is in a dilemma as a result of the Palestinians' acceptance of the agreement, which is why it is currently trying to extricate itself from this dilemma by putting obstacles in its way, in the hope that the Palestinians will lose their nerve and pull out of the negotiations. For this reason, it refused to withdraw on 13 December. For this reason also, it is making a big crisis out of the crossings issue. We do not believe that the negotiating Palestinian side has one option only, namely to stand fast and to adhere to the only positive aspect in the agreement, that is withdrawal.
