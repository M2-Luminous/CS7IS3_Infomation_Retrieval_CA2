The most important of these is the credibility of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, which remains intact despite the fact that, almost without exception, his subordinates, including Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, have made comments harmful to Thai-Cambodian relations. Although beset with domestic problems, Chuan should not remain idle over such an important foreign policy issue. The prime minister, still respected to some degree by Cambodian leaders, should take this opportunity to offer Thailand, specifically Phatthaya or Hua Hin, as a neutral venue for peace talks. In July 1991, a similar feeling of despair over peace prospects prevailed among Cambodian leaders. Then Thai Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun, equally burdened with domestic issues at the time, agreed to host the historic Phatthaya peace talks which led to the signing of the Paris peace accords. For Anan, it was a great risk, but it was one that paid off. Last week, King Norodom Sihanouk suggested Paris or Jakarta as possible venues for the roundtable. In principle, these two locations are ideal as France and Indonesia were cochairmen of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which brought an end to the conflict in that country. However, in practice, it is still very difficult to see how the proposed talks could take place there. It would be too costly and too far away. As Cambodia's next door neighbour, Thailand should take up the challenge to host the meeting and help the Cambodian factions achieve national reconciliation as soon as possible. Otherwise, the ongoing fighting between the Cambodian and Khmer Rouge troops would continue to affect the Thai villagers at the border and worse, it could draw Thailand into the undesirable war -- especially at a time when the Thai military leaders are extremely frustrated with the border situation. More than ever before, Thailand can play a useful role in the upcoming talks among the Cambodian faction. Since the UN-sponsored election in May last year, which led to the formulation of the current Cambodian government, Thailand has been labelled as a pariah, primarily because of its relations with the Khmer Rouge. The country has been repeatedly condemned for its past links with the Marxist group. This trend will continue as long as Thailand's lackadaisical attitude towards the issue remains unchanged. By hosting the peace talks, Thailand can demonstrate its goodwill and neutrality, even though it will still be tough to convince all the parties involved. If needs be, the Thai authorities can take the opportunity to answer the allegations levelled against the country. Furthermore, Thai leaders would have the chance to exchange views with all the Cambodian leaders on their own soil. They can settle past misunderstandings, deliberate or not, and begin a new dialogue to build up mutual trust and confidence. In the past, Thailand frequently acted as an intermediary in the Cambodian conflict, but that was when the country still had the creditability. As Chuan is the only Thai leader with such credentials, it is only an overture from him that will overcome the Cambodians' recalcitrance and hold the roundtable in Thailand. Chuan should play a positive role in forging a reconciliation in Cambodia as it would greatly boost Thailand's wounded international image. Helping Cambodia is to help Thailand. For too long, the Cambodian situation has been handled by an arrogant and myopic foreign minister, who has failed to understand the sensitivities of the Cambodian issue or even muster support from within the military. What the country needs most now is a show of assertiveness from Chuan in foreign policy because it is he who commands the respect of the military leaders, and he who could make a difference in shaping Thailand's Cambodian policy. Thailand has a high stake in the future of a Cambodia which is at peace and friendly. Bangkok's current problems with the Cambodian government have been the accumulative result of developments that go back two decades. More specifically, since 1979, Thailand has enjoyed all the possible advantages from the war-shattered economy of Cambodia, now it is the time to pay something back. It is useless to continue this poisonous war of words. The fate of these two countries are sealed together like a Siamese twin. They have to learn how to coexist and coordinate with one another, otherwise both of them will suffer a slow death.
