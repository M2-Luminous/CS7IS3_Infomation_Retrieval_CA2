Branko Maksimovic reports about the first round of talks with the top officials of our state: [Begin recording] [Maksimovic] The great interest shown in Slovenia for the Austrian referendum on EU membership shows that this is also important for Slovenia, which will, in the case of a positive outcome, draw closer to Europe, too. This was the idea that Dr. Klestil emphasized at the first meeting with the reporters after one hour talks with President Kucan and after the meeting of both delegations, which also comprised Carinthian Governor Christoph Zernatto and Styrian Governor Josef Krainer, and Defense Ministers Fasslabend and Kacin. In his statement, President Milan Kucan rounded up the contents of the talks so far as follows: [Kucan] The visit of President Dr. Klestil is the first official visit of an Austrian president to the independent Slovenia, a confirmation and a reflection of good relations with a long tradition, and affirmation of the trust that was formed during the process of Slovenia gaining its independence -- during the war for our independence and efforts for our international recognition. I view this visit as a part of intensified cooperation between the countries and the presidents of Central Europe, which is helping to strengthen the awareness about spiritual, cultural, and the civilization belonging to this region that is gaining importance in the new Europe because it is bringing its values to it. This visit also allows, in accordance with the tradition of good relations and the achieved mutual trust, the solution of some issues that have been accompanying our relations for many years. At this moment, this does not merely involve the questions connected with the expatriates' bureau [zdomska centrala] and the issue of economic cooperation and the deficit that Slovenia currently has in these relations, but also several concrete proposals of which President Klestil will speak with Prime Minister Drnovsek. I would like to emphasize here that we could not have avoided the problem of rights and the protection of the Slovene minority in Austria in these talks. In connection with this, we also discussed the fate of the Austrian State Treaty. [Maksimovic] Let me add that, at the above-mentioned meeting with Slovene Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek, the Austrian guest handed him a comprehensive memorandum containing concrete plans for economic cooperation. A charter on Austrian assistance in the education of the refugee children in Slovenia was signed at noon in the presence of both presidents. From the remaining program of today's visit, let me single out that President Klestil will, in approximately an hour, speak in the Slovene Parliament and at 1800 open the House of the Carinthian Slovenes together with President Kucan.
