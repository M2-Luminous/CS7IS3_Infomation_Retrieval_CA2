They said they intended to submit that draft to the meeting the 10 Palestinian factions were to hold yesterday evening in Damascus to reactivate the role of the coalition of the 10 factions out in the streets, in the field, and in the political arena, and also to discuss political and organizational relations with the aim of drawing up a joint political program and joint leaderships structure, as stated in a statement issued by these factions. The new organizational draft of the four factions includes the following: 1. Formation of a higher central command of the alliance of Palestinian forces, to include two representatives from each faction. The command would meet once every two weeks and its decisions would be based on agreement among members. The command would draft bylaws to organize its work and would form the committees it deems necessary for that purpose. 2. Formation of a day-to-day follow-up command to include one representative from each faction. Its task would be to follow up implementation of the central command's decisions. 3. Confirmation of the previous decision to set up a national and Islamic command for the intifadah inside the occupied homeland, embodying all the factions which insist on the intifadah option and which reject the capitulationist agreement, to start work immediately. 4. Reactivation and continuation of the preparatory committee for the general national congress to mobilize the broadest possible front of patriotic rejectionist figures and forces, according to the following guidelines: A. A call for a national congress in the occupied homeland to include patriotic, democratic, and Islamic forces, factions, trends, and figures opposed to the agreement, and formation of a preparatory committee of representatives of these forces and figures to make the necessary arrangements for the congress, from which a national steering committee for the Palestinian people in the occupied territory should emerge, and also to select representatives to the general national congress. B. Full national and popular conferences in the camps and environs of the Palestinian people in the diaspora to choose representatives for the general national congress. C. The general national congress shall combine representatives of patriotic forces, factions, and figures opposed to the agreement as well as representatives of the national and popular conferences in the homeland and in the diaspora, the aim being to continue the intifadah and strip 'Arafat and his clique who signed the agreement of their legitimacy. D. The preparatory committee, in consultation with all the forces and influential figures, should devise a suitable mechanism for the general national congress as soon as possible, prepare the necessary documents for that purpose, and seek to crystallize political and organizational formulas that would safeguard the Palestinian national struggle in the future.
