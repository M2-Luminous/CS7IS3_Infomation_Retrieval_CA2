The situation in Hong Kong is special. The legislature of the future special administrative region [SAR] will even include foreign passport holders, who will not exceed 20 percent of the total number of members. Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng yesterday attended a reception sponsored by WEN WEI PO for the issue of the album "Record of China's Hope Project." A reporter said that there were foreign passport holders among PWC members. Yes, Zhang responded, there are many foreign passport holders in Hong Kong, which is a special phenomenon. There are provisions in the Basic Law concerning this issue. In the NPC Standing Committee decision on forming the PWC, there were no provisions on what kind of passports its members should hold. Actually, foreign nationals are not allowed to be in the legislature of any country or region. But Hong Kong's situation is special and its future legislature may have foreign nationals, who will not exceed 20 percent of the total number of members. Zhang Junsheng continued: The Basic Law clearly stipulates that nationality and permanent residency are not the same thing. Foreigners who meet the requirements of the Basic Law may also become permanent Hong Kong residents. The provisions of the Basic Law should be followed, as they clearly state the rules concerning the matter. If there are no provisions in the Basic Law concerning concrete matters, they should be handled by adopting specific regulations. Prior to the promulgation of these regulations, deliberations may be extensively held. The question of Hong Kong residents' nationality is complicated, and this was considered while drafting the Basic Law, Zhang Junsheng stated. As some three and a half years are left until 1 July 1997, a number of problems may be encountered after the establishment of the SAR government. Although some decisions will be made prior to this period, we still have time. A reporter asked whether there will be restrictions on foreign nationals becoming members of the Preparatory Committee of the SAR government. Zhang replied that the committee has not been set up yet. You may offer suggestions, which may include whether there should be restrictions on foreign nationals.
