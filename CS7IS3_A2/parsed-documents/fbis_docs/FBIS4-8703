Miroljub Simonovic reports from Krusevac. [Begin recording] [Simonovic] By making the decision to bomb Serbian positions around Gorazde, the United Nations has lost credibility and trust in the mission it is carrying out, said President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic in Aleksandrovac today, and added: [Lilic] Because of its irresponsible and unprincipled and I would say rash behavior of some of its prominent personalities, and under the pressure of those who believe that they can realize their interests through force and to the disadvantage of others, the United Nations today is directly involved in unnecessary destruction and new victims in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has become a contradiction to itself, and it does not even observe its own documents, not even the UN Charter. By making the decision to bomb Serbian positions around Gorazde, it has lost all credibility and trust in the mission it is carrying out. The only way for the United Nations to recover at least partially the role it has lost is to proceed immediately with the signing of a peace settlement for the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to deploy all its forces on the demarcation lines of the conflicts, to protect peace impartially, and primarily to enable political negotiations. This is what we in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Republic of Serbia, and in the Republic of Montenegro have always considered the only right solution and the only real way out of the Yugoslav crisis.
