FBIS4-53212 "dreas096_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 14 May 1994 South Korea Government To Withhold Opening S-N Sea Route Government To Withhold Opening S-N Sea Route SK1405030394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0206 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405030394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) has decided against opening a direct regular sea route between South and North Korea for the time being, a KMPA official said Saturday. The official said, "we do not have to hurry in establishing a regular sea route directly connecting South and North Korea, and we don't have any reasons either. Unless the North Korean authorities guarantee the safety of South Korean ships and crew, we won't allow the establishment (of the route)." Seoul and Pyongyang agreed earlier that inter-Korean sea routes are not between two different nations but within one country, he said. "It is a cabotage route. So we will prohibit foreign shipping companies from operating on the route," he said. Under the decision, domestic shippers which operate joint ventures with foreign companies plying between South and North Korea should change the ventures to domestic corporations, according to the KMPA officials. Companies which are pushing for new sea routes to and from North Korea will have to concentrate on non-regular routes transporting common cargo, not on regular routes carrying containers, the officials said. "A regular inter-Korean route should be established after South and North Korean authorities agree to adopt systematic safety measures. That is the government's policy. If North Korea officially guarantees the safety of South Korean ships and crew, the establishment of a direct and regular sea route to North Korea will become possible anytime," an official said. But South Korean ships can still depart for North Korea on non- regular direct routes authorized by the National Unification Board and the KMPA, according to the official. "The government will actively support cargo transport to revitalize inter-Korean economic exchanges," he added.
