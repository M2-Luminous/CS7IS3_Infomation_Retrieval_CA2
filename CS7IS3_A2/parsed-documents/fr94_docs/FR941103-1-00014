FR941103-1-00014 FR941103-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Brake Hoses and Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids; Termination of Rulemaking AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Termination of rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document terminates a rulemaking proceeding that commenced in March 1985 when NHTSA granted a petition for rulemaking from the United States Army Tank-Automotive Command. The petition requested that NHTSA amend Standard No. 106, Brake Hoses, to require brake hose compatibility with a brake fluid with DOT 5 characteristics, and amend Standard No. 116, Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids, to require compatibility of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 test fluids with elastomeric seals and cups in hydraulic brake system master and wheel cylinders. After receiving further information from the petitioner and after reviewing its own data base, NHTSA has concluded there is no safety need to amend the standards. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Chris Tinto, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Mr. Tinto's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;5229. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background and Grant of Petition On March 20, 1985, NHTSA published a Federal Register document (50 FR 11213) granting a petition for rulemaking submitted by the United States Army Tank-Automotive Command (ATAC), to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Nos. 106, Brake Hoses, and 116, Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids. The petitioner requested NHTSA to expand the number and type of ``referee materials'' used to test samples of brake hose (Standard No. 106) and brake fluid (Standard No. 116) for compliance with the requirements of those standards. Referee materials are used in the test procedures of Standards Nos. 106 and 116 to represent typical fluids and components that are present in real-world brake systems. The referee materials are combined with the test sample of brake hose or fluid to determine the compatibility of the referee material and the test sample. At the time the petition was filed, Standard No. 106 referenced a referee material called RM&hyph;1 SAE Compatibility Fluid to test hydraulic brake hose and hose assemblies. 1 Standard No. 116 also referenced RM&hyph;1 SAE Compatibility Fluid to test samples of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 brake fluid. In addition, Standard No. 116 referenced another referee material, ``SAE referee cups'' made of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), to test the compatibility of test samples of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 brake fluid with the material. In all cases involving the use of referee materials, the referee materials are combined with the test sample of hose or fluid to see the effect of the combination. For example, in Standard No. 116's test evaluating the effect of brake fluid on cups (S5.1.12), the referee SBR cups are immersed in the test fluid, heated, then examined for disintegration, hardness changes and diametrical changes. 1 In 1986, Standards No. 106 and 116 were amended to replace RM&hyph;1 SAE compatibility fluid with RM&hyph;66&hyph;03 fluid. (See 51 FR 16694.) In October 1992, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking to update the referee fluid to RM&hyph;66&hyph;04, effective January 1, 1995, as RM&hyph;66&hyph;03 is no longer readily available. (See 57 FR 49162.)
