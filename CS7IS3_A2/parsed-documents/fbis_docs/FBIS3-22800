The police intend to continue the search for the dead bodies of the five missing passengers presumed to be at the bottom of Lake Constance. The investigators rule out that survivors might have been able to save themselves from the ice-cold water. Radar recordings do not give any information about a secret stopover between Prague and Lake Constance. The business deals of the passengers also continue to remain mainly in the dark. According to research by FOCUS, one thing, however, seems to be the clear: Berlin businessmen Josef Rimmele, 54, and Klaus Eichler, 53, along with their two Czech companions, intended to fly to Beijing two days later. In their appointment book a note was found of a planned meeting with three-star General Jin Kang Wang from the PRC Foreign Ministry. The two men from Berlin had been planning a dubious deal with him for months: The Chinese general wanted to get rid of 6 kg of the extremely rare metal Osmium 187 and 365 kg of the controversial phantom substance Red Mercury -- at the steep price of $493 million. The following route had been requested for the trip to Beijing and already approved by the Russian and Chinese authorities: Prague, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ulaanbaatar, Beijing. Embarrassing for Bonn: Only five weeks before the disaster at Lake Constance, the trade delegate of the FRG Embassy in Beijing had sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese Foreign Ministry requesting flight and landing rights for an earlier flight of the dubious black marketeers. Josef Rimmele, against whom Berlin judicial authorities issued an arrest warrant on the grounds of fraud, played false. He intended to carry out the adventurous million-dollar deal via his letter-box firm "Housebuilders-Service-Establishment" in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. Yet the company was deleted from the trade registered there as early as November 1993. The two Liechtenstein trustees withdrew from their mandate because Rimmele wanted to establish "dubious business constructions," as legal agent Hans Gassner confirmed for FOCUS. The head of an officially recognized test laboratory in Saxony had already been hired for the trip to Beijing. He would have analyzed the exotic metals. It remains unclear what Rimmele wanted to do with that stuff. In the view of expert Tomas Tamberg of the Federal Institute for Material Research (BAM) in Berlin, such transactions do not make any commercial sense. The demand for the valuable Osmium 187 for scientific and research projects was "in the area of fractions of milligrams." As far as the legendary Red Mercury, a harmless mercury compound, is concerned, Tamberg does not see any use at all. The alleged demand in the armament industry is regarded by the BAM scientist as "absolute and total nonsense." A Berlin state prosecutor suspects completely different motives behind such activities as those of Rimmele. Pure money laundering may be behind such fictitious transactions.
