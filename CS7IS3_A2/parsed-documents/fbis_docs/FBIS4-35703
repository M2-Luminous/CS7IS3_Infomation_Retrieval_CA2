The General Ministerial Committee resumed its discussion of the items on the agenda: disarmament, international security, the double standards from which developing states are suffering at the international level, and the possibility of expanding membership of the UN Security Council to include a larger number of Third World states. The political and economic committees began their meetings. The Economic Committee will discuss the impact of GATT on developing countries' economies and the problem of African debt. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated that at its morning session, the conference discussed a report by the Non-Aligned Movement's chairman on the political and economic problems facing the movement. He added that the afternoon session will discuss the UN role, its reorganization, and the international economic situation, with emphasis on GATT and its impact on Third World economies. He added that the conference will also discuss the social development of the non-aligned states as well as the venue for the next non-aligned summit. He said that a Latin American state will probably host that summit. Musa revealed that the conference will also discuss the setting up of a mechanism to handle disputes among the movement members. Asked about differences emerging during the present meeting, Musa said that there are no disputes other than that between Iraq and Kuwait. He said that he met with the Saudi, Syrian, and other Arab foreign ministers today and discussed developments in Yemen, since events there affect the entire region. He added that the continuation of military operations is of concern to all Arabs. Musa said that Egypt will certainly approve the resolution that the UN Security Council will issue. He explained that this resolution will call for an end to the fighting and for dispatching a fact-finding committee to Yemen. He noted that Egypt was among the cosponsors of that draft resolution.
