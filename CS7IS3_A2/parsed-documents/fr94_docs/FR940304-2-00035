FR940304-2-00035 FR940304-2-00028 On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval, as imposing several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. B. State of Delaware On October 7, 1993, Delaware submitted an application for adequacy determination for Delaware's MSWLF permit program. On November 15, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Delaware's program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 60199&hyph;60201, November 15, 1993. A public comment period began on November 15, 1993, and ended on December 27, 1993. In this notice of tentative determination, EPA announced that if there was sufficient public interest, a public hearing would be held on December 27, 1993. EPA Region III received no public comment or request for a public hearing, therefore, a public hearing was not held. In the State's final application for adequacy determination, Delaware proposed revisions to those portions of their existing regulations which did not meet the Federal requirements in EPA's 40 CFR part 258. EPA tentatively determined in the November 15, 1993 Federal Register that once adopted as final regulation, Delaware's proposed regulations would ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 258. Delaware has made the regulatory changes specified in the November 15, 1993 Federal Register , and as listed below; the revised Delaware Regulations Governing Solid Waste (DRGSW) became effective on November 24, 1993. Subpart A_General Section 258.2␣Definitions_Where appropriate, the State has adopted key terms and definitions which will more clearly ensure compliance with the 40 CFR part 258 Criteria. These key definitions have been included in section 3 of the DRGSW. Subpart B_Location Restrictions Section 258.10␣Airport Safety_The State has amended Section 5.A.3. of the DRGSW to require that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and affected airport(s) are notified of a proposed landfill located within 5 miles of an airport. Section 258.11␣Floodplains_Delaware has included the requirements and terms of this section in Section 5.A.4.a. of the DRGSW. Sections 258.13␣Fault Areas, 258.14 Seismic Impact Zones, and 258.15 Unstable Areas_The State has included the requirements and terms of these sections in Sections 5.A.4.h., 5.A.4.i., and 5.A.4.j., respectively, of the DRGSW. Section 258.16␣Closure of Existing MSWLF Units_Delaware has certified that no currently operating landfills are sited in areas impacting airport safety (§258.10), floodplains (§258.11), or unstable areas (§258.15), as defined in these sections. Subpart C_Operating Criteria Section 258.20␣Excluding Receipt of Hazardous Waste and §258.26 Run-on/Run-off Control Systems_The State has amended Sections 5.I.2.l. and 5.F.2. of the DRGSW, to include the respective requirements of these sections. Section 258.23␣Explosive Gas Control_The State has amended Section 5.E.4. of the DRGSW to require the specific response actions of this section when critical levels of explosive gas are exceeded. Subpart D_Design Criteria Section 258.40␣Design Criteria_The State has adopted EPA's performance standard for landfill design as specified in §258.40(a)(1), (c) and (d) by amending Section 5.B.2. of the DRGSW to include these requirements. Subpart E_Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Section 258.51␣Groundwater Monitoring Systems_The State has adopted EPA's relevant point of compliance (150 meters), within which the downgradient monitoring wells must be located. Sections 5.G.2.b. and 5.G.4.g. of the DRGSW includes this requirement. Section 258.53␣Groundwater Sampling and Analysis Requirements_The State now requires, through amended DRGSW Section 5.G.3.a., that unfiltered groundwater samples be obtained except where turbidity cannot be controlled through careful well construction, development, and sampling. In addition, the State has adopted the data evaluation requirements found in subsections (e), (g), (h) and (i) of this section; these requirements are found in Section 5.G.4. of the DRGSW. Section 258.54␣Detection Monitoring_The State has adopted the requirements of this section into Sections 5.G.3.b. and 5.G.3.c. of the DRGSW, including the requirement that the owner/operators sample groundwater at least semi-annually for Appendix I parameters. Based on the results of groundwater and leachate monitoring, the State may modify the required list of groundwater monitoring parameters. In addition, the State has amended its regulations at Section 5.D.4.c. of the DRGSW to require leachate sampling with monthly analyses for indicator parameters and semi-annual analyses for Appendix II constituents. Section 258.55␣Assessment Monitoring_The State will proceed directly from Detection Monitoring to Corrective Measures Assessment. Section 258.56␣Corrective Measures Assessment_The required list of parameters for groundwater monitoring was expanded in the corrective measures assessment to include those Appendix II constituents deemed appropriate from the leachate monitoring data (See Section 5.G.6. of the DRGSW). During the corrective measures process there will be an opportunity for public input at the time of permit modification. A permit modification is required when corrective measures are deemed necessary. Section 258.57␣Selection of Remedy, and §258.58 Implementation of Corrective Action_The State has adopted into regulation, the requirements of these sections into Section 5.G.8. of the DRGSW. Subpart F_Closure And Post-Closure Care Section 258.60␣Closure Criteria_The State has amended their regulations at Section 5.H.2.b. to require that a geomembrane cover be used as part of a capping system where a MSWLF has been constructed with a geomembrane liner.
