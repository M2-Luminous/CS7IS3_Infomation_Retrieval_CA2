For better or worse, the political fate of the extreme Left in the West was closely linked to "real socialism." In the first few years after the war, the Communist Party of Germany [KDP], profiting from the bloody resistance against the Nazi regime and linked to Moscow and East Berlin, still played a major part on the left-wing fringe of the political spectrum (it was present in the Parliamentary Council, in the landtags, laender governments, and Bundestag), but it was banned in 1956, and its successor, the German Communist Party [DKP] founded in 1968, did not enjoy any significant election successes. The lack of attraction, or rather the repulsiveness, of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] reduced the chances of the small western "fraternal parties." The people in power in the east attempted to boost the western communist parties by means of high subsidies, over 70 million German marks per year. Thanks to this, the DKP was able to exert a not insignificant cultural influence in the West in the form of its own newspaper and publishing empire, and infiltrate such social spheres as educational establishments, individual trade unions such as the Trade Union of Education and Science [GEW], and the network of "new social movements." Other groups from the extreme Left also received smaller pieces of the big East Berlin pie inasmuch as they availed themselves of the DKP's technical and organizational infrastructure. But by and large, the existence of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] was a burden, even though people did not spare their criticism and geared themselves to more remote patterns and models like Castro's Cuba, Tito's Yugoslavia, Enver Hoxha's Albania, and Mao Zedong's China, and even the writings of Leo Trotsky. The Crisis in the DKP The demise of "real socialism" and the end of the SED regime led to great changes in the extreme left. According to he Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, total membership of extreme left-wing organizations fell from 41,000 at the end of 1989 to 29,500 at the end of 1990. At the end of 1992, membership rose to 29,000. Particularly hard hit was the DKP, already weakened by a power struggle between traditionalists and adherents of renewal. The end of material benefits from the SED caused the DKP's party-owned media empire to collapse and necessitated drastic personnel reductions inside the DKP apparatus and in allied organizations. The "Spartakus" student organization was disbanded in June 1990, and the shrinking West Berlin SED offshoot bearing the name of the Socialist Unity party of West Berlin was restructured and renamed. The number of DKP members fell from over 35,000 at the end of 1988 to less than 7,000 at the end of 1993. Although a personnel reshuffle took place among the party leadership, the traditionalist ultra-Orthodox segment pushed through in the end. The DKP assumed the nature of a sect and became hardly capable of maintaining an alliance. If the DKP was the extremist left-wing party with the greatest membership in western Germany before the turnabout, after the turnabout this position was assumed by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], into which the SED had changed itself. The PDS (originally SED-PDS) was not banned, and was the legal heir of the SED. There was of course an exodus of members, so that out of the 2.3 million SED members in August 1989, there were not even 10 percent left. By the end of 1992, the party membership files had sunk to about 120,000 names. According to PDS data, in 1991, 95 percent of PDS members came from the SED. Particularly well-represented in the PDS was the intellectual GDR elite consisting of teachers, scientists, and artists. This information alone suggests that the turnabout propagated by the PDS leadership kept to narrow limits. An ideological opening-up might have been signalled by means of references to such authorities as August Bebel and Eduard Bernstein, but the stubborn adherence to earlier advocates of Marxist-Leninist tradition removed the credibility from any attempt at an ideological opening-up. The same applies to internal party reforms. On the one hand, the democratic centralism of the past was split up by allowing the formation of "workers cooperatives" and "platforms" with various ideological profiles, but on the other hand an almost all-powerful party presidium emerged, and the strongly-constrained "pluralism" was also extended to hard-line communists such as the Communist Platform. Naturally, the PDS hard liners maintain the closest links with the DKP. In addition, the PDS is concerned with availing itself of as much of the potential beyond the Social Democratic Party of Germany and Greens as possible. Comprehensive contacts are taking shape within the party "base" and inside various bodies, for example vis-a-vis the German Communist Party [KPD] that was formed in 1990 during the GDR's existence; or the Federation of West German Communists that was formed in 1980; the Workers Federation for the Reestablishment of the KPD; the ecological-fundamentalist Ecological Left; and the United Socialist Party, a party formed in 1986 out of a merger of Trotskyists and former Stalinist and pro-Albanian communists. But these are all small groups that share a few hundred members between them at the very most. On the other hand, the two extreme left-wing organizations with the largest memberships after the PDS and DKP refuse to link themselves to any political federation. The Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany, claiming to have 2,000 members, continues to refer to the teachings of Stalin and Mao Zedong, and sympathizes with the Maoist guerrilla organization "Sendero Luminoso" [Shining Path] of Peru. The Marxist Group, with about 10,000 members, mainly from the university milieu, seems to continue to exist secretly even though it dissolved itself in May 1991. This fact is suggested by the appearance of an agitation journal called GEGENSTANDPUNKT since that date. The PDS itself is seeking contacts with the proviolence groups of "autonomists" that have gained popularity since the turnabout (in 1993 they had about 5,000 members). The "Scene," consisting mainly of 18-28 year-olds, is hardly affected by the often-quoted "crisis of the Left" because it has never been connected to any governing political orthodoxy, and its aversion to any theory or organization, suggesting an exposure to anarchist influence, conforms to a trend toward "alternative" fundamentalistically oppositionist subcultures that was visible long before 1989. The usually loosely structured groups that are concentrated in a few large German cities, including university cities (for example Berlin), are joined together by a hatred of imperialism, capitalism, and state violence. In addition, they are much more interested in militant "actions" than theoretical discussions. For years, they have borne responsibility for most of the acts of violence possessing an extremist left-wing background (797 such acts in 1991, 972 in 1992, and even more in 1993, according to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution). The "Autonomous Scene" The "Autonomous Scene" is linked to the milieu that supports terrorist organizations, whereby the environment of the Red Army Faction [RAF] and Revolutionary Cells [RZ] displays a higher degree of ideological and strategic discipline. In addition, the political turnabout of 1989 onwards has left deep traces in left-wing terrorism, placed a question mark over political identity, and reduced the circle of helpers and sympathizers. The RAF was particularly affected by the discovery that it had had links with the GDR state security. Today, both underground and inside the prisons, the RAF is usually divided into two groups. One of them has abandoned the idea of an "armed struggle," but the other continues to adhere to it strongly. The shots fired at the headquarters of the Metalworkers Association in Cologne in November 1993, and especially the carefully planned and executed bombing of the newly constructed Weiterstadt correctional facility in March 1993, have cast doubts on whether the so-called "commando levels" are at all capable of holding talks. Hopes for an end to extreme left-wing violence seem to have proven as naive as hopes for an end to left-wing ideology. Instead, the left-wing and right-wing extremes seem to be helping each other back onto their feet. In view of the rise in right-wing extremism, "anti-Fascism" once again seems to be in vogue. It improves the chances for broad social groups to mobilize themselves, and at the same time serves as a replacement for the now-lost feeling of reassurance connected to the past. In the meantime, circles of theoreticians are working on a redefinition and modernization of well-worn dusty doctrines. Out of anarchy, Marxism, pacifism, and feminism, new ideological compositions are being created to dampen the soon-to-reappear urge for fulfillment, for the solving of problems, and for predicting the future.
