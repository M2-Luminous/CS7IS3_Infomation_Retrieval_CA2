While most of them will be listed in Hong Kong, five are heading toward the United States. The following enterprises are expected to go to the U.S. stock market one after another beginning in June: China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Huaneng Electrical, Shandong Electric Power, and Tianjin Steel Tubes. They will make up the second batch of "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock market," following in the footsteps of Brilliance Automobile, Yichu Motorcycles, China Tire, and Shanghai Petrochemical, which were listed in the United States beginning in October 1992. The term "mountain-climbing tigers on the U.S. stock market" was invented by some Wall Street stock brokers in New York, as mainland enterprises showed such a strong rising momentum soon after entering the United States. For instance, on the very day Shenyang Brilliance Automobile's shares pioneered on the New York stock market, investors vied with each other and bought 5 million shares at the unit price of $16. By the time trading officially opened, the share price had gone up to $18, and, three weeks later, reached a high of $34. Another example was when China Tire landed on Wall Street, and it sold 6.1 million shares at a unit price of $17. A few days later, the price rose to $18.75, after which it fluctuated before going up to $27 last December, ranking among the 20 most active stocks in Wall Street. Also, Shanghai Petrochemical initially issued 18 million shares at a price of $20.39, and, after some small drops and big rebounds, reached a record high of $49.2 per share toward the end of last year and became one of Wall Street's hottest stocks. The strong recommendations given by several famous investment companies in the United States contributed to the popularity of mainland enterprises on the U.S. stock market. Before and after mainland shares were listed, 30 fund managers, led by Morgan Stanley, visited mainland China. On their return, most expressed optimism about the mainland's economic prospects. A senior executive of Wall Street's Peiji [1014 1015] Securities said: "From a long-term point of view, China's stocks have good prospects, because financiers and entrepreneurs in the United States and around the world are mostly optimistic about the Pacific rim economic zone with China at its center." Therefore, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch [5019 2651], and Maibonshish [5019 6721 2514 0823] all undertook to sell mainland stocks. The second batch of five mainland enterprises are being listed in the United States with a view to raising over $3 billion. Eastern Airlines plans to raise $1 billion to expand its fleet and obtain other supporting equipment and, at the same time, is taking advantage of this opportunity to draw on the management experience of international aviation companies. In order to standardize the listing of mainland enterprises in the United States, the mainland's securities authority and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signed a memorandum on joint monitoring in Beijing in late April this year, laying the foundation for bilateral cooperation in the securities industry. It is reported that around the time this Sino-U.S. memorandum was signed, Britain's London Stock Exchange told Chinese diplomats: "We look forward to assisting Chinese enterprises in overseas listing." Exchanges in Japan and Singapore also expressed a wish to have Chinese enterprises listed on their markets. At a "Fund-Raising by Chinese and Hong Kong Enterprises in the United States" seminar held in Hong Kong in mid May, Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Regulatory Commission, said: The U.S. market is the biggest international capital market and has the largest transaction volume and highest mobility of all the stock markets worldwide. It is under strict supervision and management and its well-developed laws and regulations and full protection for investors give it appeal to many investors. Therefore, we have made an initial decision that five of the 22 Chinese enterprises in the second batch to be listed overseas will go directly to the United States to issue shares and seek listings on a trial basis. This is not only an expansion of the financial market open to Chinese enterprises, but is also a further development of economic reform in greater depth. Liu Hongru also said: The success of Chinese enterprises issuing H shares in Hong Kong has not only opened up a new channel for fund-raising, but, more importantly, has indicated that Chinese enterprises are able to strictly abide by the laws, regulations, accounting systems, disclosures, and other requirements of international markets and meet standards set by international markets on share issues and enterprise listings. Entering the large and strictly controlled U.S. capital market will help improve the reputation of Chinese enterprises in international markets.
