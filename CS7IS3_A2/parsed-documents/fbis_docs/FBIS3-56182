Citing the irresponsible, profascist statements made during the election campaign, certain observers have been predicting a strengthening of Moscow's "imperial aspirations." I have already stated my attitude to such statements. I would like to reemphasize that Russia's line in the foreign policy and security sphere is determined by the Russian Federation president. This situation, which is enshrined in the new democratic Constitution, reliably protects that line from the influence of national extremism. The policy basically remains the same -- both in terms of being geared to the development of good-neighborly relations of partnership with the outside world and in terms of being open and predictable. Another guarantee of the stability and consistency of the country's foreign and military policy is the Russian Federation military doctrine approved by the Russian president in early November. Together with the foreign policy concept ratified in April, it is an integral part of the emergent concept for the country's security. The distinctive features of our military doctrine are its defensive thrust and the strict account it takes of the country's actual requirements as regards ensuring national security. In terms of its content it is entirely comparable with the doctrinal provisions of most democratic states. I am referring above all to the similarities in the assessment of the military-political situation and the prospects for its development both globally and regionally. A key factor is the absence of any potential military enemy for Russia. According to the doctrine, the main threat to the country's security is posed by local conflicts and the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The Russian military doctrine is an obstacle in the way of any attempts to abuse military force. While using the full panoply of means available to it to safeguard its security, Russia will at the same time give priority to peaceful -- above all, political and diplomatic -- means. Military force can only be used for self-defense purposes, in order to rebuff aggression. The Russian Armed Forces will be shaped to take account of the major changes in the world and the country's actual economic potential. By the end of this century, after the transition to the mixed principle of manpower acquisition, they will be substantially smaller, but more mobile and equipped with effective weapons systems and military hardware in sufficient quantities to ensure the defense of the country and its allies. This provision of the doctrine can be illustrated by the Navy. It will fully retain its role as a factor determining Russia's might as a great power. Moreover, given the cuts envisaged by the Russian-U.S. START II Treaty, the naval component of our strategic "triad" will have increased. The decommissioning of obsolete ships will be combined with efforts to equip the Navy with modern hardware. The ships flying the St. Andrew's ensign should embody the most advanced achievements of Russian science and technology. The fact that all this is not only necessary but possible was something I saw for myself at Severomorsk in Murmansk Oblast, where the electoral district, which I represent in the State Duma, is located. An immense potential is concentrated there -- the flower of Russia's Navy. This was also attested by my visit to Russia's naval outposts in the Far East and to the ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The Navy is traditionally one of the most flexible foreign policy tools at the disposal of the Russian state, whose interests naval seamen and diplomats have defended and will continue to defend together. I am therefore all the more aware of the social needs -- requiring state support -- of those who serve the motherland on its ocean and maritime borders. Our view of nuclear weapons is becoming more realistic compared to that that prevailed in the Soviet period. The aim of the Russian Federation's policy is to remove the threat of nuclear war and the use of nuclear weapons by deterring a potential aggressor. In other words, Russia sees its nuclear forces first and foremost as a means of preventing war. This view is also conditioned by the fact that Russia does not intend to recreate massive Soviet-style general-purpose forces. It would be a mistake to make out that our new approach to nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear war. The fact that we do not intend to be the first to use any weapons, and see nuclear weapons as a last resort, is of fundamental importance. The military doctrine's provisions take full account of CIS collective security interests and are geared to strengthening defense cooperation among the CIS states on a multilateral and bilateral basis. The prerequisites for this are shared national security interests, a standard [odnotipnyy] armed forces structure and standardized weapons systems, and an interest in maintaining the former Union's defense infrastructure within your own territory. The main provisions of Russian military doctrine have been brought to the attention of Russian and foreign public opinion. The international community has thereby been able to get a clearer idea of the aims and content of our policy in the security sphere. Our numerous contacts show that the world is satisfied with its defensive thrust and the way in which it corresponds to the norms of international law. This creates favorable prerequisites for strengthening Russia's cooperation with other countries in maintaining international peace and security. In particular, there is growing potential for cooperation among the nuclear powers. I am referring to the ending of nuclear weapons tests, given the ultimate goal of a comprehensive test ban, and to further reductions in nuclear forces to a minimum level and, in the distant historical future, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Russia is ready to cooperate with all states in preventing the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the latest military production technologies. Safeguarding [obespecheniye] the unlimited-duration Nonproliferation Treaty is on the agenda. The clarification [konkretizatsiya] in the doctrine of the cases in which Russia will not use its nuclear weapons against parties to that treaty will serve as an added incentive for nonnuclear states, which have hitherto remained outside the treaty to sign it. The new view on the nature of a possible war, which recognizes the minimal likelihood of the unleashing of world nuclear and conventional war along with the increased risk of local wars, including those on the territory of the former USSR, orients our diplomacy toward more active cooperation with other states with regard to peacemaking. The CSCE declaration condemning aggressive nationalism, which underlies many local conflicts -- a declaration adopted on Russia's initiative -- is of great significance. In accordance with the doctrine the Russian Federation Armed Forces acquire a new function: participation in carrying out peacemaking operations. These are implemented by decision of the UN Security Council and other collective security organs or in accordance with international agreements, primarily within the CIS context. It is a matter of Russia's fulfilling not some sort of gendarme functions, but a mission fully consonant with its status and duties as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The Russian troops taking part in such operations strictly respect the sovereignty of the sides involved in the conflict and act with their consent and in accordance with a clearly defined mandate. In fulfilling peacemaking functions on the territory of the former USSR, the Russian Federation is prepared to cooperate closely with all interested countries and international organizations, primarily the United Nations and the CSCE. We are entitled to expect the world community to provide material support for this activity. We are raising the question of creating an international voluntary fund for these purposes. The military doctrine envisages completing before 1996 the withdrawal to Russian territory of the Russian units stationed outside Russia. We will seek to ensure that the agreements being elaborated with a number of countries regarding this properly take into account Russia's security interests and also the interests of the Russian-speaking population in these countries. At the same time the doctrine realistically proceeds from the premise that the interests of the security of the Russian Federation and other CIS members may necessitate the stationing of Russian Federation forces outside its territory. But, of course, this will be done only on the basis of appropriate international legal documents and with the consent of the states on whose territory our Armed Forces will be stationed. In outlining the main directions for the development of Russia's cooperation with other countries in the military-technical sphere, the doctrine officially sets the relevant departments, the Foreign Ministry included, tasks which we effectively began to work on from the first months of 1992. On the one hand, there is a need to maintain the country's export potential in the sphere of conventional arms at the proper level, partly so the hard currency proceeds can be used for the needs of military production and for purposes of conversion. On the other hand, we cannot allow deliveries of arms and military equipment to lead to the spread of technology making it possible to create weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems for them, to the undermining of regional stability, or to the breaking of embargoes or other international accords to which Russia is a party. The potential for strengthening mutual trust and developing cooperation with the NATO member countries, including within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, is expanding substantially with the adoption of the military doctrine. This is a weighty and, most important, practical alternative to the idea of the faster expansion of NATO to bring in new members. The fundamental shifts toward greater transparency and trust are shown, in particular, by the joint naval exercises which Russia has held recently with Norway, Kuwait, and NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. Joint exercises by the Russian and NATO navies in the Barents Sea are planned. The adoption of the basic principles of the foreign policy concept and military doctrine marks an important milestone in the development of democratic Russia's political and military thought. They graphically reflect the profound changes in the life of our state and society. Free from ideological rhetoric and claims to superpower status, these documents are called upon to help form in the world an image of democratic Russia as a peace-loving state with natural national interests. Not regarding any state as its enemies, Russia is prepared to see as partners all states whose policy is not detrimental to its interests and does not contravene the UN Charter. Only thus will we be able to reliable ensure the security of the motherland.
