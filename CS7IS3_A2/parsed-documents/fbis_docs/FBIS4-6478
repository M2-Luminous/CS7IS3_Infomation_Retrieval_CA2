FBIS4-6478 "dreas077_c_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 North Korea Commentary Accuses Japan of Anti-Chongnyon Plot Commentary Accuses Japan of Anti-Chongnyon Plot SK2104071394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 20 Apr 94 SK2104071394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 20 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by unidentified commentator: "Riots Caused by Behind-the-Scenes Instigation"] [Text] On 19 April, approximately 70 members of the Kanto Council under the League of the Great Japanese Patriots, Japan's right-wing organization, committed provocative riots in front of the Korea Hall of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] Headquarters, the Korea Bank's main Tokyo office, and the Tonghae Corporation building, after getting off of 30 propaganda cars. During the riots, they did not hesitate to make foolish, absurd, and violent remarks, saying that Chongnyon should leave Japan, that North Korea should suspend the nuclear threat to Japan, and that the Tonghae corporation should be dissolved. This is unprecedented and is very grave and provocative commotion against the republic and the Chongnyon, arousing our indignation. Needless to say, these riots are the results of the Japanese authorities' policy of regarding Korea as an enemy, as well as their plots against Chongnyon, not the mere violence committed by right-wing Japanese gangsters. As is well known, the Japanese authorities' enthusiasm about fabricated propaganda, as well as a commotion of pressure against the republic under the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear issue in collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets is unprecedented. They have not hesitated in making such hostile remarks, saying that they will deal sternly with our republic, which is being threatened by nuclear weapons, under the pretext of the so-called nuclear threat, while talking in favor of the mastermind who creates the nuclear threat. Also, they have desperately attempted to achieve their goal of imposing sanctions on us. The contents of the violent remarks made by the Japanese right-wing gangsters during their riots are the same as those of the Japanese authorities' hostile and vicious propaganda. Therefore, there is no doubt that the riots themselves are being committed by the Japanese authorities' behind-the-scenes instigation. The issue of Japan's nuclear armaments, not the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear weapon development, is the issue that has emerged as an important one in the international community today, and has reached a dangerous point. Much valid data has proven the above-mentioned facts. At the same time, impartial public opinion in the world has also sounded an alarm [kyongjong]. We do not pose a nuclear threat to Japan, but rather Japan's nuclear armaments have created a grave nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, the Japanese right-wing reactionaries have kicked up nuclear commotions against the republic as a thief turns on the victim with a club. Furthermore, they have committed acts of violence against Chongnyon and its other subsidiary organizations. Therefore, their such acts are aimed at distorting public opinion, as well as at justifying themselves for openly carrying out Japan's nuclear armaments, and thus propagate the nuclear threat on our republic. As shown by the violent remarks made by the Japanese right-wing gangsters during the riots, this also aims at finding an excuse to suppress our patriotic compatriot organizations that are related to our republic, including Chongnyon. Such criminal acts can never be forgiven, nor affect us. The patriotic activities by Chongnyon, a prestigious overseas organization of our republic, and its subsidiary organizations, should be guaranteed. If something happens to Chongnyon and its subsidiary organizations, this can be regarded as an act of doing harm to the republic [konghwagugedaehan chimhae haengwi]. The Japanese authorities should correctly assess the situation and should forge plans to prevent riots from occurring again in the future. Also, they should abandon their plots of nuclear armament and immediately stop engineering the anti-republic and anti-Chongnyon plots.
