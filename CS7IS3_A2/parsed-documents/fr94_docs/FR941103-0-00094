FR941103-0-00094 FR941103-0-00014 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 102894C] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except for directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear in the GOA has been caught. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 29, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. The final 1994 initial specifications for the GOA (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) established the 1994 Pacific halibut PSC limit for vessels using trawl gear at 2,000 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(f)(3)(i), that vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish with trawl gear in the GOA have caught the 1994 Pacific halibut PSC limit. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except for directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 29, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 28, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
