SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Act provides for a number of changes in the purposes and operation of the CVP, and in the use and allocation of CVP water. Subsection 3408(a) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate ``*␣*␣* such regulations *␣*␣* as may be necessary to implement the intent, purposes, and provisions *␣*␣*'' of the Act. Reclamation and the Service have been authorized by the Secretary to act on his behalf in implementing the Act. Reclamation and the Service have tentatively concluded that the following provisions of the Act should be considered for rulemaking: ␣ 1Subsection 1Title 3404(c) Renewal of Long-Term Contracts. 3405(a) Transfer of Central Valley Project Water. 3405(d) Water Pricing. 3405(e) Water Conservation Standards. 3406(b)(2) 800,000 Acre-Feet for Fish, Wildlife, and Habitat Restoration. 3406(b)(22) Incentives to Flood Fields for Waterfowl Habitat. 3407(a)&hyph;(d) Restoration Fund. 3408(c)&hyph;(d) Exchanges, Storage, Conveyance, and Banking. 3408(h) Land Retirement. 3408(i) Cost Sharing of Water Conservation Projects. Public comment is invited on the questions of: (1) whether there are appropriate provisions of the Act to address through rulemaking, and (2) whether there are other provisions of the Act that should be addressed. The comments received will be evaluated as part of the process for finally determining which provisions of the Act to address in rulemaking actions. The development of any proposed rules and regulations shall be scheduled to benefit from ongoing analyses in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) which is being prepared pursuant to Section 3409 of the Act. To the extent, if any, that the rulemaking requires compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), such compliance will be coordinated with processes associated with completion and issuance of the PEIS and through such other NEPA compliance activities, if any, as may need to be completed subsequent to the finalization of the PEIS. Any final rulemaking documentation shall occur no earlier than the preparation and dissemination of the Record of Decision associated with the PEIS to fully encompass and ensure benefits from all aspects of this process.

Spear, Regional Director, Pacific Region, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18490 Filed 8&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;94&hyph;M
