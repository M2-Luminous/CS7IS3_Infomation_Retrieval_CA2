FR940830-2-00157 FR940830-2-00068 8. The management fees for the Fund will not exceed the maximum fees currently paid by the Partnership. Applicants expect that other Fund expenses will be relatively higher than Partnership expenses. This is primarily because of the increased operating costs of a registered investment company and compliance with additional regulatory requirements. Through the end of calendar 1994, however, the Adviser will limit annual Fund expenses with the intention of capping fund expense ratios at levels which would have been incurred during 1994 by the partnership. 9. Prior to an Exchange, certain limited partners may withdraw from the Partnership and participate in a new limited partnership with similar investment objectives. The new limited partnership will not be registered under the Act in reliance on section 3(c)(1) thereof, and the new partnership interests will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on section 4(2) thereof. 10. The Fund's board of directors and TAMCO have considered whether the Exchange will be in the best interests of the Company and the Partnership, respectively. All of the members of the Fund's board and TAMCO have approved the Exchange and have concluded that: (a) the Exchange is desirable as a business matter for both the Company and the Partnership; (b) the Exchange is in the best interests of the Company and the Partnership; (c) the Exchange is reasonable and fair, does not involve overreaching, and is consistent with the policies of the Act; (d) the Exchange is consistent with the policies of the Company and the Partnership; and (e) the interests of existing shareholders in the Company and existing partners will not be diluted as a result of the Exchange. The Exchange will not be effected until the Company has received a favorable opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the Exchange. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a) prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of such persons, from selling to or purchasing from such company any security or other property. The Partnership may be an affiliated person of the Company because TAMCO and the Adviser are under common control. Thus, the proposed Exchange may be prohibited by section 17(a). 2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that (a) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of the registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 3. The Exchange will permit partners to pursue the same investment objectives and policies as shareholders of the Fund without sacrificing the pass-through tax features of the Partnership. In addition, shareholders of the Fund will be able to purchase and redeem shares on each business day, as opposed to only once per month as is currently provided under the Partnership agreement, providing greater liquidity. The Fund expects that operating as a registered investment company will help encourage net asset growth. For these reasons, among others, applicants believe that the proposed Exchange meets the section 17(b) standards. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
