"If a no-confidence vote passes (the House of Representatives), I will have to dissolve the lower house or resign. But I have been saying the dissolution should not be done," Hata said in a speech in front of a Tokyo railway station. "That would leave me with (the only choice of) resigning en masse. In that case, I would have to obtain the understanding of the people and of the opposition parties," he said. The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to submit a motion of no-confidence against Hata's minority cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected next week. If the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest opposition party, supports the LDP's move, it will clinch the no- confidence vote, leaving Hata with the choice of either dissolving the lower house and calling snap general elections or stepping down with his ministers. Hata has been insisting the next general elections should be held under a new election system of single constituencies combined with proportional representation in line with the political reform bills that passed the Diet in January. A government panel is currently redrawing the electoral map for the new system. Ironically, Saturday marked the first anniversary of the Diet's passage of a no-confidence vote against then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, which led to the demise of the LDP's 38-year rule, and paved the way for a broad coalition led by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Miyazawa lost his grip on power due to voting by Hata and other LDP pro-political reform lawmakers who supported the opposition- proposed no-confidence motion. Hata left the LDP along with Ichiro Ozawa, now a top coalition strategist, and their followers to create Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key component of the coalition. Hata, in recalling the day one year ago, said the move triggered drastic change in Japan's political landscape. "I voted for the motion while saying in my mind 'please forgive me' because I thought I had to open up (a new era) in Japan's politics," he said. "I am recollecting the day with a heart filled with emotion."
