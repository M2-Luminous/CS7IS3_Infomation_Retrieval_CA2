FR941207-1-00013 FR941207-1-00006 The Service is also pursuing conservation agreements and management programs with various Indian Tribal Governments and the U.S. Forest Service. If agreements can be reached and implementation ensured so that special management consideration or protection is not necessary, the Service may consider excluding those areas from critical habitat. Such management agreements should include commitments to implementation of the recovery plan for the species or equivalent protection. Background The Mexican spotted owl is a medium-sized bird ranging from parts of central Colorado and Utah, south through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas, then south through Mexico to the States of Michoacan and Puebla. Mexican spotted owl habitat typically consists of dense, multi-storied, montane forests with closed canopies, and deep, cool, fractured canyons. The Mexican spotted owl is threatened by destruction and modification of habitat caused by even-aged timber harvest methods and wildfires, and decreased habitat suitability and potential increased predation associated with habitat fragmentation. Previous Federal Actions The entire spotted owl species ( Strix occidentalis ) was classified on the Service's 1989 Animal Notice of Review (54 FR 554; January 6, 1989) as a category 2 species. A category 2 species is one for which listing may be appropriate, but for which additional biological information is needed to support a proposed rule. The northern spotted owl subspecies ( S. o. caurina ) was listed as a threatened species on June 26, 1990 (55 FR 26194), and its critical habitat was designated on January 15, 1992 (57 FR 1796). The California spotted owl subspecies ( S. o. occidentalis ) remains a category 2 candidate. On December 22, 1989, the Service received a petition submitted by Dr. Robin D. Silver requesting the listing of the Mexican spotted owl as an endangered or threatened species under the Act. On February 27, 1990, the Service found that the petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may be warranted and initiated a status review. In conducting its review, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (55 FR 11413) on March 28, 1990, requesting public comments and biological data on the status of the Mexican spotted owl. On December 6, 1990, the Mexican Spotted Owl Status Review Team completed a draft report, and on February 20, 1991, the Service made a finding, based on the contents of the report, that listing the Mexican spotted owl pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act was warranted. Notice of this finding was published in the Federal Register on April 11, 1991 (56 FR 14678). A proposed rule to list the Mexican spotted owl as threatened without critical habitat was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 1991 (56 FR 56344). In the November 4, 1991, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might bear on whether the Mexican spotted owl should be listed. The comment period was reopened from May 11, 1992, to September 1, 1992 (57 FR 20073; May 11, 1992) to allow submission of additional comments. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were directly contacted and requested to comment, and newspaper notices inviting public comment were published in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The Service held six public hearings, which were announced in the proposed rule. A notice of the hearing dates and locations was published in the Federal Register on January 2, 1992 (57 FR 35), and in notices published in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado newspapers. Interested parties were directly contacted and notified of the hearings. After a review of all comments received in response to the proposed rule, the Service published a final rule to list the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14248). Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat. At the time of listing, the Service found that, although considerable knowledge of Mexican spotted owl habitat needs had been gathered in recent years, habitat maps in sufficient detail to accurately delineate these areas were not available. Subsequent to listing, the Service began gathering the data necessary to develop this proposed rule. On June 25, 1993, and again on August 16, 1993, the Service received petitions to remove the Mexican spotted owl from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (delist). In subsequent petition findings published in the Federal Register (58 FR 49467, 59 FR 15361) the Service addressed the issues raised in the petitions and determined that the petitioners did not present substantial information indicating that delisting the Mexican spotted owl was warranted. The petitioners have legally challanged this decision in Federal District Court in New Mexico in Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, et al., CIV 94&hyph;1058&hyph;MV. Habitat Characteristics The physical and biological habitat features essential to the conservation of the Mexican spotted owl, referred to as the primary constituent elements, include those that support nesting, roosting, foraging, and dispersal. These elements were determined from studies of Mexican spotted owl habitat, including habitat structure, habitat use, and prey preferences, throughout the range of the owl.
