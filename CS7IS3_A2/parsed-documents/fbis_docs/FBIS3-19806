FBIS3-19806 "drweu056__a94020" FBIS-WEU-94-056-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Schlegwig-Holstein Voters Reject Extremists AU2103083594 Hamburg DPA in German 2221 GMT 20 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2103083594 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- At the local elections the voters in Schleswig-Holstein turned their backs on the right-wing extremist parties. Even though the Republikaner improved their results in their bastion Luebeck from 3.1 to 4.1 percent, only 0.5 percent of voters voted for them across the land. Thus, Schoenhuber's party lost almost half of its voters in Schleswig-Holstein (1990: 0.9 percent). At the Landtag election in 1992 1.2 percent of the votes cast their votes for the Republikaner. In general, the right-wing extremist parties were of such little importance at these local elections because they ran only in a few towns and districts. Just as four years ago, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) did not play any role. The German People's Union (DVU), which entered the Kiel Landtag with six deputies at the previous Landtag elections, did not run for the local elections in the first place. The Republikaner ran only in Luebeck and in the Rendburgs-Eckernfoerde district. The NPD ran in 23 constituencies in the Lauenburg Duchy district and received 2.8 percent of the votes there. At the communal elections in the towns that belong to a kreis [district], the two parties did not run at all. In Moelln, too, where in 1992 two young men from the skinhead scene had killed three Turks in an arson attack, none of the right-wing extremist parties stood for election. In 1990 the Republikaner received 3 percent of the votes there.
