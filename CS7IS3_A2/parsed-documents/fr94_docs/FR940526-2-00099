FR940526-2-00099 FR940526-2-00063 Because of the size and diversity of the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer conducted substantially more pricing surveys there than in other areas. For the Goods & Services component, Runzheimer generally surveyed to obtain six times as many price quotes in the Washington, D.C., area as in the typical allowance area. For the Housing, Transportation and Miscellaneous Expense components, data collection was generally triple that of the typical allowance area. 3. Consumption Goods & Services 3.1‚ê£Component Overview Based on the CES data, the Goods & Services component consisted of ten categories of family expense: Food at Home Food Away from Home Tobacco Alcohol Furnishings & Household Operations Clothing Domestic Services Professional Services Personal Care Recreation To aid in quality control and analysis of future pricings, Runzheimer further subdivided four of the largest categories_food at home, furnishings and household operations, clothing, and recreation_into subcategories.
