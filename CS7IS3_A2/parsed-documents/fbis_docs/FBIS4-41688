The border, which is almost 500 km long, runs between mountain ridges that separate Tajik and Afghan Badakhshan. Although all the outposts where the Russian border guards are based lie at the foot of these mountains, they are still at an altitude of 1,700-1,800 meters above sea level. You can imagine the hardships of service here, where Russian border guards have to cope with more than just the thin air of the Pamir mountains. Although political passions are now boiling in Tajik Badakhshan, on the Afghan side they have long escalated into armed settling of scores, and Russian border guards find themselves in the middle of all this. [Begin recording] [A. Neroyev, commander of Horog border detachment] The fact that no single authority is in control on the territory of the neighboring state, Afghanistan, makes things difficult for us. On the other hand, the situation in Tajikistan itself is quite complex. So, the officers and men of the border troops have to work quite hard to keep the situation under control. Even so, we are actively guarding the border. We have regular meetings with Afghan representatives and settle security issues with them. We have been granted the right to represent the state in talks with the Afghans on questions involving the state border and control of the state border. [end recording]
