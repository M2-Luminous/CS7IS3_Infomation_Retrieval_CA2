FR940819-2-00028 FR940819-2-00011 Comment 23: Petitioners contend that the Department should disallow the portion of Minasligas's duty drawback claim pertaining to IPI and ICMS taxes. Petitioners contend that these expenses are taxes, not duties. Petitioners also note that these two taxes were not listed in the duty drawback regulations provided by Minasligas. Department's Position: We disagree with petitioners. Article 314 of the Brazilian Customs Regulations provides for the ``suspension of payments of tributes due when importing merchandise to be exported *␣*␣*.'' (Emphasis added.) The suspension is not limited to customs duties. It includes all ``tributes'' paid upon importation of the merchandise. IPI and ICMS taxes incurred on imported electrodes are two such tributes which are suspended upon exportation of the merchandise. Thus, Minasligas correctly included these expenses in its claimed adjustment for duty drawback. Comment 24: Petitioners contend that the Department should use adverse, noncooperative BIA for RIMA. Petitioners make reference to the Department's December 22, 1993 verification report regarding RIMA's COP/CV response. That report indicated that RIMA: (1) Was unwilling to supply the Department with necessary worksheets, schedules, or source documents, (2) that the aspect of RIMA's COP/CV response pertaining to related party transactions, G&A expenses, finance costs, and profit were not verified, (3) that RIMA's calculation of charcoal and quartz costs were not reflective of monthly replacement costs, and (4) that RIMA did not adjust the value of its electrode purchases to account for inflation. Petitioners assert that the verification report indicates that RIMA based its cost response on a managerial cost accounting system that was not used for purposes of valuing inventory in the financial statements. As such, petitioners contend that RIMA's submitted cost information could not be reconciled with RIMA's financial statements. According to petitioners, the verification report also indicates that RIMA based its calculation of labor hours on theoretical times and that actual labor hours exceeded these theoretical hours by a significant amount. Finally, petitioners find that the Department determined that RIMA's COP response did not account for costs associated with write-downs or obsolescence. Petitioners contend that RIMA's refusal to provide requested information significantly impeded the completion of this review. In accordance with the Department's practice, petitioners argue that the Department should assign as BIA the higher of the highest prior margin established for any company or the highest margin determined in this administrative review. Department's Position: At verification we encountered serious and pervasive problems in our efforts to verify the information submitted by RIMA. We found that these problems were so extensive that we could not test major areas of the response. For those areas we tested, we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition to a lack of sufficient data to corroborate the response. We outlined the major deficiencies that we found during verification in the public version of the cost verification report (December 22, 1993) and the RIMA calculation memorandum, both of which are on file in the Central Records Unit. Under these circumstances, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the information submitted by RIMA. The Department cannot be placed in the position of having to identify and perform numerous and substantial revisions to develop accurate cost data, if indeed such revisions were even possible in this case. As stated in Photo Albums and Filler Pages From Korea; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 50 FR 43754, 43755&hyph;43756 (October 29, 1985): It is the obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity to analyze fully the information and other parties are able to review and comment on it. Verification is intended to establish the accuracy and completeness of a response rather than to supplement and reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department. Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we have determined that rejection of the cost response submitted by RIMA is appropriate for these final results and is consistent with past practice (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al.., 54 FR 18992 (May 3, 1989), 31704&hyph;31709, and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Taiwan, 55 FR 34586 (August 23, 1990, 34586&hyph;34587)). In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we use BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce information in a timely manner and in the form required. The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate for any company from the original investigation or a prior administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review for any company. For respondents that attempt to cooperate, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise, or (2) the highest calculated rate in the current review for any firm (see Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et al., Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993).
