FR941019-0-00033 FR941019-0-00004 (3) Determination of market value. The RTC shall establish a market value and estimate a net realizable market value for each eligible multifamily property, giving consideration to the lower-income occupancy requirements and the related rent limitations. The RTC shall sell each eligible multifamily property at a price no less than the estimated net realizable market value unless sale at a lower price is necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and to enable a public agency or nonprofit organization to comply with the applicable lower-income occupancy requirements. If the RTC receives an offer higher than its estimate of the net realizable market value, the amount of such offer shall be deemed to be the net realizable market value. (4) Lower-income occupancy requirements_ (i) Rent limitations. (A) To comply with lower-income occupancy requirements, the rents charged to very low-income families may not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of area median income, with adjustment for family size; and the rents charged to lower-income families may not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 65 percent of area median income, with adjustment for family size. Adjustments for family size for purposes of determining the maximum rent that may be charged shall be made as shown at paragraph (a)(6) of this section. (B) Where a unit is occupied by a family receiving housing assistance payments, pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), as amended, the family's contribution toward rent may not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted income. (ii) Continued occupancy of current residents. No purchaser of an eligible multifamily property may terminate the occupancy of any person residing in the property on the date of purchase for purposes of meeting the lower-income occupancy requirements. The purchaser shall be in compliance with the requirement if each newly vacant dwelling unit is reserved for lower-income occupancy until the lower-income occupancy requirements are met. (iii) Financial infeasibility. The Secretary, the RTC or its successor, or the State housing finance agency for the State in which the property is located may temporarily reduce the lower-income occupancy requirements applicable to a property sold under this program if the Secretary or the applicable State housing finance agency determines that an owner's compliance with such requirements is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return lower-income occupancy to the level required by the property's LURA, and the Secretary or the agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist. (5) Expression of serious interest. Before the end of the marketing period, a qualifying multifamily purchaser may express serious interest in purchasing an eligible multifamily property from the RTC. The expression of serious interest shall be submitted to the listing broker or other marketing specialist and shall provide evidence that the purchaser intends to prepare a bona fide offer and has the ability to purchase the property. At a minimum, the documentation supporting the expression of serious interest would include: (i) Confirmation of public, nonprofit, or for-profit status; (ii) A financial statement and evidence of a source of equity funds; and
