The trajectory of the movement of the total volume of retail sales is wavelike. Business is not really slack during slack seasons and is booming in busy seasons. A prolonged peak-selling period is a prominent characteristic of the consumer goods market as a whole. Last year the total volume of retail sales of the country as a whole was 1,359.3 billion yuan, an increase of 23.6 percent over the previous year, thus growing 6.8 percentage points faster than the previous year. An adjustment of the figure for inflation shows that the amount of physical goods increased by around 9 percent. In terms of development dynamics, the growth rate was 16.2 percent for the first quarter, 27 percent for the second quarter, 23.9 percent for the third quarter, and 26.9 percent for the fourth quarter. 2. The consumer goods market is basically characterized by a situation in which supply exceeds demand, and selecting good merchandise to purchase has become people's usual consumption behavior. According to domestic trade agencies' ranking of the supply and demand situations of 680 commodities in the second half of 1993, supply and demand were in basic equilibrium or supply exceeded demand in the cases of 91.6 percent of the commodities; supply was smaller than demand in the cases of 8.4 percent of the commodities. The supply of light industrial products and most agricultural and sideline products is abundant, mainly because the continued growth of industrial production and the steady development of agricultural production in 1993 has resulted in a situation in which the supply of goods for the market is abundant and in which the total supply of goods exceeds the total demand for goods. For the year, the value of output of light industry increased by 22.3 percent over the previous year, and the ratio of the total volume of retail sales to the value of output of light industry was 1:1.24, slightly higher than a normal year. 3. The rapid growth in effective demand on the domestic market has invigorated the consumer goods market. According to estimates, the per capita living-expense income of the urban residents for the year was 2,323 yuan, representing a 10 percent growth in real terms after being adjusted for inflation; the net per capita income of the rural residents was 880 yuan, representing a growth of around 2 percent in real terms after being adjusted for inflation. The rapid growth in people's income has led to strong demand on the market. Urban markets have continued to boom. "Stressing nutrition in regard to eating, stressing comfort in regard to clothing, and stressing having high-grade goods in regard to articles for daily use" have become a consumption trend prevalent among urban residents. The quality of consumption has been markedly raised, and the transition from the quantity type to the quality type is very obvious. 4. All kinds of market actors are developing rapidly, and the regulating role of the market has been further enhanced. With the increasingly important role of the market mechanism in the circulation sphere, market competition has intensified, and the various sectors' shares of business have continued to change. A prominent manifestation of the change is the decreasing of the state commerce sector's share of business and the increasing of the nonstate commerce sector's share of business. The pace of price reform has quickened. Currently procurement and selling prices of grain and oil have been decontrolled in over 90 percent of the regions. Prices for services such as those provided by hotels, bathhouses, and barber shops and repairs have also been further decontrolled, and the market-regulated proportion has continuously increased. According to statistics, the share accounted for by market-regulated prices of the total volume of retail sales has increased to around 95 percent; state-set prices account for only 10 percent of the total volume of agricultural products sold by the peasants. 5. Policy factors have large impacts on the consumer goods market. Since the beginning of last year, the state has adopted some consumption-stimulating measures, such as decontrolling grain and oil prices in most regions, raising the merchandizing business tax, and adjusting exchange rates; as a result prices of some goods have increased, and people have again demonstrated the consumption mentality characterized by an inclination to purchase goods for value-preservation purposes; media discussions of the postponement of "the resumption of GATT membership" have released the purchasing power which has been accumulated over a long time.
