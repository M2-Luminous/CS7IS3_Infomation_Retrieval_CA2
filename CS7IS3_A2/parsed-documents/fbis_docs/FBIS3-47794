The discussion came after leaders in the House of Councillors from both sides agreed in a preliminary meeting that they will negotiate on possible amendments to government-sponsored political reform bills. Juro Saito, chairman of LDP members in the upper house, told reporters that the coalition and the LDP agreed to search for a compromise in the upper chamber rather than through a proposed summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono. The government bills, aimed at weeding out rampant political corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in mid-November. Upper house debate on the package, which features changes to the electoral system for the lower house and tighter curbs on campaign funding, is to be concluded on Wednesday, paving the way for a vote by an upper house panel and a final vote at a plenary session of the upper chamber. Representatives of the coalition and the LDP in the upper house are discussing the LDP's compromise proposals, one of which calls for a change to the balance between single-seat districts and the proportional representation system for lower house elections. On the possibility of a summit between Hosokawa and Kono, Saito said only, "it depends on developments in our talks." Hosokawa has staked his political future on enactment of necessary reform legislation in the current Diet session, which ends January 29.
