According to Yakov Urinson, the draft budget envisages the conducting of a moderately rigid financial policy with a balanced approach to the settlement of current and medium-term tasks. This approach implies a selective state support for highly efficient productions and the implementation of investment projects which are quickly repaid, as well as the expansion of sources of financing in social spheres. The first deputy minister of economics believes that in 1994 workers' incomes and their minimum wages will increase. The ratio of the growth of the minimum wage and consumer prices is expected to be 85-90 per cent. The size of wages with due account for the expected subsistence wage will rise 4.9 times by the end of 1994. On the whole during the year real cash incomes of the population will decrease insignificantly in the course of the implementation of an active policy of economic stabilization, Yakov Urinson promised.
