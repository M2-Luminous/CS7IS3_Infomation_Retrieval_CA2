Military officials said there would be further releases Wednesday and a total of up to 500 by the end of the week. However former Palestinian spokesman Hanan 'Ashrawi dismissed the gesture as window-dressing when more than 10,000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails. "We are not looking for appearance we are looking for serious substance," she said. None of those released killed or wounded Israelis, none belonged to groups opposed to peace such as Hamas and none had committed crimes since the September 13 autonomy deal. "These releases are just a drop in the ocean without any political significance," said 27-year-old Nasir 'Azzah who was bussed back home to Ramallah on the occupied West Bank just 11 days before he completed a 21-month sentence. "I'm not as happy as saddened and angered by the massacre in Hebron. Releasing 1,000 prisoners is not enough," said Ihsan 'Awdah, 25, who returned home to Bethlehem six months before the end of five years inside. The carnage at the Tomb of the Patriarchs on Friday sparked widespread rioting which has left another 17 Arabs dead and hundreds wounded and Palestinian leaders ordered no celebrations for the releases. It has also led the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to snub US President Bill Clinton's call for snap talks to turn tragedy into a peace catalyst. Sufyan 'Abu-Zaydah, a senior Gaza Strip official with Arafat's Fatah movement, said: "It's too small a number. There are at least 4,000 prisoners in jail on ridiculous charges. "Israel could free them immediately to calm the Palestinian population." According to international human rights groups Israel detains about 500 Palestinians a week during normal times. Abu-Zaydah said the release of large numbers of inmates was "the only way to appease the population of the occupied territories". But violence in the territories and Arab areas of Israel subsided with more than half of the two million Palestinians still under curfew. Troops shot six Palestinians in Gaza City on Tuesday compared with dozens in preceding days. Israel nonetheless reinforced patrols in the territories and along the borders, fearing attacks. Army chief of staff Ehud Baraq said the army was bracing for a wave of revenge attacks. Pro-Israeli militia forces killed four Islamic guerrillas in southern Lebanon. The prison release -- a few days ahead of the annual liberation of a few hundred Palestinians to mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan -- was part of a package of measures announced Sunday. They included a crackdown on hardline settlers who supported the mosque killer Barukh Goldstein, but the PLO rejected them as inadequate. Police Minister Moshe Shahal vowed that four Jewish extremist ringleaders who backed the massacre, would be hunted down and detained without trial. He said the killing of 30 Moslems according to the army and 52 according to Palestinian doctors, had crossed a "red line". Leaders of the anti-Arab Kach and Kahana Hay groups, with which the killer had close links, went underground as the government ordered their arrest. Only one was caught in a police swoop. Shahal said "a few dozen" members of the movements would be disarmed and their movements restricted. Kach membership was below 100 and Kahana Hay even smaller, he said. The government also announced multi-million shekel (one dollar is worth three shekels) compensation to relatives of the dead and wounded. It was the third release since the September agreement. Some 617 were allowed out on October 26 and on January 7, another 101 Palestinians walked free, most just a few days before the end of their time. The last 200 of 415 Palestinian fundamentalists deported on December 17, 1992, were also brought back a year later.
