We are once again returning to this subject, taking into account the numerous phone calls to the editorial office with requests for assistance to contact the fund or to give more details about it. The fund's capabilities and the problems that it is running into are recounted by Ivan Starostin, its chairman. [Shinkin] Ivan Fedorovich, tell me, did you keep your word that the first group of refugees will be housed in new apartments before the new year? [Starostin] Have no doubts. More than 20 families, members of our fund, held housewarmings and celebrated New Year at the same time. Very soon approximately 200 more families, as they say, will have their corner in the motherland. This, of course, is not a lot, but it is also not that little, if you consider that, in fact, we have been working just a little more than a year. [Shinkin] On what conditions does the fund offer people housing? [Starostin] I will note that at a congress we approved Russians who by force of circumstances have found themselves outside the borders of their historic motherland and who desire to return to it. Most of these people are not rich. Therefore, the conditions in our country are most acceptable for them. First, we sell the housing only at cost. Second, the fist payment on the conclusion of the contract amounts to 20 percent of the cost of the apartment. The remaining sum is paid over the course of 10 years. At a time when other firms, as far as I know, are selling housing, as a rule, at commercial prices and immediately for full cost. Only a few can manage this. [Shinkin] Do those who are returning to Russia have an opportunity to choose where they will resettle? [Starostin] Unquestionably. Of course, for the time being the housing fund has been established essentially in the European part of Russia. But projects are also ready for its eastern regions. In addition, our fund not only builds and buys apartments in cities, but it is also building whole settlements with socio-cultural purpose facilities and production premises. Thus, our customers have to take into account only their material capabilities in selecting their place of residence. While in Moscow's outlying districts a square meter of housing costs somewhere around 600,000 rubles [R], then, for example in Krasnodar its price is lower by a factor of three. [Shinkin] Several persons from Latvia in telephone conversations with me have asked the editorial office about assistance for your fund. There is the same kind of request in a telegram from Estonia, on which there were more than 100 signatures. What, Ivan Fedorovich, caused this? [Starostin] The fund's general problems, it must be assumed. But the gist of them is this. The Russian Fund is not a government organization. And we do not rely on state subsidies, recognizing the limitation of the state budget and the profusion of unresolved tasks in the country. Therefore, from the first days we have counted on nonbudgetary sources of financing. Understandably, a lot cannot be built on the personal means of our customers. Credits are needed. If they are taken in commercial banks, then this means that it is necessary to raise the price of housing by a factor of 2.5-3. It is more advantageous, as the calculations of economists show, to take credit in the West. As early as the beginning of last year, we reached an agreement with the leaders of the concern MK Technology Trading and a number of American banks about allocating credit under the fund program in the amount of $250 million. Moreover, under very favorable conditions. In addition, the United States Department of State was also ready to offer humanitarian credit in the amount of $5 million. One requirement was raised on their part: the guarantees of the government of Russia and the inclusion of the fund in the implementation of the state program for alternative construction. But we were unable to accomplish this in our corridors of power. While former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy did not skimp on promises, Shumeyko, Shakhray, and others did not even deign to give us their answer. [Shinkin] But, you will agree, Ivan Fedorovich, it is not a rare case when personal interests are decided on the pretext of common interests. [Starostin] Doubts are understandable. Only we are prepared to account for every cent. What is more, we are ready to assume the work of representative of the government, which would control how the money is being spent. Not to mention the fact that we have already calculated the technology of returning it. But the difficulty is that they do not even want to discuss this question with us. Assuming, evidently, that there are enough places for everyone in Russia, let them come. But the problem is not that simple. As investigations show, about 17 million Russians want to return to the motherland in the near future. Even our country is not in a condition to quickly "digest" such a number. It also should not be forgotten that there are many former servicemen among the homeless, and also officers and warrant officers of subunits that will be withdrawn from the countries of the near and far abroad. At the very least, it is irresponsible not to take this into account. [Shinkin] Judging by your words, you are not planning to yield. Hope, it is well known, is the last to perish. At the present time, we are conducting negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of the United States on granting us favorable credits in the sum of $500 million for 10 years. In addition, a payment of 3.5 percent annual interest is envisioned for five years. The project has received the preliminary approval in congress, the State Department, and the Defense Department of the United States. But, again, everything depends on state guarantees. Together with the Interdepartmental Commission on Social Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families, our fund submitted a request on 18 January to First Vice President Oleg Soskovets for an examination of this question. We are prepared to submit all of the necessary documents and detailed accounts. Indeed, apparently, the appeal to the editorial office of members of the fund is a result of this. They want to bring the attention of the public to their needs. After all, I will repeat, credits for us are an opportunity to accelerate housing construction. But this means to support and inspire confidence in 300,000 persons who are forced to abandon the places they lived in. Three hundred thousand--this is the figure of the number of members of our fund today. They deserve the attention of the Government of Russia. * * * The editorial office will report in subsequent issues about what kinds of results were obtained by the appeal of the leaders of the Russian Fund and the Interdepartmental Commission on Social Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families to First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets. The International Humanitarian Fund "Russian" can be contacted as follows: Address: 42 Shchepkin Street, Room 1701, Moscow, 128857. Telephone for information: (095) 971-96-25. [Begin boxed item] From a Speech by Nikolay Pankov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Rodina Association "Assistance to refugees and those forced to resettle requires a comprehensive approach. But, in our opinion, it is necessary for the Russian side in cooperation with Russian communities and Russian social organizations to adopt a number of immediate measures. First, there is a need for a precise schedule of activities of state and local organs of authority and the broad public on the reception of the resettlers. Second, a program is necessary for the resettlers that would provide for annual quotas, determine specific oblasts and krays, and allocate finances for the creation of an appropriate infrastructure. To compile such a program requires a realistic forecast of the expected number of resettlers. Only the Russian communities are able to do this. And, third, Russia should insist on signing special agreements with states of the near abroad, whose policy is the reason for the departure of Russians, according to which these states would assume a specific part of the expenditures for resettlement, which would create normal conditions for the departure of Russians--sale of apartments, issuance of transport, containers, and so on."
