He said, just as he did during his previous travels to other regions, he has encountered understanding and respect throughout this trip, which is what Cuba expected. During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said the objective of his trek is to communicate with the Latin American community, of which Cuba is a member despite those who have tried to tear her away from it. After describing some of his previous tours to Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, he said Cuba, by no means, is dragging its woes around the world, as some have said; on the contrary, Cuba has many things to offer, as a result of her progress in the fields of science, technology, education, tourism, and others. There are many other nations interested in these achievements, which pave the way for integration and trade. Regarding Cuba's efforts to resolve its current problems, Robaina spotlighted the opening of new areas to foreign investment, in which Cuba has the raw materials but lacks the capital, the technology, and the markets. When asked about the importance of the scheduled "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference, to be held in Havana, he said this is just another event that has no bearing on the country's survival, because that is related more to the people's efforts to resist and to their unyielding determination. The meeting is directed more at promoting relations with the emigre community, he said. He refused to comment on the hysteria the meeting has triggered among extreme right-wing sectors, as this hostile activity only confirms how appropriate the meeting is. Regarding the minuscule groups promoting such activity, he said simply one can only tell the truth about Cuba through the difficulties and needs, and those who have profited from these needs do not even deserve acknowledgement. His first event in Peru, where he arrived after visiting Uruguay and after a short stop in Buenos Aires, was a meeting with almost 100 Cuban physicians, sugar industry technicians, and sports trainers working in Peru. He updated them on the current situation in Cuba, the efforts to overcome the problems, and the need to represent and defend the nation with strong and credible arguments. He told PRENSA LATINA that while he was in Argentina he stressed the fact that each Cuban represents the island. He took advantage of the stopover in Buenos Aires to meet Cuban troubadour Silvio Rodriguez, who is touring the Argentine capital. Robaina said singing to the Argentines is another form of foreign policy, because Rodriguez is telling everyone about the Cuban situation through his songs. The Peruvian newspaper LA REPUBLICA, in an interview with Cuban physician Dr. Milvio Ramirez, highlighted the importance of Cuba's activities of cooperation. Ramirez is a heart surgeon who has performed more than 100 operations in the northern city of Chiclayo, 780 km from Lima.
