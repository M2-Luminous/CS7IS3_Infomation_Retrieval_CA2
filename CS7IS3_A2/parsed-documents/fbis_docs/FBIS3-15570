Answering an Interfax question he said that he had discussed the consequences of the Ames' scandal with American intellectuals in the Russian embassy in Washington. He had suggested that the Americans should agree to discussing the call made earlier by Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence who wanted Moscow and Washington to "make each other's intelligences transparent to the other side." Rybkin said that the Americans did not see much harm in the amnesty. "They share President Boris Yeltsin's and my view that if those who were released make trouble again they can be sent back to jail and the public opinion would say `That's where they belong'," he explained. Rybkin told the journalists who accompanied him that he had agreed with the House of Representatives Speaker Thomas Foley that direct contacts would be established between the two parliaments. In particular, cooperation within the CSCE framework had been discussed. "A joint military organization could become a CSCE tool so that Russia should not be sidelined," he said. Rybkin added that he and his U.S. counterpart had discussed ratification of START-2 and other international agreements by the Russian parliament and the situation in former Yugoslavia. He said that the crisis there could not be resolved unless Russia and the U.S.A. joined their efforts. The House of Representatives speaker accepted the invitation to come to Russia on an official visit, Rybkin said. On Monday Rybkin also met with Lee Hamilton, chairman of the foreign relations committee of the US Congress. On the conclusion of this meeting he declared that it is necessary to implement several "non-popular measures" in Russia to pursue tough anti-inflation policy, civil peace and accord are necessary for this. Rybkin referred to Gaydar who declared last September that as many as $20-25 Bn "leak" abroad annually. "One should undertake appropriate measures to return these funds and grant guarantees in order to draw foreign investments into the Russian economy. There is an appropriate majority to solve these issues in the State Duma," he said. Rybkin criticized actions of the Central Bank for "wasteful allocation of technical credits" to Ukraine, Chechnya, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. "In absolute numbers the allocated sums exceeded credits being granted by the United States," he noted. For his part, Lee Hamilton welcomed Rybkin's reassurances "about irreversibility of economic reforms in Russia." At the same time he pointed out that there can appear "great difficulties" during the voting in the US Congress on allocation of an economic aid to Russia. "Officials in the United States are attentively following the Central Bank of Russia's activity and believe that it rouses hyperinflation," said Lee Hamilton.
