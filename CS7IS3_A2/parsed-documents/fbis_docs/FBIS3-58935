These are his proposals, stolen from Ronald Reagan. Berlusconi's program for governing ("A plan for the future of democracy in Italy") is modest in appearance, in the style of the Knight of Arcore. Having settled on the title, various committees of professors who are involved in the "Seekers of Good Government" association went to work before Christmas. But because the egghead consultants were working at a leisurely pace, Silvio Berlusconi's staff [preceding word in English] in the meantime quickly set about distilling certain truths into 40 points that will be the centerpiece of his election campaign. Each point is studied as if it were a minor political provocation--a hammer blow designed to demolish everything that has been done heretofore with respect to the economy, pensions, and welfare. In this way, 40 resounding blows were struck--blows that will not allow TV or the press to divert their attention for so much as one day from Silvio Berlusconi. His program is ready, however, and has even been condensed onto colored cards that the candidates of the new party "Forza Italia" are committing to memory. In reading these cards, one gets the impression tht the only way to enter fully into the Berlusconian neofree-enterprise universe is to picture Italy as an enormous supermarket in which all citizens are basically potential consumers and are differentiated among themselves in terms of the differences in income that they individually represent. And so you have the superconsumers; the medium consumers; the anticonsumers (these are the worst, because they are that way ideologically, not because of their income); and finally, those who have little or no income: the very poor. Anyone who believes, however, that Berlusconi's proposed reforms are grimly classist in nature--as might appear at first sight--is mistaken. He also has an idea and a proposal to benefit the so-called new poor (estimated--in one study by the office of the prime minister--to number approximately 3 million citizens). For them, the Knight proposes the distribution of free "vouchers" (as they are defined in the "Forza Italia" programs), which resemble meal tickets except that they cannot be spent at lunch counters, to be sure, but at private clinics or in the very same USL's [local health units] which operate in merciless competition with the private clinics and all of which, in any case, require payment. Here is the great change that Berlusconi would like to make in the system: Welfare will no longer be the responsibility of the state and guaranteed to everyone; the very poor will have their vouchers, and the others will pay for their own health care by purchasing the best coverage they can obtain in the market. All of us should, therefore, become more judicious and think of the future, because Mother State that today provides for our health and our old age will gradually be dismantled. But will all Italians be foresighted enough to provide health care insurance for themselves? And who is giving a thought to the overconfident and the irresponsible? The truth is that Berlusconi has not neglected them either: his recipe is a kind of American-style free enterprise system (the one propagandized throughout the world during Ronald Reagan's reign), diluted by Milanese circumspection. Everyone--even the improvident--will accordingly be compelled to acquire--at their own expense--an insurance policy that will cover at least the major risks (accidents, serious illnesses, operations, and lengthy hospitalizations), as occurs today in the case of compulsory automobile insurance. Under the Berlusconi free-market system, of course, social differences will be felt even more strongly than today. That is to say, those who are well off will be able to obtain complete and reliable health insurance, while those who cannot afford it will have to be content and be very careful not to get sick. The Arcore party platform also includes a complete change in the pension system. If Berlusconi were to govern the country, the entire system would be privatized within 10 years, at which point the insurance companies would compete ruthlessly with each other for life insurance policies and with the INPS [National Agency for Social Security], which would have to function on the basis of decidedly privatistic standards. Provision is of course made for a transition period: those who have already made many payments to the INPS should continue to do so until they reach the age at which they qualify for a pension, but those who start work in future years will be able to select any insurance company that suits them. As at present, professionals, artisans, and businessmen will acquire life insurance policies that are entirely private. Employed persons, on the other hand, will tend to use the pension funds (consisting of sums withheld monthly from their pay and passed on to a private insurer) that will subsequently be taxed at reduced rates. Professor Antonio Martino--the brains behind the Berlusconian economic plan and the future economy minister if the ticket of the moderates wins--is already preparing a plan to make these pension funds more attractive because they will become in fact the instruments for accumulating the sums set aside for the pensions of employees in the public and private sectors. A small percentage of the sums thus withheld will be diverted into a kind of social fund that will finance the minimum pensions for those millions of low-income Italians who will be unable to provide for their own pensions. Will Knight Berlusconi have the courage to announce these resounding innovations that have been elaborated by his economists? And above all, will they bring him votes? For the present, he is only considering it, but he will eventually propose a law to set a ceiling on government spending--in order to prevent excessive expenditure--that will be similar to the proposal he has already made regarding tax revenues. Although this part of his platform may even displease many Italians and may lend itself to the accusation that he is scrapping all that has heretofore been regarded as social gains, Berlusconi will be betting heavily on an economic recovery. Could he--an incurable optimist--stand idly by in the face of declining production and the tragedy of unemployment? Two splendid ideas have occurred to him in this connection, but they will require a sacrifice on the part of the national treasury. The first would allow a businessman not to pay taxes on profits from his business that are reinvested immediately, and the second would authorize him to hire workers without paying the corresponding social taxes until such time as the economic recovery has been consolidated. Would these two strategems serve to give a major boost to the Italian economy? "They would not work, inasmuch as apprenticeship contracts and various forms of incentives for investment already exist," says Professor Felice Mortillaro, despite the fact that he himself is a member of the Good Government Association. "An entrepreneur invests or hires when the production cycle is set in motion, and certainly does not do so in order to save on his taxes."
