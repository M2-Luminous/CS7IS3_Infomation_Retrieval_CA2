The development of Shanghai's Pudong has added greater value to these places. No wonder transnational corporations regard this as "a golden area" for investment. According to relevant statistics, a total of 185 transnational corporations have set up 300 industrial and commercial enterprises in the Chang Jiang Delta area with a total investment of nearly $4 billion. These investment projects include electronic telecommunications, machine-building, automobile, computer, and biomedical enterprises. The number of medium and small foreign companies which have made investment there is even greater and the scope of their investment is more extensive. Shanghai is a place in which transnational corporations are most interested in making investment. As early as 1980, the Schindler Corporation of Switzerland set up the first elevator plant in Shanghai and the operation of the plant has been quite successful. After that, many other transnational corporations also made investment in Shanghai one after another. To date, 129 transnational corporations have set up 206 large projects in Shanghai and their total investment has reached $2.5 billion. Last year was a peak year for investment. Forty-five corporations signed 60 joint venture projects with enterprises in Shanghai and their investment amounted to $1 billion. In the first quarter of this year, another 11 transnational corporations invested in 15 projects in Shanghai and their total investment was close to $1 billion. Of the transnational corporations which have made investments in Shanghai, U.S. corporations rank first in terms of the amount of investment; then come those from Japan, Britain, and Germany. With its development in the past four years and more, the U.S. AT and T Corporation in Shanghai has become a backbone enterprise in the modern telecommunications industry on the mainland and its products account for a quarter of those on the mainland market. The corporation has reaped considerable profits. The Xerox Photocopier Corporation has 43 percent of the mainland market. The profits made by a joint venture involving the U.S. Carrier Corporation in Shanghai has reached a total of 700 million yuan in six years. Since the beginning of this year, some transnational corporations have competed with one another to hold negotiations in Shanghai on investment and cooperation. These include American Express, Shell of Britain, Ciba Geigy Pharmaceutics of Sweden, and so on. They plan to cooperate with Shanghai in manufacturing telecommunications equipment, electrical machines, cars, and medicines, and to issue credit cards. Jiangsu Province takes up much of the Chang Jiang Delta and has big cities like Nanjing, Wuxi, Nantong, Changzhou, and Suzhou. Jiangsu is one of the mainland provinces which have attracted the greatest amount of investment made by transnational corporations. According to statistics, 56 transnational corporations have invested in Jiangsu at present and their total investment is close to $1.5 billion. For example, Japan's Mitsubishi has invested $115 million to set up the Suzhou Lingkang Chemical Fiber Company Limited; Britain's BOC Group has made investment in the Zhangjiagang Biouxi Gaseous Industry Company Limited; Germany's Siemens Corporation has invested in the Wuxi Siemens Power Station Automation Company Limited; and Japan's Sharp Corporation has invested $50 million to set up its solely-owned Changshu Sharp Office Machines Company Limited. Besides, Japan's Iwai, Marubeni, C. Ito, Toyo, and other financial groups have also invested large amounts of money in various localities in Jiangsu and the average amount of investment in each project has reached $20 million. The investment made in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, accounts for about half of the total foreign investment made in the province. Many transnational corporations have made investment jointly with Nanjing and set up a number of large enterprises. These corporations include the Phillips Corporation of the Netherlands, the Siemens Corporation of Germany, and so on. The average amount of investment in each project is about $15 million. The momentum mentioned above indicates that investment made by transnational corporations in the Chang Jiang Delta area is in the ascendant.
