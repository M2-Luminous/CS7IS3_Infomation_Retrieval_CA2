He was summoned to answer questions regarding accusations of espionage against certain public personalities as well as with changes at the SRI leadership. Although the Steering College of the respective institution was also summoned, Virgil Magureanu was accompanied only by the head of the Counterespionage Directorate. The most spectacular case, that is, the case of the former presidential counselor, Marin Pancea, was clarified with two precise answers: He is neither a French spy nor working for the KGB. Asked whether he was not interested in Pancea's commercial relations, which would have made him a suspect, Virgil Magureanu said that SRI did not react to this issue. The SRI director promised to disclose next week where all the information published in the press originated from. In connection with other personalities who were accused of espionage such as Adrian Nastase [executive president of the ruling party Social Democracy Party of Romania], Adrian Severin [vice president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)], Ion Talpes [head of the Foreign Intelligence Service], and others, the answer was the same, namely, he promised to disclose those things later. In any event, "there is no proof that those persons were spies." Nevertheless, the SRI director promised "we will also see some spies" without mentioning who they are, how they were discovered, and what has happened to them. Major General Dumitru Cristea, Deputy Chief of the SRI, Will Be Removed From Office on Grounds of Immoral Behavior Referring to the issue of demotions at the level of the SRI leadership, Virgil Magureanu said that his deputy, Major General Dumitru Cristea, will be removed from his position because of immoral and scandalous behavior. In his capacity as rector of the Higher Institute for Information Studies, he had sexual relations with female students and the father of one of the girls complained about it to the Parliamentary Commission. The Commission came into possession of a recorded cassette that contained the declarations made to the Commission expert by the respective student. In her statement, the student tells the entire story in detail. Out of decency, we decided to refrain from disclosing those details. However, the representatives of the commission assessed the behavior of the SRI deputy chief as "offensively immoral." The president of the Parliamentary Commission Vasile Vacaru also has a recording in which Dumitru Cristea admits all the allegations, even if he withdrew those statements later. In this situation, Major General Dumitru Cristea was summoned for a hearing to the Parliamentary Commission in Charge of Supervising Romanian Intelligence Service activity. SRI Has No Clear Picture About Documents That Were Concealed by Gheorghe Diaconescu and That Contain Intelligence Data In connection with the dismissal of the head of the Counterintelligence Service, Gheorghe Diaconescu, Virgil Magureanu informed the commission that Diaconescu concealed documents that contained intelligence data. The SRI still has no clear picture of the nature of the respective documents or of the reasons why they were hidden. A response is still expected from the Prosecutor's Office. Virgil Magureanu, Director of the Romanian Intelligence Service Promised Not To Carry Out Any More Changes Without Previously Discussing the Matter With the Parliamentary Commission. The SRI Director Denied All Cases of Espionage Referred to in the Press. During the hearing, the SRI director mentioned that the institution, whose chief he is, to this very day, does not have accurate data that would confirm cases of espionage, as published in the press. His statement was confirmed also by the head of the Counterespionage Division of the SRI, who was present at the hearing. Nevertheless, Virgil Magureanu said that the SRI is investigating those cases that were brought up by the press and will present a report to the Parliamentary Commission. The Commission asked the SRI director not to carry out any more changes in the structure of that institution without previously discussing it with members of parliament. In conclusion, Virgil Magureanu promised that he will bring before the commission all those dignitaries who are going to be replaced, as well as those by whom they are going to be replaced.
