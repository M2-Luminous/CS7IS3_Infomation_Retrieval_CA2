FR940317-0-00011 FR940317-0-00004 The Committee met July 22, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $262,950, which included $82,500 for marketing. An interim final rule implementing that recommendation was published in the Federal Register on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47023) and finalized on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64103). The Committee subsequently met on February 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended an increase of $18,000 in its 1993&hyph;94 budget for the construction and purchase of a new trade show booth. The trade show booth is expected to cost $27,000 and will be used in conjunction with the Committee's Vidalia onion promotional efforts. The Committee recommended that $9,000 of current budget money be used and that the remaining $18,000 be taken from the authorized reserve, increasing marketing expenses from $82,500 to $100,500, and increasing the total budget from $262,950 to $280,950. The reserve, which currently totals $187,766, is within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal periods' expenses. There are adequate funds to cover this new expenditure, so no increase in the assessment rate was recommended. Since no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended, no additional costs will be imposed on handlers. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The fiscal period began on September 16, 1993, and the Committee needs to have approval to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) no increase in the assessment rate is being recommended so no additional funds will need to be collected from handlers.
