Stanko, Physical and Technical Problems Institute, Moscow; UDC547.9:543.424] [Abstract] During the past decade mumiye (MOV) has attracted both practical and scientific interest as a substance having healing properties. A requirement for the successful use of this substance lies in the determination of its authenticity. Mumiye is a complex biologically active substance having 60-80 percent organic matter. Its structure has not yet been established, although it is known that the organic fraction contains low molecular components such as benzoic and hippuric acids and both oxy- and amino-acids, various oligomers (peptides, carbohydrates) polymers, proteins, polysaccharides, glycoproteins and their modifications, polyphenols, and others. The nature of the biological activity of this substance has not been determined and therefore its identification by content of biologically active components has thus far been avoided. Taking into account the extremely complex composition of mumiye and the lack of reliable information on the composition and nature of its biological activity, it is hypothesized that the most expedient way to resolve the problem of identification of this substance lies not in determining the quantitative content of individual components, but rather in some integrated physical chemical characterization of the substance as a whole, especially spectral. In the present work a systematic study was made of the infra-red spectra at 4000-400 cm[.sup]-1[/] of 50 standard samples of authentic natural mumiye from deposits in Southwestern and Eastern Pamir, Eastern and Central Kazakhstan, Altay, and Tuva. Spectral criteria were established for identification of mumiye as a unique substance having a complex composition. A method is proposed for determining the authenticity of this substance from recommended spectral criteria making it possible to reliably identify mumiye and distinguish it from possible surrogates.
