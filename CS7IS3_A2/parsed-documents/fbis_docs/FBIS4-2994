The decision was made after years of abuse of the 6 kgs rule and after calls from customs officials to forbid the tourist import of fruit. In 1993, the Council of Agriculture asked customs to boost its enforcement of the regulations, as illegal fruit retailers were abusing the rules by asking tourists to help them import large quantities of duty-free fruit. The abuse caused grave concern among fruit growers in Taiwan and led the Directorate General of Customs to suggest prohibiting tourists from bringing in fruit altogether. The proposal, however, was rejected because it violated consumer rights. The Ministry of Finance finally resolved the dispute by cutting the legal fruit import limit to 2 kilograms. The new limit will take effect after approval by Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo.
