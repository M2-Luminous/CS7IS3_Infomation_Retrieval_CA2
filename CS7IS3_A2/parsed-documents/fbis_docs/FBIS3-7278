Kim told Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a second round of summit talks Saturday that South Korea does not want North Korea to become internationally isolated and hopes the international community will not move toward imposing sanctions against Pyongyang, the officials said. But "the ball is in North Korea's court," they quoted Kim as saying. Kim, who is to leave Tokyo later in the afternoon for Shanghai, told Hosokawa at the Akasaka Palace that he believes China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear armament but that he wants to listen to China's position on the matter and hold "thorough" discussions with the Chinese leadership, the officials said. The president predicted the United Nations Security Council will first move toward recommending North Korea to accept full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to promote dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang rather than immediately deciding on sanctions, according to the officials. Kim said there have not been any unusual moves in North Korea although military exercises have been held there since February 3. There has also been no unrest in South Korea regarding North Korea's situation, Kim said, citing as an example the stable stock market. During the hourlong meeting, Hosokawa and Kim agreed to promote bilateral economic relations in an expanded and balanced way, the officials said. Kim pointed out that South Korea's annual trade deficit with Japan stands at about 8 billion dollars and urged Japan to import more South Korean goods. Hosokawa agreed that Japan should make efforts to boost imports from South Korea and promote deregulation, but urged Seoul to try to strengthen competitiveness, stabilize labor-management relations and beef up the environment for investment, the officials said. The premier added that Japan wants to support South Korea's small- and medium-sized companies, they said. Hosokawa agreed to study Kim's call to send a Japanese survey team to South Korea to study investment environment there, they said. Kim also voiced South Korea's interest in entering the Japanese construction market, and Hosokawa replied he will have the concerned ministries and agencies study the matter, they said. Turning to Kim's proposal to promote cooperation among Japan, South Korea and China in the environmental, medical and cultural fields, Hosokawa agreed to study the proposal through working-level talks, the officials said. Kim suggested that the three nations cooperate on joint projects concerning environmental problems, in the field of modernization of oriental medicine and in their common culture based on the use of Chinese characters, they said. Kim told Hosokawa China has shown "positive" reaction to the proposal. The president also said his policy of boosting bilateral relations with Japan by looking into the future rather than to the past is a step away from that of previous South Korean governments, and that he believes the majority of the South Korean people support such a policy, according to the officials. Hosokawa and Kim also discussed cooperation in the ultrahigh-speed information communication field. Earlier in the day, the two leaders held talks over breakfast accompanied by their wives. Topics discussed during the breakfast included North Korea, Hosokawa's trip to China and political reform in Japan and South Korea, the officials said.
