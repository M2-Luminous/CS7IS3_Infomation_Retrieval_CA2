Referring to the Hindu Munnani's agitation in Pondicherry, demanding that a cathedral be handed over to Hindus as it was originally a temple, Prof Singh said "Such things are bound to happen." He, however, said he was not justifying the Munnani's actions and added that there were hundreds of institutions and places of worship in the country which originally belonged to Hindus. "We had, therefore, said that if you give away the three most sacred places (Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya), then the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) would, in all probability, be able to mollify the Hindus and tell them not to worry about the other places," he said. "If there is delay then some such unforeseen problems would crop up. It is the delay which, I think, is responsible for the escalation," Prof Singh said in an interview to ORGANISER, the RSS mouthpiece. Asked to spell out how he proposed to resolve such problems, Prof Singh said, "You can't say. In one place you find that the facts are very clear and so strong that the government is trying not to do anything." "If you (government) don't satisfy the Hindu society in these matters, which are of great relevance and importance to us, then the question of thousands of mosques standing on Hindu temple sites will be raised and there will be nobody to douse the Hindu anger," he felt. "Today, the VHP is a formidable body. They can say that they have decided to press for the three holiest of holy places and that they would not ask for more. This will be symbolic," he stressed. "But even if such a symbolic gesture of goodwill is not appreciated, then certainly your voice loses the power of persuasion. You cannot tell the Hindus to keep quiet. You can't tell them not to start new problems," he observed. He accused the government of trying to gag the voice of the VHP by banning it. He pointed out that the supreme court had decided the case on the Jamaat-e-Islami and not the VHP, though both were simultaneously banned. Asked to comment on the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] describing Hindutva as its "ideological mascot," the RSS chief avoided any direct comment. "It is for them to say what they like about their policies. At the same time, how can one forget that they (BJP) have opposed GATT and the Dunkel proposals?" he asked. On the present Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samajwadi Party (SP-BSP) government, he said it was a passing phase, "not a very significant phenomenon" and which may not have a lasting effect on the nation's political equations. It was difficult to say long that government would last, he added. "But the mutual contradictions between them (SP-BSP) and their internal dissent are so acute that unless they exercise extreme caution, they would not be together for long," he predicted. The RSS weekly wanted to know its chief's comments on the BSP general secretary, Ms Mayawati's statement to "finish off Gandhism" and her pitting Gandhiji against Dr Ambedkar. He said the BSP had not vowed to finish Gandhism. "Strangely enough, earlier, its leader, Kanshi Ram, had criticised Dr Ambedkar. In Maharashtra, he had said Harijans would not make any progress unless they denounced Dr Ambedkar," he pointed out. "His (Kanshi Ram's) argument was that whereas he treats the Dalits as equal partners, Dr Ambedkar made them beg for their rights. In his own style, he tried to belittle Dr Ambedkar. But when he realised the tremendous work done by Dr Ambedkar and the admiration he commands among the backwards, Kanshi Ram had to change his tracks," he added. "Now the same people--Kanshi Ram, Mayawati and company--are keen on projecting themselves as followers of Ambedkar. This is something new," he noted. The RSS chief alleged that Mr Kanshi Ram had accumulated funds which, according to him, confirmed his "foreign, American and Christian connections." Prof Singh felt that Dalit politics could never take deep roots in Uttar Pradesh as it had in Maharashtra.
