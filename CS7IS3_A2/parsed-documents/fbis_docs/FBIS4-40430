The negotiations between representatives of the sides within the framework of the interparliamentary Ukrainian-Crimean working group were completed in Simferopol. As the agency INTERFAX-UKRAYINA was informed by the head of the Crimean delegation and representative of the parliamentary Commission for Legislation and Law Enforcement, Sergey Nikulin, the draft consists of three parts: Powers that the Crimea hands over to Ukraine; powers that Ukraine may hand over to the Crimea; and joint powers. However, he did not specify the content of those parts. According to S. Nikulin, during the scheduled round of talks "the sides did not even try to discuss those articles of the Crimean Constitution that did not suit Ukraine." The Crimean delegation, he said, stated directly and unambiguously: There will be no revision of the Crimean Constitution. The working group believes that just the first stage has been completed and insists that work be continued.
