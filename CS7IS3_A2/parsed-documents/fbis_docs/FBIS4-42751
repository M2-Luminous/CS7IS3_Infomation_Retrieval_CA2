Sweden has awarded a contract to the German arms industry worth 2 to 3 billion German marks [DM], which American and French firms had bid for without success. [Begin recording] [Gabriela Gube, identified by caption] Defense Minister Ruehe and his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjoerck hope that this agreement will integrate Sweden into Europe. Sweden's support for the Baltic republics is intended to secure Europe to the East. [Ruehe] If the Baltic states see that the way to the West is not only via the center [as heard] but in this case via the north, then all Scandinavian states, particularly Sweden, will be doing something here which is in the interests of all of Europe. [Gube] German-Swedish cooperation extends to all kinds of arms. Areas in which the two countries used to compete, for example in submarine construction, they will now develop together. Swedish knowledge in air defense systems and simulators will help German arms. The core of the deal, however, is the Leopard 2. Sweden thinks that 50 new and 200 used models of the best tank in the world will prove themselves in the tough northern climate. The background to the DM2.5-billion deal is the concern about the unpredictability of the East, particularly Russia, in spite of the party mood. [Bjoerck, in English with superimposed German translation] I hope the Russians will not say about this deal that we Swedes have not waged war for 200 years. [sentence as heard] [Gube] It is a bitter fact that the end of the East-West conflict does not mean detente but a greater degree of insecurity. That, at least, is how it is in Scandinavia. The German defense minister is of course pleased about the Swedish purchase of arms, not only for commercial reasons. The intractable Swedes are slowly being drawn toward Western alliances, including military ones. That would have been inconceivable even two years ago. Security is more important than neutrality, even in Sweden. [end recording]
