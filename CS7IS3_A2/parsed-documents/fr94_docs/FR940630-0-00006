The Commission announces that these rules are effective as of June 30, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Susan E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 438(d) of Title 2, United States Code, requires that any rule or regulation prescribed by the Commission to implement Title 2 of the United States Code be transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate thirty legislative days prior to final promulgation. These revisions to 11 CFR Part 102 were transmitted to Congress on April 6, 1994. Thirty legislative days expired in the Senate on June 8, 1994, and in the House of Representatives on June 10, 1994.

This amendment adds new paragraph 102.14(b)(3), which permits such use if the title clearly indicates opposition to the named candidate. Announcement of Effective Date: 11 CFR 102.14(b)(3), as published at 59 FR 17267, is effective as of June 30, 1994. Dated: June 24, 1994. Trevor Potter, Chairman, Federal Election Commission.
