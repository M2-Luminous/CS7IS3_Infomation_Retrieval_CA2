On the same day after the accident occurred, the principal leader of the Zhejiang provincial party committee called on the provincial education commission to immediately notify all middle and primary schools throughout the province of the accident, adding that the commission should urge them to draw a lesson from this accident, to ensure safety in spring outings for students, and to cancel long-distance outings if safety conditions are found to be inadequate.
