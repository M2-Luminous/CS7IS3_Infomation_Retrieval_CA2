FBIS3-6447 "dreas053__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-053-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Memo for Pump-Priming Measures Reported OW1703144694 Tokyo AERA in Japanese 14 Mar 94 pp 70-72 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1703144694 Tokyo AERA Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by editorial staff member Keiko Ito: "Totally Bogged Down MITI"] [Text] According to statements by some section heads in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], a special meeting of senior officers was held at the ministry on the afternoon of 8 February. Those attending were the administrative vice minister, director of the minister's secretariat, directors general of each bureau, heads of divisions in the secretariat, and so on, all members of regular ministerial discussions. At this meeting, an A4-size paper entitled "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures" was reportedly distributed to all members. The word processor had produced such entries as: "Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y [Yen] 15 trillion (...omitted). 2. Support the government's idea to attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio." "Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for putting forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax reductions (...omitted)...." One section head explained to Administrative Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano that they were planning to send this document to economic organizations. On 8 February the government decided upon and announced comprehensive economic measures. This paper was the "example" which they wanted leaders of economic organizations to use when making comments to the media. It told them to evaluate the government stimulus measures along these lines. Vice Minister Kumano was said to have made the point: "Isn't it rather inappropriate to use a `model'?" But by then, this paper had already been faxed to four business organizations. It was faxed twice to the Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren]. The first fax was received by the Finance Division at around 11 in the morning. It was addressed to Management Director Keijiro Koyama. But this paper was entitled "Proposed Comments on the Tax Reduction Issue." The content of this paper was almost identical as the "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," but numbers such as "Y6 trillion in income tax reductions" and "Y15 trillion in economic stimulus measures" were not included. It was around noon that day when the coalition government, which had been discussing economic stimulus measures, agreed on "proceeding with a Y6 trillion tax reduction." The concrete economic measures were announced that evening. Adjustment seems to have also been made in the MITI example, reflecting this decision. "Not A High-Level Composition" The "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," which included the contents as announced, was sent to the four organizations between three and four in the afternoon. It must have been compiled in a great hurry: there were typographical errors such as "to secure the source of revenue for the tax reduction" and irregular indentations. People who were involved say: "There were some passages in which I could not tell what the subject of the sentence was. We thought it was a badly written, hard to read document." The other three organizations received only the "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," but by the time the fax arrived, all these organizations had already made their leaders' comments public. The result was that the "unheard of" guidance by fax only made the businessmen laugh. "It was insulting," according to Managing Director Masaji Shinagawa of the Japanese Association of Corporate Executives. "It did not affect us," said Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa of Keidanren. One staff member of a business organization angrily said: "We are not kids. We can make our own judgments. The government does not have to instruct us." Industrial Policy Bureau Director-General Position Was Vacant On 14 February, when the proposed comments became known in the newspapers, at his regular news conference Vice Minister Kumano answered: "I did not know anything (about sending out the proposed comments)." He then explained that the paper was a memorandum prepared by a staff member of the Industrial Policy Bureau staff for internal use only to clarify matters in his own mind. It was not intended to force others to accept this thinking. "There were some inappropriate expressions which we regret." However, he said "it is not clear" who prepared and faxed it. According to Hiroshi Yokokawa, head of the General Coordination Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, on 8 February the Industrial Policy Bureau resembled combat on a battlefield. The government's plan for a tax increase and a tax reduction had changed twice and three times respectively since the 3 February early morning commotion over a national welfare tax. Everyday the government parties negotiated within the coalition. At midday on 8 February, the outline was finally decided upon. The Industrial Policy Bureau was extremely busy working in preparation for the evening news conference. It is said that in these chaotically busy conditions, some junior staff member might have produced the "proposed comments" and faxed them. "When policies are announced, we often receive questions from the business sector as to what the significance is. That document was a point paper that staff members had for dealing with such questions. However, it was a mistake to have faxed it." There has been no director general for the Industrial Policy Bureau since 24 December of last year. The director general until then was Masahisa Naito. He submitted his resignation when he was told to do so on the grounds he had given preferential personnel treatment to the eldest son of the former administrative vice minister. As of 15 February, Director General Tomio Tsutsumi assumed the position in the Industrial Policy Bureau, which is the most senior position among the directors general in MITI. But at the time of the faxing incident, Administrative Vice Minister Kumano was holding it as an additional position. Anxious Because Imperfections Have Became Noticeable MITI admits that "guidance" by fax is unheard of. But it is also a fact that, before announcing major policies, phone calls from MITI are always made to economic organizations soliciting them to "please offer a favorable comment." Naito, who was popular among people in the business sector because "he was not like a petty official and had a broader personality," had been performing this function of making phone calls from the time he became director of the Secretariat. According to a person involved in the economic organizations: "Until now they have been working things out in advance [nemawashi], relying on intuitive good timing. But this time, because they have no director general, they messed things up." The tax reduction is limited to one year. There is no prospect for a source of revenue. The comprehensive economic stimulus measures of the coalition government reflected the internal situation of the coalition government, which consisted of a "pickup team." Imperfections were noticeable in the content of the measures. Some economists say: "Weren't they too impatient because they thought they could not get the economic sector to provide a strong evaluation of such countercyclical measures?" But MITI's apprehension turned out to be groundless, and comments by leaders of the business sector all welcomed the stimulus measures. Chairman Ken Moroi of Chichibu Cement Co. Ltd., who is also vice chairman of Keidanren, these days often senses a "tragic" feeling coming from MITI. There is a great recession, historically unprecedented. There is the somewhat unclear meaning of the U.S.-Japan alliance relationship in the post-Cold War era. He sees this as a time when we cannot use the old manuals for domestic politics and foreign policy. "When there was a clear goal to strive for economic growth and to catch up with the developed countries, it was an era when the bureaucrats could be most active. Because there is no need to create anything new, they only have to think up ways to proceed most efficiently toward the goal. But today Japan has to create the goals itself. This cannot be done by bureaucrats." To create new goals is essentially a task for politics. But he says that, under the continuously chaotic coalition government, the Japanese bureaucrats are driven by a sense of duty to the effect that "we must do the job." At the end of last year also, Chairman Moroi was astonished when MITI Administrative Vice Minister Kumano called on him, together with Ministry of Finance Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito. "It must have been the first time in history that two vice ministers from the greatest ministries come together to ask for a favor." After greetings by Vice Minister Saito, Vice Minister Kumano made an appeal for an understanding on the argument for consolidating the tax increase and tax reduction. The two vice ministers were said to have desperately tried to persuade him that the next 15 months would be the period which would determine the destiny of the Japanese economy. They said that during this period, the government would mobilize every possible policy measure to achieve the recovery of good economic conditions, and for that purpose the sources of revenue would be used up. Therefore the consumption tax must be raised to 7 percent in the future.... Some in the economic sector also point out that "it just happened to show up symbolically in MITI that the bureaucrats are running about in confusion as things change." Reform Movement Within the Junior Ranks In this style of MITI, there is also movement for reform. Two or three years ago, when the recession had become serious, a "junior officers study group" emerged in MITI. Originally this was a study group initiated by 25 people who had entered the ministry in 1980. They held discussions in the evening, mainly over dinner. Topics included the structural recession, the reduced population of people of a productive age, aging, women's advancement in society, and the collapse of the seniority system. "The old bureaucratic office system has become fatigued. We wanted to think how MITI should respond to this time of transition," says Hisato Nagao, deputy head of the General Coordination Division in the minister's Secretariat and the person who called for the study group. Centering on the officers in charge of laws and ordinances in each division, it has expanded the circle to younger people. Current participating members number around 400 who entered the ministry between 1980 to 1989. To collect concrete policy proposals from this younger generation, they have been meeting several times each month, in groups based on the same entry year, since last October. Ironically, it was in the midst of such activity that the issue involving Director General Naito and the fax incident occurred. According to one of the initiators of the study group, Seiji Hagiwara, deputy division head in the General Coordination Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau: "It is a fact that the study group has become a platform for considering the issue of how to deal with the changing environment. Everyone thought MITI's role was being questioned by society, and we had to brace ourselves. But all we can do is to reply by putting forward solid policies as bureaucrats." [Following is the content of the faxed paper] Proposed Comments on the Economic Stimulus Measures Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y15 trillion. (...omitted) 2. Support the government's idea to attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio. 3. Come to a rapid conclusion on a national consensus for tax reform discussion, including tax revenue sources. 4. Achieve rapid implementation through rapid formation of budget and tax legislation. Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for putting forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax reductions, corporation special taxes, automobile consumption taxes, and so on. (mention appropriate contents) 2. Support the government's idea to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio from the standpoint of to secure the source for lost tax revenues such as income taxes, and attempts to review what the people's burden should be in relation to the increased expense of an aged society. 3. As for the revenue source issue, it has been decided that the discussion is to continue. But considering it will be the people themselves who pay the debts in the end, we want you to make a responsible judgment quickly. As the time of a full-scale aged society is approaching, we also want you to settle on a discussion to achieve tax system reform with a national consensus, and to make efforts to pass the legislation within the year. 4. Expect the government to attempt to quickly pass the third supplemental budget, the original 1994 budget, and budget legislation-related bills--such as tax system related legislation--at an early date, and that the stimulation measures will be quickly implemented.
