If the undiclosed amount is included, the combined sum of bad loans at the banks swells to 15,969 billion yen, the mass-circulation daily said. Nonperforming loans are loans which have become uncollectible due to the bankruptcy of borrowers or upon which interest payments have not been made for six months or longer. The 11 commercial banks had disclosed such loans worth 9,273 billion yen as of the end of September. Among them, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank held 747 billion yen worth of undisclosed nonperforming loans, compared with its disclosed sum of 440 billion yen, the daily said. The ratio of disclosed and undisclosed bad loans to the Sapporo-based bank's outstanding balance of lending stood at 15 percent, or three times higher than the 11 commercial banks' average rate, it said.
