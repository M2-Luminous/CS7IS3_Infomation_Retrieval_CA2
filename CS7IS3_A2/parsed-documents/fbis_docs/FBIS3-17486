A package of economic issues was discussed. Every year 24 million tonnes of Ekibastuz coal are supplied to Siberian power stations from Kazakhstan. According to the Kazakhstan newspaper PANORAMA, the Russian energy sector's arrears reached around 80 billion rubles, 17 billion of which have already been paid. The remainder of the debt is to be paid in April.
