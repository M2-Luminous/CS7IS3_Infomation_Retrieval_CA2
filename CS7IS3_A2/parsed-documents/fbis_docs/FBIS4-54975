This was reported in the Belgrade daily BORBA of 4 April, together with excerpts of the party leaders' statements, in an article titled "Renewal of Yugoslavia Impossible." Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, is cited as observing that the regions that formerly constituted the state of Yugoslavia should strive to establish the "firmest links possible" as long as each of the areas retains its independence "in the political and every other sense." Vuk Draskovic, leader of Serbian Renewal Movement, points out that "there is no such thing as the reintegration of Yugoslavia; this gossip is spread by those opposition parties whose power was based on hatred, war, killing, and refugees." He adds, however, that economic, transportation, and cultural links must be established "on the territory that was once Yugoslavia," noting that it does not make sense to travel to Sarajevo through Frankfurt. Vojislav Kostunica, president of the Democratic Party of Serbia, stresses that "there are both contemporary and historical factors making it impossible to create a new Yugoslav state community." Borislav Jovic, vice president of the Socialist Party of Serbia, points out that the Serbs were the only nation interested in preserving Yugoslavia before the war, but now, after the war, they are against it. The Serbian people's opposition, according to Jovic, was demonstrated during the last elections because "the parties that talk about a new Yugoslavia did not gain a single seat in the republic's parliament." Jovic further stresses that the Serbs are for a "reduced" Yugoslavia, but not for Yugoslavia as it was in the past. He also agrees that the Serbs should establish economic, commercial, ecological, and cultural relations with their neighbors on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
