FR940112-1-00025 FR940112-1-00011 As stated both in the NOPR and above, the Commission intends to conduct a field test of the Form 1 software with volunteer respondents and, to the extent needed, modifications will be made. This field testing will be in addition to testing by the Commission's staff. In order to allow sufficient time for development and testing, the Commission concludes that the most prudent course at the present time is to defer implementation. As noted above, the NOPR only addressed the adoption of an electronic filing requirement and the effective date for that requirement (and a delegation of authority). It did not address the specifics of the electronic filing, its development and implementation. The Commission believes that the details of such development and implementation are best done at the staff level in the first instance. Although not specifically solicited in the NOPR, many of the commenters nevertheless made recommendations on features they would like to see included in the software, or that they felt needed to be included in the software. We anticipate that many of the recommendations will, in fact, be included in the initial version of the software. There are others which appear to be worthwhile features which are not contemplated for the initial version software, although they may be considered and included in future updates. We believe that other recommendations are without merit in that they are at odds with the intent of the Form 1 as a whole (i.e., uniform reporting), or the purpose of electronic filing. It is presently anticipated that the following features suggested by commenters will be incorporated in the initial software program: 1. Edit checking within pages and across pages. 2. Supplemental or continuation page feature. 3. Use of data base structure in ASCII format. 4. Compatibility with different types of printers, including laser printers. 5. Footnote references on schedules by line items and written columns, including headings. 6. View screen option. 7. Menu driven screens, including a help function. 8. Support function to provide assistance to users when implementing the new software. 9. LAN compatibility. Certain additional features suggested by commenters are not considered feasible for incorporation in the initial software, but may merit consideration in future software updates. These features include the following: 1. Submission by modem rather than diskette. 2. Electronic dissemination capability to others. 3. Incorporation of filings on a ``bulletin board'' accessible to the public. 4. Providing a diskette to update Form 1 schedules without reissue of the entire software package each year.
