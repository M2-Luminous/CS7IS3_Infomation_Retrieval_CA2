Gen. Abacha made the call in a message to the end of the Seventh Joint Domestic Trade Fair in Maiduguri. Patrick Owezor has the details. [Begin recording] In the message read by the state military administrator, Group Captain Ibrahim Dada, Gen. Abacha called on Nigerians to look inwards in view of the deep economic recession in the country. He said the present administration was keen in restoring the economy back on a sound footing within the shortest possible time. The head of state said the attempt to reactivate the economy could be seen in the steps already taken by the federal government to keep the value of the naira at 22 naira to the dollar, the prohibition of the activities of the parallel market, and the review of other monetary regulations. He assured Nigerians that effective implementation of this year's budget would be pursued to the letter. The head of state then called on all and sundry to give their full cooperation, solidarity, and unflinching support to the federal government and its policies and programs. He hoped that the entrepreneurs seize the opportunity of the fair to make contact and business connections that would enable them to acquire capital, markets, and technology for the enhancement of their business. Gen. Abacha commended the governments of Bauchi, Borno, Adamawa, Taraba, and Yobe states for harnessing their resources to organize the fair. [end recording]
