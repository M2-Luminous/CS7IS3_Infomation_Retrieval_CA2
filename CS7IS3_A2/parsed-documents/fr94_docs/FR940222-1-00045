FR940222-1-00045 FR940222-1-00008 3. We also propose to remove, as outdated, the following sections and paragraphs that were applicable to contract periods that began before January 1, 1986, and to realign the designation schemes as necessary: •(b) Paragraph (b) of §417.546 (Physicians' services and other part B supplier services furnished under arrangements) and the Editorial note at the end of the section. •Paragraph (d)(2) of §417.560 (Apportionment: part B physician and supplier services). •All of §417.562 (Weighing of direct services furnished by physicians and other practitioners). VIII. Other Required Information A. Paperwork Reduction Act Section 417.532(b) (with respect to HMOs and CMPs) and §417.800(c) (with respect to HCPPs) require those organizations to submit the information necessary for HCFA to determine whether payment in excess of the presumptive limit is appropriate, because of the health condition of the organization's Medicare enrollees, or because of extraordinary occurrences. The time needed to prepare the information would depend on the particular circumstances but would not, we believe, exceed 8 hours per organization. Section 417.576 requires HMOs and CMPs to submit certified cost reports as a basis for final settlement. We estimate that preparation of the full cost report will require 100 hours. If you comment on the information collection requirements, please send a copy of those comments directly to: Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, room 3002, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Allison Herron Eydt, Desk Officer for HCFA. B. Response to Comments Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the `` DATES '' section of this preamble, and if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule.
