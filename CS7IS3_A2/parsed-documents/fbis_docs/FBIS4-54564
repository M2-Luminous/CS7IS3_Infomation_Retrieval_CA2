Hudina, deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic, by an unidentified PRACA correspondent; place and date not given: "Disagreement With Orientation; M. Hudina Has Become an Independent Deputy"] [Text] "Have you officially announced your departure from the Club of Deputies and the Movement?" PRACA No. 97 asked M. Hudina, deputy of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. [Hudina] I notified the parliament chairman in writing last week. [PRACA] What made you leave the HZDS? [Hudina] There were reports about the HZDS conducting negotiations on the formation of a national democratic bloc. Because I was the sole deputy of Hungarian nationality in the HZDS Club of Deputies, I realized that I could not remain in such a bloc. My decision was also influenced by the passage of the law on names and surnames, by the so-called law on bilingual signs, and, last but not least, by the speeches by I. Chamula of the Slovak National Party, who constantly attacks the Hungarian ethnic minority. I was not enthusiastic about the formation of a coalition with this party and was the only [HZDS] deputy who did not sign it. [PRACA] You have become an independent deputy. Toward which party do you lean? [Hudina] I was present at the constituent assembly of the Democratic Union of Slovakia and will most probably become its member.
