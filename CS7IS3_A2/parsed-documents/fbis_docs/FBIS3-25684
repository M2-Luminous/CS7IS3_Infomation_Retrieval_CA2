The violence, which erupted alongside a trade union protest at the cost of living, has claimed at least six lives with the gunning down late Wednesday of the latest known victim, a corporal in the parachute regiment, the security forces stated. Speaking for the government, the daily L'UNION newspaper charged that the main opposition party led by Paul Mba Abessole had hijacked the strike for its own ends and was handing out hunting rifles, other guns and machetes. Small groups of armed opposition militants continued to man barricades in outlying districts of Libreville, which were cordoned off by police and troops, sources close to the security forces said. The city centre and the seafront, patrolled by President Omar Bongo's crack guard troops, remained calm, however, and no trouble was reported from Gabon's traditionally volatile second city, Port Gentil. The whereabouts of Abessole, a Roman Catholic priest and leader of the National Lumberjacks' Rally (RNB) party, were not clear on Thursday, opposition activists said. Security forces had Wednesday stormed his house on the outskirts of the capital after giving chase to opposition activists who had opened fire on them, government television reported. But an opposition spokesman told AFP that the RNB leader had not been at home when the raid took place. Thursday's press attack on Abessole, whom L'UNION accused of being "chief of a warmongering band," was the first direct criticism of the opposition leader by the government paper since he claimed to have defeated Bongo in presidential elections in December. Tension was reported from Oyem, the chief town of the RNB's stronghold in the northern Woleu-Ntem Province, where opposition supporters had moved the local transmitter of their Radio-Liberte. Early Tuesday, security forces destroyed Radio-Liberte's equipment in Libreville itself, sparking violence in which an official of Bongo's Democratic Party was burned to death in his home. A dozen public and private sector trade unions launched the strike Monday to push for higher wages following last month's 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, the common currency among 14 African countries pegged to the French franc. "But we are a long way now from devaluation or politics," one analyst said Wednesday. The "law of the jungle" had taken over in the poorer districts of Libreville, he added.
