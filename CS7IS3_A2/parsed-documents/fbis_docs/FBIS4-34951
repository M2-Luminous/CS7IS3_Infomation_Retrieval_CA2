Just the floating processing platforms -- two vessels off the coast of Jamaica -- cost the U.S. taxpayer some $120,000 a day, the Florida SUN-SENTINEL reveals today. The use of the Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton costs $2,100 per hour while its six accompanying helicopters cost $750 each for the same amount of time. Meanwhile, daily fuel expenses for the hospital ship USS Comfort, used as a processing center, run as high as $15,300. The operation entails intercepting the so-called boat people [previous two words in English], examining their asylum requests on the floating platforms, and repatriating those who are not eligible. The process involves eight Navy vessels, 15 Coast Guard vessels, and hundreds of immigration officials. The cost of this process will probably continue to rise as more Haitians try to escape. "This is the largest operation conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard since World War II. Between the vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard and those of the Navy, the United States has never had so many vessels off the Haitian coastline," Lieutenant Commander Jim Howe told the newspaper. The Pentagon plans to spend another $65 million in the next four months. Those funds will also be used to meet the needs of eight U.S. Navy vessels patrolling the Haitian coast. Ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, meanwhile, expressed opposition to Washington's plan to discourage Haitians from trying to leave their country in rafts. U.S. authorities fear that an exodus might crowd the floating platform to process refugees. Since this operation began a week ago, 194 Haitians have been interviewed, 52 were deemed eligible to seek asylum while the rest were repatriated. However, since 24 June, when Washington decided to tighten economic sanctions against the coupist leadership, another 800 have been intercepted on the high seas.
