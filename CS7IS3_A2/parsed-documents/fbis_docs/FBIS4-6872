In the morning, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] told reporters, "It is important to carefully review and settle all points of dispute." In the interparty negotiations on a new policy accord, the SDPJ was in a difficult position coping with "anti-SDPJ encirclement" by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The SDPJ believes the anti-SDPJ encirclement was created by "U.S. pressure." In the SDPJ Central Executive Committee meeting on 20 April, deputy secretary general Hideyuki Maejima expressed strong frustration with the coalition's preparatory work for policy accord. He said: "If `close tie-ups with the United States and the ROK' are incorporated in the coalition's policy accord, Japan may have to comply with U.S. requests even before the official UN decision (on sanctions against North Korea)." After Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's return home from Morocco on 18 April, "U.S. pressure" became the focal point of the "post-Hosokawa" political scene. A senior Komeito official said "It appears, in Marrakech, Hata received very difficult requests from (U.S. Vice President) Al Gore over the North Korea issue." Similarly, a source in Shinseito said "Hata has become prudent about his succession of the premiership since he noticed the rigid U.S. stance on North Korea and economic issues." In an 18 April news conference, Democratic Socialist Party secretary general Takashi Yonezawa stressed: "Nobody will become prime minister unless the coalition parties adopt a clear stance toward the North Korea issue." Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party recently decided to form a new party to win the premiership, and the coalition was shaken by this move. Some coalition parties are stressing that Hata is an indispensable political figure to maintain the framework of the coalition government, and that, to achieve the objective, the coalition must work out concessions on the North Korea and tax reform policies. This opinion is obviously targeting the SDPJ. The collapse of the Hosokawa administration was accelerated by the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks in February. Hosokawa's successor should overcome the chilly relations with the United States as a top priority issue. Under such circumstances, Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa reportedly intends to remove all possible obstacles before the inauguration of the new administration. Commenting on Ozawa's strategy, a senior Sakigake [Harbinger] official said, "that is why they expelled Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura as the `principal offender' in ruining the proposal for the public welfare tax." Also, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee chairman Koken Nosaka said immediately before the 20 April negotiation of the coalition parties: "They do not want to make the Hata administration a stopgap government. So, they are urging us to accept difficult conditions." It appeared Nosaka was trying to say the United States is the behind-the-scenes player in the political controversy.
