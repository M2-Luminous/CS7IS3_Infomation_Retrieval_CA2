[Taylor] And your role within the Parliament? How do you see that? [Buthelezi] That is going to be very difficult, because as a student of constitutional law I know that there is joint responsibility in cabinet and in this case, of course, it is the constitution which decrees that: This is the vote I got then we have so many portfolios in cabinet -- so then, of course we have different parties, actually, I mean the National Party, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC -- have different policies, but of course on the Reconstruction and Development -- I mean, we have no problems with that because on the face of it there is nothing wrong. I think every government would like to do all those things for its people, so it's almost [word indistinct] really, since it's a question of the wherewithal, where the money's going to come from. [Taylor] Are you happy with the amount of portfolios you got, and specifically yours? [Buthelezi] I was not even keen to go into cabinet myself. In fact the caucus had to push me to go into it because of the problem I have just outlined to you. [Taylor] Are you not happy with the number of portfolios you got? [Buthelezi] No, I mean, I did not even expect...I did not even expect that. I have stated before elections that our (?part) is in opposition politics, but the constitution decrees otherwise. [Taylor] And your role with President Nelson Mandela -- do you see that as a smooth one or a rough ride from here on? [Buthelezi] Well, you know, Dr. Mandela and myself have been friends for nearly 60 years now and on the face of it we get on very well, as friends, as former colleagues, and so on, but of course our parties now and then are in conflict you see. For instance, I mean, the parties -- people down there may be more in conflict than he and I are in conflict. [Taylor] There is the problem with the Natal-KwaZulu -- the ANC says that it is not happy with its portfolios that it's got or the amount of portfolios. It would have liked to have joint control over things like defense, police, and stuff like that. [Buthelezi] Only one person can hold a portfolio for the services, you know, only one person and Dr. Mdlalose has decided to nominate such a person and I say, as I said yesterday, that inasmuch as the state president, Mr. Mandela, had offered me Health, but decided to...the following morning to take it away from me, I never ran to the press to complain about that because that wasn't my prerogative, so in the same way it is the prerogative of Dr. Mdlalose to nominate the members of cabinet.
