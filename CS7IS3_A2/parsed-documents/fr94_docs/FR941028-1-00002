FR941028-1-00002 FR941028-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;120&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747SP Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747SP series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections for cracks in the web of the wing front spar over engine numbers 2 and 3, and repair, if necessary. This action would require additional inspections in an area beyond that specified in the existing AD. This action also would provide for a new, optional terminating modification, which, if accomplished, would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposal is prompted by a report of cracking in the web in an area outside the inspection zone specified in the existing AD. A crack in the web that is not detected before it extends outside the chord footprints can allow fuel leakage. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire due to cracking in the web of the wing front spar. DATES: Comments must be received by December 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;120&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
