FR941230-0-00050 FR941230-0-00009 Regulatory Evaluation This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this final rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard must consider whether this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.(32)(e) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
