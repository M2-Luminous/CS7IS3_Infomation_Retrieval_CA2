An informed government source said Charan made his views known during a visit by the Australian secretary for foreign affairs about two weeks ago. The source quoted Charan as saying that providing arms is not the best way to achieve a lasting peace in Cambodia. Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk recently called for foreign military aid, saying it was the only way the end the war with the Khmer Rouge, and named Australia, France and the United States as likely providers. Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said yesterday that Canberra considered it "wholly legitimate, and consistent with the Paris Peace Accords, for the Cambodian government to seek such assistance from the international community in order to maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity". He said Australia is considering Cambodia's request for weapons but will consult and take into account the views of other interested countries, including Thailand. Charan also expressed concern that the poorly-paid and ill- disciplined Cambodian troops will eventually sell off the foreign arms. Sarot Chawanawirat, deputy permanent secretary for foreign affairs, said the Cambodian government was entitled to seek help, but Thailand believed that providing arms to Cambodia would only prolong the fighting there.
