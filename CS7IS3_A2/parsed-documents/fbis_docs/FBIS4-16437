Addressing a congress of the Union of Officers on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy warned about "the danger for those who are in favor of the restoration of the Soviet Union if they support the initiative of President Nursultan Nazarbayev." A community of states "with the same people -- Nazarbayev (Uzbekistan President Islam) Karimov, (Georgian leader Eduard) Shevardnadze, (Moldovan President Mircea) Snegur, and others - staying in their offices would be the worst that could happen," "a trap for many years, from which it would be difficult to break out," he said. A "single union state" should be based on the territorial unification of the former Soviet republics, the merger of their armed forces, security services and financial systems, and uniform citizenship, Zhirinovskiy said. Meanwhile, "Russians living in regions where temporarily somebody else's flag is flying, have the right to self-determination," he said.
