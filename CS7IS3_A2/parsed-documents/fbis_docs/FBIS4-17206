Aleksandr Znamenskiy is at the microphone. [Znamenskiy] On 20 April Turkish National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan arrived in Moscow on an official visit, and immediately held talks with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. [passage omitted] During the talks Army General Pavel Grachev also touched on the question of Russian military bases in the countries of the CIS. Here is what he said to his Turkish colleague. [Begin Grachev recording] We are going over to the stationing of bases [bazovoye razmeshcheniye] of our troops on other states' territories. We already have accord of this kind from Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. In Georgia we are planning to set up three bases, in Armenia one base [as heard], and in Azerbaijan not so much a base as a military facility in Gaballa, which is a necessary (?post) not only for Russia but for all states desiring peace -- it is a ballistic missile early warning facility. In order for this to be formalized legislatively, all that is needed now is political decisions by the leadership of our country and a legislative base from our legislators. [end recording] [Znamenskiy] It remains to be added that Russia's military presence in Commonwealth states should not be regarded as a display of Russia's imperial ambitions. It serves the interests of peace.
