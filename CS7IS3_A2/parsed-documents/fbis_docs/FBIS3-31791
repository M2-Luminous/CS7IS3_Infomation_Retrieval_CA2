"If the Russians can come, then why should not the Turks also come," Izetbegovic said in the Vrijeme Ratno program of the Moslem television in Sarajevo. Four hundred Russian peace-keeping troops have been in the Sarajevo area since Sunday. The Russian peace-keepers came on the basis of an agreement between Bosnian Serbs and Moscow in order to secure ceasefire following the withdrawal of heavy artillery of the Bosnian Serb republic agreed on February 9 with UNPROFOR and the Moslem side. Commenting the arrival of the Russian peace-keepers, Izetbegovic said he "trusts them as much as he does (trust) UNPROFOR." Izetbegovic said the Moslems have accepted the arrangement for Sarajevo because it "has already been agreed it (Sarajevo) will be placed under U.N. administration" and that this formula will be applied to Mostar, the site of Moslem-Croat fighting in southwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to him, the Moslem government will, when other towns are concerned, "think twice whether it will accept the formula since it could freeze the actual situation in the field."
