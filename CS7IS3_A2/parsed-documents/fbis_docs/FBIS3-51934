The protest outside government headquarters coincided with the start of a new parliamentary session at which members of the National Assembly, chosen in inconclusive general elections last November 29, took their oaths of office. Eyewitnesses said there were loud explosions as police fired stun grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the ceremony for the exit of Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, Prime Minister Dr Kennedy Simmonds and other officials. One of the two persons taken to hospital for treatment, had head wounds after reportedly being struck with a baton by a police officer.
