Silajdzic, who arrived in Moscow this morning from France, held two hours of talks with Kozyrev. Calling the talks "fruitful," the Russian foreign minister said, "an encouraging progress emerged in the recent past in settling the bosnian crisis in several spheres." "It is important now not to lose and to develop the positive impetus and to try to consolidate it," Kozyrev stressed, summing up the results of his talks with Silajdzic. Silajdzic, in turn, expressed his satisfaction with the results of the talks, noting that "prerequisites have emerged in the recent past to settle the Bosnian conflict." "This moment must not be lost," the prime minister stressed. He said the Russian side can play a constructive role in promoting the talks on Bosnia, stating he favored "a more balanced policy for Russia on some aspects of the Yugoslav crisis." In February, Russia's "go-between" efforts resulted in relaxing the air strikes crisis over Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We hope that Russian battalion stationed around Sarajevo will play a positive role and will help preserve Sarajevo as a multinational city," Silajdzic said. Turning to the achieved understanding on the formation of a Croatia-Muslim confederation, he stressed that its implementation is impossible without Serbs' agreement. Bosnian Serbs leader Radovan Karadzic visited Moscow last week. His talks with Russian leaders resulted at least in a major accord on opening the Tuzla airport provided Russian observers are sent here. The Bosnian prime minister also stressed, "we shall have a new version but all the same it will be based on the main thing -- territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina." Later today, Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who also is deputy prime minister of the Croatian Government, is due to arrive in Moscow for talks on Bosnian settlement.
