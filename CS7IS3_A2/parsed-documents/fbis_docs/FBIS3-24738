W. de Klerk that the security situation in the country is extremely dangerous, and that right-wing groups in particular could launch large-scale violence or even an attempted coup at any moment. They warned that if this happened, a considerable number of defense force officers and servicemen would possibly not remain loyal to the government, but would actively support the dissidents instead. Security sources indicated to RAPPORT a figure of "60 percent or even higher." Regarding the loyalty of the SADF should they be called on to take action against the right wing, reference was made to General Constand Viljoen, who this week was quoted as saying on a radio program: "A government would have a tough time scraping together enough SADF members to take action against right-wingers." The government apparently views the general staff's information in a serious light, and the details are being carefully studied. Defense force observers say the general staff would not confront the government with an "own agenda." They are simply presenting the state president with a factual report on the situation in the country. There is no talk of a widening gap between the general staff and the government, but the government realizes that when a warning comes from this quarter, it must be taken seriously. RAPPORT was told that the warning could indicate possible crises before the election at the end of April. Experts believe that it could not have been easy for the general staff to inform the government of their observations, in view of the suspicion surrounding the defense force following the Goldstone Commission's raid on a section of military intelligence. They would also have wanted to ensure that they conveyed their information in good time. A minister remarked to RAPPORT that "this information is so shocking one can hardly believe it." But he added that he personally had believed for some months that "something like this is possible." Another minister says bluntly: "I do not believe the information." The warning by the general staff tallies with the exclusive information RAPPORT published last week: that fully equipped and trained right-wing groups are ready to resort to military protest. When RAPPORT asked whether it is true that officers on whose loyalty the government cannot count might be detained before the election -- a possibility which is not mentioned in the submission by the general staff -- no one could give a firm answer. The fears of internment were raised this week in right-wing circles as well as in the security community. Right-wingers say it is odd that several police investigations are under way against suspected far-right activists, yet no arrests are taking place. They believe that the police will launch large-scale strikes against suspects at an opportune moment -- on the strength of piles of dossiers -- to prevent a possible take-over by violent means. Security sources also fear that action will be taken against dissident serving members of the defense force and retired SADF members who over the years were involved in underground intelligence structures against the African National Congress, such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau, the Division of Covert Intelligence, Military Intelligence, Koevoet [police counterinsurgency unit] and the Askaris [former ANC guerrillas] of Vlakplaas. Last week RAPPORT reported that underground right-wing military plans have found support within the security community. On the day the report appeared two helicopters, a Dakota aircraft, and even troops were sent to Beestekraal near Brits to search for the weapons caches referred to by RAPPORT. On Monday morning three trucks with black troops arrived in the area from Pretoria to help in the search. This caused great tension among right-wing farmers. It was confirmed to RAPPORT that after an exchange of harsh words between farmers' leaders and the defense force, it was agreed that black troops would not be deployed in the area again. Meanwhile RAPPORT's report of last Sunday has sent shock waves through far-right underground planning structures. A "tongue lashing" over the leak was delivered "from the top." It also appears that several police generals in Pretoria were caught unawares by the report. Urgent meetings were called in the capital on Sunday night, and members of the Criminal Information Service -- the old security branch -- were summoned from Brits area to report on the situation. It has also been reliably learned that the planned take-over of police stations by the far-right is causing deep concern to the South African Police General Staff. The report was high on the agenda the whole week at police headquarters, Wachthuis. Further investigation by RAPPORT indicated that only about two commando units in the western Transvaal are not controlled by right-wing structures. The far-right has also gained effective control over the commandos and their arsenals in almost the whole of rural Orange Free State, northern Natal, far northern, northern, and southern Transvaal. Everywhere so-called area protection units have affiliated with the commandos and will therefore be eligible to receive defense force weapons. White Wolf Barend Strydom's wife Karin, his mother-in-law Trudy, and his father-in-law have apparently all been issued with semi- automatic weapons. They live near Hartbeespoort Dam in the Brits area. A very nervous source, rifle in hand, told RAPPORT: -- There are four experts in the Brits area trained in the preparation of cyanide bullets. "These people also have pipes [probably anti-tank equipment] with which to take out tanks and armored vehicles." -- A raid had been planned for last Sunday on the police base at Rosslyn outside Pretoria to get hold of more weapons. The target was described in detail to RAPPORT. An expert at opening door and safe locks, and whose name and address have been given to RAPPORT, has allegedly been involved in several incidents to date where he had to open locks to enable members of the underground structures to steal weapons and equipment. -- The recent spate of bomb attacks on power and railway lines without the loss of life must be seen as part of an armed propaganda campaign which serves as a prelude to what lies ahead. The fact that no trains loaded with black commuters have so far been blown up is ascribed to the fact that the far-right saboteurs do not wish to cause any harm to Zulus who might be on the trains.
