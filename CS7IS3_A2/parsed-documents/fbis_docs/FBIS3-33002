FBIS3-33002 "drlat033bb_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS OAS Asserts Development Must Be Decided by Each State PA1702042494 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2103 GMT 14 Feb 94 PA1702042494 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The OAS asserted today that development models must result from the decisions and efforts of each state within a favorable foreign context and with the support of renewed international cooperation. "They must not be imposed from abroad or based on a sole paradigm," the OAS asserted in a preliminary document for the "Inter-American Cooperation for Development" meeting that will be inaugurated here next Thursday. The OAS stated that, for this reason, it is necessary to generate a new concept and form of cooperation solidarity for development within the organization; one that will allow it to overcome problems and respond to current situations more effectively. Two documents were prepared for the meeting, which will be attended by foreign ministers and representatives of the 34 OAS member states and will end on Saturday. The documents will be the center of the Special OAS General Assembly deliberations. The first document is an attempt to reach "agreements on strategies and systems that will further the achievement of integrated development, the struggle against extreme poverty, and the improvement of the basic levels of social and economic well-being in the hemisphere." The document emphasizes that "it is first necessary to strengthen the role of the OAS as a forum for inter-American dialogue as this will enable it to promote the development of the member states." It observes that activities should be geared to those areas in which the organization has comparative advantages, meaning where it can complement the actions of other organizations to boost the development of its member states. To further this end, -- the document asserts -- special attention will be given to efforts to coordinate development financing; to foster the creation of productive jobs; and to propitiate economic integration, commercial opening, and access to markets. Attention will also be given to the fight against the use, production, and trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as related crimes. The preservation, enrichment, and transmission of the countries' cultural identities and languages will also be furthered, as well as public administration strengthened. The second document, which is called "Commitment To Promote Cooperation Solidarity and To Overcome Poverty," notes the effects of the economic crisis that jeopardized most of the countries in the region during the past decade. In this sense, the second document highlights the reforms made by the OAS to eliminate extreme poverty and foster integrated development in its member states. For example, the OAS created the Inter-American Council for Integrated Development that is aimed at promoting cooperation solidarity for development. An OAS report indicates that democracy "has been revitalized" on the American continent as, perhaps, nowhere else in the world. The report on OAS activities, which was published in the OAS TODAY magazine, observes that representative democracy is the rule in the countries of the region. It highlights that many of the democratic changes experienced on the continent occurred prior to those that took place in Central and Eastern Europe. The report estimates that governments elected by the people have substituted de facto leaders in several countries and that other nations have gradually strengthened their democratic structures and institutions. It highlights the OAS commitment to the modernization of economic structures and to the achievement of social justice and adds that making democracy a sustainable system is "an essential task" at the OAS.
