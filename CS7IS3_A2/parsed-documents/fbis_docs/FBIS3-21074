The project's history in this area which, according to experts, is most favorable for wind energy exploitation, began three years ago with the operation of the first experimental 300-kw wind turbine, the result of joint efforts of the Timisoara Technical University faculty staff, the researchers and designers of the Specializing Institute in Timisoara, and the machine builders in Bocsa. Recently, a second such power unit has just passed into the final installation phase, to be followed by two more units which are presently being built and tested in the Bocsa plant and the Timisoara workshops respectively. These four experimental 300 kw "EOLTIM"-type turbines will constitute the first pilote wind power station in our country. The next phase in wind energy exploitation, considered presently to be the cheapest form in the world, is the installation of 100 turbines of this type, and in the more distant future--according to experts participating recently in an international symposium on the subject--the constructing of a 900-kw power station: a true record in the field.
