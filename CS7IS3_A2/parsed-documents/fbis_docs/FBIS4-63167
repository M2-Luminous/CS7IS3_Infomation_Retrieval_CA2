The true opposition is being formed in the Russian State Duma, presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told reporters on Thursday. "The irreconcilable opposition is very small and is of marginal character. These forces are a byproduct of political life, have no social support and resort to harsh language because of that", Kostikov said, but added that this does not mean that Yeltsin sees no danger of political extremism. Yeltsin believes that "the true opposition is currently being formed in the State Duma which is a normal phenomenon", according to Kostikov. The president is ready to hold discussions with it, but if the Duma encroaches on his powers the "attempts will be cut short", the spokesman warned. Yeltsin believes that relations with Duma have a favourable character in general, but regrets that the lower chamber has spent much time discussing its privileges rather than lawbills. There are "elements inherited from the tactics of the former Supreme Soviet which consisted in unlimited expansion of functions of deputies and of the legislative body", Kostikov said and added that at present "the State Duma is cautiously intervening into the powers of the executive authority". The president has so far quietly reacted to that and sent a letter to the Duma with his remarks. Yeltsin believes that the situation has become more stable in the country after the signing of the civic accord treaty. "Political forces which stand for accord are undoubtedly dominating the forces of confrontation and political revenge", Kostikov said.
