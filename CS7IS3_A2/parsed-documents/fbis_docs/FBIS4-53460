Japanese petrochemical companies are performing well in their competition with foreign products with the import ratio staying at a low 9.0 percent in fiscal 1993, the Petrochemical Supply and Demand Coordination Council, an advisory body to the trade minister, said in a report. The council said this reflects better services provided by the domestic industry in nonprice fronts, such as better quality products, well-organized after-sales services and better distribution-related services. But it added maintenance of such services, often made at the expense of a product price increase, has put a heavy financial burden on Japanese petrochemical firms, making their business operations less profitable. In order to keep price competitiveness while providing the same services, the industry needs to curtail costs in production, sales, and research and development, the council said. The task, however, is impossible unless the Japanese petrochemical industry goes through comprehensive structural reforms, including formation of joint sales and manufacturing companies and the industry's overall reorganization through mergers and acquisitions, for efficient business operations, it said. The report calls for a drastic review of Japanese petrochemical firms' export strategy in which they tend to offer products at bargain prices abroad simply to maintain factory utilization rates.
