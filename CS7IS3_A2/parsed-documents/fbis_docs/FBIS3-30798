Accepting full responsibility for every word in the letter, Karadzic emphasizes that an explosion in which few people were killed and injured took place at the market, while everything else surrounding this incident was stage-managed. There were very few goods in the market, and those were in only a few stalls. Eyewitnesses did not observe over 300 people at the market directly prior to the explosion, but only a handful. It would not even be logical for more than 300 people to be present at a small market that was lacking in goods. Karadzic also pointed to a very indicative fact: The Muslim side rejected an investigation that would be carried out by the UN experts with the participation of Serbian and Muslim experts. Interviews with survivors, as well as pathological findings on the causes and times of deaths, would have revealed the entire fake. Namely, all the witnesses, even the Muslims in the Muslim media, have stated that this was an unusual bomb because the characteristic whistling noise was not heard prior to the explosion. Karadzic, among other things, warns that the television footage clearly shows that manipulation with bodies has taken place in this tragedy. As he says, in the footage one can see the bodies of casualties who had died hours earlier as well as plastic body parts. We must not allow, Karadzic says, that one warring side would deceive the entire international community, including the most important forces -- the United States and Russia, and their presidents -- and lead them to false conclusions. This is a great shame, he says. Karadzic appealed to Clinton and Yeltsin: We beg you to discover the real truth by all means available to your powerful countries.
