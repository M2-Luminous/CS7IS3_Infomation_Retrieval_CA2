According to a statement by Vladimir Solomin, chairman of the company's strike committee, an exception has only been made with regard to the petrochemical workers of Angarsk, who have fully settled their accounts for the output received. The remaining consumers situated in the region are considered to be debtors, as are those in neighboring Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays. According to a statement by General Director Ivan Shchadov, Vostsibugol is the largest mining company in Russia today, which is capable of producing 32 million tonnes of fuel annually, but on one condition, that it receives its wages on time. At the moment the debts to the miners amount to 170 billion rubles, and they are prepared to make their actions open-ended. The administration of Irkutsk Oblast, where the main enterprises of the joint stock company are situated, considers the action of the miners to be illegal and has demanded the dispatch of coal to consumers.
