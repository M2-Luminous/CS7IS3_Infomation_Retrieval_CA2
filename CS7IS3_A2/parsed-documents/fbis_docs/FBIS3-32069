In confirming the release, the Chiapas government explained in a communique that the measure has no relation to the Amnesty Law decreed a few days ago by the state and federal governments, "which was implemented at a different time and under different procedures." The Indians, who were held prisoner at a jail in Cerro Hueco, near Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, faced charges for criminal association for their alleged links with the armed rebellion that broke out in the state on 1 January. During a recent visit to the jail, members of Amnesty International interviewed approximately 70 prisoners. Most of them said they were held incommunicado and that they had been tortured to force them to confess their participation in the EZLN rebellion. They also claimed that they received no medical attention. Several journalists who were allowed to visit the Cerro Hueco jail for the first time last Wednesday to interview the presumed guerrillas said they heard the same testimonies. The detainees showed reporters the marks left by the blows they received from the soldiers and said they spent between four and seven days without receiving any food. They were also blindfolded and had their hands and feet tied. All of the prisoners who were interviewed denied belonging to the EZLN.
