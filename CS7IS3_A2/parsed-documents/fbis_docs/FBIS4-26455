FBIS4-26455 "drchi120_d_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Northeast Asia Japan Denies Capability To Produce Nuclear Weapons Japan Denies Capability To Produce Nuclear Weapons OW2106115794 Beijing XINHUA in English 1149 GMT 21 Jun 94 OW2106115794 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Japan today denied that it is capable of producing nuclear weapons, saying the nation "does not have any expertise or experience in producing nuclear weapons." "Japan has highly advanced technology for the peaceful use of nuclear energy," however, mere possession of high-level nuclear technology and scientific technology does not amount to production ability, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada told a regular press conference. Terada's denial of Japan's nuclear potential came days after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata acknowledged that Japan has the capability to produce nuclear arms but said it has not done so in line with its international treaty obligations. "It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," Hata told Japanese reporters inside the Diet building last Friday. Terada said Japan's nuclear power activities are restricted to peaceful purpose by the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the atomic energy basic law and others. As the only country that suffered from atomic bombing, Japan strictly upholds a so-called three no's principle -- no possession, no manufacturing and no introduction of nuclear weapons, he said.
