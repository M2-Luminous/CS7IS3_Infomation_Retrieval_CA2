This was declared by Minister [of Control] Igor Nemec yesterday. THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote on Sunday [20 March] that the RFE was expected to reach an agreement with Soros within one month about the privatization of its research center and archives and their relocation from Munich to Prague. The government is determined to finance the operation of the currently unoccupied building of the Federal Assembly until the end of this month. Should RFE move into the building, it ought to finance the operation of the building as of April. The building is to be leased to it for only a symbolic sum. Should Soros become involved in the radio as an investor, however, the Czech Government would have no reason, according to Nemec, not to lease the Federal Assembly building to someone else at a market price. "There are hundreds of interested parties," Nemec said.
