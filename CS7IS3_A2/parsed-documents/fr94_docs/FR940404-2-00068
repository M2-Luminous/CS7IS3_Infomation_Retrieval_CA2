FR940404-2-00068 FR940404-2-00047 The Daiwa Bank, Limited; Application To Engage in Certain Nonbanking Activities The Daiwa Bank, Limited, Osaka, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), to engage de novo through Cosmo Securities (America) Inc., New York, New York (Company), in the following nonbanking activities: 1. Providing discount and full service securities brokerage services pursuant to 225.25(b)(15)(i) and (ii) of Regulation Y; and 2. Purchasing and selling all types of securities as a riskless principal on the order of customers where Company may retain a position in the securities for up to seven days. Applicant seeks approval to conduct the proposed activities throughout the United States and the world. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). The Board previously has determined by regulation that full service brokerage activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(15). In addition, the Board previously has determined by order that riskless principal activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its previous orders, are closely related to banking. See, e.g., J.P. Morgan & Company Inc., 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990); Bankers Trust New York Corporation, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989). In addition, the Board has modified certain conditions contained in these orders for foreign banking organizations to address certain issues raised by an organization's foreign status and to avoid extending U.S. bank supervisory standards to foreign banks. See, e.g., The Royal Bank of Canada, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 272 (1991); Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, et al., 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 158 (1990). Applicant maintains that Company will conduct the proposed activities in conformity with the conditions and limitations established by the Board by regulation or in prior cases, except that Company, in conducting its riskless principal activities, proposes to retain a position in securities for a period of up to seven days in the event that Company is unable to execute a customer's order in full in a single transaction. Riskless principal refers to a transaction in which a broker-dealer, after receiving an order to buy (or sell) a security from a customer, purchases (or sells) the security for its own account to offset a contemporaneous sale to (or purchase from) the customer. See 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin at 831. Applicant does not believe that the offsetting transactions need to occur on the same day in order to be contemporaneous. Rather, Applicant believes that a purchase or sale should be regarded as contemporaneous if it occurs promptly following the time it reasonably takes to complete the offsetting transaction. Furthermore, Applicant believes that the absence of market risk (as opposed to customer credit risk) is the key element in riskless principal transactions. Applicant states that Company will have a binding contractual commitment by its customer to buy or sell a given security before Company effects the offsetting transaction as a principal. Applicant does not believe that a time lapse between the two sides of the transaction creates a market risk for Company. In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition. Applicant also believes that approval of this application will allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience to its customers. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than April 29, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 29, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7944 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210-01-F
