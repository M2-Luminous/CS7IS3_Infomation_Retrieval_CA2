He briefed them on the latest developments in the situation on the national, political, and military fronts. He also briefed them on the efforts that have been exerted on the foreign level and the nature of the talks that have been held with Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general. The brother president explained that from the outset, our country stressed its abidance by UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 and its full readiness to implement it. He added that our country proposed five cease-fire initiatives to stop Yemeni bloodshed and to give those who have been misled a chance to join the ranks of unity and legitimacy. The brother president said the leaders of rebellion and secession insisted on (?rejecting) all initiatives because the UN Security Council resolution did not serve their inhuman and anti-unity objectives. They continued to violate the cease-fire and to escalate the military situation in order to prolong the war and internationalize the Yemeni issue. The brother president praised the political parties and organizations for their principled stand on the challenges facing national unity at this delicate phase in the history of the homeland. He also praised their commitment to national issues. He said that the challenges facing the homeland have proven the credibility of the people's national stands and cohesion as they confront the enemies of the homeland, unity, and democracy. He stressed that our country will continue to adhere to the option of unity and democracy as an irreversible option to build a modern Yemen based on the principles of political and party pluralism, economic freedom, the freedom of expression, respect for human rights, developed local government, and progress and comprehensive development throughout Yemen. The brother president indicated that the next phase requires cooperation and cohesion among our people to rebuild what the treasonous, rebellious gang has destroyed in all fields, starting with supporting the families of the martyrs' and victims in all governorates.
