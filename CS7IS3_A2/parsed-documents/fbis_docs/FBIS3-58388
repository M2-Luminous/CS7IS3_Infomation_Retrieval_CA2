However, in the face of all the various conflicts around the world, he notes "a certain fatigue within the international community." Yesterday, in an exclusive interview with LE FIGARO, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expressed his satisfaction with the conclusions of the NATO summit regarding Bosnia. Visiting Paris, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, who had just held talks with Defense Minister Francois Leotard, thanked France "for contributing so much to the UN peacekeeping forces." France, with 8,000 men in the former Yugoslavia, is the country which has deployed the largest contingent of UN troops. [LE FIGARO] NATO has just renewed its threat of air strikes in Bosnia. Are these constant threats of intervention in Bosnia by all the international institutions not becoming rather laughable? [Butrus-Ghali] I carefully read the NATO press release before answering your questions, and I think that, to be fair, there is a change of attitude on the part of the states involved, and that there is a genuine political will to take action. Consequently, I am rather optimistic. People are now demanding specifically that ways be found to open the airfield at Tuzla and ensure the rotation [of UN peacekeeping troops] in Srebrenica. [LE FIGARO] With what in mind? NATO has always said that; everyone has always said that. The ball is being passed around between Europe and the United States, with one or the other not wishing to intervene, explaining that this is due to the other.... The United States is calling for air strikes, while Europe is talking rather of intervention on the ground.... The whole thing will take months to decide. [Butrus-Ghali] No, I am telling you. My commentary is based solely on the press release. Compared with other press releases, this press release is, to my mind, more positive, and expresses a political will to take action. [LE FIGARO] What about the UN troops in the event of air strikes? What will you do with them? [Butrus-Ghali] Should we ever have air strikes, they will be decided by the political authority, and we will have to accept the risks involved. [LE FIGARO] Will the UN troops have to be withdrawn at that moment? [Butrus-Ghali] No, not necessarily. The air strikes would be specifically targeted, occurring only in certain places. [LE FIGARO] If the time comes, who will make the decision? Do you have the power to do so by invoking the resolutions already adopted by the UN Security Council? [Butrus-Ghali] It is the political authority that must decide. I was given a mandate, but I also need a request by my special representative for the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Yasushi Akashi [name as published], who will himself have heard the views and opinions of the military leaders on the ground, of the co-chairman of the steering committee of the International Conference on Yugoslavia, Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg, and of those in charge of the humanitarian action. [LE FIGARO] These men being your representatives? [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly. And in the event of a positive verdict, I shall not hesitate to use air strikes to contribute to the restoration of peace. [LE FIGARO] Using whose air force? [Butrus-Ghali] In principle, NATO's. However, I have no authority over NATO. If NATO decides not to use force, then I will be powerless to oblige them. [LE FIGARO] When you say that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] has to look into how Tuzla airport could be opened, is this not another way of putting things off, because surely all the necessary studies have been made since we have been talking about Tuzla and Srebrenica as safe areas? [Butrus-Ghali] We have not managed to implement this decision because we did not receive the 8,000 soldiers necessary. This decision was adopted in May. Now it is January, and we have only had about 1,000 more soldiers, who were sent by France. We need another 7,000 troops and are still negotiating with the states concerned with a view to obtaining these soldiers. It is a case of a physical impossibility. According to our military experts, we would need 8,000 more soldiers to take care of these safe areas, this being a minimum number, for we could also do with more men. [LE FIGARO] Do you lack the soldiers to relieve those in Srebrenica and open Tuzla airport? [Butrus-Ghali] There, we are envisioning an air strike. I cannot go into details on the basis of the press release. I will be meeting with all my specialists and with representatives of the military in Geneva either today or tomorrow with a view to seeing exactly what we can do. [LE FIGARO] The problem with these threats by the international community is that the Serbs do not believe them. They feel that we are acting in this way to make ourselves feel better and ease our conscience. All the international institutions, starting with NATO, are being accused of hypocrisy. [Butrus-Ghali] The only comment I can make, having followed these debates and been in contact with the responsible individuals here in France -- and tomorrow, in Geneva, I shall continue my contacts with the people in charge -- is that there is a new political will to take action. [LE FIGARO] Do you sense that the French, for example, are determined to see this thing through to the end? [Butrus-Ghali] Do not make me say such things. See this thing through to the end? No. However, I am saying that there is a new political will and, reading the NATO press release, my impression is it contains something new. There is a new political will, because something has to be done, although it has taken us too long to reach this stage. Transition [LE FIGARO] When you talk of air strikes, which you appear to think might be a possibility in Tuzla or Srebrenica, what does that mean? Does it mean that UN people are going to say to the Serbs: "Let us into this airport or let us relieve the forces in Srebrenica? If you do not do so within such-and-such period of time, then we will send in the air force." Is that what it means? [Butrus-Ghali] I do not know. I have no idea about that. I cannot make any further comment. [LE FIGARO] What does "air strike" mean? Technically speaking, within what time frame? [Butrus-Ghali] I have no idea. The only thing I can tell you is that I think a new political will was expressed in Brussels at a conference which ended one hour ago. How will this be applied in practice? What difficulties will arise? I cannot say. I must first consult the technicians. [LE FIGARO] Is what is at stake in Bosnia, like in Somalia, not the very principle of what is called the humanitarian war? [Butrus-Ghali] No, I think that the real problem, in both Somalia and Bosnia, is that the states involved are not ready to send the necessary troops, that they are not ready to allocate the financial resources required for these operations, and that there is a certain fatigue dogging the international community as a result of being faced with these various conflicts. [LE FIGARO] Something about the system of organizing UN troops is tainted, namely that people are being sent to the firing line without being authorized to fire a shot. [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be realistic. There is absolutely no point in my talking of shifting up a gear when I realize that the states concerned do not want to do so. It is a question of not throwing ideas around if it will mean you losing your credibility.... [LE FIGARO] Are we very far away from having a world government? [Butrus-Ghali] I am entirely in favor of having one, but we are very far from achieving this. Moreover, I do not even know if it is in the interest of the international community to have a world government. I would present the problem from a different angle: In 1815 there was the Congress of Vienna; in 1919 the Treaty of Versailles; in 1945, San Francisco, and even Luxembourg. And then...when the Cold War ended, there was no international conference. So we are making no progress. We are going through a difficult time, a period of transition. [LE FIGARO] That is a reproach. Do you really think that an international conference should have been held after the Berlin Wall came down? [Butrus-Ghali] I am merely saying that this is complicating the situation. The transition period will last longer because we do not know what the new standards are, what the new system is, or the new balance of power. What role do the states concerned want to confer on the United Nations in this new, post-Cold War system? My conclusion after serving two years as the UN secretary general is that the states have not yet reached a decision on this subject. Why? Because they themselves do not know what the new balance of power is, nor what new system should govern international relations. That is where we are for now.
