In politics, this "agility" has enabled him to slide from one ideology to another without losing face -- or not too much, at least. The Ukrainian Houdini has elevated the quick-change act to an art: Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee until 1991, he did not say a word in defense of Gorbachev during the time of the attempted "August coup"; but after the coup failed he sided with the Ukrainian independence movement and was elected president by a landslide vote a few months later . Now he is seeking reelection by flirting with the communists (he appointed one of them prime minister), but he is also wooing the moderate nationalists. A man for all seasons who has the good fortune always to appear like the "lesser evil," helped by the absence of worthy alternative candidates and by an unscrupulous exploitation of power. [Franceschini] During your two-and-a-half years as president Ukraine has plummeted into an abyss. Do you not feel responsible? [Kravchuk] I disagree. Only those who do nothing make no mistakes. We have made some, but we have also done a great deal -- building from nothing an independent state, without wars or disasters, with democratic structures and its own Armed Forces, earning the respect of the international community. The worst is over. We have a long way to go, but we are on course, and in two or three years' time everything will be resolved. [Franceschini] Are you in favor of forming a Slavic confederation between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as some people have been suggesting recently? [Kravchuk] It is a dangerous idea. It could spark a tide of pan-Slavism and nationalism from Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan, in all the countries where millions of Slavs live. It is impossible to create unions on the basis of the ethnic-national principle. But we do want to have good relations with Russia, especially in the economic field. [Franceschini] Crimea and East Ukraine, where 10 million Russians live, are pressing to return to Russia's orbit. Could this prompt a conflict between Moscow and Kiev? [Kravchuk] Russia and Ukraine have lived together for 350 years, have never taken up arms against each other, and will never do so. To resolve the issue of Crimea's autonomy we will not resort to force under any circumstances. We are in favor of a peaceful solution of the problem, and I think we are moving in this direction. [Franceschini] Will Ukraine sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and thus pledge to consign its arsenal to Russia? [Kravchuk] With me as president, the treaty will be immediately submitted to Parliament for ratification as soon as possible. It is an essential duty that we have taken on with respect to the international community.
