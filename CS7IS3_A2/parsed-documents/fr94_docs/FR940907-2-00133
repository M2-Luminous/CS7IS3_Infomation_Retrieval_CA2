FR940907-2-00133 FR940907-2-00092 In addition, several regulations issued pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), 7 the Exchange Act, 8 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') 9 have incorporated the term ``NRSRO'' as it is used in the net capital rule. For example, the Commission employs NRSRO ratings as a basis for distinguishing between certain types of securities that may be issued using simplified registration procedures under the Securities Act. 10 NRSRO ratings also are employed in connection with investment restrictions applicable to money market funds. Rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act requires a money market fund to limit its investments to securities that are ``Eligible Securities,'' 11 which, among other things, are securities rated in one of the two highest rating categories for short-term debt by the requisite number of NRSROs. 7 See, e.g., Regulation S&hyph;K (17 CFR 229.10); Rule 436 (17 CFR 230.436); Form S&hyph;3 (17 CFR 239.13); Forms F&hyph;2 and F&hyph;3 (17 CFR 239.32, 239.33). 8 See, e.g., Rule 10b&hyph;6 (17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6). See also Form 17&hyph;H (17 CFR 249.328T). 9 See, e.g., Rule 2a&hyph;7 (17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7); Rule 10f&hyph;3 (17 CFR 270.10f&hyph;3); Rule 3a&hyph;7 (17 CFR 270.3a&hyph;7). Cf. Investment Company Act Release No. 19716, 58 FR 49425 (Sept. 23, 1993) (amending Rule 12d3&hyph;1 by, among other things, dropping the requirement that investment companies limit their purchases of debt securities issued by securities-related businesses to those that are investment grade). 10 See Adoption of Integrated Disclosure System, Securities Act Release No. 6383 (Mar. 16, 1982). Adoption of Simplification of Registration Procedures for Primary Securities Offerings, Securities Act Release No. 6964 (Oct. 22, 1992). 11 See 17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7. Rule 3a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act, which exempts certain structured financing from registering under and complying with the Investment Company Act, also utilizes the ratings of NRSROs. 12 Under paragraph (2)(a) of Rule 3a&hyph;7, an issuer of fixed income securities that are rated in one of the four highest categories by at least one NRSRO is deemed not to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In adopting the rule, the Commission recognized that rating agencies had been ``successful in analyzing the structural integrity of financing *␣*␣* [and] appear to have been a major factor in investor acceptance of structured financing.'' 13 12 Exclusion from the Definition of Investment Company for Structured Financing, Investment Company Act Release No. 19105 (November 19, 1992), 52 SEC Dkt. 4014. 13 Id. at 4028. In proposing Rule 3a&hyph;7, the Commission requested specific comment on whether a rating requirement was necessary and, if not, on what alternative bases the Commission should exclude structured financing from the Investment Company Act. The Commission also requested comment on whether rating agencies should be subject to additional regulatory requirements. Those commentators who specifically addressed the issue registered strong support for use of NRSRO ratings in the structured financing context. The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. and the Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') opposed reliance on NRSRO ratings in this context. Of the commentators addressing additional regulatory requirements for rating agencies generally, a large majority opposed Commission regulation of rating agencies, whereas several others argued that questions of regulatory oversight should be addressed separately from the merits of the proposed rule. The ICI was the only commentator supporting additional government oversight. Finally, Rule 10b&hyph;6 under the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons participating in a distribution of securities from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate the distribution, employs an NRSRO concept as well. Generally, Rule 10b&hyph;6 exempts certain transactions in nonconvertible debt and nonconvertible preferred securities from its coverage if the securities, among other things, are rated investment grade by at least one NRSRO. 14 14 See 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6(a)(4)(xiii). In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System uses the term ``NRSRO'' in Regulation T. See 12 CFR Part 220.
