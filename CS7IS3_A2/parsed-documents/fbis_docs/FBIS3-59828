These observers believe that the al-Ghubayri demonstration, along with the regrettable and unjustifiable loss of life, which accompanied it, was not the cause of the confrontational posture, which Hizballah and all those who move in its circles assumed. It was rather a product of that confrontational posture, which all those who have been working with Hizballah and those who have been striving to run it also assumed. [These incidents] show, as the observers add, that grief or anger over the loss of life was not the essence of the problem for those who "burned their bridges." Nor was their attitude toward the 'Arafat-Israeli agreement the essence of the problem or the reason for the sharp and hard-line positions that were taken and expressed in the rhetoric of the previous hateful war. The people who took those positions were trying to throw the country once again into the gloom of internecine fighting and divisiveness. The essence of the problem, which uses the blood of victims as its slogan, has to do with feelings of dread about the countdown phase. Hizballah leaders fear that this phase might have started and that its onset could signal the end of what the party has been representing over the past years since it was founded. There are reasons for those feelings of dread, and the most notable of them have to do with the new equations that are emerging in the region. These equations do not show Hizballah having the same regional prestige that it had over the past years. Another notable reason for those feelings of dread has to do with developments in Lebanon under a state of peace. The direction in which these developments are moving tends to highlight the real magnitude of those forces that, like the Lebanese forces for example, rode the wave of war in Lebanon and appeared to be larger than they really were. Today, the Lebanese Forces appear to be like one of the ordinary partisan Christian forces, whereas in the past their prestige and influence made them appear to be representing Christians in Lebanon. This factor applies to Hizballah, too. In a state of peace Hizballah cannot possibly represent more than 10 percent [of the population] under the best of circumstances, particularly when we learn that Hizballah pursues its activity among Shiites, and most Shiites, like other sectarian groups in Lebanon, tend to renounce the previous war in all its forms. Another salient reason for those feelings of dread has to do with Hizballah's brittle organizational and political makeup. The tight, or rather rigid, form of that organization is considered an indirect indication of the confluence of various tendencies, each with its own nature, characteristics, and interests. Hizballah's makeup is also considered an indication of the fact that the party has brought together groups who are dominated by pressure from Iran and driven by interests and politics. Other than those reasons for Hizballah's dread there are other reasons that have to do with Iran. Iran is always sending out signals indicating that it would soon abandon its support for Hizballah, the party that was basically founded by Iran. Hizballah has relied on the enormous financial assistance, that it has been and is still receiving from Tehran. It is this financial assistance, which enabled Hizballah to expand its base and build and strengthen its agencies. In this regard everyone remembers the statements made by 'Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Hizballah's founder and the former interior minister of Iran. Mr. Mohtashemi, whose statements were critical of Iran's policies, called upon Hizballah to be vigilant and to reach beyond what the state of Iran was trying to forge in its international relations. All these feelings of dread came to a head the moment when the 'Arafat-Israeli agreement was reached. It was a moment, which suggested that doors leading to the resolution of issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict were being opened. New conditions would then ensue, and Hizballah would find no place for itself under those new conditions. Hence, it became evident that Hizballah was losing no time in its quest for a confrontation. It was doing that by becoming the driving force behind what happened during and after the al-Ghubayri demonstration. In doing that, Hizballah is seeking guarantees for its survival. AL-SHIRA' discusses in three articles in this issue these designations for the feelings of dread, which are being felt in Hizballah. The first and second articles, which are AL-SHIRA's, discuss details, which have to do with the party, with the positions of its leaders, and with the circumstances under that the party acts. The third article, which is by Amir Taheri, was published by our fellow newspaper, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT. That article discusses the reality of Iranian politics today.
