All the deputies tendered their resignation yesterday [2 Jun] because they were in danger of losing majority support in the Island Council. The biggest party, the PNP [National People's Party] of former Prime Minister Liberia-Peters, will now try to form a new coalition. Formally Curacao's Island Executive Council fell over an education issue. The deputee responsible for education wanted to expand the size of classes to 36 pupils in order to save money. However, there was considerable opposition to this measure within the education system and the trade unions. Three PNP members also threatened to vote against the proposal, which would have ended the coalition's majority in the Island Council. The deputees resigned before things reached this point. However, the real problem is primarily a party political affair. By voting against the measure, the three dissident PNP members wanted to express their dissatisfaction. After its defeat in the recent parliamentary elections, the PNP is in the middle of large-scale party reorganization. The three Island Council members would no longer be included on the PNP's list of candidates in next year's elections for a new Island Council. An attempt by the PNP leadership to talk with the dissidents has failed. They are now keeping their seats in their own names. At present the PNP has seven seats. It is looking to work with its present coalition partner, the Democratic Party, and with the MAN [New Antilles Movement] opposition party. Early elections for the Island Council are legally impossible. The next elections are scheduled for April. The Antillean Prime Minister Pourier has reacted with disappointment to the Island Executive Council's resignation. He was afraid that it would hamper the negotiations with Venezuela on the further existence of the refinery. "That is a crucial point about which we must reach agreement before the end of the month. The refinery is of national importance," Pourier said. Economic Affairs Minister Mendes had a different view. "The government does not have an outgoing status," he said. "We will continue to exercise our duties until a new coalition is formed."
