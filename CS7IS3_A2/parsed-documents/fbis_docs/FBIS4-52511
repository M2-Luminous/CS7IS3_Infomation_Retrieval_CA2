The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister, held a closed-door session here Tuesday to hear views from 11 representatives of agricultural, distribution and consumer groups in western Japan, the officials said. Most attendants called for the government to make efforts toward self-sufficiency in rice production and stable supplies, while seeking a review of the Food Control Law, taking a flexible approach to rice production and sales, the officials said. They said the representatives of agricultural cooperatives and consumer organizations urged the government to ease regulations on rice production and distribution. The council plans to hold similar sessions in six other cities, including Sapporo and Miyazaki, before working out an interim report for the government in July.
