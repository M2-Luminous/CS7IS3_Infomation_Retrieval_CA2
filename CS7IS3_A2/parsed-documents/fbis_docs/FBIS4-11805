He said that France is only interested in seeing sanctions work against Iraq, and not in creating hardships for Jordan. He added that "Jordan's suggestion of allowing UN inspection of ships only once they reached shore and not on the high seas was very reasonable," and that "France along with its European partners are taking the Jordanian suggestion very seriously and presently discussing it." The ambassador said the French navy is participating in UN inspection of ships heading for Aqaba along with the Americans.
