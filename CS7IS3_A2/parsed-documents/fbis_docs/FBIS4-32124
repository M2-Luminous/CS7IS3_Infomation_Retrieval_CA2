This works out at Kc14 for each citizen. First and foremost, it is essential to clean up the underground waters and the parcels of land contaminated by fuel and to dispose of the unexploded munitions the Soviets left behind. "The source of the damage, which is deemed to be Russia, has not spent anything on rectification, and it is not envisaged that anything will be spent," said Jaroslav Ruzicka, an Environment Ministry expert. Clearing up the damage left behind by the former Soviet Army has already cost almost Kc400 million in the years 1991-93; this is roughly one-fifth of what, according to estimates, will have to be spent as a whole. Ruzicka said that a lot of unnecessary damage was done to the environment because the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the Republic was very sudden. "In Germany, the Russians' withdrawal has been staggered over a period of several years, and so it is under greater control," he said. Ruzicka commented, however, that the damage caused by the Czech Army is, to say the least, the same.
