Javier Solana said it is frustrating and a scandal to see how these political and military leaders disregard their own citizens by hindering the arrival of aid the citizens need to survive the severe winter. The minister also referred to the visit his Algerian counterpart, Mohamed Salah Dembri, is making to Spain. Algeria, said Javier Solana, is a country going through severe political and economic problems, as well as suffering from terrorist violence. Algeria has a great potential; however, it needs help to develop. Solana added that risks to Spanish companies and citizens in Algeria have to be minimized.
