At the same time, "The Great Alliance to Safeguard the Traditions of the New Territories," an organization set up spontaneously by indigenous New Territories inhabitants, also is planning to conduct several protest activities. Thus is can be seen that activities of indigenous New Territories inhabitants to oppose the motion to amend the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill show no signs of declining, but are tending toward gradual escalation. Various circles in society and the mass media universally hold that the motion to amend the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill should be shelved in order to avoid social turmoil or a split among the people of Hong Kong. The formulation of the New Territories Ordinance and the forms of property rights inheritance of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories have a long historical background. All previous Hong Kong governors have abided by the New Territories Ordinance and have respected the forms of property rights inheritance and other traditions and customs of the indigenous inhabitants. The Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law also give solemn commitments and guarantees to them. However, owing to the development of urbanization in the New Territories, the uses of much of the land have changed, and new variables have emerged in the issue of property rights inheritance. The Hong Kong Government therefore put forward the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill so as to dispel doubts and misgivings in property inheritance of proprietors of more than 300,000 residential and private houses in the New Territories without affecting the interests, traditions, and customs of the indigenous New Territories inhabitants. The New Territories Heung Yee Kuk and the overwhelming majority of the indigenous inhabitants were sensible people and expressed their understanding and agreement. The Heung Yee Kuk also reached a consensus with the Hong Kong Government. Unexpectedly, when the Hong Kong Government submitted the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill to the Legislative Council, Loh Kung-wei, an appointed member of the Legislative Council, proposed an amendment extending the scope of exemption in the bill to include village land. This was done without careful consideration and without first carrying out any consultation. The Hong Kong Government originally said it would not support the amendment, but later changed its mind and was in favor of it. If this amendment is adopted and implemented, the New Territories Ordinance will exist in name only, and there will be an impact on the traditions, customs, and legitimate rights and interests of the indigenous New Territories inhabitants. In addition, this motion is evidently in conflict with relevant provisions and commitments in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. It is even more difficult for the indigenous inhabitants to accept this. Therefore, it is quite understandable that the proposed amendment has caused strong resentment and protests among the indigenous inhabitants. The crux of the issue is that the indigenous New Territories inhabitants' opposition to the proposed amendment to the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill is aimed at safeguarding the continuity of the New Territories Ordinance and at not permitting any attempt by outside forces to change their traditions and customs. The former involves the long-standing commitments and administrative policies of the Hong Kong Government, and no change should be made lightly. The latter involves the issue of changing prevailing habits and customs, and such changes can be made only gradually, through consultation. The move by the Hong Kong Government to impose such changes on the indigenous inhabitants by means of legislation without any consultation is obviously unwise and wrong. It has caused disputes and chaos in the life and internal relationships among the indigenous inhabitants, and to a certain extent, has caused social unrest and a split among the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government announced some time ago a delay in submitting the bill to the Legislative Council for examination; the reason given was to study how many existing regulations would be affected by the amendment and to study its impact. To date, however, the departments concerned of the Hong Kong Government have not yet solicited the views of the Heung Yee Kuk or the indigenous inhabitants, and the departments concerned are continuing to divorce themselves from reality and are acting blindly. Evidently, the escalation of protest activities by the Heung Yee Kuk and the indigenous inhabitants is caused by their worry that after its "study," the Hong Kong Government will cling obstinately to its course, force the amendment through, present a fait accompli, and compel the indigenous inhabitants to accept it.
