The North Korean ambassador expressed the appreciation of his embassy and government for the stand of IAF and the PAF. He stressed the firm Korean position in confronting U.S. threats.

In a separate development, seven Jordanian parties issued a statement of solidarity with North Korea against the onslaught being waged against it. The statement says: "Contrasting with this U.S. plotting against the DPRK concerning nuclear inspection issues is the imperialist states' full collusion and suspect silence toward the government of Israel, which is being turned into a nuclear base far away from international inspection in the Middle East. Moreover, Israel's military arsenal is constantly beefed up, thus violating the international will and peoples' interests." The seven Jordanian parties called for a campaign of solidarity with the Korean people. The parties that signed the statement are: The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian Democratic Progressive Party, the Jordanian Communist Party, the Jordanian Socialist Democratic Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th party, the Jordanian Arab Masses Party, and the Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party.
