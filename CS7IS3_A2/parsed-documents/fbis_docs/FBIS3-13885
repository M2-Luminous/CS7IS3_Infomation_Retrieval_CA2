In as much as he is familiar with the issue of Jerusalem, he could find no better opportunity to affirm that a unified Jerusalem was Israel's capital other than in these delicate circumstances through which the talks are passing. Since 1967, on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions, the U.S. position has continued to reject the annexation of the Arab part of Jerusalem to Israel. In his meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, Clinton said that the United States refuses to refer to Arab Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories. He did this in order to arouse the emotions of the Jews and gain their trust at a time when he finds himself involved in an investment bank scandal in his state, Arkansas, of which he was governor before winning the White House. If the Oslo accord postponed discussion of the Jerusalem issue until the final settlement stages, Clinton's remarks dissipated hopes that the United States would remain committed to international legitimacy and implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to Jerusalem. Instead of adopting a position that renews the desire by the Palestinians to return to the talks and implement the Oslo accord, Clinton, "with his wisdom" and long experience in foreign affairs, saw fit to pour salt on the wound by raising the Jerusalem issue at this time and place. The United States, instead of adopting the position of a neutral partner and attempting to build confidence between the Palestinians and the Israelis following the damage created by the Hebron massacre, has now adopted a pro-Israeli position that retreats from previous U.S. positions on Jerusalem. What is a cause for ridicule is the contradiction in President Clinton's stance. In the blessed night of the Koran's revelation he addressed the Muslims and tried to display feelings of friendship toward them. A few days later came Clinton's position, hostile to Islam and the Muslims, who consider Jerusalem to be the first Qiblah and the third holiest site. On one hand he congratulates the Islamic nation on the great night of the Koran's revelation, and on the other he defies the feelings of this nation by insisting on a position biased toward Israel with respect to the issue of Jerusalem, as if he is not aware of the extent of this nation's link to Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque and of the fact that more than one billion world Muslims reject Arab Jerusalem remaining under Israeli control. Moreover, a just and comprehensive settlement in the region cannot be reached without finding a solution to this sensitive issue that satisfies the three religions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Although we are grateful to President Clinton for congratulating us on the night of the Koran's revelation and the blessed 'Id al- Fitr, his second message which he sent through the American Jewish leaders, whom he met two days ago, is more impressive and bitter. That requires the Islamic nation to resist and confront this message because it represents a challenge to the Islamic and Arab nations, regardless of whether this was an intentional act or a failure to realize the danger of this U.S. position on relations between our Islamic and Arab worlds and his Western world as well as the fact that this position could lead to derailing the talks and the entire peace process. This pro-Israeli and biased U.S. stance on Jerusalem increases Israeli intransigence on the issue of Jerusalem, on Israel's plans to reduce the Arab presence in the city and Judaize the remainder of the holy city, and diminishes the chances of a peace whose crux is Jerusalem. We say to President Clinton and the U.S. Administration that this U.S. position increases the Palestinian people's persistence to continue the political struggle until they achieve their freedom and regain their rights. This U.S. position will help to unite the Palestinian ranks and to search for common denominators among the various groups and factions. We add: If this was the U.S. response to the Hebron massacre, in which the Palestinians were the victims, how will the U.S. response be if the Israelis are the victims? What a calamity it is when the United States turns falsehood into truth.
