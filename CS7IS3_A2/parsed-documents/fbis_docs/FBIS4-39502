The law changed Articles 3 and 4, which had provided for foreign investors' right to effect investment in Ukraine in the form of any movable or immovable property including land (Article 3), and their right to all types of investments, which involve six forms including the form of acquisition, not directly prohibited by Ukraine's legislation, of any movables and immovables including land plots (Article 4). The new law nullifies investors' right to land. Besides, Article 42 on proprietorial rights to land and other natural resources now specifies that "obtaining by foreign investors of proprietorial rights to natural resources is regulated by Ukraine's legislation." The Cabinet's decree provided for more specific regulation of such rights, in particular, by the Land Code of Ukraine. The Cabinet's decree was approved on 20 May 1993 (No. 55-93) and was based on the laws on foreign economic activities and on investment activities in Ukraine. The law on making amendments to the Cabinet's decree on foreign investment procedures was signed by President Kravchuk on 2 February 1994. However, its text became available to the media only on 4 June 1994.
