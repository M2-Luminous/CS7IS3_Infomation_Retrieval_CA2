He graduated from the Islamic Institute in Tashkent and Jordan University in Amman. He was the qadiqalon [Muslim judge who interprets and administers religious law] of Tajikistan from 1988 (after the accession to power of the People's Front, he was removed from this post and pronounced an "enemy of the people.") He was second in command in Central Asia's official Islamic hierarchy, a member of the Republic of Tajikistan Supreme Soviet Presidium, and he spoke out in favor of building a secular state. Our meeting with the former qadi took place in conditions of secrecy in the capital of one of the southern republics of the CIS. Addressing a press conference in Dushanbe, Turajonzoda once said that there are three instances when the qadi is not entitled to speak: if he is irritated, if he has not slept well, and if he is fasting. When we reminded him of these words he smiled and said that, thanks be to Allah, there was nothing preventing our work that day. [Dubnov] A year has passed since Imomali Rakhmanov was elected chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Soviet. You were the only opposition representative to send a congratulatory telegram to Rakhmanov, in which you proclaimed your readiness to promote a peaceful settlement to the war among Tajiks. However, you did not attend the actual session. Why? [Turajonzoda] I knew Rakhmanov's character. He is a very hot-tempered man and a true communist. Despite all that, I welcomed his election for the sake of establishing peace and tranquillity. But why did I myself fail to take part? I had reliable information that there were plans to deal with the opposition at the Leninabad session or after its conclusion. "You would be better off not going, as I cannot guarantee your safety," erstwhile Prime Minister Abdullodzhanov told me. [Dubnov] How do you evaluate the situation in Tajikistan today? [Turajonzoda] It was not difficult to predict what is now going on in my motherland. A regime which seeks by way of its basic task to instill fear in people and not self respect is in no state to last long. Absolutely nothing is sacred to these people, these authorities. Reviling democracy, and after making threats only a year ago to "the entire democratic scum, not only in Central Asia, but in Russia too" while swearing fidelity and friendship to Russia so as to ask it for aid -- these people sing quite a different song in other places. "If we (the government and the opposition) had fought against Russia together, we would not have the situation we have today, and we would not have spent two years fighting one another." This is a quotation from an interview given by Abdumadzhid Dostiyev [name as transliterated], first deputy chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Soviet, to Iran's KEYHAN. But Imomali Rakhmanov persuaded Afghanistan's President Rabbani to help first and foremost the true Tajiks who had come to power in Tajikistan (that is, the people of Kulyab) so as to prevent Abdullodzhanov's Leninabad clan from "selling the republic to Russia and America." I was told about this by Borhanoddin Rabbani himself. [Dubnov] And did you try to get in touch with the Russian leadership somehow to give it your point of view? [Turajonzoda] I appealed to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin personally on several occasions. To judge from Moscow's policy, it can be concluded that Former Security Minister Barannikov and Russia's current ambassador in Tajikistan, Mecheslav Senkevich, did not present the president with all the information on the situation in Tajikistan. However, I am inspired by the Russian president's edict on the appointment of a mediator to set up dialogue between the government in Dushanbe and the opposition, by Andrey Kozyrev's recent statements, and by the meeting between Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Chief Yevgeniy Primakov and Said Abdollahi Nuri, chairman of the Islamic Movement for the Revival of Tajikistan. [Dubnov] The Tajikistan authorities describe you as one of the main culprits in the bloodshed. Do you consider yourself guilty of anything? [Turajonzoda] Any man who enters the political arena always strives for power. I said that I would not seek to achieve any kind of state post, and I recognized that I was mistaken when in September 1991 I agreed to be nominated as a candidate for the Supreme Soviet. But, given that people had pinned enormous hopes on me, I simply wanted to help in the acquisition of independence, the revival of culture, and the attainment of religious freedom. When people say today that we wanted to seize power, they are lying. [Dubnov] In the last nigh-on three years you have had several chances to become Tajikistan's number one. Do you regret not making the most of this? [Turajonzoda] On several occasions I was asked by both political organizations and individual territories to run for the presidency, but I considered then as now that Tajikistan's spiritual leader should not be the leader of the state. We are accused of allegedly striving to impose Islamic order in Tajikistan. This is impossible. All the more so through force, and against the people's will and convictions. This kind of regime cannot last. It was impossible to impose from above something for which there existed no formulated demand in society. Could we, armed with this experience, do something so stupid? That would have been criminal. After all, all the mistakes I made while in office were ascribed to Islam. [Dubnov] A coalition government was in power for a total of six months last year and peace was not brought to the country. It is asserted that this happened because the government was under your influence. [Turajonzoda] The government comprised 90 percent communists, with only Vice Premier Davlat Usmonov [name as transliterated] representing us there, with myself in the Supreme Soviet Presidium. [Dubnov] Where were you and your family when hostilities against the opposition began? [Turajonzoda] At that time 49 of my relatives were killed. They were simply slaughtered in their own homes, in their native villages. My own home was first pillaged and then burned. The very same thing was done to my parents' home and the homes of my brothers. They even set light to the mosque next to my house. Three of my closest relatives, old men, were decapitated. In February 1993 I managed to travel on foot across snow-covered mountain passes to reach the territory of Kyrgyzstan, as far as Osh, and then onward to one of Kazakhstan's oblasts, and from there I flew to Moscow. We welcomed Rakhmanov's call for mutual disarmament by the armed formations. But instead of this, hostilities flared up against the opposition, and People's Front detachments occupied Dushanbe: the opposition was forced to take cover in the Garmo Hills and to retreat to Kofarnikhon. Then we sent a delegation to Rakhmanov and Karimov requesting that there be no attack on Kofarnikhon and that, with the aid of the 201st Russian Division which would be the guarantor of our safety, a start might at last be made on mutual disarmament. Rakhmanov ordered the delegation's arrest. [Dubnov] It is said that you are the chief of the Tajik government in exile. Is this so? [Turajonzoda] There is no Tajik government in exile. Even if the current government in Dushanbe stands down, we do not intend to take power into our own hands. Let people who have not participated in the war come to power. It is necessary with the help of Russia and other neighboring countries that we trust to disarm both sides and eventually, once the situation in the republic is fully stabilized, say in 18 months to two years' time, to hold free and democratic elections under the supervision of the United Nations, the CSCE, and other international organizations. Whoever wins the elections will lead the republic. But until then, while the Communists remain, we will continue the armed struggle against them. We believe that this struggle is legitimate. [Dubnov] You do not want to go into talks with official Dushanbe until you have set up contact with the Russian authorities. At the same time, it is considered in Moscow that the establishment of peace in Tajikistan is primarily the concern of the Tajiks themselves. If you continue to defend these stances, how will you break this vicious circle? [Turajonzoda] Yes, we still want to meet with representatives of the Russian Government first, but this does not mean that we consider Russia our enemy. We recognize its geopolitical interests in the region. Russian troops can remain in Tajikistan. We want to see Russia as a mediator. We want to explain our point of view -- it is not important whether this is done officially or unofficially -- and that is all! And if we convince Russia, then we will be prepared to sit around the negotiating table with representatives of the current regime in Dushanbe, with the exception of those people who were actual commanders the People's Front and who are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of completely innocent people. There are upstanding people in the government with whom it is possible to talk. The communists and democrats in the republic are incapable of reaching agreement without mediation and help from countries like Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. If Russia's stance remains unchanged, this will signify a continuation of the fratricidal war. [Dubnov] How do you explain attacks by armed opposition detachments on border posts on the Tajik-Afghan border, the victims of which are the wholly blameless Russian soldiers? [Turajonzoda] We deeply regret the the fact that innocent Russian boys are dying. But show us another way of fighting against the hated regime in Dushanbe. What else can we do if Russian troops continue to defend it? After all, according to the agreement, border troops protect the border from foreign invasion. But we are citizens of Tajikistan, we want to go home, but we are being killed there. The border troops are preventing us from returning home with dignity. Our guys, when crossing the border, are instructed to bypass the posts and military units and not to enter into combat with Russian soldiers, but they pursue us onto Tajikistan territory and, you know, we are in our own country. I would very much like the Russian readers to put themselves in our shoes.
