Dyakov; place and date not given; under the rubric "Exclusive Interview": "Yevgeniy Saburov: Agreement With Russia Signed"] [Text] Negotiations were held between government delegations of Russia and Crimea in Moscow. On returning to Simferopol from the Russian capital, Ye.F. Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Crimean Government, answered our correspondent's questions. [Dyakov] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what news did you bring from Moscow? [Saburov] As a result of the just-completed negotiations, the parties signed a Russian-Crimean framework intergovernmental trade and economic agreement. This document defines the boundaries within which Russia and Crimea undertake to develop mutually profitable business relations. We speak here of trade and economic ties. We will create the most favorable conditions for entities engaged in economic activities. Within the framework of this agreement, agencies and enterprises will be able to enter into economic contracts between themselves. This will lead to an expansion of Russian-Crimean trade. For us, relations with our Russian partners are very important. Thanks to a strengthening of these ties, we will be able to speed up the implementation of economic reforms. [Dyakov] But the ties also existed in the past. Why was it necessary to formalize them in an agreement? [Saburov] It is true that Crimea is linked with Russia by a myriad invisible threads. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, however, economic relations became more complicated. A new and rather difficult situation emerged. Customs and other artificial barriers arose between Crimea and Russia. Simply talking about removing these barriers cannot solve the problem. Thanks to these agreements, relations with Russia have been elevated to a new, higher level. The two governments undertook an obligation to facilitate the expansion of cooperation in every way. [Dyakov] Apparently, the framework agreement is to be followed by concrete steps in bringing Crimea and Russia closer together in the economic sense, is it not? [Saburov] Some steps already have been taken to fill the outlined framework with concrete content. For instance, Russia had a limit on how much cash could be taken out of the country, including to Crimea. It was set at 500,000 rubles [R]. Too little for vacationers at current prices. Now this amount has been increased to R1.4 million. This is extremely important for Crimea. In the summer we expect millions of Russians to come and vacation here. They will be able to spend their pocket money--the R1.4 million--on our goods and services. The Crimean budget will get an infusion. In short, the benefit is obvious. In addition, the Russian Government made the decision to subsidize vouchers to Crimean resorts. The corresponding expenses will be carried by insurance funds and trade unions. Thanks to this, our sanitariums, room-and-board facilities, and recreation homes will not be empty... [Dyakov] How will the agreement affect the development of Crimean industry? [Saburov] Most tangibly. We will define the volume of Crimean products to be shipped to Russia with reduced customs formalities. We have conducted negotiations on the issues of transportation and communications. Russian Government leaders treated with understanding our difficulties and requests. We count on the closest cooperation with our partners in the brotherly country. [Dyakov] Who conducted the negotiations on the Russian side? [Saburov] The head of government, V.S. Chernomyrdin. At the signing of the agreement he emphasized that nothing now stands in the way of concrete contracts between Russian and Crimean enterprises. He urged an intensification of this work, bringing into its orbit broad circles of interested parties. The agreement was signed by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister S.M. Shakhray and myself. [Dyakov] Were these long negotiations? [Saburov] They began under the previous Crimean leadership, but at some stage ground to a halt. Now we have been able to bring them to a successful conclusion. [Dyakov] When may the results of the negotiations have an effect in overcoming the economic crisis in Crimea? [Saburov] Unfortunately, not right away. The economy has a very strong inertia. But there will definitely be positive results. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin suggested, for instance, that we start thinking now of Crimea's preparations for the winter and the fuel and energy supply. We are supposed to sign contracts for exports of our products to Russia, which should give a boost to our industrial production. [Dyakov] For many Crimean enterprises, as well as Russian ones, the problem of mutual nonpayments is practically unsurmountable. Have you been able to resolve it? [Saburov] We touched upon this issue in the course of negotiations. We resolved to clear financial channels between Russian and Crimean enterprises. Then mutual payments for products shipped will flow through them unimpeded. We will keep under supervision the implementation of concrete measures in this respect. This is what we agreed on with the Russians. In short, we see this agreement as a door that has opened between Russia and Crimea. I am confident that it will always remain open.
