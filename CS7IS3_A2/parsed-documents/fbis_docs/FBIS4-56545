In an impromptu news conference that he gave at the end of the ceremony, Menem emphasized that "certain interests" are trying to create a confrontation between the military and civilians. He also insisted on stressing that "we have never had better relations with the United States" and said he believes that country will not apply sanctions if the pharmaceutical patents law is not approved. In this respect he stressed that a measure of that kind "would not be suitable either for the United States or for Argentina." In addition, the chief of state again criticized the mothers of Plaza de Mayo, saying: "I respect them about as much as they respect the president of the nation," and immediately asking: "Who is financing the many trips they make?" Menem presided over the Air Force ceremony, which was held at the 6th Air Brigade based in this city, together with Army Chief of Staff General Martin Balza. [passage omitted]
