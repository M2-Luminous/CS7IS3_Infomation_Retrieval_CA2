This money is to compensate farmers for the fall in agricultural prices and means that the agricultural subsidy for 1995 from the EU to Finland is 7 billion and not 4 billion markkas. This means that the Finnish taxpayers' additional contribution for 1995 to farmers will be 1 billion and not 4 billion markkas -- the figure that has been mentioned hitherto. This has been confirmed by Finnish agricultural experts in Brussels. The package that resulted from the membership negotiations contains a provision that for four years Finland will receive 738 million ECU's (a little over 4.7 billion markkas) from the EU's so-called agrobudgetary package. It is this money that is to compensate farmers for the fall in prices (a 50-percent fall in prices for agricultural products from the first day of membership). The other candidate countries with a high level of agricultural subsidies also received similar compensation. Sweden also received money under this same heading, despite the fact that it has already adjusted its prices to the EU level. This is a scarcely disguised budget rebate. The calculation of the national support package is very complicated and Prime Minister Esko Aho, who yesterday visited Brussels, had his work cut out to explain the need for the package to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. "We met with the reaction we expected. The Commission will have to undertake a swift investigation of the package, so that we can have its conclusions in good time before the referendum. On this we are agreed," Aho said after his meeting with Delors, not going into any details about what Delors' reaction actually was. Aho said at least that he had not encountered any "insurmountable" difficulties for Finland's national agricultural support package. "There is bound to be pretty thorough discussion of some points, but the fundamental outlines of the support package will probably remain unchanged," Aho said. He refused to say what details in the package the Commission is expected to take an especially careful look at. The Commission will scrutinize the national support package to see whether it conflicts with the EU's rules. The most important thing from the Commission's viewpoint is whether the subsidies for farmers and the food industry can be considered to distort competition. This would anger farmers in the other member nations. One of Aho's main arguments for the national subsidy package is that Finland's farmers receive less support than EU farmers in Central Europe, since the most important part of the EU's agricultural subsidy is related to production. The greater production, the bigger the contribution from the EU, and this would leave Finland's relatively low-production farmers with smaller contributions. The Commission has been critical that Finland has made available so little information about the package in the period in which it had been prepared. "We could not negotiate with the EU before the decisions on the package were made at home, and in my view we have given the EU good advance information," Aho said before the meeting. Aho fears that the strongly critical discussion at home in Finland could threaten the package's acceptance by the EU, and said that he thinks that the whole discussion has been derailed. On the subject of next week's confidence vote, Aho said that it will decide whether Finnish EU membership has any future. Without the national subsidy package there is no chance, he said. "The Eduskunta decided two years ago that Finland should apply for EU membership on the present base. If the Eduskunta does not consider that it is defensible, I do not think that there is any other point of departure from which Finland could become a member of the EU," Aho said. Asked whether he considers it important that Pertti Salolainen should remain in the government, Aho replied "yes." The delicate subject of Delors' successor was also debated over lunch with the Belgian prime minister. Dehaene himself is the French-German favorite for Delors' successor. "Dehaene and I have a number of divergent views, about federalism in Europe (decisions at central level rather than in individual countries), for example, but Dehaene seems to be a pragmatic federalist and would probably not be a bad choice for president of the Commission," Aho said. The prime minister also said that he does not want to mix together a possible election to the European Parliament and Finland's Eduskunta elections in March next year. "It is better that the Euroelections take place at the same time as the local elections," Aho said.
