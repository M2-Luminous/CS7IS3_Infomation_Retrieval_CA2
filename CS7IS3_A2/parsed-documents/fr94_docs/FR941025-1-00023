FR941025-1-00023 FR941025-1-00006 In 1991, the Commission decided to re-examine the scope of the children's sleepwear standards and to consider the possibility of amending the definitions of the term ``children's sleepwear'' in the two standards. This undertaking resulted in the initiation of this rulemaking proceeding in 1993. C. Statutory Provisions Section 4(g) of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1193(g)) provides that a proceeding for issuance or amendment of a flammability standard is initiated by publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). Section 4(g) of the FFA requires that the ANPR must describe the product and the risk of injury under consideration; summarize the regulatory alternatives being considered; provide information about existing standards which may be relevant; invite interested persons to submit comments on the product, risk of injury, and regulatory alternatives under consideration; invite interested persons to submit an existing standard or portion of a standard to the Commission for publication as the proposed standard or amendment; and invite interested persons to submit a statement of intent to develop or modify a voluntary standard to address the risk of injury under consideration. If the Commission decides to continue the proceeding after consideration of comments and submissions received in response to the ANPR, section 4(i) of the FFA requires the Commission to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR). The NPR must set forth the text of the proposed rule and a preliminary regulatory analysis containing a discussion of the anticipated benefits and costs of the proposed rule and other regulatory alternatives considered by the Commission. Provisions of section 4(d) of the FFA provide that interested persons shall be given the opportunity to make oral presentations of data, views, or arguments as well as to submit written comments on the proposed rule. To issue a final standard or amendment, section 4(j) of the FFA requires the Commission to publish a notice of final rulemaking setting forth the text of the final rule and the Commission's final regulatory analysis of costs, benefits, and alternatives to the rule. Section 4(j) also requires that the notice of final rulemaking must contain the Commission's findings with regard to the provisions and extent of compliance with any voluntary standard that may be applicable to the risk of injury under consideration. Additionally, section 4(b) of the FFA requires the notice of final rulemaking to contain findings that the standard or amendment is needed to protect the public from the unreasonable risk of death, injury, or significant property damage from fires associated with the fabric or product under consideration; is reasonable, technologically practicable and appropriate; and is limited to those fabrics or products which have been determined to present an unreasonable risk of death, injury, or significant property damage. D. Publication of ANPR The Commission began this proceeding to consider amendment of the children's sleepwear standards by publication of an ANPR in the Federal Register of January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4111). The ANPR identified the products under consideration as children's sleepwear garments in sizes 0 through 14, and the risk of injury as death or personal injury from fires resulting from ignition of children's sleepwear (4). As required by section 4(g) of the FFA, the ANPR also described the regulatory alternatives being considered by the Commission. Briefly summarized, the alternatives listed in the ANPR were: (1) Amendment of the children's sleepwear standards to exempt tight-fitting sleepwear garments and sleepwear garments in infant sizes. Children's sleepwear garments exempted from the requirements of the sleepwear standard would be subject to the provisions of the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (16 CFR part 1610). That standard prohibits the manufacture, importation, or sale of garments which are ``dangerously flammable because of rapid and intense burning,'' but does not require garments to self-extinguish when exposed to a small open-flame ignition source, or (2) Issuance of an enforcement policy statement to announce that the Commission will not apply the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards to tight-fitting sleepwear garments and garments in infant sizes as long as those garments meet the requirements of the clothing textiles flammability standard. Section 4(g) also requires the ANPR to include information about all standards known by the Commission to be relevant to the proceeding. The ANPR discussed provisions of flammability standards for children's sleepwear issued by Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The Canadian and New Zealand standards have less stringent flammability performance requirements for tight-fitting children's sleepwear garments than for loose-fitting children's sleepwear. The Canadian standard also makes special provisions for sleepwear garments in infant sizes and children's sleepwear intended for use in hospitals. It is noteworthy that there have been no burn deaths associated with children's sleepwear reported in Canada since its standard was promulgated in 1987. At the same time the Commission published the ANPR, it also announced that it would not enforce the children's sleepwear standards in instances involving garments in sizes 0 through 14 which are labeled and marketed as ``underwear'' if those garments are skin-tight or nearly skin-tight and are essentially identical in design and fit to underwear garments (5).
