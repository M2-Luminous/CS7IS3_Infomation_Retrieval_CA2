Prosecutor-general Kim Tae-chung also wanted to know whether Han received any bribes when appointing heads of NACF branch offices. In addition to building up the slush fund by misappropriating money from the budgets of NACF provincial and city branches, the prosecutor suspects Han, 58, may have added billions of won more to the fund by receiving commissions and payoffs from construction companies for various NACF building projects. The presidential office at Chongwadae, meanwhile, brushed aside allegations that Han was being prosecuted for political reasons. "There was no political intention for Han's arrest," said one senior Chongwadae official. "It's preposterous to suggest that Han is being made the target of an unjust investigation." There has been speculation that Han, as the leader of the nation's powerful farm organizations, incurred the wrath of the Kim administration with his uncompromising stance on opening the domestic rice market to imports and other farm policies following the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The prosecutor plans to summon officials from four to five large construction companies, NACF accountants and heads of NACF provincial and city branches for questioning in this connection, sources said. "Apart from the 360 million won Han admitted to having set aside as a slush fund, we have found that he misappropriated about 10 million won a month from the NACF's budget," said one investigator at the prosecutor's office. "We plan to find out the exact size of the slush fund and its uses by tracing his personal bank deposits," he added. The prosecutor's office is also looking into the possibility that Han may have embezzled public funds from the NONGMIN SINMUN (farmers newspaper) and Nongmin Co. He is president of both companies. In a related development, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] decided at a party postholders' meeting Monday to urge the government to conduct a thorough investigation of Han and possible systematic irregularities at the NACF. The NACF must be transformed into an organization that can act as a real spokesman for the nation's farmers, the DLP said. "On the occasion of chairman Han's arrest, systematic irregularities at the NACF have to be cleaned up and the current investigation should not leave any trace of suspicion," said DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong after the meeting. With regard to allegations that Han paid off more than 100 politicians, DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "the party will study taking possible action against anyone who is implicated in the prosecutor's investigation." The main opposition Democratic Party [DP] also urged the government to investigate Han and the NACF thoroughly, clear up any suspicions and severely punish those found guilty of wrongdoings. DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "Since (the government) started this investigation (of the NACF), it has to do a complete job." The government should also take this opportunity to investigate other organizations run along similar lines as the NACF, Yi said. DP spokesman Pak Chi-won urged a thorough investigation, saying: "There was an allegation that 2 million to 3 million won apiece had been offered to 110 ruling party candidates during the last parliamentary elections, and large amounts of political funds had flowed into the political circle."
