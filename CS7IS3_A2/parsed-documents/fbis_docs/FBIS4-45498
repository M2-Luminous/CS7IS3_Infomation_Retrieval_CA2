The meeting began today in the Chilean port of Iquique, 1,857 Km north of Santiago, and will end tomorrow, 17 June, with the release of conclusions on subjects such as drug trafficking, the foreign debt, energy and mines, economic matters, and international law. Bolivian Deputy Guido Camacho, president of the Antinarcotics Defense Commission [Comision de Defensa en la Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico], told EFE that the international community must participate in coca replacement policies in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, given that this agricultural product generates revenues in those countries. He said there is the legal consumption of coca, especially by Bolivian and Peruvian peasants as part of their daily diet. The Parlatino members pointed out that excess coca goes for the production of cocaine, which leads to drug trafficking. Camacho added that measures must be adopted to prevent this from happening. Enforcement policies must be reinforced with preventive measures, related to the need to replace the coca plantations with alternative crops. This must be done within a plan to improve highway infrastructure and other measures to pave the way for a more adequate trade of agricultural products, Deputy Camacho said. He added that the proposal to legalize the use of cocaine in Colombia will be discussed at the meetings to be held on Friday. Among the proposals is one submitted by Chile demanding punishment for drug traffickers and also for consumers. When asked about the validity of the conclusions released by the Parlatino for the governments, the Bolivian deputy explained that the resolutions will be approved by consensus of the Parlatino members who will then take these ideas to the congresses of their respective countries to turn them into laws.
