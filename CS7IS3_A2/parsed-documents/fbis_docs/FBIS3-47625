Telecom President Cho Paek-che and Indosat President Tjahjono Soerjodibroto signed the agreement at a Pacific partners' meeting in Hawaii. They will form a consortium to participate in an international tender to be placed by the Indonesian Government for installing 2 million telephone lines on a build, operate and transfer (BOF) basis. Under its sixth economic development plan, the Indonesian Government plans to install 5 million lines. Developing countries prefer BOF, by which foreign firms operate invested facilities for a time and hand them over after gaining a preset profit. If the consortium succeeds, it will help build Korea Telecom's reputation in the area, the spokesman said. Telecom has consulted on two projects in Indonesia. One on communication technology at 3.9 million U.S. dollars and the other on building a communications network at 1.3 million dollars.
