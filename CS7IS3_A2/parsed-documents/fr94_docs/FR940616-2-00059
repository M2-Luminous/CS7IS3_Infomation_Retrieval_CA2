FR940616-2-00059 FR940616-2-00045 [FRL&hyph;4999&hyph;7] Notice of a Final List of Water Quality Limited Waterbodies in the State of Minnesota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of a final Clean Water Act section 303(d) list for the State of Minnesota. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) final decision with respect to the list required of the State of Minnesota, under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). On December 8, 1993, the USEPA published (58 FR 64584) a proposed list of waterbodies, subsequent to its disapproval, on August 9, 1993, of portions of the list prepared by the State of Minnesota. A total of 72 waterbodies have been identified as appropriate waterbodies for the development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), pursuant to section 303(d), 40 CFR part 130, and USEPA guidance, as resources permit. An additional number of waterbodies have been identified, for which implementation of a TMDL will be dependent on a variety of events or actions outside the control of the State of Minnesota. Copies of the lists may be obtained at the address provided in the addresses section. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the lists may do so by contacting Mr. Robert F. Pepin, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Water Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, telephone (312) 886&hyph;1505; or Mr. Greg Gross, Division of Water Quality, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, 520 Lafayette Road, St. Paul, Minnesota 55155, telephone (612) 296&hyph;7213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert F. Pepin or Mr. Greg Gross at the above addresses or telephone numbers. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that the States identify lists of waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate. Further, section 303(d) requires that the lists developed by the States be submitted to the USEPA for review and approval or disapproval. To the extent that the USEPA disapproves a State submittal, section 303(d) of the CWA requires that the USEPA develop and publish the list. The USEPA must also assure that public participation in the formulation of a list of waterbodies is consistent with 40 CFR part 25, and may publicly notice a State submittal for that purpose as well. The State of Minnesota had prepared several lists for the USEPA review, and had submitted and subsequently withdrawn several of these. On July 6, 1993, the USEPA received from Minnesota, a proposed list, which contained some, but not all of the waterbodies which the USEPA believed should be included on the list applicable to the State of Minnesota. As a result, the USEPA issued, on August 9, 1993, a partial approval of the list submitted by the State, approving the list to the extent that it did include waterbodies which were appropriately included on the list, but disapproving the submission in that it did not include all waterbodies which would be subject to the requirements of section 303(d). Subsequently, USEPA developed a list of additional waterbodies which it believed were subject to the requirements of section 303(d), and published a notice to that effect on December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64584). The USEPA received written comments from four commenters, including the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). These comments are available for public inspection at the address listed above. (A) Responses to Comments In making its final determination, the USEPA has carefully considered all comments received, and has revised its lists accordingly. In particular, changes have been made based upon the following. (1) The MPCA commented that 23 stream segments were not identified on the proposed list, and should be included. In alternate years, the State of Minnesota, pursuant to section 305(b) of the CWA, provides a report to Congress, on the health of waters within the State. In its 1992 report, Minnesota had identified the 23 stream segments in question, as impaired, however, the USEPA had not included these segments on its proposed list, believing the data to be old and somewhat unreliable. Upon further review, however, it is apparent that these segments are contiguous with other waterbodies included upon the USEPA's proposed list, and that these other waterbodies are scheduled for TMDL development within the next few years. As MPCA intends to develop these TMDLs for the whole waterbody, the MPCA believes that the 23 segments the USEPA had originally proposed to exclude should also be listed. The USEPA agrees. (2) The MPCA commented that 65 segments that were identified by the USEPA in the proposed list should not be included because the data used to support listing does not reflect current conditions. The information provided by the commenter indicates that of the 65 segments, remedial actions have been taken on 51 segments. In addition, exceedences of water quality standards were infrequent for five of the 65 segments, and did not support a conclusion that the waterbodies were impaired. Finally, the impairment determination for nine segments was based on data that were typically five to 10 years of age, and was not thought to be indicative of current conditions. The USEPA agrees that these waterbodies should not be listed pursuant to section 303(d). (3) The MPCA commented that nine waterbodies that were identified in the proposed list should not be listed because the stated impairment is due to ubiquitous metals, for which there is no evidence, based upon biological sampling, that designated uses are impaired. For each of these waterbodies, the MPCA provided documentation that the impairments described were based upon one or more of the following: Rare excursions of the water quality standards; ambient levels of the various constituents higher than expected for the ecoregion, but no water quality standards exceedences measured; or misinterpretation by the USEPA of the data provided in the 305(b) report. The USEPA agrees with the MPCA that cause does not exist for listing these waterbodies. (4) The MPCA commented that approximately 245 segments of waterbodies which were included on the proposed USEPA list, should be excluded for a variety of reasons.
