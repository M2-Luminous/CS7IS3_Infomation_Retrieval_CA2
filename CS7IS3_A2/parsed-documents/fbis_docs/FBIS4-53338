His childhood name was "Yura." * The official Kim Chong-il biography published in the early 1980's does not give his birthplace. In 1980 North Korea named a peak in Mt. Paektu as Chongilbong after his name and began to claim that Kim Chong-il was born on Mt. Paektu. Present address: The Central Party building in Namsan-tong, Chung-ku, Pyongyang Special City.

FAMILY RELATIONS Kim Hyong-chik married Kang Pan-sok. Kim Il-song was born to them in 1912. He married Kim Chong-suk (born in 1917), and Kim Song-ae (born in 1924). With Kim Chong-suk, he had Kim Chong-il (born in 1942), Syu-ra, and Kim Kyong-hui (born in 1946). The latter married Chang Song-taek (born in 1946) and that union produced Chang Kum-song (born in 1977). Kim Chong-il married Hong Il-so and that union produced Kim Hye-Kyong (born in 1968). Kim Chong-il married Song Hye-rim (born in 1937) and that union produced Kim Chong-nam (born in 1971). Kim Chong-il also married Kim Hye-suk and that union produced Kim Un-song (born in 1974). Kim Il-song's marriage to Kim Song-ae resulted in the births of Kim Kyong-chin (1952), Kim Pyong-il (1953) and Kim Yong-il (1955). The latter is listed as having an offspring named Kim Song-kang (born in 1983 with no mother listed). Kim Kyong-chin married Kim Kwang-sop (born in 1952) and the union produced two children (Kim Chung-min, born in 1981 and Kim Tong-min, born in 1983). Kim Pyong-il married Kim Sun-kum (born in 1956) and that union produced two children (Kim Un-song born in 1981 and Kim In-kang born in 1983).

But he is currently the KPA supreme commander and holds the title of marshal. He is also the chairman of the National Defense Commission. But he was never, not even once, shown up in military uniform. Even when he reviewed troops during the 60th anniversary of the North Korean army (on 25 April 1992), he was in people's uniform, not in military uniform. [passage omitted] Little Experience Abroad He was born in the Soviet Union. During the Korean War, he took refuge in Jilin in Jilin Province, China. He never stayed longer in any one place abroad than he did in Jilin. (North Korea claims that Kim Chong-il took refuge in Mt Changsa in Kanggye where he engaged in logistic support for the KPA.) Subsequently, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il visited Moscow in 1957 and East Germany and Romania in 1959. That is about all of his travel experience abroad. There is an unconfirmed report that Kim Chong-il attended an East German air force academy, but he left the academy and returned home shortly afterward probably because he did poorly at school. Kim Chong-il toured various places in China in 1983 and 1984. There is no further information on his foreign experience. Maybe that is why he likes movies and music. Reportedly, he likes Russian, American, and Japanese movies and Korean folk songs. He likes to drink cognac while boasting of North Korean wine, and smokes British Dunhill cigarettes, probably to vicariously sample a foreign experience. As for his known foreign language ability, he can say only such rudimentary expressions as "Thank you" and "How are you?" in Japanese. Presumably, he may speak some Chinese and German also. Perhaps he may be having some other foreign travel experiences in secret. Kim Chong-il's Nicknames The more closed a society is, the more secret language it produces. An examination of argot associated with Kim Chong-il or his nicknames will be of great help in understanding his personality. Some of the derisive expressions used to describe his appearance are: "oppossum hair" and "chuche hair" for his curly hair; "squint eyes" or "cross- eyed," "midget," "greenhorn," and "little bear" for his eyes and diminutive stature. Expressions deriding his behavior include: "womanizer," "pervert," "brat," "hedgehog," and "chestnut burr." "Altitude" is slang deriding his habit of wearing elevator shoes to appear taller than he is.
