In the Sunday Newspaper radio program, he stressed that there must be reconciliation between the churches and various strata of society. Evaluating the government party's economic policy, Fur said that it has been possible to squeeze back inflation. He mentioned by way of example that in January price increases were barely above 3 percent, although they had themselves been reckoning with inflation of around 6 percent. Economic growth had already begun last year, he said, mentioning the building industry as an example. Lajos Fur spoke about the situation that has evolved along our southern borders. The Hungarian Government's position is unequivocal: It does not wish to get mixed up in the conflict and it also declared that when it stated that in the event of conflict, NATO planes would not be allowed into Hungary's airspace. The MDF chairman is of the view that there will probably not be any need for NATO air strikes, because the warring sides in Bosnia will hopefully see reason.
