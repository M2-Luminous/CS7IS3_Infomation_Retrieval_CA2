FBIS4-66964 "jptdd019__l94026" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 29 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA HAITI Aristide Spokesman Says Military Antidrug Initiative `Too Aristide Spokesman Says Military Antidrug Initiative `Too Late' FL2904203694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 29 Apr 94 FL2904203694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude Martineau, has reacted to the antidrug operation led by the Haitian military authorities. The initiative has come too late, according to the president's spokesman. Martineau has reaffirmed that the Haitian military authorities are involved in drug trafficking, up to the hilt. [begin recording, in Creole] Martineau: A big drug dealer made a series of statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week ago. He stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant Colonel] Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is involved in drug trafficking, up to the hilt. Obviously, it was not necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it. Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (only) after this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end recording] This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude Martineau.
