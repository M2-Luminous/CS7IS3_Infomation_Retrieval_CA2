This decision was made after a two-hour meeting between Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Felipe Sola, the agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary. This was reported by Sola yesterday during a news conference. The fishing functions will be exercised by the agriculture secretary, supported by a group of advisers who will not exceed the number of advisers already used by Gutierrez. Sola will be supported by Felix Cirio, the under secretary for agriculture and livestock production and markets, who will replace incumbent Roberto Baltar in the Fishing Directorate, and Agrarian Economy Under Secretary Jesus Leguiza, who will contribute with statistical data on catches, fleets, and fishing economic reviews. Sola said: "This point definitely represents a weakness for us." [passage omitted]
