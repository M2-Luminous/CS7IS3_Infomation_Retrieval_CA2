Contrary to the regulations, he had been demonstrating and explaining the principles of flying the aircraft". This sensational, and unfortunately, very sad, news about the reason why the airbus A-310 fell from the sky was confirmed in an exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent at the public relations department of the Russian Ministry of Transport. These findings were based on a first study by members of the government commission on 4 April of the results of the decoding of parametric information registered by the on-board recorders. The Moscow-Hong Kong flight SU-593 of the A-310 aircraft came to a tragic end on 22 March near Mezhdurechenck in Kemerovo Oblast. Seventy-five people died in the crash. It has been established that the flight from Moscow to Novokuznetsk was going according to schedule. There were no indications of any malfunctions of the aircraft, its engines or systems. Four minutes after passing Novokuznetsk, as a consequence of what happened on the flight deck, the airbus "banked to the right more than it should have done, causing it to descend steeply and to strike the ground." A document presented to ITAR-TASS this evening points out that the actions of the crew and the disaster situation procedures are being investigated by highly qualified specialists. The commission is continuing its work.
