France has enormous experience -- in that country, atomic electric power plants produce 70 percent of all the electricity being consumed. Accordingly, an efficient system of disposing of radioactive waste was created there. France's major company dealing with these problems has agreed on concrete cooperation with representatives of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Geological Sciences during negotiations in Paris.
