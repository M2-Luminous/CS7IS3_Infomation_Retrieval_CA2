Security Council, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday [13 January]. But the official indicated that the matter will be a long process. "The reform of the Security Council is a relatively complicated issue which includes ratifying the U.N. Charter, and several procedural problems," spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly briefing. "Solving these problems is not a question of one or two countries expressing their opinion, but needs the full and ample deliberation of all the delegates to the United Nations. Only then can we strive for a method acceptable to everyone," he said. Wu did not elaborate on China's position in the matter, only saying that China understands the two countries' hope "of making greater contributions to peace and development in the world." During a two-day visit to Beijing last weekend, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata briefed Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on the establishment of a working group for the reform of the Security Council. At that time the Chinese side made no response, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
