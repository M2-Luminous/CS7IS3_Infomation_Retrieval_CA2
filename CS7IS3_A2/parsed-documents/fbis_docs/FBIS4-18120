[Vogel] I doubt that it is so large. What is large is the difference in people's lives in the two parts of Germany over the past 40 years. This difference cannot be balanced overnight. Furthermore, occasionally I get the feeling that some west Germans now have expectations that they never had in the past. People from Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria are not constantly hugging each other, either. The Saxons and the Thuringians will still retain certain individual characteristics. [FOCUS] Nevertheless, the east Germans are complaining that the wages are adjusted too slowly and the west Germans are complaining about excessive burdens.... [Vogel] People in Germany like to complain, in the west more than in the east. It is not completely incomprehensible that the east Germans are impatient. Frowning over this impatience in western Germany is largely due to ignorance regarding the real situation. The occasionally patronizing attitude that says "For us it also took 40 years" is very little consolation for those who have already waited for 40 years. [FOCUS] The 1989-90 vision spoke of "flourishing landscapes"; the reality are prefabs, industrial ruins, and old ecological burdens. When will the landscapes finally start to flourish? [Vogel] I will not give you any specific date, but things are flourishing, as one can see, and they are flourishing more in the south than in the north of the new laender. In a few years we will have fields where we will certainly be competitive. We will soon have caught up with Saarland; catching up with Bavaria will take a bit longer. [FOCUS] How do you want to stimulate Thuringia's economy? [Vogel] With a broad range of economic instruments, such as the newly founded reconstruction bank and the industry participation fund. This helps companies that have good prospects to overcome their difficulties with liquidity for a certain time. For instance, we must not immediately say that young companies are doomed to fail because they have starting difficulties, such as too little capital. Thuringia's great chance lies in the technological lead in state-of-the-art production facilities. The disadvantage: The number of jobs is lower than in the usual facilities. [FOCUS] Where do the differences between the south and the north in the new laender come from? [Vogel] Because the south is the classical industrial region in Germany and here the structural preconditions are much more favorable. One cannot be located more centrally than Erfurt, right in the center of Germany. We have a lot to do to be able to use this inheritance. Railroad tracks and roads must be built to make use of the advantage of a central location. [FOCUS] The classical industrial region also has ecological burdens. Where are the billions for cleaning up the old burdens supposed to come from? The 3.8 billion German marks [DM] in tax revenues are already devoured by the personnel costs that the land has to pay. [Vogel] The Federal Government pays between 60 and 75 percent of the removal of the large old burdens. At the moment our budget situation is as follows: Of DM100 that we pay, DM25 is tax revenues, which experience a gradually upward trend, DM25 is borrowed, and DM50 comes from the west, in particular from the Federal Government. [FOCUS] And now there is the election campaign. Are you not sometimes suffering from insomnia in view of the latest election disasters of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]? [Vogel] We are doing a lot of work. Therefore, I sleep well. By the way, the two most recent elections were quite certainly not successful for the CDU, but they did yield a few gratifying messages. [FOCUS] Which ones? [Vogel] We have a high turnout once again. The Republikaner had nothing to say, not even in Lower Saxony. And the concentration of the voters on the two people's parties is quite clear. We no longer have 60 percent as in Hamburg, but we are back at 80 percent. In addition, it is a good message that the governments are being confirmed: Minister-presidents are winning elections. [FOCUS] Do you still expect to have your coalition partner in the next Thuringian Landtag, since the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] does not achieve 5 percent anymore? [Vogel] I assume that the FDP will again enter the Erfurt Landtag. However, I do not believe that the CDU should speak of an absolute majority. We did not achieve it in 1990, when conditions were quite extraordinary. Achieving it in 1994 is not realistic. It is our goal to become the strongest party. I would like to continue the coalition with the FDP. The FDP wants that, too. [FOCUS] No grand coalition? [Vogel] I do not want that, in particular because it would result in a weak opposition. [FOCUS] The Thuringian Landtag elections take place at the same time as the Bundestag elections, on 16 October. Are you not afraid of the negative effect that Kohl might have? [Vogel] One cannot avoid the Bundestag election and its influence by holding elections 14 days before or 14 days later. The decisive thing for me is that the turnout at Bundestag elections is, on average, 10 percent higher than at Landtag elections. This means, we will have a smaller proportion of left-wing extremists and right-wing extremists. After all, they go to the ballots in every kind of weather. And regarding the alleged negative effect that Kohl might have: I have known Helmut Kohl since 1954. Ever since then I have heard similar things at certain intervals. For that he has been ruling for a relatively long time! There is no reason to hide Helmut Kohl. [FOCUS] Does one have to pursue a different election campaign in the east than in the west? [Vogel] This must not and will not be done. But the new laender must recognize themselves. Because there is hardly anything that annoys me more than when texts are formulated or plans are made with a patronizing attitude without us. [FOCUS] How does the CDU want to overcome the negative trend? [Vogel] By concentrating on just a few topics, such as economy, work, and internal security as well as credibility, because the disenchantment with politics has an essential place in the manifold lack of credibility. It is also necessary to listen more and to provide more political leadership. Anyone who always runs behind the voters just sees them from behind.
