FR941004-1-00026 FR941004-1-00005 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD13&hyph;93&hyph;031] RIN 2115&hyph;AE47 Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Columbia River, OR and WA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing an amendment to the drawbridge regulations governing the operation of the twin Interstate 5 drawbridges across the Columbia River, mile 106.5, between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. The original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed an extension of the morning and afternoon time periods when the draw need not open for the passage of vessels without regard to vessel type or river flow condition. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking proposes an amendment which would provide for relatively uninterrupted vehicular flow during peak traffic times while being less restrictive to commercial navigation during periods of high river flow conditions. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Thirteenth Coast Guard District, 915 Second Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98174&hyph;1067. The comments and other materials referenced in this notice will be available for inspection and copying at 915 Second Avenue, Room 3410, Seattle, Washington. Normal office hours are between 7:45 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Comments may also be hand-delivered to this address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John E. Mikesell, Chief, Bridge Section, Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, (Telephone: (206) 220&hyph;7272). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments, data, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge, and give reasons for concurrence with, or any recommended changes in, the proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgment that their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of final action on this proposal. The proposed regulations may be changed in light of comments received. Drafting Information The principle persons involved in drafting this notice are John E. Mikesell, project manager, and Lieutenant Laticia J. Argenti, project attorney. Background and Purpose The twin Interstate 5 vertical lift bridges across the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver are required to open on signal, except that from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday except Federal holidays the draws need not open. These closed periods are necessary to accommodate peak morning and afternoon vehicular commute traffic across the bridges. Both bridges also provide alternate mid-level fixed spans which provide greater vertical clearance than do the drawspans in the closed position. The alternate fixed spans are routinely used by tug and barge traffic except at higher water surface elevations. Because the number of vehicles crossing the interstate bridges has increased dramatically, particularly during commute times, any opening in close proximity, before or after, results in unacceptable vehicular traffic delays. Therefore, Oregon State Department of Transportation (ORDOT) has requested an extension of the weekday closed periods. On November 26, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (58 FR 62302). In addition, the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District also published the proposal in a Public Notice dated December 14, 1993. Both notices advised the public that the Coast Guard was considering a proposal to extend the morning and afternoon time periods during which the draw need not open for the passage of vessels. The morning period would be changed to 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and the afternoon period would be changed to 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. The Coast Guard received five comments in response to its public notice and no comments to its Federal Register notice. One commenter, a federal resource agency which routinely responds to our public notices did not take a position in favor or against the proposed amendment. Two commenters representing land transportation interests favored the proposal. Two commenters representing commercial navigation interests stated opposition to the proposal unless it was modified to provide the following: (1) When the vertical clearance under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is less than 52 feet (river gauge 6.0 feet or more), the closed periods remain as existing. (2) When the vertical clearance under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is greater than 52 feet (river gauge 5.9 feet or less), the proposed closed periods would be in effect. Note: The referenced wide fixed span is the span between the vertical lift span and the designated alternate channel fixed span. Following further investigation by the Coast Guard it was determined that because vertical clearances of less than 52 feet under the center of the wide fixed span occur only during spring run off or other infrequent flood conditions, the requested change was reasonable for commercial navigation. We have incorporated it in this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held.
