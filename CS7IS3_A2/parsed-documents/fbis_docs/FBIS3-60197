She said in the high-level meeting of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force at her house that the major drug smugglers will be arrested at any cost and political pressure of any kind will not be accepted. As for cultivating, use, and smuggling of narcotics in our country, it is still on the rise. The situation is so serious that this trade is regularly protected by some circles in our country. Some members of the law enforcement agencies are also allegedly involved in it. Now they discuss political patronage for this trade openly. The U.S. government went as far as to say that some persons in the legislature are also involved in this trade. The drug trade, in addition to increasing the number of drug abusers, has also given the United States and Western nations an opportunity to denounce Pakistan. Our economic aid was also stopped because of this. There is no doubt that the "drug Mafia" in Pakistan has become very powerful during the last few years, and it has the blessings of the administration, law enforcement agencies, and politicians. The drug trade within the country is carried out under the supervision of this Mafia. Despite the efforts of government law enforcement agencies, heroin factories in tribal areas still have not been destroyed. The drugs smuggled from Afghanistan are available in addition to it. Although the Saudi government has sentenced some Pakistanis to death recently and also has given Pakistan a list of smugglers, the big fish of the Mafia has not been apprehended. The efforts to control this Mafia started during General Ziaul Haq's time, however, only minor dealers were arrested. This determination was announced by the governments that followed Zia, however, the drug Mafia was never really affected. During the caretaker government, names of some of the big fish were published, and a series of raids were started. Some of them were arrested, however, those who control this trade, and whom the Pakistani agencies know well, were not arrested. It is clear from the record that the efforts to catch the big fish or the drug lords have been nothing more than slogans. Now Madam Bhutto's government has made this announcement all over again. We expect that some serious work will be done and the proposed operation is not just paperwork.
