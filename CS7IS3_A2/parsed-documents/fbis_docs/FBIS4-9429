[Moravcik] We are going to continue the political style we have decided to adopt. This means to search for constructive solutions to the problems and to try to reach consensus with a wide spectrum of political parties. The existence of all our government is based on this principle. Some of the circles on the domestic scene, however, would like to hear declarations oriented toward the radicalization of the events. In my opinion, there is only one way: not to react to nonsense. Regarding foreign countries, we are going to search for friends there. We are not going to invent enemies. [Minarik] Slovakia is once again at a crossroads. What direction is it going to follow? [Moravcik] We said it, in no uncertain terms, in our policy statement. We are going to try to integrate ourselves in traditional European economic, political, and security structures. Regarding the attitude toward the state, we want to renew the trust of the people in state institutions and to increase people's feeling of security. This will not be easy. We have recorded an obvious increase in the crime rate. We are not likely to be able to eliminate this trend, but we would like to improve the number of solved cases. We are interested in an efficient functioning of our administration, which is to serve the people. We also want to stress the importance of individual initiative not only in the economic sphere, but also in the social one. This means that we are considering giving the nonstate organizations, including various foundations, room for activity in the social sphere. We are also going to push for a bill on conflicts of interest. [Minarik] Last week, parliament approved the policy statement, but the new Cabinet does not have enough time left. What should you concentrate on? [Moravcik] In the economy, we have to concentrate on budgetary discipline. We are going to try to solve, in a more consistent manner, the insolvency of our enterprises, which is a drawn-out problem of our economy. We believe privatization is very important. In its policy statement, the government has unequivocally indicated that it has the political will to prepare the second wave of coupon privatization, so that it might take place immediately after the elections in the fall. We want denationalization to become part of our overall economic strategy. [Minarik] Are you aware of the risks your government is taking on? [Moravcik] A government cabinet that has a limited time span for its existence, such as our Cabinet, cannot ignore risks. However, there are also some advantages. That is, the government is forced to adopt very tough attitudes toward fulfilling its tasks. I have the impression that we will be able to solve certain long-term problems, particularly in the economy. We will have to intervene in the tax system in a way that will affect taxpayers. Certain spending from the budget will have to be reduced, which also is a risk factor. [Minarik] Are you not afraid that such steps will have a negative impact on your further political career? [Moravcik] That is irrelevant. [Minarik] Former Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] members who were in the government before are now acting as a shadow cabinet. How do you view their activity and their declaration that you are a government of broad corruption and trained poodles? [Moravcik] We are carefully watching everything the opposition is saying about us, including the shadow cabinet. We are going to try to find something positive, if possible, that could help solve some of our problems. Anyway, from this viewpoint, the opposition is always important because, if they are efficient and constructive, they should point to certain aspects that the government cannot see. Unfortunately, we have not discovered stimuli in the declarations of Meciar's shadow cabinet that would make us change our attitude. [Minarik] How is the right-left government of the center managing to govern? On what basis do you reach consensus? [Moravcik] I will be sincere: In the course of the discussions at the government meetings, it is difficult to tell who is the left wing and who the right. The coalition has the advantage that it can concentrate fully on solving problems. There has never been a confrontation of the left- and right-wing concepts. Of course, it is more difficult to reach consensus when there are more entities involved. No stumbling blocks have appeared yet, however. [Minarik] What chances do you give to your Cabinet after the elections in the fall? [Moravcik] We are building on the fact that we are going to convince the electorate that our viewpoint and our policy represent an alternative for Slovakia, which alternative is acceptable to the majority or them. Otherwise, we would hardly be able to manage all our problems. I believe that this Cabinet has a chance to function even after the elections. [Minarik] Many people in Slovakia are balancing on the edge of the sustenance level. They are ill-behaved voters because they want an immediate solution. [Moravcik] We want to make the transformation process as socially acceptable as possible. This will be very demanding, but we must do everything not to increase the number of people living below the subsistence level. I admit, however, that this is one of the most important problems this government has to solve. [Minarik] You are one of the people who knew Vladimir Meciar well. Is his position in Slovak politics being demonized? [Moravcik] Maybe it is. To tell the truth, I do not have time to think about it too much. I believe that a positive program can become an alternative [for Slovakia]. If a certain part of society--we will try to make this part as large as possible--realizes that there are several alternatives and possibilities and that there are different political entities that can efficiently execute their powers, is it possible that the public will positively appreciate such personalities? [Minarik] Your predecessors from Meciar's cabinet have not properly handed over their offices to the members of your government. We have even heard about empty shelves in certain ministries. How have you solved this problem? [Moravcik] Several weeks have elapsed since then. All this is rather grotesque. No unsurmountable obstacles have arisen as a consequence of this. [Minarik] Why did the HZDS have difficulties governing in Slovakia? [Moravcik] I did not think about it in any specific way. If we wanted to point to the core of the problem, we would speak about something the public has already forgotten and what I pointed to when I was expelled from the HZDS. They have adopted two attitudes in politics. The first is exclusivity. Only the HZDS is able to govern in Slovakia. The second is the confrontational character of their politics. I believe that, if the HZDS does not change its policy in both points, it may be led to the fringe of the political scene and become an extremist party.
