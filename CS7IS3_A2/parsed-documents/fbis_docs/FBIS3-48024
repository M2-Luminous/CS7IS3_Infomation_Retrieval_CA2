In another of his strong speech criticising the international community over the plight of the Bosnians, the prime minister said UN had not only put its integrity in question but also the sincerity of the so-proclaimed champions of human rights. At a function where he received a standing ovation from a group of Bosnians now taking shelter in Malaysia, he also expressed his sadness that the international community had chosen to stand by and watch the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina continued to face the merciless aggression of the Serbs. If we accept what is happening to the Bosnians now as legitimate and right, then our civilisation is coming to an end, he said when launching the books Voices of Malaysia, Suara Keperihatinan Malaysia and Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As Told By Survivors here Thursday. At the ceremony, attended by corporate leaders, senior government officers and politicians, more than RM1 million [Malaysian currency] was collected for the Bosnian fund which Dr Mahathir said, proved that they were still humans, symphathising for the Bosnians. In criticising the UN, Dr Mahathir said it was clear that it was the United Nations that was holding down the Bosnians with its policies of arms embargo over Bosnia-Herzegovina, over protecting the UN troops and failing to apply pressure against Serbia. The embargo had left the Bosnian Muslims defenceless against the Serbs, he said, adding that it was apparent that the Western powers did not want their soldiers even to get hurt, and not to mentiom killed and that they did nothing to protect the Bosnians Muslims. What good are they called soldiers. We might as well call the civilians or small children to do their jobs, he said. Prominent social worker Dr Alijah Gordon, who edited the book Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As Told By Survivors, criticised UNESCO for failing to protect priceless manuscripts in Sarajevo from being destroyed by the Serbs.
