FR940817-2-00116 FR940817-2-00064 [CA&hyph;060&hyph;5440&hyph;10 B021] Availability of Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for Rail-Cycle Bolo Station Landfill, San Bernardino County AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that a joint final Environmental Impact Report/Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) has been prepared by the Bureau of Land Management and the County of San Bernardino for the proposed Bolo Station Class III landfill. The proposed Federal action comprises a land exchange involving 2.5 sections of public land, 2 rights-of-ways for access and utilities, and a plan amendment to the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA) Plan. DATES: Written comments will be accepted if received on or before September 12, 1994, and comments received after that date may not be considered in the Record of Decision. The address for written comments is given below. ADDRESSES: Bureau of Land Management, California Desert District Office, Attn: Rail-Cycle, 6221 Box Springs Blvd., Riverside, CA 92507. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas Romoli, (909) 697&hyph;5237. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed land exchange involves 2.5 sections of public land of which 1.5 sections are designated Multiple Use Class L (Limited Use) under the CDCA Plan. The proposed use as landfill is not consistent with the guidelines for Class L, and the proposed amendment would designate the 1.5 sections as Class M (Moderate Use). The guidelines for Class M allow disposal of public lands for potential landfill purposes. The proposed 3 sections of private land to be acquired contain tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, recreational value and land in the proposed East Mojave National Park. The proposed landfill site is located between Amboy and Cadiz, south of Highway 66 and about 35 miles northeast of the City of Twentynine Palms. The proposed landfill consists of 4800 acres of which 2100 acres would be used for the landfill. Solid waste would be sorted and processed for recyclables at a Materials Recovery Facility in Southern California. The residue would be packed into containers and transported by train to the Bolo Station site. At full operation, approximately 21,000 tons per day of solid waste would be transported, and the facility would be operated between 60-years and 100-years. Besides the proposed action, two alternatives and a no-action alternative are analyzed. The EIR/EIS analyzes the affects of the proposed action on such environmental issues as ground water, air quality, geology, visual resources and wildlife among other resources. Copies of the Final EIR/EIS are located in the California Desert District Office, Riverside, California and in the Needles Resource Area Office, 101 W. Spikes Rd., Needles, CA. Dated: August 8, 1994.
