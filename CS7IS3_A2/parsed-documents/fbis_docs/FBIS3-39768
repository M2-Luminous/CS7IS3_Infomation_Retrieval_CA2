Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert today reiterated support for the Government on national issues. Our correspondent Fotis Kafarakis has the following report: [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] Despite the pressure being exercised by various sides, the Government's decision to place an economic blockade on Skopje remains firm. Moreover, it is not ruled out that new measures will be imposed if the leaders of the neighboring statelet continue to reject the three Greek conditions for resumption of the dialogue under UN auspices. New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert made a statement in Preveza reiterating that Greece does not accept threats. Hands off hellenism and respect for Greece was the message that Mr. Evert sent in all directions. Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, speaking in Iraklion, talked about the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government following a different national strategy on the Skopje issue than past governments. [Tsokhatzopoulos] It struggles to change things, it struggles to succeed where others accepted conciliation and betrayal in the past. [Kafarakis] The Greek measures against Skopje will be discussed at the European Union's council on general affairs in Brussels on Monday. Our 11 partners will examine if these measures are compatible with Greece's obligations to the European Union. This question was raised yesterday during the visit to Athens of both German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. For his part, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras, who is visiting northern Greece, said that our partners should not demand we revoke the measures but should revoke their recognition of Skopje. Finally, it is noted that the measures against Skopje are being applied in an absolutely satisfactory manner, as Deputy Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos has said. [end recording]
