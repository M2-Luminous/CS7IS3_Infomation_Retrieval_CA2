FR940328-2-00094 FR940328-2-00053 Applicants' Conditions Applications agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same protrfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee or a shareholder services plan (e.g., Class B and Class A shares may pay different rule 12b&hyph;1 service fees and/or rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fees); (c) different Class Expenses for each class of shares, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer Agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation, tax liens or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan, except as provided in condition 15 below; (e) different exchange privileges; and (f) the conversion feature applicable to certain classes of shares. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class arrangement, prior to the implementation of the multi-class arrangement by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed multi-class arrangement is in the best interest of both the Fund and their respective shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own expense will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. If any class will be subject to a shareholder services plan, the shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 6. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution or shareholder servicing expenditures properly attributable to the sale of servicing of one class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or shareholder servicing fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the directors to support any fees charged to shareholders of that class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Class Expenses and costs and distribution fees associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and shareholder services plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each respective class.
