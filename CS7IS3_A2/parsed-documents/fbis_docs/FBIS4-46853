Kalinicheva: "Only Mountain Summits Are More Abrupt Than the Head of the City of Moscow"] [Text] A. Chubays Versus Yu. Luzhkov A modest press conference held by Anatoliy Chubays took place on Friday evening, 27 May, and was devoted to his differences with Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, concerning privatization. By the way, that press conference extended clearly beyond the framework of that issue. The discussion concerned the fact that a new comet with a tail appeared in the Russian firmament and it is impossible to know what to expect of it. Chubays characterized the actions of the mayor of Moscow as a game not played by the rules. The chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of State Property declared that also in the past the well-financed propaganda shows of the Moscow city chief, aimed against progressive market reforms, appeared indecent for a man declaring himself to be a fervent supporter of the president. Now the situation has gone completely out of control and is becoming catastrophic. Chubays directed the attention of the journalists to the fact that every new step by the president and the government aimed at deepening the reforms met with opposition from the mayor of Moscow. The glory of a hero of the October events and defender of democracy apparently introduced new colors in the bright image of Luzhkov and granted him new rights. Luzhkov believes that he has the right to correct laws, presidential edicts, and government decrees. In that manner he essentially halted the privatization of real property in Moscow, and blocked the inclusion of land in the overall privatization program. With a slight time shift after the presidential edicts Yuriy Luzhkov proclaimed his decisions, which totally negated presidential decisions. The latest example of Luzhkov's independence is the antiprivatization constitution, as Chubays called the Moscow privatization program, and stressed that it is merely a selection of unparalleled opportunities for arbitrary action by officials in the capital. That was how Chubays put it and one cannot deny him his eloquence. Luzhkov, however, is no fool either. His actions it would appear have an economic underpinning as well. For example he announced that he could obtain one trillion rubles from Moscow privatization, while the entire privatization campaign itself, according to estimates by the Committee for the Administration of State Property, is expected to yield a revenue of one trillion rubles for the treasury. Moreover, Moscow authorities reached the conclusion that privatized enterprises have economic indices inferior to those of state enterprises. Studies by sociologists hired by Luzhkov's people indicated that only six out of a 1,000 directors of privatized enterprises can perform the functions that were formerly handled by the ministries. Luzhkov plans close alliances with producers. The alliance with ZIL, with AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant], and with other Moscow giants can serve as an example of that. Chubays rejected these assertions at the press conference. Results of market research conducted by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property indicated that the overall investment demand in the country comes to 2.6 trillion [currency not specified]. Half of these funds will go to the already privatized enterprises. Only 15-20 percent will go into the federal budget. Society, yet another time, can see that figures argue with each other just like people do. They are prejudiced and, unfortunately, cannot serve as criteria of the truth. Against the overall behavioral background of the city chief, the fact that Luzhkov simply prohibited the registration of joint-stock companies in Moscow appears to be a minor matter. By April the Moscow State Committee for the Administration of State Property blocked the privatization of all state property within their jurisdiction. Privatization in Moscow is carried out only with the permission of federal authorities. Luzhkov received good support from the Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management and an extensive Moscow officialdom that certainly does not wish to live under rules written by another hand. The power of Moscow officialdom is greater than the power of law. According to Anatoliy Chubays a social explosion may occur in Moscow, the responsibility for which will rest squarely on the conscience of Yuriy Luzhkov. By the way, Anatoliy Chubays did not limit himself to the press conference, but also wrote a letter to Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and to President Yeltsin describing his position with regard to Luzhkov. According to Chubays the letter to the premier was well received and Luzhkov was given three days to make corrections. Chubays, however, according to his statement, also sent a letter to the procurator general of the Russian Federation demanding that order be established and lawlessness eliminated in Moscow.
