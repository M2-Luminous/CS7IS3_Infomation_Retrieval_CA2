At about this time last year, information was circulating in political circles to the effect that Dumitru Cristea was trying to make contact with various opposition leaders -- and not only them -- to point out to them that he might be a good SRI director, better than Virgil Magureanu. Had they accepted the suggestion, it would have provoked a scandal following the discussions on the SRI report in the parliament and they would have had to vote against Virgil Magureanu's confirmation in the position. Cristea even met with some of those opposition leaders, while others avoided any contact with him, seeing it as a trap, and did not wish to get involved in private, internal SRI scandals. In those days there were even rumors about how Virgil Magureanu had dismissed Dumitru Cristea. However, this did not happen because Cristea fought hard for his position. Slowly, slowly, after having been confirmed in his position, the SRI director removed from their positions those people who were supporting his deputy. General Gheorghe Diaconescu, the head of the counterespionage service, was one of them, and now even Cristea's turn has come. Sources close to the SRI director affirm that Gheorghe Diaconescu was not removed from office because he was involved in the Pancea affair but simply because he was an incompetent person and a hard drinker. As far as Dumitru Cristea is concerned, the same source affirms that he was also involved in leaking information to a known extremist magazine. According to our source, published texts in that magazine that were signed Al.I. Manescu, were edited by somebody who is a professional in the field of information, namely, former General Neagu Cosma. For a while he was putting out the magazine "Espionage-Counterespionage," which he was writing almost entirely alone, and whose style very much resembled the aforementioned items in the extremist magazine.
