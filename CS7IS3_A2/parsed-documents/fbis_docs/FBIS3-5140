The number of National Unification Board-approved applications for contacts with North Koreans almost doubled from 14 in January to 27 last month, according to the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry. The increase was particularly conspicuous in the week starting Feb. 18, with 11 applications filed, indicating that the North's acceptance of IAEA inspections has raised southern businessmen's expectations on improved inter-Korean ties, including better business relations. Of the 27 applications approved in February, 17 concerned forming trade relations with North Korean businesses and the remaining 10 covered investment in joint ventures with North Korean partners. Of the 11 applications approved after Feb. 16, however, only two were for establishing trade relations and nine for investment in joint ventures. An application filed by the Hanhwa Group in the names of five group executives, including chairman Song Nak-chung of Kyong-in Energy, after North Korea's inspection decision covered joint-venture investment in constructing oil storage facilities and petrochemical factories along the west coast of North Korea. Hyosong Corp. applied to contact a North Korean firm on setting up a joint-venture knitwear factory, while Cheil Food & Chemicals sought a joint-venture food processing factory. Of the 233 applications filed last year, only three were turned down, ministry officials said. Total applications this year will more than double the number filed last year, they added.
