On the same day, three of the 1989 pro-democracy movement leaders, including Wang Dan [3769 0030] and Zhou Duo [0719 5305], suddenly left Beijing and their current whereabouts remain unknown. Before the departure of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher from the United States, U.S. officials had hinted that he would possibly meet Chinese dissidents during his visit, despite the fact that during his journey he had openly stated that he would not meet dissidents. The fact that the Chinese public security authorities took action against dissidents yesterday shows that the authorities are not "taking any risks." According to some foreign reports, it is not known whether or not the departure of Wang Dan and others from Beijing is by design of the authorities. However, their choice to leave Beijing before Christopher officially began his visit might avoid becoming entangled with the public securities authorities which would most likely happen. Surprisingly, a foreign dispatch quoted Wang Dan and others calling on the U.S. Government to continue to prolong MFN status for China, before they left Beijing. Wang Fuchen is the fifteenth dissident that has been detained over the past week whereas Yang Zhou has been detained twice over the past weeks. According to Wang Fuchen's family, when he returned home yesterday morning, he was immediately taken away by some public security men: "They said they were taking Wang to stay in a guest house for several days." The 39-year-old Wang Fuchen, an individual household, was given a sentence of 3-year imprisonment for participating in the 1978 Democracy Wall Campaign. He is currently secretary-general of the Shanghai Human Rights Association. Yang Zhou, one of the signatories of the "Peace Charter," had talked about Wang Fuchen being detained with this reporter over the phone before he himself was apprehended, saying: "They hold Wan Fuchen in custody as a warning sign. If Wang was lucky, he would be detained for 24 hours; otherwise, they might detain him till after the conclusion of the NPC." Shortly after, he was taken away from his home by a public security man. Yang Zhou's wife said that the public security man did not provide an explanation on why he took Yang away, nor did he disclose when Yang would be released. As to the three pro-democracy movement figures who left Beijing, they are: Wang Dan, the student leader of the 1989 student movement who sent the NPC and CPPCC an open letter only two days before; Zhou Duo, one of the last batch to withdraw from Tiananmen during the 4 June incident; and Min Qi [7044 3823], a scholar. This reporter phoned Wang Dan's family yesterday evening to inquire after him. His mother said that she knew nothing about Wang Dan's departure from Beijing; Wang Dan had "left home" when his family members were all at work and he had not said goodbye to his family, nor had he made any telephone calls. They learned about his departure through one of his friends who was with Wang Dan. According to his mother, Wang Dan had left home without saying goodbye and she was worried about it. However, she reckoned that Wang Dan would make contact with the family in a few days time. According to his cousin, Wang Dan suddenly decided to leave Beijing by taking a train heading south yesterday morning. Accompanying him were two of his friends, Zhou Duo and Min Qi. His cousin said that Wang Dan left Beijing at around 0900 and that Wang did not explain anything to him because Wang was in a hurry; However, Wang did say that he would return to Beijing after a week or so. His cousin was worried as to whether or not he would be able to return to Beijing a week later. A foreign dispatch quoted Zhou Duo: "In view of the present situation, we are leaving Beijing for a few days on our own. We strongly appeal to the U.S. Government to continue to grant China MFN status." It is still hard to tell whether or not the departure of the three was genuinely voluntary. Earlier, the public security authorities demanded that Wang Dan leave Beijing but he refused. However, within 10 days, Wang Dan has already been detained twice fro a short time for interrogation and the public security men had warned him to end all his political activities or else he would face heavy penalties.
