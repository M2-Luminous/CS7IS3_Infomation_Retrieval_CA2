The NATO's ultimatum late Wednesday gave the Bosinan Serbs 10 days beginning 24:00 GMT Thursday to remove their heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo, saying if they fail to comply with the deadline, their heavy weapons will "be subjected to NATO air strikes." In a statement, the NATO also called upon the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, within the same period, to place the heavy weapons in its possession within the Sarajevo exclusion zone under the control of U.N. protection forces, and to refrain from attacks launched from within the current confrontation lines in the city. The statement said the Bosnian Serbs bear the main responsibility for the tragic loss of civilian life that results from their siege of Sarajevo. The ultimatum was given after a mortar shelling on a market in Sarajevo killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 others last Saturday. The carnage led to renewed calls for NATO air strikes against Bosinan Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner immediately informed U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the decision made at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors. Despite Serb denials of responsibility for the attack on the market, Woerner told reporters earlier: "It's time for action. We have had enough of words." Following the NATO ultimatum, Woerner said there would be a swift allied response if the threat of air strikes against Serbs brought retaliation against U.N. forces and other personnel in Bosnia. "If there would be an attack on U.N. personnel, then we would respond firmly, rapidly and ... decisively. We will do everything possible," Woerner told a news conference after the NATO meeting. President Bill Clinton of the United States, which is an important NATO member, warned Bosinan Serbs on Wednesday that the ultimatum for the removal of Serb artillery within 21 kilometers of Sarajevo was no idle threat. "NATO is now set to act, " he said. The United States would participate if NATO launched air strikes, he said at a White House news conference, but he assured the American public that the United States would not be drawn into any major combat role in ex-Yugoslavia. Casting the Bosnian conflict mainly as a European issue, Clinton said American involvement would be "proportionate to our interests - no more, no less." "We have made it quite clear that this will not involve American ground forces," he added. Under the threat of Western air strikes, Bosinan Serbs on Wednesday agreed to a Sarajevo truce under the mediation of U.N.representatives and pledged to pull back their artillery from around Sarajevo and put the heavy guns under U.N. monitoring. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned against any air raids, saying, "We will shoot down every plane we can" if attacked. "In case of an attack, we cannot guarantee safety to any foreigner who finds himself on our territory, " he said. In its statement, the NATO also stressed its commitment to securing a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian crisis, saying the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a step toward the placing of Sarajevo under U.N. administration.
