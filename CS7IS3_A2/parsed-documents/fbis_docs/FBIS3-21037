Grotelueschen: "Parallel Computers Extrapolating Themselves"] [Text] Alternative to Conventional Computer Technologies. Output Can Be Flexibly Adapted to Particular Task. Technologies of the 21st century. VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 17 Dec 93. Parallel computers have crossed the threshold from research stage to industrial utilization. With the help of this key technology, users want to solve a series of problems that until now had been reserved for the considerably more expensive high-performance computers. "If technical progress in car making had been as speedy as in the computer field, then you could buy an S-class limousine for DM5, including air conditioning, car phone, and air bag." This is how Dr. Andreas vom Hemdt, business manager of the Center for Industrial Uses of Massive Parallelity (Ziam, Herzogenrath), described the tremendous jumps that occurred in the price/output ratio. What does the future of the high-performance computer look like? Do we need any more improvements in the output? "It seems as there are no limits to what people want the computer makers to come up with," commented vom Hemdt. This is because, when it comes to the "great challenges," such as nuclear physics, the genome project, or improved weather forecasts, basic researchers demand more and more computer power. And users from all fields of activity, such as engineers, physicians, car makers, aircraft makers, or city planners right now need computer output in the 200-GFlops class, in other words, 200 x 10[.sup]9[/] floating-point operations per second. The Ziam boss is convinced that the required high and also payable computer output cannot be attained by the next decade with conventional computer technology. Nevertheless, he argues, the limit of the output in the conventional sequential computer era is in sight in spite of all of the progress that has been made at work stations and supercomputers. Only a few powers of ten today separate processor technology from the final physical barrier of the speed of light when it comes to signal transport. Besides, the financial border has long been crossed: Very few university computer centers and big corporations could afford supercomputers with a price tag of DM20 million and more. Parallel computers are increasingly replacing the traditional vectorial high-performance computers and, according to vom Hemdt "will become the industrial key technology in the coming years." Massive parallel computers with hundreds and thousands of processors can adapt their computation output to the particular problem because the number of processors can be increased theoretically without limit. This extreme scalability and the resultant good price/output ratio open up new fields of employment and opportunities on the market as did personal computers 15 years ago. Many hardware makers are preparing products for the new basic technology of parallel processing and more and more conventional user programs are ready for industrial employment. For example, the big system maker Sentec Software, Hilden, which specializes in parallel computer technology, developed an image processing unit that ensures constant quality in filling beer bottles. Figuring on an output rate of 80,000 bottles per hour, it may well happen that bottles are equipped with tops and labels of the preceding beverage, particularly after a switch to a different beverage type. High-speed image processing recognizes such errors in real time and causes a claw to remove these bottles from the flow of material. Sentec emphasizes the quick ability to learn and the manifold employment possibilities. Project manager Peter Plapper noted that, when it comes to starting the system up, the sample of the objects to be investigated could be learned "in a simple teach-in step." Since the system generally recognizes writing and geometries, it is also useful for quick analyses in the textile industry, precision mechanics, or testing technique. Another example is a process developed by Condat GmbH, Fernhag, that can be used to simulate the dynamic failure of composite materials under shock and other stresses. In the auto industry, for example, one can use this method to analyze the elastic behavior of high-strength fiber materials and the gradual transition between intact and destroyed material. A neuronal software sees to it that one of the fastest ZIP code number conversions in Germany can be successfully accomplished on a parallel computer, that is, the Parsytec-GC with 1,024 processors. In May 1993, around 4.4 million customer data of the Company for Payment Systems, Frankfurt/Main, were updated within a few hours during this spectacular demonstration. Ziam business manager vom Hemdt is convinced that "new high technologies, such as massive parallel processing (MPP) cannot be used in research and development in the context of international competition without government subsidies." For the "Real World Computing" Project--in whose context MPP is being promoted--Japan spends DM2.2 billion, while in the United States, the government in 1993 is funneling DM1.3 billion in as direct government subsidies, and the growth rate keeps going up. In addition, American MPP makers reportedly are getting massive support as a result of the procurement policy pursued by public research institutions and the military establishment. When an English Meiko parallel computer was ordered by Lawrence Livermore Lab, there was a massive wave of protests in the United States; or when Parsytec of Germany wanted to deliver machines to the universities of Chicago and Moscow, the United States Administration slowed the European competition down with CoCom blockades dating back to the time of the Cold War. Vom Hemdt mentioned other negative examples: One of the biggest German industrial enterprises referred to as "Bank With Electronic Workshop," is combining job positions and instead sells supercomputers from Kendall Square or Fujitsu under the trademark Siemens to German universities in Munich or Aachen. Thinking Machines installed its computers in Wuppertal or St. Augustin; Intel hits the competition from Aachen with a machine delivered to the Juelich research facility. As a result of this procurement policy pursued by German and partly also European institutions, taxpayers are bound to find themselves in the rather odd situation of subsidizing American computer makers and promoting the development of the next American computer generation. On the other hand, it is charged, European supercomputer makers depend on direct subsidies for development. The research policy pursued in the EC, in the Federal Republic, and in North Rhine-Westphalia reportedly took these needs into account by means of programs and specific individual measures, for example, by means of Cardinal Point 3.1 in Esprit III, the Suprenum Project, which is worth mentioning in spite of commercial disaster, or the North Rhine-Westphalia initiative entitled Parallel Data Processing. Parallel Computers Parallel computers attain their high computer output, which can exceed the output of conventional supercomputers, by allowing a number of microprocessors to work together. Theoretically, the number is unlimited; starting as of 100 microcomputers, experts speak in terms of "Massively Parallel Processing" (MPP systems). To be sure, each individual chip is much slower than the very core of a conventional supercomputer, but their large number more than makes up for this. The mostly simple microprocessors can be produced in vast numbers and make parallel computers much more cost-efficient than conventional supercomputers that, in their simple version, already cost about DM0.5 million.
