Some 1,106 cases of the total involved mainland residents and the other 255 were foreigners and foreign citizens of Chinese origin, said the official at a seminar here today on China's AIDS prevention. Despite the fact that China is one of the regions in the world with a relatively low rate of AIDS-virus infection, the Chinese Government has paid close attention to the issue, Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, told the seminar. He said that China has intensified its efforts to prevent and curb AIDS, citing that in recent years the country has done a great deal in monitoring, educating on and researching into the disease. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has fruitfully cooperated in this area with the United Nations Development Program and the World Health Organization, Chen said. China will keep to the principle of "prevention first" in its endeavors to curb AIDS and will actively advocate coordination and cooperation among relevant departments, the minister noted. It will also encourage the participation of the whole nation in the struggle against AIDS. He said China will launch a publicity campaign on preventing and curbing AIDS so as to make people more knowledgeable about AIDS, which in turn is expected to help them avoid unhealthy behavior and boost their capacity of self-protection. Official sources said that China is to draft medium and long-term plans on the prevention of AIDS as well as to step up the legislation of necessary laws so as to standardize the work and ensure the full implementation of measures designed to curb AIDS.
