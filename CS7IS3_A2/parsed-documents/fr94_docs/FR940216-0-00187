(C) During Phase I, the ``edge target'' fuel shall be identical to the target fuel for all fuel parameters, with the following exceptions: (1) If the E200 level of the target fuel is less than 33 volume percent, then the E200 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 33 volume percent. (2) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 18 volume percent, then the ARO value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 18 volume percent. (3) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is greater than 46 volume percent, then the ARO value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 46 volume percent. (4) If the E300 level of the target fuel is less than 72 volume percent, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 72 volume percent. (5) If the E300 level of the target fuel is greater than 95 volume percent, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 95 volume percent. (6) If [80.32+(0.390×ARO)] exceeds 94 for the target fuel, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 94 volume percent. (7) If the E200 level of the target fuel is less than 33 volume percent, then D E200 shall be set equal to (E200^ 33 volume percent). (8) If the E200 level of the target fuel equals or exceeds 33 volume percent, then D E200 shall be set equal to zero. (9) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 18 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to (ARO^18 volume percent). If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 10 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to 8 volume percent. (10) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is greater than 46 volume percent, then D ARO shall be set equal to (ARO^46 volume percent). (11) If neither of the conditions established in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(C) (8) and (9) of this section are met, then D ARO shall be set equal to zero. (12) If the E300 level of the target fuel is less than 72 volume percent, then E300 shall be set equal to (E300^ 72 volume percent). (13) If the E300 level of the target fuel is less than 94 volume percent and [80.32+(0.390×ARO)] also is greater than 94, then D E300 shall be set equal to (E300^94 volume percent). If the E300 level of the target fuel is greater than 95 volume percent and [80.32+(0.390×ARO)] also is greater than 94, then D E300 shall be set equal to 1 volume percent. (14) If neither of the conditions established in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(C) (11) and (12) of this section are met, then D E300 shall be set equal to zero. (D) During Phase II, the ``edge target'' fuel is identical to the target fuel for all fuel parameters, with the following exceptions: (1) If the E200 level of the target fuel is less than 33 volume percent, then the E200 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 33 volume percent. (2) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is less than 18 volume percent, then the ARO value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 18 volume percent. (3) If the aromatics level of the target fuel is greater than 46 volume percent, then the ARO value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 46 volume percent. (4) If the E300 level of the target fuel is less than 72 volume percent, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 72 volume percent. (5) If the E300 level of the target fuel is greater than 95 volume percent, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 95 volume percent. (6) If [79.75+(0.385×ARO)] exceeds 94 for the target fuel, then the E300 value for the ``edge target'' fuel shall be set equal to 94 volume percent.
