He was speaking to about 12,000 people attending an ANC rally at Bisho Stadium, site of the 1992 massacre of 28 ANC supporters by Ciskei Defence Force troops. "It is not easy to talk about peace in that situation. In spite of that we want to heal the wounds of the past, we want reconciliation, because without reconciliation we will not be able to give our people a better life." He had spoken to Ciskei military leader Brig Oupa Gqozo several times before the massacre and "literally begged" him to work with the democratic movement. He had also spoken to Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope and was going to speak to the kwaZulu chief minister on Tuesday. The bloodshed and the political and economic uncertainty in the country could not continue. "That is why, with all humility, I am talking to every leader in this country. I will not stand on dignity or prestige or any popularity that might be enjoyed by our organisation. I will go down on my knees to beg those who want to drag our country into bloodshed and to persuade them not to do so." This was why he was going to meet Chief Buthelezi in Durban. "I want him to participate in this election."
