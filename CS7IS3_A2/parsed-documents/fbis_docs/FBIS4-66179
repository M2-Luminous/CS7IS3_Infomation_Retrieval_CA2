FBIS4-66179 "jpcar027___94023" JPRS-CAR-94-027 JPRS China 10 February 1994 REGIONAL SOUTHWEST REGION Work Report of Guizhou Provincial Higher People's Court Work Report of Guizhou Provincial Higher People's Court 94CM0234A Guiyang GUIZHOU RIBAO in Chinese 10 Feb 94 p 2 94CM0234A Guiyang GUIZHOU RIBAO Chinese CSO [Article by Xie Jinhan (6200 6930 3352) titled: "Guizhou Higher People's Court Work Report" -- (January 1, 1994 at Guizhou's Eighth National People's Congress Second Session)] [Text] Fellow delegates: [passage omitted] Now I will report to the People's Congress for approval and examination the overall situation and future views on the work of the courts throughout the province: 1) Strengthening the "harsh crackdown" struggle, and maintaining social stability After ten years of the "harsh crackdown" struggle, Guizhou's public order overall is stable. However, there are many factors influencing the stability of the public order, and major pernicious cases are on the rise, so that in some locales the situation with public order is not good. Throughout the province, courts are conscientiously working to implement the essence of directives from Party central on maintaining social stability, and are gradually strengthening their effect against the enemy dictatorship, and punishing various types of criminals in strict accordance with the law. Over the year as a whole, some 14,109 criminal cases in total were accepted and heard, and 13,903 were tried and settled, while 15,470 criminals were provided with legal services in the course of court decisions. Among these, there were 5964 people who received sentences of more than 5 years in prison, life imprisonment, or the death sentence (including stays of execution), or some 38.55 percent of the total criminals sentenced; 9166 people received sentences of less than 5 years, detained labor, or were placed under surveillance, while 248 people avoided criminal sanction, and 92 people were declared innocent. In the course of launching the "harsh crackdown" struggle, we are stressing the proper handling of the following links: 1) Make the key crackdown points standout, vigorously promote the trying of major cases. Target the crackdown against murderers, robbers, rapists, bombers, hooligans and other serious criminal elements, particularly against the ringleaders of other criminal organizations with a sinister social effect, and against recidivists, and habitual offenders. For this type of case, we must adopt intervention in advance, and after a case is prosecuted, pay close attention to hearing and settling the case, and strictly meting out punishment in accordance with the law. For example, when former Shuigan Public Security Department people's policeman Jiang Qianjun [5592 7816 6511] used a gun to murder someone, this had a great social effect, the danger was great, and the case was followed with great interest by the masses. After the court accepted the case, only nine days were required from the first hearing to the final state of the second hearing, and the approval of the death sentence for him. At the same time as the day-to-day type crackdown work is strengthened, in order to frighten criminal elements, we must build up our prestige, and in an organized and prepared manner launch a four time province wide concentrated attack operation, and concentrated pronouncing of judgements against a group of criminal elements seriously harming the public order. It was only during a pre-National Day unified effort, with the provincial court and nine mid-level courts, 48 county and municipal courts convening a comparatively large-scale meeting for pronouncing judgement, that 119 people guilty of the most heinous crimes were sentenced to death, and for the criminal elements the law did not allow to remain, the swollen arrogance of the criminal elements was attacked. 2) Continue to launch special struggles and stress bringing things under control. In accordance with central and provincial deployment of personnel, various local courts, under the unified leadership of party committees, and closely integrated with public security and procutorial organs, are launching, in line with local conditions, special struggles such as "attacking kidnappers," banning drugs, opposing robberies, and attacking "train bandits," while stressing bringing things under control. Various local courts are strengthening their efforts to bring to trial these types of cases, and accomplishing rapid trying and rapid resolution of cases, concentrated attacks, and on-the-spot pronouncements. The entire province in total has sentenced 1944 criminals who abducted and kidnapped women and children, 163 drug dealers, 5475 thieves, and 1910 robbers. Through such things as explaining the law, printing and distributing notices, disseminating material, etc., they have galvanized the masses to arise and resolutely struggle with criminal elements, and to strengthen vigilance. 3) Increasing the force level of major attacks, ensuring the quality of handling of cases. Throughout the province, courts are unswervingly implementing the guiding policy swiftly and seriously and in accordance with the law. For serious criminal elements committing crimes guilty of the death penalty, sentencing of the death penalty is resolutely carried out. For crimes requiring stiff sentencing, criminals are being resolutely sentenced to stiff penalties, paying attention to overcoming and preventing the phenomenon of attacks with insufficient force. For the year as a whole, among cases tried and completed in one hearing, the proportion of those sentenced to more than 5 years specified imprisonment up to the death penalty rose 7.6 percent compared to 1992. At the same time, the courts are conscientiously carrying out a policy of combining suppression with leniency, and persisting in equal doses of leniency and strictness. In order to properly utilize corporal punishment and the relevant resolutions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, county courts have strengthened their inspection and examination guidance, and are conscientiously resolving issues of measurement of penalty in convicting someone of a crime. No matter whether it is concentrated attacks or special combat efforts, or normal trying of cases, courts should persist in properly handling the facts of a case, and master the legal criteria, and surely, accurately, and relentlessly attack criminal elements. 4) Conscientiously carry out comprehensive measures for managing participation in maintaining public order. [comprehensive programs of public order] When severely punishing criminals, courts at various levels should in a comprehensive way give full play to their judicial functions, and conscientiously carry out various linkup participatory measures in terms of vigilance, education, management, construction, and transformation. Over the year as a whole, in all there were 414 judicial meetings, some 401 cases where judicial suggestions were put forward to relevant departments, and 7538 cases of commuted sentences and releases on parole. In addition, in terms of aspects related to publicizing legal institutions, strengthening the people's legal work, guiding mediation of disputes, education, setting an example, rescuing errant youths, etc. they have worked very hard, and had a quite good social effect. At the same time, by persisting in the goal of responsible management, and establishing and perfecting a varied system with peoples' courts carrying out comprehensive measures for managing participation in maintaining public order, taking the various operations and requirements of comprehensive measures for participation in maintaining public order and channelling them into the unit target responsibility system, and strengthening management, during county and locally organized inspections on reaching the goals of comprehensive management, all examined courts achieved their targets, and many courts also were appraised as Comprehensive Program of Public Order Red Flag Units. 2. Severely attack serious economic crime, resolutely mete out punishment for corruption, safeguard the economic order Peoples' courts at all levels throughout the province, in accordance with the Party Central's personnel deployment, are actively launching an anti-corruption campaign, stressing major cases as the breach, augmenting the force of attacks on economic crime. Over the year there were a total of 1755 economic crime cases accepted and heard in one hearing, with 1718 being completed, and 1980 people were sentenced. Of these, those sentenced to over five years, those receiving life sentences, and those receiving the death penalty (including stays of execution) totalled 752 people, or 37.98 percent of the total number of criminals sentenced, an increase of 6.64 percent over the previous year. Among the sentenced economic criminals, those convicted of individual crimes involving more than 10,000 RMB totalled 271, of which 22 people associated with crimes involving more than 100,000 RMB. Through these judicial proceedings, economic losses of 718,860,000 RMB were collected and returned to the state. In the struggle to attack economic crime, throughout the province courts at all levels are paying attention to seizing the key points, and vigorously bring to trial major cases. The attack points are aimed at those cases where state workers, particularly leading cadres, use their positions to engage in graft, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and other serious infringements on the interests of the state and people, and undermine Party and government prestige. It is also aimed at cases of major swindling, profiteering, manufacturing and selling counterfeit goods, evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes, etc., that seriously damage the market economic order. During the year, there was a total of 515 tried cases of graft, bribery, and misappropriation of public funds, and 636 criminals were sentenced. Various local courts are paying attention to properly mastering the work of trying major cases, and are progressively perfecting the registering and reporting system for major cases, and the timely grasping of the relevant circumstances. Taking the initiative to strengthen relations with inspection organizations, for those major economic crime cases resulting in significant harm, having a major effect and to which the society is paying great attention, courts are resolutely promoting intervention, and painstakingly organizing proper bringing of cases to trial, working closely together to coordinate the launching of the anti-corruption campaign. Last year at the end of October, the province's 29 counties and cities one after another convened large-scale sentence pronouncement meetings, to concentrate pronouncing of sentences, and handled 80 cases of economic crime, leading to the sentencing of 111 criminals. Among these, there were 20 major cases that the county courts directly handled, with 30 criminals sentenced. For this set of serious economic criminal elements, relying on the law to mete out strict punishment, there were 12 people who received the death penalty, death sentence with a two-year reprieve and forced labor, or life imprisonment, 11 people received sentences of more than 10 years, and seven people received sentences of less than 10 years. The county courts also specially convened press conferences, and reported on the launching of the anti-corruption campaign, and on the strict punishment of serious economic criminals. And through using the news media, and providing widely disseminated reporting, the momentum and social effectiveness of the attacks on economic crimes will be extended. Strict reliance on the law for handling matters, conscientiously ensuring the quality of cases. The circumstances of economic crime are complex, and have different characteristics than normal crime: the facts of the crimes, such as the monetary totals involved in graft and bribery are difficult to thoroughly investigate; the stages involved in the commitment of crimes are diverse, and proof is hard to obtain; the basis of convictions are very closely related with policy regulations, and in the process of the transformation of the economic system, for behavior in the economic sphere it is necessary to make clear distinctions between the criminal and the noncriminal, and the difficulties here are not small. Thus, throughout the province courts at all levels are firmly basing cases on the facts, taking the law as the principle criterion and being guided by the principle of "the first necessity is to stand firm, the second necessity is to be cautious, and be sure to be prepared," and strictly and properly involved the facts in seeking proof, repeatedly do research to determine the nature of an offense, and correctly mete out penalties, and be sure to approach the judgement of cases by obtaining the experience of history. The county courts, using issues that they encounter in trying cases of economic crime, and on the basis of investigative research and through case precedence discussions and critical analysis, are drafting a series of concrete stipulations suited to policies and laws, and are strengthening their professional guidance for lower level courts; lower level courts, for some cases that they have no preparation for, are taking the initiative to request instructions and report on the cases, preventing erroneous decisions. In the wake of the deepening of the anti-corruption campaign, a series of major economic crime cases have been ferreted out and investigated, and the number of economic crime cases prosecuted in court will increase. Courts at all levels have intellectually and in terms of judicial strength already properly handled the making of the required preparations, and for those major cases such as graft, bribery, etc., no matter how many people are involved, all will be fully investigated, and stern sanctions will be applied in accordance with the law, and by no means will evil be tolerated as this is tantamount to abetting it, and under no circumstances will we break our promises to the people. 3. Comprehensive launching of economic, civil, and administrative judicial work, giving full play to regulatory functions, to develop market economic services Throughout the province, under intellectual guidance designed to establish a socialist market economic system to provide legal guarantees and legal services, courts are actively making great efforts during the course of economic, civil, and administrative judicial work to increase the strength of services, expand the realm of services, and give full play to their regulatory functions. 1) Economic judicial work has been developed to a substantial degree. Last year in economic judicial work there emerged a good trend involving large numbers of accepted cases, large numbers of completed cases, and large numbers of resolved disputes. Throughout the province, courts hear a total of 10,679 cases involving economic disputes, an 18.07 percent increase over last year; in total, 9976 cases were resolved, an increase of 19.83 percent from the previous year. Among these, mediated cases totalled 5980, a mediation rate of 59.94 percent, or a 4.5 percent increase over last year; Some 84.84 percent of the cases were resolved within three months, a 1.23 increase over the past year. In all there was a total of 337,911,900 RMB involved in the resolved disputes, up 70.02 percent from last year. In addition, there were 3784 cases applicable to paying for the resolution of economic disputes, with a total value of 45,652, 400 RMB. 2) Civil judicial cases have progressively developed. Last year, the overall number of civil cases totalled 56,276, with 53,452 cases settled, increases from last year respectively of 6.89 percent and 7.61 percent. The number of cases accepted exceeded historical high levels, and there emerged a number of new circumstances, new issues, and major changes occurred for civil cases, in terms of the principal part, content and type of litigation. Looking at the province as a whole, matrimonial and family disputes, though they still occupied the leading position in cases accepted (constituting 32,791 cases, or 58.27 percent), cases frequently touch on issues dealing with contracts involved one party (husband or wife) against the other or two party (husband and wife) contracts, rent, and management rights issues; personal and property damage compensation disputes have already leapt into second place (constituting 1810 cases, or 10.32 percent), and investigation and obtaining of proof and determination of compensation amounts have encountered major difficulties; in various types of business, rent, and mortgage disputes, due to the developing of the market economy, prices change, and issues of cost, rental money, and mortgage amounts become very difficult to try. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of new types of cases such as celebrity rights, book rights, real estate development, and labor disputes, and cases touching on foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. From this description it is evident that at the same time as the number of civil dispute cases accepted by peoples' courts involving the aspect of personal rights and interests, the proportion of cases involving some aspect of property rights and interests has increased substantially. This change has meant that the relations between civil judicial work and economic construction and the market economy are growing more and more closely linked, and civil judicial work is directly effecting the wider and wider expansion of the scope of economic construction and market economic services. 3) Administrative judicial work is steadily expanding. Last year, there were a total of 1602 administrative cases tried, with 1532 cases settled. Among the settled cases, 370 judgements maintained the original administrative conduct, while in 533 cases the ruling granted removal, with these two outcomes totalling 64.95 percent of the cases; in 397 cases there were judgements of recision, and changes to the original administrative conduct, amounting to some 25.91 percent of settled cases. People's courts at all levels, in the course launching economic, civil, and administrative judicial work, are using judicial measures to adjust economic relations, and are emphasizing the mastering of the following points: First, steadfastly focus on the Party and state major policies and plans, give prominence to key points of work. Throughout the province courts are conscientiously implementing various central policies touching on the deepening of reform and the broadening of opening, the establishment of a market economic system, the strengthening of macro-level regulation and the maintenance of social stability, and conscientiously focusing on the core in judicial work, and defining the key points of work. Courts at all levels are conscientiously implementing the party committee transmitted provincial court leading party group "Views on Fully Utilizing Judicial Functions To Strengthen State Macro-level Regulation, Opposing Corruption and Maintaining Social Stability," taking as the main goal of work having the socialist market economy provide legal guarantees and services, and taking the key points for consideration in working to be the difficult points and points attracting attention that arise in reform and opening and the development of the economy, strengthening economic, civil, and administrative case judicial work closely related to macro-level adjustment and the market economy, and ensuring the smooth implementation of the center's major policy decisions. In the course of work coordinated rectification of the financial order, throughout the province courts in accordance with the law and in a timely manner settled 4918 cases involving borrowing and lending, recovering for banks and credit unions mature and overdue loans totalling 843,913,000 RMB, and at the same time, on issues touching on financial management they provided judicial suggestions to relevant departments, and promoted the standardization of call borrowing and credit activity. Second, establish law enforcement concepts and judicial principles that are suitable to a market economy. In order to adapt to the developing and changing new circumstances, courts at all levels are being guided by liberated thinking, and replacing concepts, while strengthening investigative research. When it comes to some current legally sluggish objective circumstances, research issues of handling how to master policies and suit the law, and establish law enforcement concepts that are suitable to a market economy, upholding the concepts of a national legal system and a unified market, conscientiously resisting and overcoming local protectionism; the concept of the equality of the positions of (legal) parties, and the legitimate rights and interests of equally protected Chinese and foreign litigants; it is necessary to affirm the effectiveness of respecting the concept of the litigant's autonomy of opinion, under the premise of inviolable legal stipulations, and no harming of the legitimate rights and interests of the state, society and other people, while displaying consistency when it comes to real opinions held among the litigants; protecting the concept of equitable competition, realizing the superiorities and inferiorities of the main body of the market, ensuring the orderly movement of the market economy. At the same time, in the course of work upholding the four principles, and correctly handling the relational principles between the partial and the whole, establishing whole concepts, and relying on the law in handling disputes; the principle of using reform to promote development, through trying of cases, implementing the promotion of reform measures; carrying out policies and implementing unified legal principles, and where the legal and policy stipulations are not clear, using the principle of the "three favorables," seek truth from facts in handling matters; the principle of comprehensively administering, through launching such activities as judicial suggestions, etc., and promoting the standardization of various types of activities and social stablility. Third, base ourselves on judicial procedures, increase strength of services, expand the scope of services. Throughout the province courts are continuing to overcome the phenomenon of "handling cases in isolation," and at the same time as they base themselves on judicial procedures, and handle more cases, and handle cases properly, they are linking various working characteristics of judicial work, increasing the strength of services, and expanding the scope of services. In addition to work such as continuing to launching the establishment of judicial liaison stations, legal service offices and local judicial liaison officers at large-scale enterprises, rural and township enterprises and related departments, helping train legal talent, systematizing contractual relations, integrating judicial cases and issues that are found in the course of investigative research, and timely putting forward of judicial suggestions, they have also launched special services, such as taking the initiative for financial departments to settle loans on a legal basis, and actively assist enterprises in setting debts on a legal basis, supporting tax organs in legally collecting taxes, etc., and in the course carrying out these various specialized services in assisting enterprises in setting debts in accordance with the law, they were able to recover for enterprises debt liabilities totalling 620,083,000 RMB, and to resolve the large number of contradictions and disputes that arise in the course of economic activity, maintaining the normal economic order, and having an ameliorative social effect. Fourth, strengthening execution work. Courts at all levels are taking marshal cases as the major content of building economic services, and are strengthening the work involved in executing cases. Over the year as a whole there were 18,245 executed cases of various types, an 11.62 percent increase over the past year in the total monetary amount of the executed case target. Among these, executed civil cases amounted to 10,031, and executed economic dispute cases totalled 3,519. Last year, some new circumstances emerged for executing work: first, there was a reduction in the number of cases executed. This because since 1992, throughout the province courts have launched several campaigns to concentrate on unification of execution, and have put in order a large set of long-pending cases, while a great many courts have basically cast off the millstone of "executing difficulties," and executing work is heading towards normalization and standardization. At the same time, courts at all levels, are actively working diligently at linking aspects of trying and executing cases, and investigation and executing, and there has been a substantial increase in litigants voluntarily carrying out their own obligations. Second, the difficulties of executing cases are increasing. The principle reason is that after the state strengthened macro-level regulation measures, enterprise operating funds have normally been tight, and some enterprises are in a production slump, their benefits are not good, with the result that the phenomenon of enterprises' chain of debt has again appeared, and this has increased the difficulty of executing cases. Third, administrative organs applications for case execution are increasing, making up 21.65 percent of cases. In order to support administrative organs in administering in accordance with the law, ensuring the orderly carrying out of state adminstrative management, a large number of courts are adopting organizational and work-related measures, to ensure the execution of these cases. The total execution mark target was 350,020,000 RMB, with the return and removal of illegal construction amounting to 51,600 km2. [passage omitted]
