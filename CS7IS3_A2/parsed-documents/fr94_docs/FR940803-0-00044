FR940803-0-00044 FR940803-0-00019 Authority: This interim final rule is issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act), 31 U.S.C. 1111, 41 U.S.C. 405 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act), Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, and E.O. 11541 (``Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive Office of the President''). Justification to Issue Interim Final Rule Under the Administrative Procedures Act, to issue a final rule without notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), it is necessary to make a finding that issuing an NPRM would be impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. As stated above, this rule is based on the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110, that was developed by an interagency task force and received extensive public comment. The revised Circular specifies that Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule adopts the provisions of the Circular word-for-word. Therefore, an NPRM would not allow the public to make comments that could have a significant impact on the content of the rule. This would make such an effort unnecessary.
