PRES (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) Has Consolidated Its Ranks and Russia's Choice Has Not Split"] [Text] Yesterday, which was declared a break in the work of the State Duma, was in fact fairly strained as partisan and independent deputies were hastily organizing parliamentary factions. Yesterday the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction was joined by a financial and industrial group of independent deputies of approximately 20 people. All in all, as of yesterday the faction numbered some 40 deputies. Interestingly, this is the first coalition created by independent and partisan deputies. Independent deputies, mainly including entrepreneurs and bankers who have joined the PRES, will constitute a section within the framework of this faction and their representative will become part of the faction's leadership. Addressing yesterday's press conference, PRES leader Sergey Shakhray stated that the faction is conducting talks with deputies from republics and autonomies. In his opinion, however, the "process of factional growth will not be explosive." Shakhray said that the faction is nominating his candidacy for the post of chairman of the State Duma. "Wherever I am, I shall be working on regional policy," Sergey Shakhray stated in concluding his press conference. Yesterday Liberal Democratic Party deputy Aleksandr Vengerovskiy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that apart from the party list six people have affiliated with the faction. The faction is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, of course, and its cochairmen are Aleksandr Vengerovskiy and Sergey Zhibrovskiy. The Liberal Democrats have the largest number of those wishing to work in the committee on education, science, and culture and also in the committee on organizing the Duma's work. In addition to cochairmen, the Liberal Democratic Party's faction council includes leaders of intrafactional groups (lawyers, economists, youth, and women). Sergey Baburin yesterday tried to create a deputies group called Russian Way that, however, has not as yet gathered the requisite minimum of 35 members. The group includes Anatoliy Lukyanov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, Vladimir Tikhonov, and Yuriy Vlasov (it was decided to nominate the latter to the post of speaker of the State Duma). Yesterday the emerging factions of deputies groups were counting their real and hypothetical votes and discussing rumors as to who will be elected chairman of the State Duma, his deputies, committee chairmen and their deputies. Furthermore, they discussed the principle to be used in filling these still vacant posts. In the lobby of the Duma assembly hall, in cozy leather armchairs the deputies of the emerging Russian Way group held a meeting -- Anatoliy Lukyanov, Sergey Baburin, Yuriy Vlasov, Vladimir Tikhonov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and others. Mr. Lukyanov briefed them on the progress in factional bargaining. Thus, according to some reports, a large coalition is nominating Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin as speaker and Alevtina Fedulova from Women of Russia and Vladimir Medvedev from the "independents" as his deputies. Incidentally, the latter are divided into several groups: the above mentioned Russian Way with an ideology of traditionalism, according to Sergey Baburin; and yet another group, fairly close to Russia's Choice, which will possibly be headed by Irina Khakamada, general secretary of the Economic Freedom Party. The creation of this group, however, has been postponed for the time being. On the other hand, the group headed by oil businessman Vladimir Medvedev has attracted deputies from the republics and autonomies led by A. Dzasokhov, and it will apparently try to register today. As for the reports about a split within Russia's Choice, according to a source within this faction, the bloc's leadership has so far not accepted the idea of splitting into two groups as a way of removing the internal tension and ensuring freedom of maneuver for itself. Yesterday at 1600 a meeting began between leaders of the Duma factions. Its agenda was as follows: procedure for conducting sessions prior to the election of speaker; provisions on the temporary rules of procedures; sequence of questions slated for discussion at Duma sessions; and the formation of the leadership of the lower chamber. According to some reports, the election of the entire Duma leadership is to be carried out simultaneously -- in a package. The formation of the package will be based of how many conventional points particular factions have gathered. These are calculated on the basis of simple arithmetic: Each post is assigned a certain number of points and then the aggregate number of elected deputies is divided by their sum total, which gives the number of deputy mandates per point (for instance, seven and a half mandates). Next a discussion is held as to what exactly each faction can get for its points. This method, however, is not known in detail yet, although it is already raising objections from those factions that are not among its authors. The beginning of yesterday's consultations was marked by a scandal when the Liberal Democratic Party leader voiced suspicions with respect to his negotiating partners. It was decided that today the elders will take turns conducting the session and that elections of the speaker will also begin today.
