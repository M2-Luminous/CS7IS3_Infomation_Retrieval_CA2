Fraser said the new group will have to sell itself hard to the electorate, since Prime Minister James Mitchell's New Democratic Party would exploit some of the questions about itself that the alliance has not answered. He told CANA the alliance "raises more questions than it provides answers because one hopes that it has come about because of dissatisfaction with the state of things." He asked: "Have they been looking beyond the election?" On Monday, the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party, led by lawyer Stanley John, and Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for National Unity announced that they had formed an alliance. The two parties will campaign on a common platform and share a single manifesto, but retain their individual identities. Prime Minister Mitchell, whose party won all fifteen seats in the last general election, remains confident about a third straight win. He told CANA: "No last-minute strategy of an alliance of convenience by the opposition parties can prevent us from securing a third consecutive mandate from the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines."
