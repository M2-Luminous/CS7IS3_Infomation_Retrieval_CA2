I received the news of the passing into eternity of Rabbi Moses Rosen on Friday, at 1900. I was in Iasi, in a spring garden under a dried-out oak tree upon which some thoughtful farmer had placed a sign: "A tree which is well-cared for has 388 years of life". I did not see any signs of life but, nevertheless, no one dared to cut it down. [passage omitted] Almost all the members of the leadership of the Greater Romania Party [PRM] were in Iasi -- for a news conference. At dawn, after the plane landed, we went to the Church of the Three Hierarchs to lay a wreath with a tricolor ribbon at the tombs of the glorious voivodes Dimitrie Cantemir and Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Of course, Romanian Television did not show any part of it, not a word. Then, there was a dialogue with trade union leaders, which I could not attend since I had had only three hours of sleep in three days and three nights and I was exhausted. Professor Mircea Musat represented me. Finally, from 1430 to 1330, there was the much-awaited news conference before a packed hall. Many people said that it was a triumph for us, but the mouths of some impostors in the county press could not be shut up even by the earth from Eternity Cemetery. I hope that I can publish the entire discussion soon. I do not know how it happened, but in the whirlpool of the dialogue with the press and the people in the hall, the name of Moses Rosen came up. Of course, at that time no one knew that he had died. To the surprise of many people, I was very restrained. Indeed, I even praised him for his participation, during very frosty weather, in the Alba Iulia festivities on 1 December 1993. "Do you want Vadim to say that I am not a good Romanian?" -- the rabbi responded to presidential counsellor Victor Opaschi, who asked why he, an 81-year old man, did not stay home, in a warm place, that day. And I said, in Iasi, that indeed. at least on that occasion, the rabbi was a good Romanian, humiliating our political opposition which had boycotted the National Day celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Great and Eternal Union. The rabbi also went into the Orthodox Church (which he had never done before) and wore a tricolor rosette with the picture of Avram Iancu. At that time, I realized that we can never know the depths of the human soul. For the first time in my life, I had fond feelings for that old man who had traveled over snow-covered mountains, while those who claim to be "national", "Christian", and "democratic" and who live off the corpse of the great Iuliu Maniu insulted the National Day. I said this to President Ion Iliescu. Then I spoke, publicly, at a PRM press conference on that paradoxical December. A few weeks later, when I had collected two pages of material critical of the rabbi, I had a change of heart and I remembered the little man with the teary eyes and frosty beard, on the stage decorated with fir trees, and I did not publish any of it. Indeed, I even sent the galleys to Ion Iliescu (something I never do) and I wrote him a few words, saying that I could not see any merit in carrying a fight to the absurd, especially when the adversary is old, powerless, and sick. "Moses Rosen is dead!" a friend announced to me that Friday, near Iasi. There were a number of guests, besides me, including Iasi professor Gheorghe Buzatu, who had just returned from Israel, as well as Professor Mircea Musat, our parliamentarians Iuliu Furo, Anghel Stanciu, Ion Marinescu, Ion Carciumaru, Theodor Constantinescu, Viorel Burlacu, Marcel Moldovan, Dan Cristian Popovici, Generals Traian Bandila and Theodor Paraschiv, and other members of the PRM leadership such as Mircea Hamza, Dan Mirescu, Cornel Ciontu, Sever Mesca, and Alexandru Mica. The news passed quickly through the small garden where we were eating, from parliamentarians to newsmen, from newsmen to the leaders of the local prefecture. Then, I experienced a strange feeling: Instead of rejoicing (as someone who said to me: "I have some good news for you!" would have thought) -- I was sad. My greatest enemy had died and I was suffering as one would after the death of a friend. I still did not know the human soul. I read in history books that, after their enemies died, our great voivodes made merry and feasted and even gave donations to the church. Since I am not a voivode and since I am animated by somewhat more Christian charity, I cannot do this. With the death of Moses Rosen, 15 years of my life become more barren. He began to denounce me to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party and in the world press in 1979. In 1980, after the publication of the famous article entitled "Ideals" [Idealuri], he denounced me once again. I was visiting him, accompanied by a Jewish photo-reporter Armand Rosenthal (one of my colleagues at AGERPRES, a particularly fine man), and I tried to give him a dignified explanation. But the rabbi told the world press that I had become a fascist and he told me to leave. This was not true and I do not know what made him falsify the truth. In September 1980, he made the biggest mistake of his life: He sent a terrible letter to the Romanian Academy demanding that Volume IX of the complete works of Mihai Eminescu be taken off the market, calling the National Poet a fascist, Iron Guard supporter, hooligan, fool, and pornographer. This was a bit too much, a bit above the level of tolerance of the Romanian people. Three people protested this move: Alexandru Oprea, Pompiliu Marcea, and myself. The first two died under mysterious circumstances. One had a cardiac arrest while bathing (at 50 years of age!) and the other drowned, in broad daylight, in Lake Herestrau. I did not die because God loved me, even though the rabbi said to one of his fellow Jews, in reference to the rumor that I would be receiving a grant to go to Italy: "If Vadim goes abroad, he might find himself with a knife in his back!" I did not go. I stayed home to see how my book of verses, "Saturnalia" [Saturnalii], was taken out of bookstores and libraries, also by the rabbi. From April to November 1984, I was banned from the press and the radio. I did not appear on television, which, at that time, was controlled by Jews, from April 1984 to September 1990. These were hellish times for me. I was dragged into lawsuits. I received death threats on the telephone. There was ferocious psychological pressure. I was pursued. Most of the people regarded me as if I had the plague. Elena Ceausescu decided that I should receive severe sanctions from the party, after a memorial session and after Emil Bobu, instigated by her, put me at wit's end! Isn't that right, Ion Traian Stefanescu and Constantin Radu? You were there. My beloved parents prayed daily for me. My mother wept and her health became frail. She took everything to heart. But the wounds began to heal. It was hard for me but I did not die of hunger. In 1990, after these events, the rabbi defamed Eminescu once again, calling him a fascist and Iron Guard supporter, in an Iasi review. Then he criticized a number of Romanian writers, from Fanus Neagu and Al. Calinescu to Eugen Barbu and Cezar Ivanescu. This was too much. The man did not know any bounds. He was convulsed by the tremors of a strange malady; dismembering Romanian culture. In 1957 he had denounced Mihail Sadoveanu's novel "The Axe" [Baltagul], at all forums. Later on, he criticized Vasile Alecsandri and Octavian Goga, threatening that, if he is not satisfied, we would not receive most-favored-nation treatment from the Americans, which was an exaggeration on his part, since the United States also had very great strategic interests in the area. But, in 1990, he was in for a definite reaction. Romanians could respond to him since the press was free. Immediately, he disseminated throughout the world press the scare that "there is the scent of a pogrom in Romania." No one believed him. His time had passed. What pogrom? Who has anything against the Jews? At about the same time, in front of Coral Temple in Bucharest, he installed a sort of monument on which it is written that Romania was, allegedly, one of the centers of the world Holocaust and that we killed 400,000 Jews by terrible tortures. These were all lies, but I think that they were not originated by him but by the leaders of world Zionism who would like to blame the Romanian people to demand $50 billion in damages, as a greedy person revealed, in Tel Aviv. The same holds true for the whole saraband of lies about the army and Marshal Antonescu. The televised appearances of the rabbi were scandalous, especially the one at the beginning of 1994 when, for 30 minutes, in prime time, he levied unimaginable insults against the Romanian people. Intentionally, I did not publish anything on the part of ROMANIA MARE which would escalate a useless scandal. As you probably remember, I presented the opinions of some disgusted Romanians, which had been published in EVENIMENTUL ZILEI and ORA. Probably His Eminence, if he was still lucid at that time, was shaken by the lightning bolts and agitation of the people's rage. It exceeded all limits. Later, two patriotic historians, professors Gheorghe Buzatu and Florin Constantiniu, went to the television studio seeking the right to reply and to restore some of the sullied honor of the army and the Romanian people. They were not allowed to do so. The rabbi was stronger. He acted like a head of state. However, there is someone even stronger: God, who cut short the thread of his life. Some say that the curses of the war invalids who were mutilated at the battlefront, while the Jews swept the snow on the streets and drank hot cinnamon wine, got to him; others say that the anathemas of the Orthodox priests got to him; finally, someone telephoned me to tell me that he took along with him another great man who had been defamed by the rabbi, Eugen Barbu [founder of ROMANIA MARE], both dying in the same intensive care room in the Elias Hospital. I will not make any statement on this. There is a fatality, a predestination which is beyond us. This is not the time or the place to judge the sins which Moses Rosen committed against the Romanian people. Who knows, perhaps they can be compensated for by his very great service to his people Israel, helping about 400,000 Jews to leave Romania for the Promised Land, the land of their ancestors, which is quite admirable, and to his credit! As for me, I have the courage and honesty to forgive him for the days and nights of nightmares which he caused for my parents and me. To forgive and forget in the Christian way. This is the difference between Christianity and Zionism, which does not forgive, does not forget, and even invents, constantly, other plagues, other holocausts, and other hunters of men. I prefer to remember the rabbi as I saw him, in the flesh, for the last time, on that unforgettable day of 1 December 1993. At that time, a large part of his sins was washed away. I recognize this but I would have every reason to ignore such a thing. I am not an anti-Semite. I cannot be inherently against any people. And I cannot persecute the people who wrote the Bible. This is why I was saddened in my soul at the death of this old man. Perhaps I was reliving the sorrow of King David who had fought with his unyielding son, Absalom. But, when he found out that soldiers had killed him in an olive grove, he, the King of the Psalms, cried his heart out and ripped up his clothes. What strange alchemy is in the Romanian soul! As for the funeral ceremony, which was broadcast live on Radio Bucharest, for two hours on Sunday evening, I believe that this was too much and it exasperated many citizens. I am relaying only a few of the telephone messages which we received: "It's a wonder that Iliescu did not proclaim a national day of mourning!"; "Is it possible that Nicolae Ceausescu's gravedigger, the sinister Gelu Voican, was not there?"; "Rabbi Neuman of Timisoara screamed hysterically and insulted the Romanians; he claimed that Moses Rosen fought against the Communists but he forgot to say that Rosen was a close friend of Ana Pauker [former Foreign Minister, a Jew] and that he was a deputy in the Grand National Assembly for 40 years."; "A week ago, the great bishop of Tomis and the lower Danube, the 80-year old scholar Antim Nica, died but Iliescu did not go to his funeral and Radiotelevision reported 1,000 times less about the bishop than it did about the death of the rabbi"; "Where did the American rabbi get the term "great genius" for Moses Rosen?"; "The richest man in Romania has died. Who got his money?"; "Did you read ORA on Saturday? On page 1, Nicolae Cristache has given the amazing title: "An Outstanding Personality of the World Has Died," as if the rabbi from Moinesti were an "outstanding personality" like Jesus Christ. Moses, Alexander of Macedonia, Julius Caesar, Dante Alighieri, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Napoleon Bonaparte, Beethoven, or Brancusi!"; "Moses Rosen died but we still have the new Israeli ambassador who recently insulted Eminescu, calling him anti-Semitic and slaughtered Marshal Antonescu, once again, calling him a war criminal, even though, when you were in Iasi, you called for his expulsion from the country"; "When will Iliescu get out of the clutches of Eugen Preda-Glotter, director general of Radio? In the past four years, a number of great national cultural figures died, such as Edgar Papu, Ion Lancranjan, Eugen Barbu, Geo Bogza, Eugen Ionescu, Academician David Prodan, Petre Tutea, Father Dumitru Staniloae, Gina Patrichi, Gheorghe Cozorici, George Constantin, Theofil Valcu, Jean Georgescu, and Cella Delavrancea, and there was not a single minute of direct radio coverage of their funerals"; "Who is paying for the charter flight to Israel [where Rosen was buried]?" We reproduced only a few of the indignant telephone calls from ordinary Romanians who could not understand how their Sunday and Monday evening radio programs could be replaced by the two live broadcasts, from Bucharest and Jerusalem. We reproduced these opinions because this is the democratic way. Radio subscriptions are paid for by Romanian contributors and they have the right to know what is being done with their money, their nerves, and their time. But, it is all over now. Let us accept the idea that it was a more special funeral of a more special clergyman, representing a special tribe of people. Let us not be evil and do what we criticize others for doing. The rabbi desired my death but I did not desire his death. The rabbi made judgements about me but I did not make judgements about him. The rabbi banned me in my country but I did not ban him. I could not and I did not want to. After December 1989, the rabbi derided his great benefactor, Nicolae Ceausescu, which I did not do, although the former head of state punished me because of the rabbi. Also, Jews in Israel and the United States criticized Moses Rosen unsparingly for 40 years, but he did not accuse any of them of anti-Semitism. "Moses Rosen is dead!" -- the silent trumpet of that voice which gave me the news that the enemy of my home and of Romanian culture had crossed the threshhold to eternity still resounds. I was as sad as if my best friend had died. Undoubtedly, he was a person of international caliber, an educated man, a brilliant scholar of the Bible and the Torah, a character from a novel, a devoted husband, a distinguished pastor of Jewish souls. I think that all these qualities will carry a lot of weight at the Last Judgement. May God forgive him his sins, value his merits, and give rest to his tormented soul. Lord, have mercy on him! I forgave him long ago.
