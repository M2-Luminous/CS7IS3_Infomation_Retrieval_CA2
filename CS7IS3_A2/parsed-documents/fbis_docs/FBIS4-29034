FBIS4-29034 "dreas115_d_94029" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea Ruling Party Issues Statement on DPRK Issue Ruling Party Issues Statement on DPRK Issue SK1506024294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0223 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1506024294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] urged the government Wednesday to forge an independent nuclear policy, including re-examination of the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The appeal was contained in an announcement on the party's basic position and policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute. The DLP issued the statement after a meeting of party lawmakers and local chapter chairmen in the morning. It was the first time the ruling party has enunciated the need to form an independent nuclear policy and reconsider the denuclearization declaration. Heated debate has occurred among segments in the ruling party and the Kim Yong-sam administration over whether South Korea must take another look at the declaration as North Korea has been systematically and impudently violating the declaration. In a statement read by DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin, the ruling party again urged Pyongyang to implement the inter-Korean accords and the Denuclearization Declaration issued Dec. 31, 1991. "North Korea should also stop developing nuclear weapons immediately and in order to prove it, it should retract its decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency," Pak said. The DLP is urging North Korea to accept unconditional and comprehensive IAEA inspections not only to maintain nuclear transparency in the future but also to assist international efforts to determine its nuclear activities in the past, the spokesman said. The DLP statement asked the international community to cooperate in U.N. sanctions against North Korea aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute. Addressing the Kim administration, the statement said the government should prepare thoroughly for the effective execution of sanctions within the framework of international rules and the United Nations. The party said the country ought to establish law and order and tight national security by liquidating "left-leaning" forces, including the radical student organization Hanchongnyon, which are "openly and publicly supporting the North's dictatorial regime under an anachronistic illusion and without realizing the changes taking place worldwide." In addition, the party expressed concern that if national policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute is divided in a crisis, it may induce a misjudgement on the part of the Pyongyang regime. All South Koreans should unite against the North's ambition to conquer by force and communize the South, the statement said. Earlier in the meeting, DLP leaders received reports from Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae on the U.S.- drafted sanctions resolution and military activities in the North.
