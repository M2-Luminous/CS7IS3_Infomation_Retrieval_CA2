[applause] I expressed our cordial thanks to the Belgian Government, the Belgian foreign minister yesterday. I think it was appropriate, because the Belgian paratroopers have done a good, remarkable, and for us most important, job. Ladies and Gentlemen; the situation in the former Yugoslavia cannot be easily reduced to a common denominator. All in all one can say that it has improved. Bosnians and Croats have displayed their serious intention to overcome last year's confrontation on the basis of the Washington agreement, and to establish a federal state together. For the first time people in the conflict area at least believe in the possibility of peace. Sarajevo has been freed -- at least for the moment -- from the suffocating grip of Serbian terrorist attacks, and can hope for life to normalize in the city with the help of the United Nations, even though new incidents did, unfortunately, occur yesterday. In Mostar, the people are waiting for the United Nations to set up an administration that is to be headed by Hans Koschnick. Everything has to be done now to preserve the positive momentum, and everything has to be done not to frustrate the incipient hopes. There is even some light on the horizon in Croatian-Serbian relations. The 29 March cease-fire is being complied with and implemented, which means that Dalmatian areas that have so far been in danger are now no longer within the range of the Serb artillery. This is of considerable importance for the tourist trade and, thus, for the entire economy in the region. The next important step has to be the restoration of important infrastructure at the level of transportation and the energy supply. Negotiations on a political solution can be started on the basis of such a modus vivendi. The Federal Government welcomes the strong U.S. commitment in the peace efforts, which we have repeatedly called for, and the constructive cooperation of Russia. The role of these two countries is of vital importance. Russia must be involved in the efforts to seek a political solution. Without the participation of Russia there will not be a solution in the former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, one is also entitled to expect Russia to continue to support the UN Security Council resolution. The contribution of the EU must not be forgotten, either. Yes, we Europeans did not manage to get this conflict, which is actually a European conflict, under control on our own. Yet, the rapprochement between Bosnians and Croats, the demand for a satisfactory territorial solution in Bosnia, and the idea of a modus vivendi in the Serb-occupied territories in Croatia -- these concepts have been developed by the EU as a result of the impetus provided by myself, together with my French colleague Juppe. It is true that the negotiations on the cease-fire in Krajina took place in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Nevertheless, they were chaired -- and unfortunately such things tend to be overlooked -- by a German diplomat on the instructions of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. We are in constant close contact with the main parties involved; and with our Foreign Ministry representatives we participated decisively, of course, also in the Bosnian-Croatian negotiations in Washington. At the moment it is of utmost importance that the peace process remains credible. This means two things: There must be no more Serb occupations, and the suffering of the people in the towns besieged by the Serbs must come to an end. [applause] The combat operation of NATO aircraft is to be seen in this connection. The operation was justified, necessary, and right. Over the last two days, the chancellor and myself have discussed the overall situation in former Yugoslavia and these specific operations in detail with the secretary general of the United Nations. The legal basis for the operation is undisputed. Security Council Resolution 836, which has also been supported by the Russians, provides for the use of airborne strike forces to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. The Serb move toward Gorazde and the heavy attack on the city endangered the security of the UN military observers stationed there. A UN soldier was wounded. Following this, the UNPROFOR command, with the permission of the special envoy of the UN secretary general, asked NATO to provide airborne support. It was granted on 10 April. On 11 April it was repeated. This was in keeping with the procedure laid down for such cases. On 10 June 1993, NATO decided on the basis of Security Council Resolution 836 to make such protection measures possible. For this reason a special procedure was not necessary within NATO. For reasons of time it was not possible to inform all the other parties concerned. On 11 April, the UN Security Council unanimously agreed on the operation, with the exception of Russia. But Russia did not voice any reservations under international law or any other legal concerns. It only criticized the lack of consultation before the operation. But let me say it again: Bringing the case before the Security Council before every operation would impair the purpose of Resolution 836 and make it impossible to provide efficient, swift, immediate protection against such attacks, especially against UNPROFOR troops. I would also like to point out again that this was not an operation equal to the Sarajevo threat, but a specific operation in response to a specific attack against UNPROFOR troops. We think that a clear, decisive signal was necessary. The Serb attack on a UN protection zone is a provocation of the community of states. And we all know what the capture of a largely Muslim city by the Serbs would mean for the population. The United Nations could not allow the protection zones it established to be disregarded. On 9 April, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali -- he explained this again yesterday -- himself warned the Bosnian Serbs against continuing their attacks on Gorazde and instructed UNPROFOR to use all available means to achieve a Serb withdrawal. After Sarajevo, Gorazde is another symbol for the suffering of the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For months, some 65,000 people, most of them Muslims, have been trapped there. Unfortunately, only very few humanitarian aid convoys have managed to get through to the city. It must now become clear whether the community of states will manage to extend to Gorazde what it has achieved in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, there are a number of Sarajevos, Gorazdes -- a fact that is all too easily forgotten. We urgently have to try and approach the other crisis spots as we did in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, this will be the only possibility. The operation was right, also with a view to the peace process. The community of states can only call upon the parties to the conflict to find a political solution if it remains credible in its own resolutions. The Serb side is in control of some 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The community of states demands that the Serbs should withdraw from about 20 percent of the Bosnian territory. At an earlier point, the Serbian side expressed its basic willingness to do so. Thus, a withdrawal is required and not another advance. [applause] One can only recommend to the Serbs in their very own interest that they take the determination of the community of states seriously and renounce further military advances. Instead, they should constructively participate in efforts to achieve a peaceful solution. Above all, this includes the submission of a qualitatively satisfactory proposal for the territory. As far as Russia is concerned, I would like to stress that, if a repetition of the situation of the past few days is to be prevented, the best and most effective method is -- I also discussed this with Foreign Minister Kozyrev -- for Russia to continue to exert influence on the Serbian side. In this respect, I would like to point out that the Russians are cooperating in an extraordinarily constructive manner. I just mentioned that. Their influence on the Serbs was decisive for the withdrawal of the troops in and around Sarajevo, for ensuring access to Tuzla for UNPROFOR and UN troops, and hopefully for other peace efforts, too. [applause] If the Serbian side should take the legitimate intervention by the United Nations to ensure the resolution adopted by the UN Security Council as an opportunity to question the whole peace process -- which I cannot imagine -- doubts would be justified that they have ever been ready for a peace agreement that is acceptable to the other parties to the conflict and the community of states. The Federal Government hopes for the continuation of the processes that have been initiated in the past few weeks. Germany will be confronted with high expectations concerning the stabilization of the relationship between Muslims and Croats, which is still difficult, and, above all, concerning the implementation of a peace solution for the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will hopefully be achieved soon. This applies particularly to our role in the administration of Mostar by the EU. I explicitly thank Mr. Koschnick for his readiness to assume the task of the administrator of the EU, which is not exactly easy. [applause] I can only say -- he knows that from various conversations we have held -- that he can be sure of our solidarity and support. An appointment has rarely been received so positively in the EU as that of Mr. Koschnick in Greece when we asked him to assume this position. Good luck! [applause] The international community will also rely on us regarding the opening of Tuzla Airport and aid for the reconstruction of the territories affected by the war, particularly because we cannot participate in the military elements of the pacification. Our commitment in the humanitarian sphere, where we have done a great deal, must be maintained. I would like to thank the German people once more, who have accepted over 400,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. I would like to repeat proudly that this is more than twice the number that all other European countries have accepted together. This is an astonishing achievement. During the talks in Washington, this was honored in a special manner, particularly by the Muslim and Croatian side, and special thanks were conveyed to us -- also for our humanitarian commitment in general. One should not ignore or forget that, as far as financial contributions and aid are concerned, we are in second place. Thus, we need not hide our light under a bushel. However, in view of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which continuous to be terrible, the world community must not grow tired and lose interest. This is the biggest danger that exists in the sphere of humanitarian efforts. I would like to repeat that, in view of the terrible situation, we must not grow tired and lame, or lose interest. Today's support by the German Bundestag for the Federal Government's policy on the former Yugoslavia should be viewed as a signal in this spirit. Thank you very much.
