Uno, who served as Japan's prime minister for three months through early August 1989, also told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he considers it unlikely that the LDP will splinter any further. Uno said he is not optimistic about an early LDP comeback because "the ballots cast by the people are not really so ambiguous." Noting that the LDP would need to win back over 30 seats in order to obtain a majority in the House of Representatives, he said, "it will probably be difficult to regain them in the next election." He said that while it cannot be helped if a small number of parliamentarians leave the party, "I want to tell them: `don't do anything funny.' The LDP has lots of flaws, but they can't be fixed in one fell swoop. Everyone must chime in to fix them."
