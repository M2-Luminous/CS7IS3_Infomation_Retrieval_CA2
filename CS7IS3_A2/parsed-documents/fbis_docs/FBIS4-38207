The new method is to directly address King Husayn as the head of the three branches of power and explain the legislative branch's stand without resorting to the option of a vote of confidence which will, undoubtedly, lead to a constitutional crisis in the country that may topple not only the government but the House as well. Engineer 'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, a former minister and a centrist deputy, told AL-WASAT: We will act more responsibly than the prime minister. He was referring to the relationship between the government and the House of Representatives, most of whose members feel that al-Majali has been ignoring the House since he formed his government in May 1993, and that he has not succeeded in changing his approach in spite of the three government reshuffles he has carried out. Tasked by 40 House members, nine deputies, including Abu-al-Raghib, are drafting a letter, the first of its kind in the constitutional history of Jordan, that they will address to the Jordanian monarch. Abu-al-Raghib described the letter as worthy both in form and content and revolves around three basic elements: The first emphasizes that the deputies do not want either to hold another extraordinary session or submit a vote of no-confidence in the government; meaning that they do not seek to topple the government through parliament. The second element stresses that the deputies are aware that the exacerbation of the crisis will have a negative impact not only on the domestic level but also on the level of Jordan's foreign relations and its tackling of various issues, including the peace process. The third element outlines the deputies understanding of how institutional relationships should be and how this calls for normal relations between the executive and legislative branches with an emphasis that the deputies have grasped the requirements of the current stage which is governed by the peace negotiations on the one hand and the economic pressures on the other. In the prime minister's third reshuffle, two out of the 18 new ministers drew attention for agreeing to join the government. The first is Dhuqan al-Hindawi, who has been appointed minister and deputy prime minister in many previous governments over the past 30 years, and who repeatedly refused to join al-Majali's government. The second is 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah, who not only voted against the al-Majali government, but has been one of its most prominent opposers, and has mobilized many deputies against it. Al-Hindawi and al-Rawabidah would not have accepted to join the government without the intervention of King Husayn and Crown Prince Hasan to convince them of the importance of their participation to face the challenges of the current stage with a strong government. The reshuffle was made in accordance with an idea that al-Majali be devoted to administer the negotiations, in which representation will not only be upgraded to the level of prime minister and foreign minister (al-Majali is foreign minister in addition to his post as prime minister) but will be shifted to the region as Prince Hasan announced. According to Jordanian officials, the Gulf of Aqaba, where al- 'Aqabah and Ilat cities are situated close to each other, will be the arena of the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on border demarcation and sovereignty that will start next July. Al-Hindawi's condition for accepting to join the government was that the government should include House of Representatives members, which was something opposed by al-Majali when he formed the government, so his government did not enjoy much parliamentary support. But the admission of 10 House of Representatives members into the government did not increase its supporters because of al-Majali method in selecting these members. Instead of consulting with the parliamentary blocs for their representatives to join the government, he chose 10 deputies through personal contacts. Furthermore, he tried without success to convince a Muslim Brotherhood deputy, who is 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ukur, to join the government. One day after the government reshuffle was announced, the deputies were furious, including the deputies of the bloc led by the prime minister's brother Engineer 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali. Forty-one deputies, out of 80, met and announced their opposition to the method in which the government was reshuffled. It was decided to prorogue the parliament's extraordinary session as of 16 June, hence the parliament went into its summer break. But the Jordanian Constitution allows the majority to call for another extraordinary session to discuss specific issues. Hence, the deputies resorted to a new method in opposing the government which advocates the principle of "keeping both the wolf and the sheep alive" as said one of the nine deputies who are preparing the message to the king. Therefore, al-Majali's government is finding itself once again facing opposition. While it may be true that the opposition does not seek to topple the government, it will keep it under close scrutiny and mobilize public opinion against it.
