FR940602-0-00003 FR940602-0-00001 Environmental Impact Statement The action has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA and RDA have determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Discussion of the Rule The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;50, authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer certain funds previously authorized by Public Law 102&hyph;368 to a program designed to reduce the interest rate on certain Business and Industry Guaranteed loans. The funds will remain available through fiscal year 1994. Borrowers must be located in areas affected by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar and unable to make the full payments on the proposed loan. The interest rate charged by the lender must not exceed the prime rate by more than 100 basis points. The lender will receive payments from the Government to reduce the effective interest rate paid by the borrower by one percentage point. Interim Rule It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, we are making this action effective upon publication in the Federal Register without securing prior public comment. This action implements a program authorized by statute and intended to assist with economic recovery of areas affected by certain natural disasters. The program will only be available for new loans approved before the funding expires at the end of fiscal year 1994. It is necessary to implement the program as soon as possible to help stimulate the economy of the disaster area as soon as possible, to provide assistance to struggling businesses before they are forced to close, and to provide potential applicants the opportunity to develop applications and have them processed before the funding authority expires. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication and, if appropriate, adjustments will be made in the regulations based on the comments.
