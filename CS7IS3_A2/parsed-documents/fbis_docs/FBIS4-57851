Following Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf's instructions, Alicia Pierini, the Interior Ministry under secretary for human rights, pressed charges following remarks he made during an amity dinner with retired military officers. The former military officer noted that "he should have been given an award for his part in the struggle against subversion." Videla described himself as "a scapegoat of that struggle." [passage omitted] The dismissal ruling mentions that Videla confirmed making the remarks mentioned in the charges, but, according to the judges, he did not maliciously seek to have his remarks published by newspapers or retold outside the group attending the dinner.
