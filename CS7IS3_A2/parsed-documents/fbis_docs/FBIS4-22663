To continue this parallel, the stance taken by a certain number of government people--supported by the agrarian lobby--with regard to the necessary allocation of more than 50 trillion karbovantsy to the rural areas for the purpose of carrying out sowing operations may be compared to the peace initiative of one of the Middle Eastern sides. They have said something like the following: Come to an agreement on this large-scale currency emission; let's smoke a peace pipe, and everything will be just fine. However, the monetarist course taken by the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] does not provide for sowing at such a high price. (In response to such a demand from the agrarians, one of the National Bank's highest officials even allowed himself to make the following bitter joke: "Do you intend, then, to sow coupons?"). It must be acknowledged that most of the government authorities have already become aware that the greatest evil is such hyperinflation, and that it must be combatted. After emphasizing this thesis once again, Viktor Yushchenko--NBU's chairman of the board--at a regularly schedule meeting with journalists elucidated the key positions taken by the National Bank with regard to conducting monetary policy, the price of money, and a possible currency emission. According to Yushchenko, the National Bank has seriously undertaken the task of putting a stop to soaring hyperinflation. Because of the latter's great rapidity, this task cannot be accomplished suddenly or abruptly; and, therefore, we must go along with it for some time, while seeking to restrain it. That is to say: If in 1994 Ukraine had a monthly inflation rate equalling 84 percent, then during the first quarter of this year it can be knocked down by only 20-30 percent. If in December the monthly currency emission amounted to 12 trillion, then in January it must be equal to 8 trillion. To account for this, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers must designate 4 trillion worth of savings. According to the National Bank's plan, Ukraine must gradually make the transition from the 80-percent monthly inflation jumps which characterized the end of 1993 to well-harmonized, constantly lowered, and sensible currency emissions during 1994 by means of what Yushchenko called an "economizing" system. The NBU has submitted a scheme for such a system to the Supreme Council for its approval and ratification. The success of this package can be guaranteed only by a well-coordinated, finance-budget and economic policy on the part of the government, the central bank, and the parliament. If with such an alliance no success is achieved within a brief time period on account of the NBU's exclusively monetarist powers, the time bomb which can be perceived even now will explode in a "cloud of blossoming white smoke." Another key factor in the National Bank's monetary policy is a positive, favorable interest rate. The bank has set a nominal rate equal to 20 percent per month (which amounts to an annual rate of 240 percent) and does not see the need to adjust it upward to the level of the monthly inflation rate. We need to tie inflation in to the price of money rather than the other way around. If this price is set, for example, at the inflation rate which prevailed as of November 1993--i.e., 84 percent--no operating budget or economic plan could endure such torture. A critical percentage rate must be set, and the state's entire anti-crisis policy must be keyed to that rate. Talk within the government to the effect that such a rate would be a hyperinflationary factor is absurd. Only Ukraine is capable of discussing such a topic. Academic theory excludes even the possibility of any kinds of disputes on that score. Yet another important factor in stabilizing the Ukrainian monetary unit is currency regulation. Ihor Mityukov, the National Bank's leading expert on this matter and the NBU's deputy chairman of the board, has called currency regulation an important instrument in the matter of regulating exports and imports and eliminating the deficit in our foreign balance of payments. Recently, however, because of the universality of VKV [freely convertible currency] the currency policy has become confused and is being replaced by a policy of taxation, customs duties, and export-import fees. The right to twirl foreign currency around is being taken into the hands of the government, leaving to the National Bank the role of an observer of a downward slope and the declining potential to carry out currency operations to the point where they amount to worthless tokens. The divergence in the approaches to the organization and instrumentality of the currency market, as well as the difference in views on creating exchange rates provide several more occasions for comparing their dispute with the Middle Eastern conflict: Yushchenko's National Bank is Yushchenko's National Bank, whereas Zvyahilskyy's government is Zvyahilskyy's government, and they will never get together on matters policy regarding currency or exhange rates. According to Mityukov--whom we mentioned earlier--currency exchange rates ought to be under the jurisdiction of the NBU, but the Cabinet of Ministers thinks "a bit" differently and has called the fixed exchange rate "12610" the most important element in the policy of state regulation. A small ray of hope with regard to the possibility of making the transition to a course of regulations has been dashed--perhaps even extinguished by the National Bank's deputy chairman of the board; there is simply no mutually agreed-upon scheme of regulation. In principle, such an opposition is not normal; they understand this at the NBU and, therefore, act on the basis of the following principle: "The sensible man does not go up the mountain--the sensible man goes around the mountain." There is already agreement with the machine-builders and miners concerning the sale of currency on auction-type principles. Nor has agriculture been forgotten (in order to assist rural inhabitants in finishing their sowing, the National Bank has decided to buy up the dollars saved by such inhabitants--at a price of 30,000 krb. [karbovantsy] for one dollar. One of the components of the currency market--the NBU's currency auction--is likewise experiencing some rather unhappy times: Offers have stabilized at the level of 8-9 million dollars a month; as a result of already-adoptedemissions decisions, demand has risen sharply. The fixed rate of exchange for the karbovanets is depressing exporters, and--therefore--an increase in the rate of exchange at the auctions will hardly be able to provide more available freely convertible currency. The situation is tragic. In order to provide shelter for those many producers who have not been able to make their way to the tender committee, the NBU retained the auction but was forced to yield to administrative restrictions in accepting conditions for buying currency. The circle of restrictions will thereby become somewhat wider; moreover, the auction will continue to operate for some time, ensuring--first and foremost--the purchase of energy resources, raw materials, and technical needs. ...Viktor Yushchenko has recently begun to gather journalists together quite frequently. He does not complain to them, but merely tells them about his own work. Operating under the conditions of opposition and misunderstanding is difficult and often thankless--something like being forced to spit into the wind, when one feels like spitting in all directions and going on to something else. It seems that only the National Bank is bearing in mind the fact that rescuing drowning persons is largely a matter for the very persons who are drowning. In the wondrous country of the Swan, the Crab, and the Pike Middle Eastern motifs have not abated.
