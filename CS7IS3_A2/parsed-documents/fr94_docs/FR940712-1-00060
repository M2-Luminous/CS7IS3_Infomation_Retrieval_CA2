FR940712-1-00060 FR940712-1-00012 The communication use rental schedule will be re-evaluated, and if necessary, revised periodically to ensure that rentals are fair. Schedules based on county population will be re-evaluated after completion of the next census in 2000. The updated county population information will be substituted for 1990 county population figures. Partial Waiver of Rent 43 U.S.C. 1764(g) provides authority to charge less than fair market value if the holder provides at reduced or no charge a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary concerned. Actions taken by the holder at no cost or reduced costs to the public may be considered in granting a temporary, partial, or full waiver. Any requirement placed on the applicant or holder as a condition of granting or renewing the authorization is required to be legal and not result in additional costs unrelated to the use authorized. Therefore, requirements that the building owner set aside 10 percent of its space for Government use or that Federal agencies be granted free use in the building should be considered in setting fair market rent. Basis for Rental Schedule In developing the schedule, the BLM has considered information from a variety of sources. This includes information provided by industry groups, existing BLM rents that are believed to reflect fair market value, data and information provided by BLM appraisers, and information gathered by the FS in preparing their schedule. The BLM has also taken into consideration the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee. The rental schedules are included in the proposed regulatory text. Public Comment The BLM is requesting public comment on all aspects of this proposed rule as well as comments on specific questions. Specific comments are requested regarding the following questions: 1. Is the proposed schedule reasonable? If not, what information can you provide that would help in setting a fair and reasonable schedule? 2. Are the proposed phase-in methods for base rents and percentage of gross rental receipts reasonable? If not, please suggest a method that can be easily implemented. 3. Are the categories clearly defined? Would there be any potential problems in determining the category of use? Please provide suggestions to improve the description of each category of use. 4. Are there any potential problems in setting the base rent for commercial mobile radio services based on the population of the county in which the transmitter is located or the nearby or adjacent county predominantly served by the transmitter, whichever is greater? Please suggest alternative methods. To conform with the format requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Note at the beginning of Group 2800 is being removed, and the information provided there is being included in new sections 2800.0&hyph;9, 2810.0&hyph;9, and 2880.0&hyph;9. There is no substantive change involved. The principal author of this final rule is David Cavanaugh of the Division of Lands, BLM, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management. It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of Land Management has determined that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual (DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will bring annual rental fees charged holders of authorizations for communications sites on public lands, which have been held to artificially low levels for many years, to fair market value as required by statute and administrative direction. The fees that would be placed in effect by this proposed rule would bring existing rental charges for communications sites authorization holders on the public lands more into line with those who lease land from private landowners. The increased revenues resulting from this fee schedule will result in increased payments to States and counties in which the public lands containing the authorized facilities are located under current statutory authorities.
