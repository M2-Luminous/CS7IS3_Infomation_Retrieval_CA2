[SME] Do you consider your being elected chairman as just a formality, inasmuch as the first deputy chairman is to lead the party? [Moravcik] No, I believe it a very prudent technical solution to the problem we encountered. [SME] Why did the Saturday merger assembly decide on this step? [Moravcik] We felt that such a solution could be acceptable to the coalition partners, and it guarantees efficient control of the party. [SME] By this measure, you have probably denied the philosophy, according to which political leaders were not to be in the Cabinet, on the basis of which the coalition government was formed. [Moravcik] Because I am not going to actually work as chairman of DEUS, I consider it an acceptable compromise, even with respect to this philosophy. [SME] How are you going to explain to the voters that almost the entire executive of the new party worked for a while at Meciar's side in the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia? [Moravcik] If we peruse the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia program from the time the movement emerged and consider the people who created the movement, we cannot ever have such feelings because the present Movement for a Democratic Slovakia is something altogether different from the movement we then organized. [SME] How do you explain the increase in your popularity to 25 percent? [Moravcik] I would understand it unequivocally as a government preference. It means an endorsement of the idea with which we formed the government. We will try not to disappoint this confidence. [SME] You have defined yourselves as a liberal entity. What do you intend to do to succeed, and does a liberal party have any chance in the context of what the Slovak voter has experienced over the past five years? [Moravcik] The emphasis on being a liberal party is not important to us. The important part for us is that we promote the program we call liberal and submit it to the voter for his own assessment.
