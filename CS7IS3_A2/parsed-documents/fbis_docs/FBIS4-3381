"The second round of informal Taiwan-U.S. trade consultations under the GATT framework will begin May 9 and we hope the talks will produce concrete results," said Tsai Lien-sheng, a BOFT department director. Major topics will include tariff reductions and the removal of non-tariff trade barriers, including liberalization of agricultural imports, government procurement and aircraft purchases, Tsai noted. During the first round of talks held in Taipei in late February, American delegates were dissatisfied with Taiwan-proposed tariff cuts on a range of industrial and agricultural products. Tsai said the U.S. wants Taiwan to make greater tariff reductions in accordance with the GATT Uruguay Round accord and allow free imports of farm products. Tsai said the government will seek a 10-year adjustment period for local rice farmers. Taiwan will only allow imports of 1 to 4 percent of its annual rice consumption for the first 10 years after joining GATT. After the adjustment period, Taiwan's market will become fully open to foreign rice imports, he explained. Tsai said Taiwan may agree to sign a GATT agreement on government procurement to facilitate its GATT entry. BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will head the Taiwan delegation to the May talks, Tsai added.
