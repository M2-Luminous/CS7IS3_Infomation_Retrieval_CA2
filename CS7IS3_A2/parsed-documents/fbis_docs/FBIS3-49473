During the 1994 electoral campaign, Hungary's main coalition party will do its utmost to prevent the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) from having the chance to form a government, he said. The MDF does not want to enter into coalition with parties which disagree with its nationally-committed policy and do not recognize the values of a conservative center-right policy, Kulin asserted. Asked by MTI, the politician thought it impossible for the MDF to make a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats. Any further guesses were meaningless -- the MDF would not look at alliances with other parties before knowing election results.
