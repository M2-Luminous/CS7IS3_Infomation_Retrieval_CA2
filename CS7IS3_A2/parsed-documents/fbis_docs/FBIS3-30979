In his letter Minister Granic informs Butrus-Ghali about the readiness displayed by both sides to intensify negotiations which have been initiated on the resolution of remaining contentious issues and future relations between the Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim nations. Minister Granic welcomes the consent given by the governments of the United States, European, and other countries for pressure to be stepped up on all the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to reach a final solution on the basis of the European Union action plan. Minister Granic also expresses support for the NATO readiness to use force to lift the siege of Sarajevo, which represents the first step in the implementation of that plan. The Croatian minister of foreign affairs also informs the UN secretary general about Croatia's readiness to meet the request of the UN Security Council to reduce tensions between the Croatian and Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the spirit of a cease-fire agreement that the two sides have previously signed. The Croatian government will also turn to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] representatives in order to coordinate the verification of moves by the Croatian Government and the Croatian Defense Council, which should reduce tension and rebuild trust between the Croatian and Muslim sides, particularly in central Bosnia and in Mostar. The Croatian Government asks the UN Security Council to offer guarantees with regard to halting the offensive actions of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas, in the spirit of the aforementioned Geneva negotiations.
