Yubun Ueno's comment paves the way for voting on the bills by the committee later the same day. "I decided to hold a panel session on January 19 prior to a final vote," Ueno said. The government and the seven-party ruling coalition have been trying to force the bills through the committee by Wednesday and through the House of Councillors by Friday at the latest. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed a plan to modify 10 points in the government's bills as a condition for endorsing them, but the coalition rejected them and is ready to get the bills through the committee and an upper house plenary session without any revision. The bills cleared the more powerful House of Representatives on November 18. Two of the 10 points demanded by the LDP are a continuation of donations by enterprises and groups to individual politicians and a ban on visits by candidates to the homes of voters. The LDP also called for revising the system whereby votes are counted by treating the whole of Japan as an electoral district for proportional representation in lower house elections. The government bills allow candidates to visit voters' homes for 12 hours from 8 A.M. during campaign days and bar firms and groups from donating money to individual politicians. The government wants 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats decided by proportional representation, cutting the current total of 511 seats in the lower house to 500. The lower chamber killed the LDP-proposed bills on November 18. The bills, designed to revamp Japan's corruption-tainted politics, set the amount of public money available annually for political activities at 30.9 billion yen, a figure proposed by the LDP, down from the coalition's initial proposal of 41.4 billion yen. The upper house delayed deliberation of the government's bills after they cleared the lower house, and the Diet voted December 15 to extend for 45 days beyond the deadline of the 90-day session to January 29.
