Russia's peacekeeping forces are ready to take up positions on the Inguri River [Abkhazia] and along the front line of confrontation between Armenian and Azeri military units. Two to three years ago, Russia transferred quite a large amount of weapons to those countries involved in the current wars in the Transcaucasus. The reason for this was simple: The opposing sides would cause great damage to one another with the transferred weapons and then the Russian Army would directly intervene in events. The plan has, for all intents and purposes, succeeded. A new stage of subjugation is beginning in the Transcaucasus although certain facts could change the scenario somewhat. In spite of six years of bloody battles, both Azerbaijan and Armenia still possess a large amount of military equipment and armaments. The Armenian Armed Forces: Army -- 32,682 men, including: Main Staff -- 773; Ground Forces -- 31,909; Tanks: T-72 -- 129; IFV's: IFV-1 -- 192; IFV-2 -- nine; IFV-1K (Command) -- seven; BRM-1 (Reconnaissance) -- 22; BMD's: BMD-1 -- 12; APC's: APC-60PB -- 27; APC-70 -- 67; APC-80 -- four; APC-152 -- six; Artillery: 122 mm howitzer D-30 -- 63; 122 mm self-propelled artillery system 2S-1 "Gvozdika" -- 10; 152 mm self-propelled artillery system 2S-3 "Akatsiya" -- 32; 152 mm howitzer D-20 -- 31; 152 mm gun 2A-36B "Giatsint" -- 20; 152 mm howitzer D-1 -- two; 120 mm mortar -- 19; 122 mm multiple rocket launcher LV-21 "Grad" -- 48; Aviation: MiG-25 fighter aircraft -- one; Su-25 assault aircraft -- five; Mi-24 assault helicopter -- 13. Azeri Armed Forces: Army -- 56,000 men, including: Ground forces -- 48,920; air forces -- 2,050; naval forces -- 1,500; air defense -- 3,530; Tanks: T-72 -- 163; T-55 -- 116; IFV's: IFV-1 -- 104; IFV-2 -- 191; IFV-3 -- three; BRM-1 (Reconnaissance) -- 34; BMD's: BMD-1 -- 90; BMD-2 -- one; APC's: APC-60PB -- eight; APC-70 -- 76; APC-80 -- nine; APC-A (amphibious) -- 22; Multi-purpose tracked vehicle MT-LB -- 198; Artillery: 122 mm howitzer D-30 -- 153; 122 mm self-propelled artillery system 2S-1 "Gvozdika" -- 14; 152 mm self-propelled artillery system 2S-3 "Akatsiya" -- 36; 152 mm D-20 -- 36; 152 mm gun 2A-36B "Giatsint" -- 24; 122 mm multiple rocket launcher LV-21 "Grad" -- 66; Aviation: MiG-21 fighter aircraft -- six; MiG-25 fighter-reconnaissance aircraft -- 35; Su-24 tactical bomber and reconnaissance aircraft -- seven; Su-25 assault aircraft -- three; Su-17 fighter-bomber aircraft -- two; Mi-24 assault helicopter -- six. This data is based upon that of independent foreign military experts (although it is not excluded that, as a result of wide-scale hostilities during the last few weeks, certain changes have occurred). One assumes that Azerbaijan will not reconcile itself to the occupation of a large part of its territory by Armenia's Armed Forces, whereas Armenia will try in every way possible to maintain a buffer zone along the border with Nagorno-Karabakh. A cessation of hostilities in the war in southern Azerbaijan is unlikely in the near future; the large amount of combat equipment gives one grounds to assume that a big war is yet to come.
