SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Soya Oligo Japan, Inc., has filed a petition (GRASP 1G0369) proposing to affirm that soybean oligosaccharide syrup is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used as an ingredient in foods. DATES: Written comments by May 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Blondell Anderson, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;207), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))) and the regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in §170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Soya Oligo Japan, Inc., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500, Washington, DC 20001, has filed a petition (GRASP 1G0369) proposing that soybean oligosaccharide syrup be affirmed as GRAS when used as an ingredient in foods. The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in §§170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation. The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the Federal Register in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c). Interested persons may, on or before May 30, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comment should be filed and should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be helpful in determining whether soybean oligosaccharide syrup is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use and whether it should be listed for use as an ingredient in foods. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: March 1, 1994. L. Robert Lake, Acting Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5789 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
