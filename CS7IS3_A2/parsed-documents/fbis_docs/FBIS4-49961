Speaking at the function, Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: After meticulous and thorough preparations, the Tibet Art Troupe will soon be leaving for performances in Austria. The troupe is thus far Tibet's largest cultural troupe to be dispatched for overseas performances, serving not only as a key foreign propaganda project for Tibet, but also a major cultural exchange program with foreign countries. Gyaincain Norbu stated: We should, through visiting performances, widely publicize Tibet's realities, including political stability, economic development, social progress, nationality solidarity, ever-enhancing living standards, protected Zang culture, and freedom of religion achieved under the correct central leadership and with the vigorous support of people of all nationalities across the country in the past 40-odd years since its peaceful liberation, particularly since launching of reform and opening up, so that more Zang compatriots overseas and people all over the world will have a correct and full understanding on Tibet -- a bid to project a correct image of a new socialist Tibet to the world and to enhance friendship between the people of the Chinese Tibet and that of other nations through friendly exchanges. Gyaincain Norbu said: The Tibet Art Troupe will not only function as Chinese ambassadors responsible for conducting cultural exchanges with foreign countries with the missions of spreading friendship and broadening overseas publicity, but will also be given the important responsibilities of studying, drawing experience from, and absorbing the fine cultures of the people of other nations. The autonomous regional party committee and government hope that all members of the art troupe will be united as one in completely fulfilling their glorious and arduous missions entrusted by the party and the people of the motherland.
