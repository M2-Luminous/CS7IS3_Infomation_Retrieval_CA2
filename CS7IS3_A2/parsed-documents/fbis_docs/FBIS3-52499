In a statement issued in Islamabad yesterday, he called on all Afghan parties to initiate the process of dialogue for national reconciliation. He said the need of the hour is peace, understanding, and reconstruction in Afghanistan, so that the valiant people of that country could benefit from the fruits of the holy war. The foreign minister said Pakistan is of the firm view that the military triumph of any one faction over the other will be of a transient nature, and it may further exacerbate regional, ethnic, and linguistic tension and may undermine Afghanistan's unity and regional peace. He said it is very important for all regional countries, especially for Pakistan, to ensure that civil war is replaced by peace in Afghanistan. He said we believe this objective can be achieved through the process of negotiations and broad consensus. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said he is ready to visit Afghanistan if the Afghan leadership responds positively.
