[Yaacobi] Yes, it is the beginning of the end of a process which may lead towards reconciliation and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. But it is not a time for celebrations, it is a time for realization of the implementation of the agreement. And the Palestinians are facing the main challenge -- to be in charge of their lives and the municipal and civilian affairs of their people in the territories. [Snow] Do you think you've done it soon enough for the PLO to be those Palestinians in charge? [Yaacobi] Yes, I believe that we did it in a very accelerated way. Within three weeks the implementation will be over and at that time the Palestinians will take over and I believe that this will be perhaps the end of the conflict between the two peoples that has lasted for 100 years in general, but for the last 27 years, since the six-day war. [Snow] Now, two other very important ingredients to the global Middle East peace -- Jordan and Syria -- have both said that this accord will not lead to a wider peace in the Middle East. They've both condemned it. [Yaacobi] I am sorry to hear it because I think that Jordan supported the whole move for a very long period of time. One day after the Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington DC, Israel signed with Jordan the agenda for peace which included a mutual agreed agenda to make progress toward a peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. But I agree with those who think that this is not enough. First of all, we have to implement this agreement, and the main task is that of the Palestinians. Secondly, we have to conclude positively the negotiations between Israel-Syria, Israel-Lebanon, and Israel-Jordan. And we know very well that Syria is a key state in the whole peace process in the Middle East. And following a peace treaty between Israel and Syria -- I believe that it is the only option that the two states are having -- then of course other states and neighboring Arab countries will join the peace process with Israel and hopefully it will be within the next year. [Snow] Well, sitting where you are in New York, briefly do you see the Syrians actually concluding something within in the next year? [Yaacobi] We would like to see them doing it, because we believe that this is the only way that the Syrians can achieve their goals, which means having back some of the territory of the Golan Heights, doing peace with Israel, developing resources from the conflict into the economy and the society, and communication and housing, and the same is relevant to Israel. We are willing to build a new Middle East and a new future for our people. This is what the whole story is about. [Snow] Ambassador, thank you very much.
