Perhaps it was in hopes of avoiding Iranian terrorist blackmail as the trial in France of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's assassin draws closer, Dupuy conjectures. Perhaps it was a way of ingratiating fundamentalists the world over, and especially in Algeria, he adds. Then again, the government may have been motivated by its desire to promote economic relations in an area where France's role is "unremarkable." Deploring the government's refusal to comment, Dupuy expresses the hope that, on the contrary, much will be said, it being "at least strange" that a government that includes "professional terrorist eaters" such as Interior Minister Charles Pasqua would show Tehran a kindness "whose laxism borders on cynicism." The "national interest" invoked by Paris entails a minimum of political morality, and hence transparency, Dupuy concludes.
