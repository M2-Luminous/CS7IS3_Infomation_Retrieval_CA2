FR941117-0-00213 FR941117-0-00014 The Commission also requested comment on the broader issue of whether the shortened settlement period of three days (``T+3 Settlement'') will have an effect on the future utility of the confirmation and whether some information currently required in the confirmation could be shifted to an account statement. 14 In addition, the Commission proposed adding a preliminary statement to Rule 10b&hyph;10 designed to clarify that the Rule is not intended as a safe harbor from the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 15 14 See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12767&hyph;68. 15 Id. at 59 FR 12772. In response to the request for comment, the Commission received 344 comment letters, the majority of which addressed the mark-up disclosure proposals for riskless principal transactions. Commenters included regional and national broker-dealers, industry associations, financial institutions, law firms, insurance companies, and individual investors. 16 The comments presented a range of views with respect to the proposals and the effects that the proposed disclosure requirements may have on broker-dealers, investors, and markets. 16 The comment letters and a summary of comments have been placed in Public Reference File No. S7&hyph;6&hyph;94, which is available for inspection in the Public Reference Room. After a review of the comments, the Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 that require disclosure if a debt security is not rated by an NRSRO, with a modification to exclude all government securities from the disclosure requirement; mark-up disclosure in connection with transactions in certain NASDAQ and regional exchange-listed securities; disclosure if a broker-dealer is not a member of SIPC, except for certain transactions in investment company shares by non-SIPC member firms that do not handle customer funds or securities; and disclosure with respect to the availability of information with respect to transactions in collateralized debt securities. The Commission also is adopting the preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10. To allow firms the appropriate time to adapt their systems to accommodate these disclosure requirements, the proposals will become effective April 3, 1995. In addition, that portion of Rule 15c2&hyph;13 that would require disclosure if a municipal security was not rated by an NRSRO has been deferred and will be withdrawn if the MSRB acts to adopt similar amendments to its confirmation rule, Rule G&hyph;15. 17 The MSRB recently reiterated its willingness to amend Rule G&hyph;15 to require disclosure if a municipal security is not rated by an NRSRO. 18 17 MSRB Rule G&hyph;15, MSRB Manual (CCH) Â¶ 3571. 18 Letter from Robert H. Drysdale, Chairman, MSRB, to Arthur Levitt, Chairman, SEC (Nov. 3, 1994). Available in Public Reference File No. S7&hyph;6&hyph;94. II. Description of Amendments A. Role of the Confirmation The Commission's confirmation rule, Rule 10b&hyph;10 19 under the Exchange Act, 20 generally requires a broker-dealer effecting a customer transaction in securities (other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities) to provide written notification to its customer, at or before completion of a transaction, that discloses information specific to the transaction. The confirmation requires, among other things, the disclosure of: The date, time, identity, and number of shares bought or sold; 21 the capacity of the broker-dealer; 22 the net dollar price and yield of a debt security; 23 and, under specified circumstances, the amount of compensation paid to the broker-dealer and whether payment for order flow is received. 24 For over 50 years, the customer confirmation has served basic investor protection functions by conveying information allowing investors to verify the terms of their transactions; alerting investors to potential conflicts of interest with their broker-dealers; acting as a safeguard against fraud; and providing investors the means to evaluate the costs of their transactions and the quality of their broker-dealer's execution. 19 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10. 20 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq . 21 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(2). 22 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(1). 23 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(4)(i); and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(5). 24 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(7) (ii) and (iii); 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(8)(i)(A); and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(8)(i)(B). Recently, the Commission proposed for comment additional disclosures relevant to payment for order flow, which would include for monetary payment for order flow, the range of payments received on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually. For non-monetary payment for order flow, the Commission proposed requiring disclosure of an estimate of the range of payment for order flow on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34903 (Oct. 27, 1994), 59 FR 55014. 1. T+3 Settlement In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on the future utility of the confirmation once T+3 Settlement is implemented on June 7, 1995. 25 Rule 10b&hyph;10 requires that a confirmation be sent at or before completion of a customer transaction. 26 Commenters noted that T+3 Settlement will diminish the confirmation's usefulness as a customer invoice and questioned the practicability of requiring the disclosure of additional information on a document that an investor will receive after already having made his or her investment decision and tendering funds or securities. 27 25 T+3 Settlement was adopted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (Oct. 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891. 26 Rule 15c1&hyph;1 under the Exchange Act defines ``the completion of the transaction.'' 17 CFR 240.15c1&hyph;1(b). 27 See, e.g ., Letters from A.
