In addition to general issues, the delegations arriving at the meeting intend to solve their own problems. For instance, the Moldavian [Moldovan] delegation plans to sign a number of agreements, except military ones. That country is very interested in setting up a free economic zone, re-exporting goods, and solving the issues of a payment union. Tajikistan plans to discuss additional measures to stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border.

In addition, President Askar Akayev is to speak about the natural disasters in the republic. Russia has given the largest amount of aid to the areas hit by landslides.
