The Sino-U.S. Summit Meeting Achieves Results A matter of first importance in China's foreign affairs in 1993 should be the formal summit meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton held in Seattle on the 19 November. It was not only the first formal Sino-U.S. summit meeting since the "Beijing disturbance" in 1989, but also a contact in which both sides sought a favorable turn at a time when Sino-U.S. relations were undergoing twists and turns. So their meeting was of special significance. Jiang Zemin's meeting with Clinton occurred at the crucial time when there had been conflict between China and the United States, though neither side wished to fall out with the other completely. Ever since Clinton took office, Sino-U.S. relations have tended to be strained. The two most prominent incidents created by Washington in July were: The U.S. ban on the export of high-tech, sensitive products to the PRC for two years on the so-called grounds that "China had transferred M-11 missile technology to Pakistan"; and the obstruction by U.S. warships of the Chinese freighter "Yinhe" on its way to Iran in accordance with false information that the freighter was loaded with the precursors of chemical weapons. These were the strong measures taken against China by the United States on the issue of weapons proliferation. However, Beijing did not submit. It strongly protested to Washington, declaring that it would reconsider its commitment to the "missile technology control regime" and claiming compensation of $12.93 million from the United States for the loss which China suffered from the "Yinhe" incident. The United States Will Shift Its Target for an Economic Boost to Asia On the other hand, the United States has decided to shift the focus of its foreign policy to Asia in accordance with its primary target for rejuvenating its economy, which is suffering a slump. Under such circumstances Clinton reiterated that Sino-U.S. relations will be strengthened while he was on his way to Tokyo to attend the G-7 summit meeting and during his visit to Seoul. Some White House advisers offered advice, suggesting that Washington change its China policy. Then Clinton approved his senior officials' visits to Beijing. Charles Freeman, U.S. assistant secretary for regional security affairs, visited China at the end of October, reopening the dialogue between Chinese and U.S. military officials which had been suspended for four years. At the same time, Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum summit conference in Seattle. Thus the Chinese and U.S. Presidents, who had newly assumed office, had an opportunity for contact. The meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton lasted 90 minutes. Later Clinton talked to the press, saying that the meeting was "fruitful" and a "good beginning" for Sino-U.S. relations, while Jiang Zemin said that the meeting "had promoted understanding, helped improve and develop Sino-U.S. relations, and marked a good, new beginning for the Sino-U.S. relationship." Both leaders made positive comments on their meeting. Political observers note China and the United States differ on the issues of human rights, trade and weapons proliferation. China has not made any concessions. Although Clinton mentioned these problems at their meeting, Jiang Zemin ignored them. Before setting out for Seattle from Beijing Jiang had reiterated China's position, saying that "attaching conditions to U.S. most-favored-nation treatment was a practice left over from the time of the Cold War and should be discarded." Since the meeting of the Chinese and U.S. leaders, the foreign ministers of the two countries have visited each other and the departments concerned have increased their mutual visits. Qian Qichen said at a press conference that both sides had many specific problems to discuss, such as trade, human rights and weapons proliferation. Whatever problems concerned China and the United States could be discussed. The United States is concerned about the big trade deficit, while China is concerned about whether it gets approval to purchase U.S. goods. International opinion believes that both China and the United States have found ways to improve their relationship and China has increased its impact on the world. Kohl Returns Home With Fruitful Results, Having Entered Into Business Contracts Worth $2.8 Billion German Chancellor Kohl visited China last November. During his visit China and Germany signed more than 20 business contracts, agreements and letters of intent, the amount of business totaling $2.8 billion. This shows there has been a new breakthrough in the relationship between China and a big European power. Kohl has been to China three times. However, this was his first visit as head of government of unified Germany. It was also at a time when Germany had adjusted its "new Asian strategy." He made it clear that Germany would follow the policy of "one China" and that it would not have any official connections with Taiwan or sell it any weapons. Germany, with its powerful economic strength, has noted that Asia has maintained a strong impetus in its economic development. It is especially attracted by China, whose economy has been developing at high speed. At the same time, Germany is seeking a permanent seat in the Security Council of the United Nations, with the hope that China will vote for it. So Kohl visited China in November after visiting five Asian countries, namely, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and the ROK, in February. He declared that the purpose of his visit to China was to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in various fields, endowing the German-Chinese relationship with a new quality. China badly needs funds and advanced technology from Germany in the process of pushing its national economy up to a new stage. Germany is China's biggest trading partner in Europe. Trade between the two countries this year greatly exceeds the total of $6.47 billion in 1992. The contracts signed between China and Germany include German loans for the project of constructing the Guangzhou underground railway network and China's purchase of six German A-340 airbuses. Kohl said that there were no obstacles on Germany's part in exchanges between Germany and China in the sphere of high technology. There is no doubt that Germany has sent China "charcoal in snowy weather," given that the United States has banned the export of sensitive high-technology products to China. As Taiwan intended to buy submarines from Germany, some German enterprises showed great interest and wished to try. However, Kohl made it clear that Germany would not sell any weapons to Taiwan to avoid possible trouble in the Sino-German relationship. What Lessons Does Britain Draw From What Germany Has Done? In Europe, France is probing to repair its relationship with China, while Britain has fallen out with China over the political system in Hong Kong. Talks between China and Britain have been suspended and China is quickening the preparatory work for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It is inevitable that trade between China and Britain will be affected. In this way, Britain has lost a good opportunity to enter China's market, in striking contrast with Germany, which is quickening its road to the East and promoting all-round cooperation with China. During Kohl's visit to China, China sent two signals to the West: One was Beijing's perception that Germany took the correct stand on the question of Taiwan, thus laying an "important foundation for the continuous development of Sino-German relations; the other is the great potential of China's market, that is, during its Eighth Five-Year Plan from 1991 to 1995, China's total import amount will increase from the originally planned $300 billion to $400 billion. It is no doubt a great attraction to the slack economy of the West. ASEAN Countries Get Closer to Beijing Heads of state and government leaders of the six ASEAN countries visited China, while Qiao Shi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC], visited five ASEAN countries this year. From February with its spring chill to November with its clear autumn skies and crisp air, Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong, President of the Philippines Ramos, and Prime Minister of Thailand Chuan Likphai visited China one after another after they took office. Sultan Hassanal of Brunei visited Beijing after his country established diplomatic relations with China. Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir visited China for the second time. Although no senior officials from Indonesia visited China this year, President Suharto met with Jiang Zemin in Seattle. ASEAN Leaders Take Large Groups of Entrepreneurs To Visit China Economic and trade cooperation with mutual benefit is the distinctive characteristic of the contacts between China and ASEAN countries this year. Some ASEAN leaders took large groups of entrepreneurs to visit China directly and signed huge cooperative projects with China. Among them is the "Suzhou Industrial Park," a cooperative construction project between Singapore and China which introduces Singapore's experience in the construction and management of Yulang Industrial Park. Businessmen from Singapore have also invested in opening up a large area in Shandong Province. It is worth noting that the leaders of five ASEAN countries do not believe the "China threat theory" spread by the West. Instead, they consider that a strong and prosperous China will benefit the prosperity and stability of Asia. Moreover, they accept China's position on the Nansha Islands, that is, "put aside disputes and open them up together." Qiao Shi chose Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines for his first visit after he became chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It never happened in the past that a Chinese leader visited five ASEAN countries in one trip. During his visit Qiao Shi put forward the four principles which China would follow in its contacts with ASEAN countries. Of the four principles, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are listed first. This has further promoted the trust of the ASEAN countries in China. In November this year, ASEAN Secretary General Singh [xin ge 6580 2706] paid his first visit to China. His Beijing trip resulted in the establishment of the joint Sino-ASEAN Committee of Economic and Trade Cooperation and the Joint Sino-ASEAN Committee of Science and Technology Cooperation and promoted the cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in the fields of economy, trade and science and technology. New Developments in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Indian Relations This year China has also improved relations with Vietnam and India. They are neighbors which had once fallen foul of Beijing. In November 1991, leaders of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi and Vo Van Kiet visited China, their trip promoting normalization of the relationship between China and Vietnam. At the end of 1992, Li Peng paid a return visit to Hanoi, while Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh visited Beijing in November this year. Their visits deepened top-level mutual understanding. The obstacles in Sino-Vietnamese relations lie in the border dispute and the Cambodian issue. Now the Cambodian issue has been basically settled. Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, vice foreign ministers and specialists of both sides have held meetings to deal with the border dispute. In October this year, China and Vietnam signed a treaty on the basic principles for solving the issue of border territory, laying the foundation for further border negotiations between the two countries. Contacts between top officials of China and India have also increased. At the end of 1991 Li Peng visited New Delhi, while Indian Prime Minister Rao paid a return visit to Beijing in November this year. The greatest reward of his visit to China was the signing of a treaty ensuring peace and stability in the border areas which both sides actually control. Thus, conditions for final settlement of the border issue were created. Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited Nepal, India and Pakistan in November. It was another diplomatic move by China to further develop good-neighborly relations with these three Southeast Asian countries. China Pays Attention to the Countries to Its North China also lays stress on cooperation with countries of the CIS. Exchanges in various fields such as economy, culture and military affairs have been further strengthened. Last year Russian President Yeltsin was invited to visit China. As a result, trade relations between the two countries have been developing rapidly, their trade volume totaling more than $5 billion. In June this year, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited Russia, and Russian Defense Minister Grachev visited Beijing in November. Both sides signed a Sino-Russian treaty of cooperation between the two defense ministries. It involves contacts between personnel and exchanges of experience. In addition, Georgian head of state Shevardnadze, Tajikistan head of state Rakhmanov and Lithuanian President Brazanskas visited China for the first time. Li Peng originally planned to visit four Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyszstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and Mongolia to the north of China as well. He postponed his visits to these countries because he suffered a sudden heart attack. To seek a peaceful international environment, especially a stable surrounding environment, China has promoted friendly contacts with its neighboring countries in a big way. Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC, led a party and government delegation to visit the DPRK. The visit was also aimed at promoting good relations with its neighbor to the northeast. Countries That Have Established Diplomatic Relations With China Have Increased to 158 China has been very active in its foreign affairs this year, having established diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Eritrea and Macedonia and resumed diplomatic relations with Liberia. Thus those countries that have established diplomatic relations with China total 158. Dominican President Seignoret recently visited Beijing, though his country has not yet established diplomatic relations with China. Democratic Parties Get Involved in Foreign Affairs It is a new tendency in China's foreign affairs that leaders of China's various democratic parties take turns to welcome foreign leaders who come to visit China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Rong Yiren, known for his nickname "red capitalist," talked freely about internal and external affairs while meeting foreign guests in Beijing. Furthermore, he visited Portugal and Spain as part of the effort to promote China's foreign affairs. China's Year of Foreign Ministers It is a new tendency that the foreign ministers that visited China this year are particularly numerous. By the end of November, there had already been 24. Some people consider this year "China's year of foreign ministers." Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, has been especially busy since so many ministers of foreign affairs have visited Beijing. At the same time Qian Qichen has also visited 26 countries this year (20 countries last year). Qian Qichen's Frequent and Busy Activities Epitomize China's Active Foreign Affairs While attending the 48th UN General Assembly in New York at the end of September, Qian met with state heads, government leaders and ministers of foreign affairs of nearly 60 countries. It is Qian Qichen's frequent and busy activities in foreign affairs that epitomize China's foreign affairs. Deng Xiaoping's 16-Character Policy The pragmatic and flexible display of China's omnidimensional foreign affairs embodies Deng Xiaoping's analysis of the international situation and his diplomatic tactics. In November this year, the Chinese authorities first made known a series of speeches on China's foreign affairs and the international situation made by Deng in recent years. On 3 March 1990 Deng talked with several bigwigs of the CPC after great changes had taken place in Eastern Europe. He pointed out: "The old pattern is undergoing changes, but this process is actually not completed and the new pattern has not formed yet. As for the two big issues of peace and development, the issue of peace is not settled and the issue of development has worsened." In the face of the changeable international situation, Deng Xiaoping put forward the 16-character guiding policy for China to cope with international problems in its foreign affairs. It reads: "Observe coolly, stand firm, tackle calmly and accomplish something." On 4 September 1989, when Deng talked with several top leaders of the CPC about the present international situation and China's tactics, he summarized it in three sentences: "The first sentence is to observe coolly; the second one is to stand firm; and the third one is to tackle calmly." He said emphatically: "Be cool, cool and cool again, immerse ourselves in hard work, do a good job, a job of our own." In accordance with the three sentences put forward by Deng Xiaoping, in its foreign affairs China went through the test when international incidents such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union occurred and withstood the pressure caused by Western sanctions. On 14 December 1990, 14 months later, Deng talked with several bigwigs of the CPC. He urged China to accomplish something in diplomacy. He pointed out: "There are many unpredictable factors in the international situation, while contradictions become more and more prominent." He said: "Some Third World countries want China to take the lead. It is a fundamental policy of our country that we will never take the lead. We cannot afford to do that. It is beyond our strength. It is absolutely disadvantageous to do so for we will lose a lot of initiative. China will always stand on the side of the Third World. China will never seek hegemony, nor will China take the lead. However, it is not possible to do nothing on international issues. We should accomplish something. What to do? I think we will actively promote the establishment of a new international order in politics and economy. We are afraid of no one and we will not offend anyone. We will act in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence, which we will stick to on matters of principle and stand." Deng Xiaoping's theory is still guiding Chinese diplomats from behind, moving freely and developing flexibly in the international arena.
