The seized heroin, allegedly imported by one Joe Brown Ekubueze, were seized by the anti-narcotics agency at Apapa Port and had been stored at warehouses in Buxton and Shaw Roads, Ikoyi in Lagos. The discrepancy was raised Tuesday by an unidentified state witness, who claimed to be a narcotic superintendent with NDLEA. He said the discrepancy was only discovered when the drugs actually seized were counted by a team from the miscellaneous offences tribunal, which has started hearing the case. He claimed that there was overestimation of the wraps which were seized last December. He said the total wraps of heroin, excluding one wrap presented as exhibit in the court, was 289. Retracting from his earlier testimony, the agent said the total number of seized heroin wraps was 290 and not 302 [as] were found by the tribunal's inspection team. He added that another 87 pouches of heroin were seized 30 December, each containing two wraps, plus the one tendered as [an] exhibit in the tribunal. This brought the number of wraps to 351 and not 347, said the witness, who was only referred to as "Mr W". Asked by Justice Olufunmilayo One-Okpaku to explain the discrepancy, the agent said "I am not competent to explain the discrepancy in the number of wraps counted because I am not the exhibit keeper."
