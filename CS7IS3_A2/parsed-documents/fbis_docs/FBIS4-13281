One attack follows another and terrorism has become a daily occurrence. Seeing as we are now opening the Knesset summer session, I would like to remind you, Mr. Prime Minister, of what you said at the beginning of the last winter session. Seven months ago, eight days after signing the Oslo agreement with 'Arafat, you stood upon the podium and declared that a new era had begun. I am quoting the very words you used to describe it: a new era. I continue to quote: Today, we are heading toward greater opportunities and better times, toward days which will be free of worry and nights which will be free of anxiety. When the peace which we so yearn for arrives, our lives will change completely and we will no longer have to live by the sword. What has happened since then? What has happened is that there has never been such a deterioration of personal security in every city, town, village, and settlement in this country. You, Mr. Prime Minister. You, and not me, mentioned statistics before. I heard your statistics. You said that 161 Israeli civilians were murdered during the six and a half years of the intifadah. Sorry, I was mistaken, the correct number is 151. Since the signing of the Oslo agreement, a period of a little more than six months, almost 40 Israeli civilians were murdered. According to my calculation, Mr. Prime Minister, this means that since the signing of the Oslo agreement -- which you signed in order to bring about an end to terrorism -- the rate of murders and the rate of terrorism has increased fourfold. So do not talk to us about days without anxiety. What you have brought us with your government's stupid policy is days filled with worry and nights consumed by anxiety. The good days you promised us have turned into days of bloodshed and terror under the shadow of terrorist attacks. Mr. Prime Minister, the government has failed in the most important task of every Israeli government, which is to protect the life of each civilian; and this failure is a direct result of your policy. You said that you did not change the rules of engagement for IDF soldiers. Okay, I will not argue with you on that point although that too is debatable. However, you did the following things with regard to the other party. You, not me, released thousands of terrorists into the streets. You returned hundreds of deportees. We told you not to permit them to return. They participated in accelerated courses in assembling car bombs in Lebanon, yet you permitted them to return. You pardoned hundreds of fugitives and let all the leaders of the intifadah return. So what happens when you flood the streets with terrorists? Is there really reason to be surprised by the tremendous upsurge in terrorism, as indicated by the data you yourself provided? More terrorists lead to more terrorism. Did you learn anything from this? No, because you are going to continue. We have just been told that you are about to release not 4,000, but another 6,000 prisoners. You talk about a historic process. Mr. Prime Minister, you are about to enter history as the prime minister who established a 9,000 member Palestinian terrorist army whom you are about to arm with helicopters, armored vehicles, and machine guns. You call this a security policy? It is a policy that undermines security, it is a policy of insanity, of disconnection from reality. I call on you to stop this policy and bring it to a halt before there is more bloodshed. However, since we are at the opening of a Knesset session and I have reminded you of statements you made in the past, let me recall other remarks you made at the same session on 21 September 1993, eight days after the signing of the agreement in Washington. You said that you have firmly anchored this agreement on three basic tenets. Let me quote the very words you used from this podium to describe these three principles. One, the PLO has committed to condemn and stop all acts of terrorism and violence in Israel, the territories, and everywhere else. Two, the PLO has promised to enforce the cessation of terrorism and violence on all of its members and prosecute anyone who breaks these commitments. Three, the PLO has promised to annul all clauses in the Palestinian Covenant denying Israel's right to exist and to bring about the official abrogation of these clauses. Mr. Prime Minister, what is left from all these commitments? You can make as many dismissive gestures as you want. Let us see what happened. You said that the PLO would stop terrorism. Okay, so we checked the minutes again and noted down that on the same occasion on this podium, eight days after the signing of the agreement, you said -- and I quote: I would like to report that since the signing of the Oslo agreement, the PLO has not carried out any attacks. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to tell you that nearly eight months have now passed since the signing of the Oslo agreement and they have definitely perpetrated attacks. Let us see what the PLO has done. First of all, the PLO -- and right now I am not talking about people directly under 'Arafat's command, I am talking about those who are not under his direct command -- these factions carried out nine terrorist attacks. They killed five Israelis and wounded eight other people. Okay, they are not directly under 'Arafat's command. So let us see what the Fatah did. This is much worse, Mr. Prime Minister. When one makes use of statistics it is advisable to examine the figures first. For example, the Fatah, 'Arafat's own organization, carried out 37 attacks in which six people were killed and 14 others were wounded. I would like to read out the names of Yuval Golan, David Dedi, Hayim Weizman, Yitzhaq Rutenberg, Maurice Eisenstadt -- who murdered them Mr. Prime Minister? Was it the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]? No, it was Fatah. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the prime minister who murdered them? Was it the enemies of peace? No, it was the supporters of peace, the Fatah people, the good guys. You understand: There are bad guys, who are the Hamas, and good guys who are the PLO. There are also even better guys among the good guys -- that is Fatah, the cream of the crop. Mr. Prime Minister, the first promise you made to the people of Israel that the PLO would halt terrorism was not kept. Now, with regard to the second promise that 'Arafat would take steps to punish any of his people who continued to carry out attacks, thus violating the new policy of putting a stop to terrorism -- that was not kept either. No action whatsoever was taken against any of these murderers. 'Arafat did not say anything. He did not bring them before a court, he did not expel them from the organization, he has not even condemned the attacks. One can occasionally drag out a condemnation from him much like a dentist extracting a tooth from a reluctant patient. That is really interesting. Obviously, the second condition that the PLO would take steps against terrorists was not kept. Now for your third promise: that 'Arafat would annul the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's destruction. He has not canceled the covenant nor does he intend to abrogate it in future. Mr. Prime Minister, I heard a senior defense establishment official, whom you sent to one of the Knesset committees, say that Israel had solid intelligence data that they had no intention of ever conceding anything. What are you proposing? Let us examine that. Every single one of your assumptions, without exception, has crumbled in the face of reality. I understand that this bothers you, Mr. Peres. You wrote a book about the new Middle East but what can you do if the old Middle East comes back to slap you in the face? I know that reality is hard to face. Because when you examine your assumptions -- the PLO did not keep its promise to stop terrorism; the Palestinian Covenant was not canceled; and no punitive steps were ever taken against PLO terrorists -- they all crumble in the face of reality. All I am asking for is that the prime minister, who, as we have already seen, can take the stage at any given moment, come up to the podium and simply admit that he was wrong. Let him say: I was wrong and made certain assumptions that did not come to pass. It can happen. People can make mistakes. Mr. Prime Minister, I heard that you held a telephone conversation with 'Arafat two or three days ago. Let me ask you exactly what you have to talk to that man about? Do you demand that he revoke the Palestinian Covenant and stop Fatah terrorism? Do you demand that he enforce these steps? Do you ask for this? It is very hard to hear the truth but the people already know the truth and no amount of shouting can hide or obfuscate it. Mr. Prime Minister, I was also told that during yesterday's cabinet session, you flexed a little, puny muscle vis a vis the PLO. You said something, you gently chided them that people were saying that the Fatah in Gaza is not behaving nicely, that it has some sort of cooperation going. Look, I do not want to offend the prime minister or the members of the cabinet but I do not think that 'Arafat is overly concerned and I will tell you why. It is because he sees and knows that every one of the basic assumptions that you counted on, every one of the promises he gave you are not being kept and you are not demanding that he keep them. For him, the entire business is pure bunk. To him, you personally as well as the entire Israeli Government is nothing but a paper tiger. It has no value. It is incapable of demanding or insisting on anything. It can only make threats which are meaningless. You do not know how to negotiate. Several days ago, I asked a group of Israeli businessmen, who are not affiliated with the Likud -- actually they are even closer to the Labor party -- whether they would entrust negotiations over their private businesses and assets to such a government. None of them said yes. Now, Mr. Prime Minister, you have discovered something new. Mr. Prime Minister, today I heard of your new discovery. You have discovered that the PLO is cooperating with Hamas; or rather you said that if it cooperates with Hamas then we will have to consider taking steps. Have you suddenly discovered this today? Did you not know this already? You have a delegation where Fatah representatives are constantly and incessantly issuing one ultimatum. They are demanding that we release the Hamas murderers. A Hamas official appears at the ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the Fatah's establishment. Now they meet and say that when the Palestinian police, or rather army, is established it will not act to prevent attacks against Israeli citizens. This is Hamas and Fatah. I hear what they say and then I hear your reaction. Who do you threaten? King Husayn. Okay, so you threatened Husayn. But I ask you Mr. Prime Minister, why do you not demand the same demands of yourself that you demand from Husayn. Where is this cooperation between these two terrorist organizations, Hamas and Fatah, taking place? In Amman, Syria, Baghdad, or Tunisia? No, it is taking place here in the territories under your control and responsibility. It is taking place here in the Gaza Strip, in Judaea and Samaria, and you are doing nothing. You are not even condemning it or demanding anything. What you do is threaten King Husayn. This is a government which makes threats that nobody takes seriously. Everything is collapsing and disintegrating. What do you do? What does the prime minister do after all his basic assumptions collapse? The third basic assumption was that the PLO would defend us against Hamas. The prime minister told us several minutes ago and I quote: We will not stop the peace train. What peace are you talking about? Do you really believe this? This is self-delusion, it is not peace. The government is deluding itself and deluding the public. It is a process which will lead to an increase in terrorism. It is a process of retreat. It is a process of retreat which will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders. Mr. Prime Minister, you may have a technical majority in the Knesset, however, you tour the country occasionally and you already know that you do not enjoy the support of a majority of the Israeli public. You do not have a majority and that is putting it diplomatically [Netanyahu interrupted by prolonged heckling]. Mr. Chairman, you have to understand that this government believes that its job is to prevent the opposition from voicing its opinions. If the government can use its influence in the media then great, but if not it can always scream to high heaven. But I can hear what Hamas and Fatah said through all the government's yelling. They said that not only will they cooperate in murdering Jews -- they are not the murderers of peace, they are the murderers of Jews -- but they also said something else which is more important. They reiterated what was once declared by Rafiq al-Natshah, a leading PLO official, who said that they shared a joint long-term goal: the liberation of all of Palestine. Therefore, from the point of view of both Hamas and the PLO, the goal of this process, which you insist on calling a peace process, is to establish a Palestinian state which serves as an instrument for our destruction. The distinction made by the government between those Israelis who oppose and Israelis who support peace is not only absurd but also patently false. There are no opponents of peace among the Israeli people but there are many people who oppose a false peace which is only designed to bring about the establishment of a Palestinian state, to hand over the Golan Heights to the Syrian tyrant, and following these concessions to lead to a war which will be far worse than any we have experienced until today. If one were to ask what is the most fundamental and deepest difference between our approaches it is this: The main difference between the left-wing Labor government and the Likud is that the left-wing believes that peace will be achieved by dwarfing Israel's stature and by its capitulation to the dictates of tyrannical regimes and terrorists; whereas we believe that peace can only be achieved by Israel growing stronger within its present defensive borders. We believe that this strengthening must be effected by expanding settlement activity, increasing aliyah, and bolstering, not weakening, the IDF's ability to meet the challenges we may yet be forced to face.
