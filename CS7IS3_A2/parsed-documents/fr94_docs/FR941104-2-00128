FR941104-2-00128 FR941104-2-00076 Each office will submit the first CSF needs report to the Central Office for ongoing ยง102 and Title III awards by December 1, 1994. CSF will be provided for 75 percent of the reported amount to each office from the available $95,639,978, based on these reports. Each office will submit the second CSF needs report to the Central Office for ongoing ยง102 and Title III awards as of June 30, 1995. The second report is due on or before July 10, 1995. A final distribution of contract support will be made on or about July 31, 1995, on the basis of these reports. If the reports indicate that $95,639,978 will not be sufficient to cover the entire need, this amount will be distributed so that all offices receive the same percentage of their reported need for distribution at this same percentage. Also, should the amount provided for these existing contracts prove insufficient, a tribe or group of tribes may wish to reprogram funds to make up deficiencies made necessary to recover full indirect costs. This tribal reprogramming authority is limited to funds for programs only within the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) portion of the budget. A new program code (39010) was established under TPA in the Federal Finance System (FFS) to accommodate the contract support tribal reprogrammings. For programs other than TPA, tribes are not constrained from recovering full indirect costs from within the overall program and contract support funds awarded for each program. Congressional language specifically precludes the Bureau from requesting a reprogramming of funds on a Bureauwide basis to meet any CSF shortfalls. An ongoing/existing contract is defined as a BIA program operated by the tribe or tribal organization on an ongoing basis which has been entered into prior to the current fiscal year. An increase or decrease in the level of funding from year to year for such contracts would not affect the designation of such contracts as being ongoing. Rather, an assumption of additional BIA program responsibilities would be required to trigger a change in designation as explained below. New and Expanded Contracts Each office will submit CSF need reports to the Central Office for new and expanded ยง102 and Title III contracts. The reports are due in the Central Office on December 1, 1994, and February 2, 1995. Contract support funds will be provided at the 100 percent level to new and expanded contracts on a first-come-first-served basis until the fund is exhausted. The unfunded requests will be given first priority in the subsequent fiscal year, from funds appropriated for this purpose. Priority of Funding for New and Expanded Contracts Contract support will be awarded from the ISD fund to all new and expanded contracts/compacts on a priority basis, based on the start date of the award, the application date, and then the approval date, on a first-come-first-served basis. An Indian Self-Determination Fund ``applicant roster'' shall be maintained, which shall list, in order of priority, the name of the tribe or tribal organization, the name of the program, the start date, the application date, the approval date, the amount of program funds, the program cost code(s), the amount of contract support funds required, and the date of the approved Indirect Cost Rate Agreement, or the date the indirect cost proposal was received by the Inspector General. Start date means the date or commencement of operation of the new or expanded portion of the contract or compact by the tribe or tribal organization. However, the Self-Determination Act provides that contracts will be on a calendar year unless otherwise provided by the tribe, any start date on or prior to January 1 of each year shall be considered a January 1 start date. Application date shall be the date of the request by the tribe which includes: (1) a tribal resolution requesting a contract or compact; (2) a summary of the program or portion thereof to be operated by the Tribe or Tribal organization; and (3) a summary identifying the source and amount of program or services funds to be contracted or compacted and contract support requirements. In the event that two tribes or tribal organizations have the same start date, application date, and approval date, then the next date for determination of priority shall be the date the fully complete application was received by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. If all of the above are equal, and if funds remaining in the ISD fund are not adequate to fill the entire amount of each awards contract support requirement, then each will be awarded a proportionate share of its requirement and shall remain on the Indian Self-Determination Fund Roster in appropriate order of priority for future distributions. A new contract is defined as the initial transfer of a program, during the current fiscal year, previously operated by the BIA to the tribe or tribal organization.
