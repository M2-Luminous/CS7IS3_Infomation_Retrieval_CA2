This support constitutes an OAS political and diplomatic legacy toward our most important international dispute, which is yet unresolved and which undermines our morale and our economic development. The sea is an essential part of Bolivia's material and spiritual integrity. We need a solution to this problem, and we are obliged to find it. "The community of the Americas has unequivocally recognized the need for the two involved countries to achieve a peaceful and friendly solution to the landlocked situation Bolivia has endured since it lost its sea coast during the Pacific War. This negotiation at the OAS level does not conflict with bilateral or trilateral discussions on this issue, nor with inevitable direct negotiations on the maritime issue. On the contrary, they are in line with the friendly spirit that must reign in hemispheric relations. It is only normal for nations of the Americas to be concerned and to urge those countries involved in unresolved conflicts to find friendly solutions. "Was it not the support of the countries of the Americas which paved the way for achieving the Torrijos-Carter agreements through which Panama regained its sovereignty over the Panama Canal? Was it not the support of the international community which led to peace between Palestine and Israel? Was it not the support of the international community which helped to definitely eradicate apartheid in South Africa? "I believe we are all obliged to build a peaceful, friendly, and secure region for our children. "Although the future seems bright, both Chile and Bolivia are determined to establish conditions and measures of mutual trust and tolerance, and despite renewed appeals by the OAS General Assembly, it is obvious that the governments directly involved have been unable to achieve a suitable satisfactory solution. "The international scenario has witnessed changes and advancements at the end of this century which seemed utopian a few years back. Ideological and racial barriers, and conflicts between nations are giving way to agreements that honor justice, solidarity, and international peace. "In view of this why should countries tied by a common heritage be unable to achieve agreements that will restore Bolivia's original status as a Pacific rim country, and definitely heal old wounds? "There is no legal argument in the world that can override the deep feeling of a nation that tells our governments to end their defensive and negative positions, and formal speeches for the sake of creative measures that will allow the establishment of ethical international relations. "We believe in integration and in the complementation of countries with common interests that are able to ban chauvinism and misunderstandings for the sake of uniting their efforts and overcoming the challenges of a future filled with uncertainties, in which the one single enemy is the poverty of our countries. "Latin America is living in an era of democracy and cohesive cooperation that demands a consensus. A new mentality of trust and credibility is taking hold in the region. A mentality in which neighbors do not look upon each other as potential antagonists. One in which the creative force of our countries is surging. One in which there is a clear awareness that the countries of the region are one family and that they must unite under the new breezes sweeping through contemporary history. "We must support each other, without impositions or exclusions. We must engage in common undertakings, encourage our reciprocal knowledge, promote the rapprochement of our societies, strengthen our cultural ties, and tear down the fences of misunderstanding, prejudice, dogmas, and insensitivity. This is definitely the state of mind with which we must welcome the next century. "Not so long ago, as a result of the new mentality upheld by their respective administrations, and by overcoming Chaco War grievances, Paraguay and Bolivia were able to achieve a long-sought historic rapprochement. Current ties and friendly relations bind today the two countries which optimistically seek excellent rewards from trade, road interconnections, the Paraguay-Parana waterway, the Pilcomayo river, and other similarly important projects. Bolivian-Paraguayan ties constitute a model for Latin America and an example that should be followed. "For the good of the Latin American community, the same is occurring among other countries in the region where neighboring countries which, until recently were faced with what seemed insurmountable rivalries, have resolved long-standing border problems in an exemplary manner, achieving an excellent level of ties. "Recent developments allow us to view with prudent optimism Bolivian-Chilean ties. Meetings between high-ranking government officials have been cordial. During President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's trip to Santiago, Chile, on the occasion of the Rio Group presidential summit, several meetings were held between the Bolivian and Chilean presidents. The preponderant role the Catholic Churches of Chile and of Bolivia have played in this process is also worthy of mentioning. It is clear, however, that despite all auspicious circumstances that have been discussed, Bolivia continues to suffer the consequences of its landlocked situation. This is undoubtedly one of the most clear obstacles in the path of full integration in the Americas. "I am certain that all the countries represented here hope to see noble gestures from the countries involved and, by the next OAS General Assembly, bear witness to a solution to this issue. "The challenge facing the new administrations of Bolivia and Chile today is to build together a future of peace and cooperation. There is no better inspiration to achieve this goal than the conviction expressed by the great Chilean Poet Vicente Huidobro who said: `As a Chilean and as a human being, I believe and assert that we must negotiate with Bolivia as soon as possible and that the two countries should and must resolve the serious issue involving Bolivia's outlet to the sea fraternally and with generosity.'"
