With their employment adjustments, payments to those retiring are growing sharply and generating huge special losses. Until now, they have gotten by somehow by disposing of assets or borrowing from banks, but there is no guarantee that those methods will work indefinitely. It is time to pay the piper for the contradictions of lifetime employment and the seniority pay system that had been put off to the future. Companies That Have Been Lucky Since the end of 1993, president Kenji Kano of the big software developer INES has repeatedly been told, "I want to know why you have cut your staff back so much." In November 1993 the company sought voluntary resignations and 302 persons responded. Before that 250 people had resigned for their own reasons, and by the start of the first quarter of 1994, one-fourth of its staff of 2,067 had left the company. The reason such a large staff cutback possible is that average employee age is a young 30 years. Employees who resigned were mainly those in their 20's who had been with the company two to four years. Including bonuses, total payments for resignation allowances came to 1.44 billion yen (2.6 million yen per person). One can see how light that burden was if it is compared to the total of 3.6 billion yen (12.2 million yen per person) that Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co., Ltd. paid last June after soliciting 250 voluntary resignations among those mainly in their 50's. It was also lucky that much of the 14.3 billion yen procured in a publicly offered new stock issue in March 1990 still remained as current deposits and had not been put into facilities investment under the business recession followed immediately. Listed firms that have cut staff by more than 100 by soliciting voluntary resignations exceeded 20 in fiscal year 1993 alone, but few companies covered resignation bonuses from funds on hand as INES did. Even in the software industry, where it is said that "some 10 percent of employees have no work," making up funds for resignation bonuses is a bottleneck and one sees no firms resolutely cutting back staff. How do companies that have solicited voluntary resignations usually cope with the financial aspects? A typical example of that is Tamura Electric Works, Ltd., which solicited voluntary resignations in the summer of 1992. This company paid out a total of 7 billion yen to 698 persons resigning voluntarily (36 percent of its total staff). To cope with this, it raised 3 billion yen by selling off land, golf course memberships, and borrowed the remainder from a number of banks including its main-force Fuji Bank. The handling for accounting purposes is that 3 billion yen in normal resignation bonuses is written off as resignation payroll reserves. The extra 4 billion yen in resignation bonuses is counted as a special loss, taking the form of a partial covering of losses by extra profits from the asset disposal gain. Ordinary resignation fund reserves, which are an item on balance sheets, also have not actually been secured as funds on hand. Therefore, says General Affairs Division Chief Minoru Takahashi, it was necessary that "with deciding to solicit voluntary resignations, our officers went around" seeking the cooperation of the banks at the same time. Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which October 1993 solicited voluntary resignations (382 persons), and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing, which made a solicitation January 1994 (297 persons), procured their resignation bonus funds--2.2 and 1.8 billion yen respectively--by selling off idle assets and getting the banks' cooperation. Hard To Borrow From Banks Lately, cases have begun emerging in which companies are being forced to do last-resort fund procurement to pay resignation bonuses. To cover the procurement for, and special losses accompanying its solicitation of 178 voluntary resignations, Orient Watch Co., Ltd. sold off its main factory in Hino City, Tokyo, March 1994. It sold its storage area, amounting to one-third of its acreage to Seiko-Epson, its number-two stockholder, for over 3.1 billion yen (a disposal gain of 2.9 billion yen), and by leasing this back it has continued operations. The company holds 5 billion yen of its stock by book value, but as of late September 1993 was holding 1.7 billion yen in latent losses. Even as it defers personnel adjustments, its asset value is dropping and a company executive says, "In a situation where we have no prospect for earnings recovery, it is hard to borrow even from banks." There are more companies which, separately from the firms' own finances, hold in trust as "pensions" the funds for needed for future resignation bonuses. Yet, the problem of operating stagnation even in company pensions is quite onerous. The totals for company pensions grow year by year and had reached a scale of 50 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993. However, if adjusted for market price, some 2.8 trillion yen is gone with the wind due to the effects of stock-price stagnation. If Environment Deteriorates... Nagasakiya Co., Ltd., whose unprecedentedly expensive resignation bonuses were so much discussed, seems currently to be carrying latent losses close to 10 percent in qualified pensions accumulating to 19 billion yen. With a total of some 10 billion yen in resignation funds, including pensions, to be disbursed by 17 April [1994], the company will be drawing down over 2 billion yen in pension assets. But it is also possible that it will force loss- cutting on its stock, and if it tries to avoid that, its latent loss would expand even more. Although a glimmer of light has become visible in the business climate, few forecast a rapid recovery in business earnings. It even seems likely that there will be more corporations unable to come back without restructuring that includes employment adjustments. Unprepared firms are raising the funds after undergoing great difficulty, but if the environment worsens, it may even become an actual matter of not meeting "labor liabilities." [14 Apr 94 p 17] [Text] In the December quarter of 1993, Japan IBM effected a personnel reduction of some 3,000 persons, amounting to over a 10 percent of its whole staff. Its total payout of resignation funds, including the portion for pensions, is unknown; but under special losses in the name of resignation funds, it tallied 45 billion yen. This is mainly payments of extra retirement bonuses and payments to employees under 50 years of age who are not eligible for qualified pensions. "Total Amount From Current Deposits" Its allowances for resignation bonuses are under the same dual system as other Japanese firms: resignation payment reserves and pensions. "We are guided by our parent company in the United States and do the management of resignation expenses strictly, having kept a setup for covering the total amount by drawing it down from current deposits," says Katsunori Asakura, deputy chief for financial fund planning. The company made no asset sales in the previous quarter, and its long- and short-term debts are being reduced so that it takes the form of internal procurement which copes by making a 35.7 billion yen cut in inventory. In general, U.S. firms have larger allowances for resignation expenses than Japanese firms. the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires for fixed-benefit type pensions that differences between the current valuation of pension assets and the amount payable, which estimates future pay raises also, be accounted as that quarter's pension expenses. When the actual contributed amount exceeds the pension expenses in the account, the difference is added to assets as a prepaid expense. Conversely, when a sum less than pension expenses is contributed, the shortfall is added to liabilities as an unpaid expense. In corporate accounting, obligations to employees are actively maintained. When Japanese firms make employment adjustments, one reason for their cash position troubles is their inadequate accumulation of resignation payment reserves. Certified public accountant Ikuo Nishikawa criticizes that inadequacy, saying, "Japanese resignation expense reserves do not make a projected calculation using actuarial statistics but have merely gone back to current values under a set discount rate for the sum needed for payment at quarter's end." In actuality, too, there are many companies which adopt, as is, the tax law standard that accepts as a loss up to 40 percent of the amount to be paid at quarter's end. This is calculated by postulating the sum to be paid should all employees resign at the end of a certain quarter with 12 years of remaining service, discounted at a rate of 8 percent. The possibility is high that accumulations will be inadequate simply from not considering such things as future pay increases. Limitations have also been pointed to in the aspect of securing funds accumulated in readiness for future payments. Professor Aishi Imafuku of Nihon University says, "The funds reserved are directed into one investment or another; and, with reductions in the investment value of land or stocks, instances are emerging of the basic assets of resignation funds becoming inadequate." Managing Director Yoichi Sugimoto of the Japan Securities Industry Welfare Pension Fund, controlling the pension assets for some 150,000 persons working in securities firms, asserts, "The biggest issue for Japan's company pensions is asset management by book value." Not a few pension funds even carry latent losses. Over the past several years, U.S. companies have tallied huge deficits and pushed forward with bold restructuring. The U.S. IBM's fourth-quarter 1992 operating deficit was about $8.2 billion and its final deficit for the year went above $4.9 billion while its costs related to restructuring rose to $11.6 billion. It effected staff cuts of 32,000 persons, equivalent to nearly 10 percent of its total work force. Its supplementary resignation costs covering extra resignation funds were $2.3 billion and totalled $5.4 billion when the share due in the following fiscal year are included. Yet, its pension expenses were $838 million, growing by no more than just over $300 million above the previous quarter. It is a big contrast to the dire distress which Japanese firms go through even in paying out ordinary resignation funds. Great Difference Between Japan and the United States Where Japan differs greatly from the United States is not merely in the sense of obligations owed to employees and their security. For the size of liabilities a firm will carry forward into the future, its liabilities still to be accumulated for pensions and its expenses in a period are vital information for investors, but in Japan these are not adequately disclosed. In the United States, not only are shortfalls in accumulations of pension assets added into the balance sheets, but such items as the market value of pension assets and pension expenses are also entered. In statements of cash-flow accounts, cash appropriated for pension funds is disclosed. In Japan, once an appropriation is made to a pension fund outside of the company, it becomes an off-the-book asset and only the book value of pension assets is disclosed. Pension expenses also are lumped together as legal welfare expenses and become unknown to anyone on the outside. The Hitachi, Ltd.'s total of pension assets and resignation payment allocations as of the end of March 1993 was about 725 billion yen. That differs greatly from the approximately 570 billion yen at Toshiba, where the scale of staffing and average age are not very different. On the grounds that "We have no obligation to disclose it," expenses for the quarter are not revealed; however, cumulatively a gap in expenses of about 150 billion yen would have existed in the past. Era for Deferrals Is Passing The era is passing in which under the systems of lifetime employment and seniority wages premising a high growth rate firms could defer expenses, and the need is growing to set up conditions for corporate ratings that even allow global comparisons. The issue of "labor liabilities," while subsuming complex elements tied to the social system, is a topic that makes it urgently necessary to take up a clarification of the obligations and security measures that companies owe their employees as well as disclosure of information to investors.
