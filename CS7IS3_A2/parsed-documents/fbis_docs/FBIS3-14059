Nabil Sha'th, who headed a Palestinian delegation at discussions with Israeli officials on Sunday and Monday in Tunis, said the PLO was banking on a positive Israeli response to its security demands when the two sides meet again here on Thursday. Earlier reports from both Tunis and Israel had said the security talks would resume in Cairo on Wednesday. "We can't say we got all that we wanted," Sha'th said of the Tunis meetings, "but we are on the way toward an opening that will allow for a resumption in the (autonomy) talks and the protection of the Palestinians." He added that Israeli and PLO delegates would "probably" confer again here on Thursday at a meeting of 22 countries that are to finance a Palestinian police force for autonomous Palestinian areas of the Israeli-held territories.
