"No, none at this moment," Hosokawa said when asked if the government may take action against the U.S. move announced Thursday. Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in a telephone call by President Bill Clinton. "We agreed to deal with the matter coolly," he said. Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to opening the telecommunications market and the distribution system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials said. The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting held after a regular cabinet session. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi told the meeting that the government's emphasis on deregulating housing and real estate would not help improve overall relations between Japan and the United States because Japanese imports of housing-related goods are limited, the officials said. Hosokawa said deregulation of the telecom market and streamlining the distribution system should be added to the list of priorities, they said. In a related development, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told reporters Friday he is not sure whether a dispute with Washington over mobile phones can be settled quickly in private-sector negotiations. He said the talks are nearing a conclusion, but it is not known if they will bring about a quick solution. Motorola Inc. of the United States and Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) of Japan have been discussing U.S. demands for boosting foreign access to the Japanese cellular phone market since Washington announced plans in mid-February to retaliate against Japan over the dispute. Washington, accusing Japan of breaching a bilateral 1989 trade pact, has threatened to raise its tariffs on imports of Japanese telecom goods and possibly other products. It has set March 17 as the deadline for unveiling a list of Japanese imports to be targeted for retaliation. Japanese business leaders deplored the U.S. Administration's decision to reinstate the super 301 clause. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said super 301 runs counter to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aimed at freer world trade. He called on the Japanese Government to promote the opening of Japan's market. Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the Clinton administration apparently wants to use the clause as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade negotiations with the Japanese Government.
