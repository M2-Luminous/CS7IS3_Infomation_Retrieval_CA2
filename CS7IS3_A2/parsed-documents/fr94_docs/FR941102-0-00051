FR941102-0-00051 FR941102-0-00008 V. Effects on Competition and Other Findings Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 26 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the competitive effects of such rules, if any, and to balance any impact with the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission has considered the amendments to the Rule in light of the standards cited in Section 23(a)(2) and believes that adoption of the amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. As stated above, the amendment is designed to assure the lawful availability in this country of Spanish government bond futures that otherwise would not be permitted to be marketed under the terms of the CEA. The amendment thus serves to expand the range of financial products available in the United States and enhances competition in financial markets. Insofar as the Rule contains limitations, they are designed to promote the purposes of the Exchange Act by ensuring that futures trading on Spanish government securities is consistent with the goals and purposes of the federal securities laws by minimizing the impact of the Rule on securities trading and distribution in the United States. 26 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2) (1988). The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 27 that the amendments to the rule are exemptive in nature. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to make the foregoing action effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register . 27 15 U.S.C. 553(d) (1988). VI.
