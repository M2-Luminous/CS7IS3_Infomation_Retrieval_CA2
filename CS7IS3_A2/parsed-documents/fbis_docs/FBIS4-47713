United Nations special representative Lakhdar Brahimi said everyone who had wanted to vote had been able to. The observers said they could not yet comment on the fairness of the elections. The heads of the European Union Election Unit and Observer Mission, the Commonwealth Observer Mission and the Organisation of African Unity Observer Mission were addressing a press briefing at the Independent Electoral Commission's Gallagher Estate offices in Midrand. In a joint statement they said the elections had been successful despite administrative problems. Former Jamaican prime minister and Commonwealth mission head Michael Manley said he had been impressed by the enthusiasm of South African voters and the good relations between black and white people queueing at voting stations. South Africa was on the threshold of rejoining the Commonwealth, Mr Manley said. "This is really the end of the anti-colonial struggle." The joint statement read: "The people of South Africa clearly demonstrated their commitment to the end of apartheid and the transformation to nonracial democracy by turning out in enormous numbers to vote. "The escalation and spread of violence which was widely predicted and feared did not happen."
