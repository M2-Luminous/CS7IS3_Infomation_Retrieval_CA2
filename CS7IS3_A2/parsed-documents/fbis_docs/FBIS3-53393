At the same time, he says, the settlements cannot be scraped off the face of the earth retroactively. Interviewed on Qol Yisra'el, Beilin said most of the settlements will not remain under Israeli rule under the permanent arrangement and that, consequently, an agreement should be reached with the Palestinians and the Syrians whereby Israelis will be allowed to remain in their settlements under Arab rule. The Golan Heights Settlements Committee is demanding that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin clarify whether Beilin's remarks reflect the government's policy and, if they do not, to fire Yosi Beilin. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hanan Erez, chairman of MAPAM [United Workers Party], has also criticized Deputy Minister Beilin. Erez believes that such pronouncements, coming on the eve of the Clinton-al-Asad summit, are unnecessary and damaging both politically and in terms of their impact on the mood of the Golan settlers.
