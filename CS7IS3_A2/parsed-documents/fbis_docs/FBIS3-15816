Russian Defense Ministry Expert Cautious in Forecasts"] [Text] "A practical realization of the trilateral understanding on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, reached by the Presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia in the Kremlin on 14 January, has begun," advised a high official in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry with the caution acquired through many months of negotiating. Without naming, for known reasons, the day the "operation" should begin, and very roughly (several months) defining the length of time for withdrawing nuclear warheads from Ukraine, the Defense Ministry general noted that the leaders of the three states had also specified the "equivalency" of exchange -- the minimal number (200) of warheads for 100 tonnes of uranium fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power engineering. The "transportation expenses" shall be absorbed in equal portion by both sides -- the transportation of the special cargo across the territory of Ukraine shall be paid for by Kiev, the next part of the journey by Moscow. No customs inspection has been envisioned (under the agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the withdrawal of strategic weapons of April 1992, the general said, transportation in a special category with a special cargo is not subject to customs inspection). The protection and security arrangements while the "cargo" is in transit, the specialist vouched, are guaranteed by a tough system of security that includes constant monitoring of progress, provision of all types of communications facilities, and a "cover" by competent organs along the train's route. A participant in the Russo-Ukrainian talks, the Russian Defense Ministry expert is rather cautious about prognoses regarding the future of the nuclear disarmament process of the Ukrainian state which, he remarked, has not so far added its signature to the document on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons -- which in itself does not rule out debates inside Ukraine, in particular in its new parliament, on the question of Ukraine's possessing its own nuclear potential. The "neatness" with which the first stage of partial nuclear disarmament of the neighbors has gotten under way, the expert underlined, evokes the satisfaction of the Russian side.
