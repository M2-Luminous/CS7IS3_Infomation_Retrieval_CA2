Cambodians living in this area are very angry because they have lost land on which they work to earn a living. A rubber plantation official who requests anonymity says that in the past, standing on the mound in Bos Ta Kok village in Da commune, Memot District, and looking toward the Daeum Dong Prampil Daeum village, one can see the zinc-sheet covered roofs of Vietnamese houses built along the border. This area is an important smuggling point where Vietnamese wait to buy goods from Cambodia. Now some Vietnamese have trespassed and intruded into Bos Ta Kok village in Da commune by clearing and leveling aroud 100 hectares of red earth and openly took over between 20 and 30 hectares of scattered rubber tree plots which had been the property of an official named Ret. The rubber plantation official also says that local people dare not poke their heads into this area because nearly all of these land-grabbing Vietnamese are armed. They look like an army unit. It is not known yet what will be done with the plot of land the Vietnamese have cleared and leveled, but latex is siphoned off daily. These Vietnamese have let it be known that they will not withdraw because this piece of land protrudes along the border and they consider it theirs. The rubber plantation official, quoting many local residents, says that it is not only land in the Bos Ta Kok area that the Vietnamese have annexed; border markers along the entire district border have been moved deep inside Cambodia. The important thing is that along this border the Vietnamese have deployed troops, disguised as civilians, for protection. They are armed with assorted weapons, and at some places tanks have been stationed in the trenches. Only their cannons can be seen. Is the government aware of this land expropriation in Bos Ta Kuk? Upon ceiving this information, please investigate and solve the problem immediately. First of all, the district authority has to immediately report to the Interior Ministry in order to solve the problem through legal means.
