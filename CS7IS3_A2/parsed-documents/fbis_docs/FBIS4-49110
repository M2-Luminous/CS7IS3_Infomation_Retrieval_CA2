In attendance were Du Qinglin; Wang Xueping; (Zhong Chen); Wei Zefang; (Li Mingxian); (Wu Fengnong); Tian Zhongmu, president of the provincial higher people's court; Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate; and provincial department and bureau directors; secretaries of city and county party committees; mayors and county magistrates; and secretaries of commissions on politics and law. The meeting was presided over by Vice Governor Wang Xueping, member of the provincial party committee standing committee. Governor Du Qinglin [title as heard], deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important speech at the meeting. Du Qinglin pointed out: Since the beginning of this year, party committees and governments at all levels in the province have achieved very great results in conscientiously implementing the basic policies set out by the party Central committee for the work of the whole party and nation, and in upholding the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously while attaching importance to both. Nevertheless, while the situation was fine, there still were factors affecting our province's political stability and social tranquility, the pubic security situation remained grim, and the incidence of major and [words indistinct] cases rose. The existence and spread of these destabilizing factors will affect and hinder the smooth progress of reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as economic construction. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should pay close attention to safeguarding stability as an important task at present; place it in an important position; uphold the strategic principle of doing two types of work simultaneously while attaching importance to both; and carry out the task of safeguarding stability and the struggle against various crimes, right down to the various aspects and strata of society, so as to develop a situation in which the whole party and society make joint efforts to manage social order and in which the broad masses of people take an active role in managing social order. Principal party and government leaders should take command personally, and party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen unified command and concentrate human, material, and financial resources, as we did in the case of severely cracking down on criminal activities in 1983; firmly implement the principle of punishing criminals sternly, promptly, and according to the law so as to destroy the criminals' overweening arrogance; implement the various measures for the comprehensive management of social order; uphold the principle of simultaneously solving and preventing crimes and taking both radical and stopgap measures, with the stress on the management of social order; and reduce or elimminate destabilizing factors and symptoms of law violations and crime once and for all.
