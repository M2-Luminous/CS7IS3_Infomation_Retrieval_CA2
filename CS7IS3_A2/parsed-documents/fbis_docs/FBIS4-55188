Maric: "We Shall Defend What Is Ours"] [Excerpt] It is not true that the Serbian republic army is amassing fresh forces and hardware on the Brcko front. This was stated by General Novica Simic, commander of the east Bosnian corps, who stressed that the republic of Srpska army has the same forces in the region of Brcko that it had three months ago. With this, Simic denied claims -- particularly by the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- about the concentration of an extremely large number of Serbian troops and armored-mechanized units in this part of Posavina. Moreover, the commander of the east Bosnian corps has denied rumors that the republic of Srpska army was preparing an offensive on the strongholds of Alija Izetbegovic's troops south of Brcko. A Muslim army attack on Serbian defense positions would not be anything new for us, because they have been trying for months to cut off the "corridor" and reach the Sava River. So far, we have successfully repelled all attacks of the Muslim forces on this front; we shall repel the future ones as well, if they occur -- General Novica Simic told reporters assembled in Brcko. Circles close to the republic of Srpska army assess that the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has not -- even after the arrival of UN Protection Force observers on the Brcko front -- given up its intention of attacking the joint forces of the 1st Krajina and east Bosnia corps on this front. If the Muslim political and military leadership truly feared an "offensive of the Bosnian Serb forces," the General Staff of the Supreme Command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would not have forbidden Hazim Sadic, commander of the 2d Tuzla Corps, to sign a cease-fire agreement on the Brcko front with General Simic. Losers' Threats If the Muslim side were interested in peace in this part of Posavina, it would not have positioned seven brigades and several independent subversion-terrorist units around Brcko! Altogether, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has concentrated over 14,000 troops, a part of its armored-mechanized forces, and artillery weapons, including 152-mm Nora howitzers around Brcko. On the other hand, northwest of Brcko, in the region of Orasje, the Croatian Defense Council has six brigades, supported by a military police battalion of the regular Croatian Army. Croatian troops also have 30 tanks and armored personnel carriers that they received from the Croatian Army. Moreover, they have large caliber artillery weapons that were brought to the Sava River bank from the Republic of Croatia. In addition to Djuro Matuzovic, commander of the Orasje region, the Croatian Defense Council units are under the command of Zeljko Barisic from Korac near Brod, Iko Stanic from Derventa, and Tomo Bozic from Odjak.
