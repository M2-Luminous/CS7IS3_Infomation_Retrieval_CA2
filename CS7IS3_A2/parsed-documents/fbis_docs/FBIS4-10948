As a good Santanderean, former minister Luis Fernando Ramirez does not avoid confrontation. It was said of him that he was fine as a government official, but as a politician he brought nothing to candidate Andres Pastrana. In just a few hours he managed to disprove that. One thing he said in this interview will certainly draw fire: "Samper was disloyal to President Gaviria when he was in the government...." [Murcia] The Samper people are still saying that you are ineligible. What is your response? [Ramirez] Concerning my supposed political ineligibility, I repeat that they are mistaken. The Council of State settled that in response to a query from the minister of government on 10 June 1993, when it categorically stated that having been a member of a ministerial cabinet or a government official creates no legal bar to being vice president. There is no such ineligibility for the vice president or the president. [Murcia] Horacio Serpa says that you could not become president as you were a government official until last Saturday. [Ramirez] That contradicts the position of the Council of State. In terms of ineligibility, analogies can not be applied. The Constitution lists a single cause of ineligibility for the vice presidency: he must not have served as vice president during the preceding term. [Murcia] Why do you think your ticket is better than the liberal ticket of Samper and De la Calle? [Ramirez] We represent the future, they the past. In our case, there is unity of views, identity of platforms. We did not have to give up our principles or our platforms for electoral purposes. Our program has great credibility and viability, especially for voters who, in past elections, when they looked at the ballot and saw Samper and De la Calle, decided to stay home. [Murcia] Why did you agree so quickly when they called you early Saturday morning and offered you the candidacy? [Ramirez] Despite my state of mind because of my father's kidnapping, I made the decision after talking it over with Andres Pastrana and the campaign team, for we have a strong commitment to Colombia. We represent a young but experienced ticket. I have worked on the economic and social reforms of the recent governments with both President Gaviria and President Barco. I know the program that best suits Colombia in this second phase, and that is the platform of Andres Pastrana. It seems a good opportunity for me to continue to serve the nation. [Murcia] It is said that you are not a politician in this campaign. [Ramirez] I believe that explains the very high abstention rates. People are tired of the traditional politician who is in a state of constant contradiction and in search of political compromises, so that he has to sacrifice a government program. People wonder if in the future those who acted like that will not again place their personal interests ahead of the nation's interests. In our case, the ticket does not reflect a political compromise but rather an identity of views and a cohesion of ideas and a shared commitment to the nation. It was not put together for purely electoral purposes. [Murcia] Why a conservative and not a liberal for the Pastrana ticket? [Ramirez] The Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez ticket is for all Colombians, not just for conservatives. With this ticket, we call upon liberals, conservatives, independents, and especially those who did not take part in the liberal primary because they found no program there that was viable for Colombia in the 21st century. I believe a liberal could have been chosen for the vice presidency, but the politicians' mistake is believing that people still vote in response to party labels. The people can see that ours is a platform aimed toward the future. [Murcia] Why do Samper and De la Calle not offer credibility? [Ramirez] The people are very concerned about the differences between Samper and De la Calle. Dr. De la Calle had been saying that Samper had placed a car bomb on the social security program, and then overnight he joined forces with the "carbomber." The Colombian people fear that in the government the same differences that arose between Samper and Gaviria might recur between Samper and De la Calle. [Murcia] Are you suggesting that Samper was a "fifth columnist" inside the government? [Ramirez] There is no doubt that he was a "fifth columnist." All of Gaviria's reforms were made against Samper's opposition. Economic liberalization, social security, even the foreign trade reform. He certainly was not very loyal when he was in the government. That is what people fear might happen with a Samper government, that De la Calle might apply the same medicine, because their platforms are not the same. They have already showed their true colors, and it does not bother them to alter their platforms in order to work out a political deal. You wonder if, when they have to choose between what is best for the nation and what is best for them, they might not choose the second alternative. [Murcia] You were a key player during the debates in Congress on the social security and pension system reform. Will that help you or hurt you in the campaign--with the workers, for example? [Ramirez] I think President Gaviria himself answered that question when he said it is the most important social reform Colombia has had in the last 50 years. That is a guarantee that in the Pastrana government program, social policy will occupy a leading place. [Murcia] Do you think this is the right time to hold public debates, with frankness, on the platforms of one ticket or another? [Ramirez] I believe it is best for the country if we present our platforms so we can see which campaign has internal differences and which is consistent, with united views. We are ready for those debates.
