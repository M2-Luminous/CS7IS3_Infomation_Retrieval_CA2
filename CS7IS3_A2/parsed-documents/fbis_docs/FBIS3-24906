Addressing about 8,000 enthusiastic supporters at Dal Josaphat stadium in Paarl in the Western Cape, he said opinion polls had consistently shown that the ANC was the most popular organisation in the country and that it would win an outright victory if an election were held now. "The party that follows us in comparative strength is nothing more than a Mickey Mouse. But the greatest danger to democracy is you, the supporters of the ANC." Mr Mandela said the ANC had to ensure that every one of its supporters would be able to vote and to achieve that, activists had to work very hard. Earlier the ANC leader praised Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, saying Mr Coetsee had had "the courage and vision" to initiate discussions between himself and former President P W Botha while Mr Mandela was still in Victor Verster Prison. Mr Mandela also thanked the community of Paarl for their support while he was held at Victor Verster and praised a number of white warders who had treated him with sensitivity and kindness. The ANC leader was wildly applauded when he arrived at the packed stadium and circled the track on the back of a bakkie [pickup truck] waving to the crowd. Mr Mandela was presented with a symbolic freedom torch which had been lit outside Victor Verster prison on Wednesday morning and carried to the stadium by runners. Crowds lined the streets of Paarl and many shops were closed as the ANC leader's entourage passed through the town on its way to the stadium.
