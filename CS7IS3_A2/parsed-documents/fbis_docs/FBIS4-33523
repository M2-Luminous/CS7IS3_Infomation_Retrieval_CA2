Military reports say that documents prepared by the Army reveal that in addition to the Trabalhadores Ranch in Pernambuco, land invaders have another training area known as "Cacador University" in Santa Catarina in the town of Cacador. Most Army reports on landless people's action were prepared by the Southern Military Command, which covers Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana. The Army considers these states the most critical because of frequent land occupations and the methods landless people use in their operations. There is also major concern about Sao Paulo State, which the military has placed in fourth place because of the large number of land occupations. Next comes Pernambuco as the state with the next largest number of occupations. Army reports show that "Cacador University" is an old convent that priests donated to the Landless People's Movement. Various types of training are given in the convent, which landless people have christened a "university" because it is considered a school. According to military sources, the slogan of the group occupying this area is "occupy, resist, and produce." According to information gathered by the Army, when someone outside the MST gets near the area, landless people abandon all suspicious activities that might prove they were undergoing training and begin chanting church songs in an attempt to show they were in a cult. A Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) document, to which O ESTADO had exclusive access this week, also mentioned "Cacador University." SAE also considers the "university" a landless people's training area. The Army reports always mention the Military Police's rapid intervention in all the places where land occupations have been reported. Army officers are concerned because if the Military Police are overwhelmed or if help is needed to enforce the Constitution, the Army will be called in. This is why the Army believes it is justified in closely following all landless people's movements. At Army High Command meetings, generals always evaluate landless people's action. The matter never has a noticeable place on the agenda, but it surfaces either as part of the debates or as a subject for an exchange of information among military commanders whenever they discuss the national situation.
