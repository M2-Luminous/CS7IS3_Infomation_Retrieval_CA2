From the panicky statements about a "reactionary turn in the economy" to the forecasts of a burst of hyperinflation which prevailed in January, the world's media has begun to offer a more considered and objective view. And though at the beginning of the year some ultra-radicals, including some of our own in Russia, called on the west not to give a cent to the "red directors" who had taken control of the Russian government, the International Monetary Fund still took the symbolic decision to assign to Moscow the second tranche of a $3bn loan in exchange for commitments to market reform. What happened in these first 10-12 weeks of this year to justify the IMF's decision? There was no great turnover of ministers in the Russian government. The economic reform programme, adopted in August 1993, did not change. Most significantly, events themselves have refuted the unscrupulous allegation that our course would change, an allegation that proceeded simply from the political ambitions of those who made it. The continuation of reform, financial stabilisation and structural change remain the core of Russia's economic policy. The economic evidence of the first three months of this year attest to that. Between February and April, the monthly rate of inflation fell to 10 per cent. We do not expect the picture to change in May. In the planned 1994 budget, the deficit is pegged at 9 per cent of gross domestic product. By observing these parameters, we will see inflation lowered to a monthly rate of 7-8 per cent by the end of the year. To achieve this goal we must adopt the most resolute measures aimed at limiting the budget deficit and the emission of credits. In particular, we took a difficult decision to increase state revenues by changing a range of previously-fixed taxes, customs and excise duties. And we did that against the backdrop of a 25 per cent fall in production in the first quarter of this year compared to the corresponding period in 1993. At the same time we continued to carry out a tight monetary policy to which the central bank interest rate -- significantly higher than the inflation rate in the past few months -- bears witness. It is vitally important that every member of the Russian government fully understands that a strong rouble is the indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy, and the Russian state as a whole. Naturally, as elsewhere in the world, ministers will lobby for more resources. However as every member of the Russian government knows, the important thing is not the amount of money they receive; rather it is that the money they get should have a real and lasting worth. It is counter-productive to have a currency which in one month alone loses about a quarter of its value. Such has been the fate of the rouble. Our common task is thus clear: to ensure that Russian citizens should know that everything their government does is directed towards protecting the purchasing power of the rouble, so that with these roubles Russian citizens will be welcomed anywhere in the world. The question naturally arises as to why we do not introduce an even tougher financial policy and limit even more tightly budgetary expenditure so as to bring down inflation more rapidly. We are told by critics that in other countries, in eastern Europe and the Baltics for instance, the authorities have managed to achieve financial stabilisation more quickly. And when we insist, in defence, that Russia is fundamentally different from these countries, our critics retort that all countries are different but that economic laws work in the same way everywhere. Posing the question in this way reveals an inadequate understanding of the specifics of the Russian situation. In a small state the government can follow what happens in every large enterprise and, where needed, take urgent action: in Russia, however, the geography of the country significantly reduces such a possibility. If a disaster strikes a small country and its economy grinds to a halt, the world community will come to its aid. Even Russia, in spite of its worsening economic crisis, continues to help its neighbours in trying to overcome their poverty. Indeed Russia's donor status vis-a-vis the member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States is parallel to that of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries vis-a-vis Russia. In other words, while economic laws work the same in all countries, the possibility of a government responding to them depends on the historic particularities of that country's economy. For 70 years, the former Soviet totalitarian economy accumulated vast structural disparities. Tackling these problems demands prolonged effort and huge expense. It is clear that we cannot sanction mass closures of our exhausted plants since that would usher in an unsupportable rise in unemployment and sharply worsen both the political and the social situation in the country. Besides, it would be simply unreasonable, since many enterprises have significant reserves with which to improve their financial position. All industrial enterprises should get the chance -- and that means time -- to overcome their present difficulties. Today, we can define three groups of basic industries in Russia: Enterprises that have successfully completed a period of adaptation to new market conditions and are already increasing turnover. Enterprises which have yet to undergo such a period of adaptation, but which display the necessary potential to do so and have some hope of succeeding. It is these enterprises which should get help from the government. This group is by far the most numerous. Enterprises which are beyond salvation and should be closed down in accordance with the law on bankruptcy. A list of such companies is already prepared. We do not, however, want to throw the baby out with the bathwater; and we cannot ignore the social consequences of each step on this road. Imagine a provincial Russian town, built up around a big defence plant set up some years ago. The entire population of the town -- maybe 100,000 people -- works at the defence plant, including those engaged in the service sector. Assume that the plant has long since ceased to have any social use and no longer receives orders. Should we shut the enterprise without considering the consequences for its employees? Consider another example: a northern mining town with a population of 50,000 which was established to work the coal reserves. The extraction of the coal is carried on with huge losses, the reserves are near to exhaustion, the equipment is obsolete and the cost of transporting the coal has gone up several times. There is no other settlement for 500km. There are hundreds of such cities and towns throughout Russia. What should be done? We have no choice but to study carefully each case and patiently find a solution. We do now feel there is some understanding in the west for these problems. The talks last month between the Russian government and representatives of the Group of Seven during the annual meeting of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in St Petersburg showed that our colleagues in the US, the UK and other countries recognise the importance of assistance in the social sphere. They intend to take an active part in the search for a way to separate out from the enterprises the social components traditionally provided by them, such as schools and kindergartens, so as not to threaten the basic living conditions of millions of people. The issue here is the possibility of channelling the international credit given to Russia towards the resolution of, above all, social problems. We can cope with the other issues ourselves. We recently finished a round of talks in Moscow with the IMF; our approach met with understanding and support. Our relations with the IMF, to which we have furnished the most complete information both on the economic situation on what we intend to do to correct problems in that sphere, have become a symbol of our new openness in economic matters. We believe that the agreement with the IMF will lay a good foundation for our talks with the Paris and London clubs of sovereign and commercial creditors on the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt which we inherited from the Soviet Union. Successful co-operation with our creditors should also assist our efforts to achieve financial stabilisation. The further integration of Russia into the world economy fully accords with our interests. We have left behind the former artificial exchange rate of the rouble, the state monopoly of internal trade and other former obstacles and limitations. We welcome foreign investment in the Russian economy and very much count on attracting further foreign investment -- even though we understand that much will depend on the success of our economic reforms and the improvement of the legal and tax regimes for foreign investors. At the same time we will continue to insist on the establishment of equal trading relations, on the ending of the discrimination against Russian exports. In that regard, we are determined to push through Russia's application to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. In the near future Russia will take its proper place in the system of world trade and it will benefit both Russia and its trading partners. I know that much of this appears over-optimistic. Indeed the country has still to emerge from its deep economic crisis. At the same time, we see the first signs that our efforts are bearing fruit. The privatisation of small businesses -- shops, restaurants, workshops -- is almost complete. As a result, the look of Russian cities is changing: in place of the dejected and sombre queues to which we were accustomed we see smart advertising hoardings and attractive, lively goods. We count on the privatisation of the larger companies to produce the same positive effect. The first stage of privatisation, based on the use of vouchers issued free to every citizen, will soon be complete. From 1 July the remaining shares in state hands will be sold not for vouchers but for money. This new approach should replenish the state budget and also strengthen the financial position of the enterprises themselves. The strengthening of political stability is also an enormously important condition for successfully addressing the economic crisis. Last year, a new constitution was endorsed by the people in a popular referendum, marking the end of the long-drawn out and weary confrontation between the executive and legislative powers. The other important step in the development of the democratic process was the holding of parliamentary elections, also in December. There are differing views on the results of the December parliamentary elections. Yet the first 100 days of the federal assembly's work shows that the new parliament is a great improvement on the old Supreme Soviet. We count on close co-operation between the government and the parliament as a necessary condition for the creation of a legal base for the new economic environment. Political stability has been further strengthened by the achievement of a civil accord of national reconciliation, a process led by President Boris Yeltsin and now endorsed by a broad range of Russian political parties, enterprises and associations. In today's Russia we are seeing a new beginning: a time for those who know how, and have the ability, to do business. We are now living through the trough of the economic crisis. In the next few months we can make a break from the basic negative tendencies which have held back our development in the past two or three years. I am certain that we will make the break. Russia has only one path to tread -- that of reform, and it will not depart from it.
