Good evening Mr. Pasqua. [Pasqua] Good evening. [Leenhardt] Mr. Pasqua, you were delighted after the first round of the cantonal elections. Are you as happy this evening? [Pasqua] Listen, the election results must be taken as they come. One can see that the parliamentary majority has had good results. As far as seats go, the votes were better distributed among the Left than within the parliamentary majority. Besides, the candidates of the National Front prevented the winning of some seats. Therefore, as we said earlier on, there has been a change in the majority in some departments. [Leenhardt] Albert Du Roy. [Du Roy] Yes. Charles Pasqua, you hoped -- the majority hoped -- to get a victory in more departments than is the case. How do you explain ... [Pasqua, interrupting] Mr. Du Roy, you know in how many general/councils we already have a majority, don't you? [Du Roy] 75? [Pasqua] Yes. Listen, we are in a democracy. One cannot hope to have 100. Besides, it is obvious that it would have been attempting the impossible to think that the Socialist Party would disappear in some departments where it has been deeply rooted for a long time. We are not the ones who said that we hoped to win such or such a department. The observers did. Of course, we would be happy if we had won them. [Du Roy] The second round took place today. For you, is this vote mainly local or national? [Pasqua] I believe that it is first and foremost a local vote, but one cannot ignore its national aspect. I am not giving you a noncommittal answer, I am only saying that it is obvious that the cantonal elections are first and foremost local elections. Some of this evening's results confirm this. Moreover, mobilization has been more successful with left-wing voters, insofar as they have heard and heard again that the majority was threatened in some departments. This is why they mobilized more. I would like people to see things as they are. This evening, as far as seats are concerned -- although we do not have all the results, since we are still without the results in 32 cantons -- may I say that the great victors are the parties close to the majority and those close to the opposition. [Du Roy] Let us now go beyond the cantonal elections. Earlier on, the chairman of the French Democratic Union, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that one of the messages of the vote was that the government had to speed up reforms. Do you agree with him? [Pasqua] Yes. However, for the government to speed up reforms, it would be necessary for those who -- or at least, this is what I think -- support the government to do so and to leave it to its work. [Leenhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Pasqua. You were speaking live from the Interior Ministry.
