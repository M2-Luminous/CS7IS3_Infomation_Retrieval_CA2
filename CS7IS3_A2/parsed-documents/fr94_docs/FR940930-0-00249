FR940930-0-00249 FR940930-0-00030 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William J. Franks, Jr., Director, Science Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Room 3507 South Agriculture Building, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456. Telephone (202) 720&hyph;5231. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Executive Order 12866 and Executive Order 12778 The Department has determined that this rule is not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and it therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. II. Effect on Small Entities The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). The fees provided for in this rule reflect a minimal change in the costs currently borne by those entities which utilize certain laboratory services. The rule is designed to provide usual and reasonable fees for laboratory testing that are consistent with costs in time and resources to ensure adequate funding of the laboratory operations of the Science Division. III. Background On August 9, 1993, the agency reorganization of analytical testing under the Science Division and schedules of laboratory fees were published as a final rule in the Federal Register (58 FR 42408&hyph;42448) after receiving only one comment on the proposal. The fee schedules became effective immediately and were devised to have a single fee for the same test rather than assessing separate laboratory fees for different commodities and their products. The dairy product laboratory fees for 35 tests or combinations of tests that were listed in former regulations at 7 CFR 58.44 were increased by large percentages in the August 9, 1993 final rule. As a consequence, the dairy industry indicated that it is burdened with testing fees that cannot be assimilated into current purchasing contracts. The single test laboratory fees for other commodity products did not change as significantly as test fees for dairy products. Prior to the final rule implementation, the dairy testing fees had been revised only slightly since November 2, 1977 (42 FR 57301). The heavy volume of laboratory testing of dairy products in the early 1980's associated with Commodity Credit Corporation purchases diminished the need for periodic fee increases. However, the workload for laboratory testing of dairy products was reduced greatly beginning in 1986. In addition, the dairy testing fees were carried over and not revised from 1988 to 1993 while the Agency prepared a consolidated regulation for laboratory services within the Science Division and updated fees. Consequently, when the new fees were placed in effect, the dairy industry faced substantial increases in testing fees. In response to the various objections generated among dairy processors, and after further consideration of the matter, the agency temporarily restored the dairy testing fees to the applicable charges and hourly rate in effect on April 17, 1989. An interim final rule reducing testing fees was published and effective on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24318). That rule amended 7 CFR parts 58, 91, 93, 94, 95 and 98. It provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 9, 1994. Only one comment was received recommending that the flavor fee be adjusted and made specific to dairy products.
