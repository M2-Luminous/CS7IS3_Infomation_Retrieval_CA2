Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said he cannot accept converting salaries into Real Value Units on the 25th of each month, as the Federal Supreme Court wants. If the conversion is done on that day, the government will have losses totalling $1.25 billion. According to the finance minister, the government will have to create more taxes to cover these losses: [Begin recording] I am giving them the results. If they want to change the conversion date to the 25th, they will have to collect taxes equivalent to $1.25 billion. It will be very clear in the eyes of the people that everyone is paying for this salary increase. Calculations, however, will have to be made. It will not be 5 percent over a small portion, because the minister will not agree to that. This readjustment cannot be granted only to a small sector and not to everyone. The federal administration minister does not agree to that, the president of the Republic does not agree to that, and I do not either. The famous discussion about the Treasury, the budget, and about these valuable people who work hard... [pauses] Some people are even saying that I am adopting two different concepts, but I am not. [Word indistinct] and they are right. The administration minister comes to me and says: If we agree to increase their salaries, we must increase everyone's salaries. What do you think of that? Therefore, we cannot increase anyone's salary. It is the same thing. Unless we adopt a new procedure in Brazil and begin saying things clearly and openly, nothing will work out. If we agree to change the date from the 30th to the 25th, we will have to do it for everyone. If we do it for everyone, someone will have to get me the $1.25 billion. [end recording] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso also commented on the possibility of running in the presidential elections. He is analyzing whether it is really the time to leave the government, particularly now that there is such confusion among the three government branches.
