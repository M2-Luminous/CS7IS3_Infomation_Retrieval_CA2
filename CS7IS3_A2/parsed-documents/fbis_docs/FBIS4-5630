Admiral Larson, who made his comments in Wellington, is the first senior American military official to visit New Zealand in almost 10 years. In that time New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear laws, which the Admiral said remained a barrier to military exercises between the two countries. But he added, the objective of his visit was to begin a dialogue and lay out a framework for common interests. The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, told reporters that most of his discussions with Admiral Larson had centered on peacekeeping around the world. Relations between New Zealand and the United States deteriorated in the mid 1980s after the adoption of the anti-nuclear laws. The American president at the time, Ronald Reagan, prohibited military contacts and all exchanges between senior officials, but earlier this year President Bill Clinton announced the restoration of high-level contacts.
