The statement says that the Srpska republic army "successfully responded to the strong attack and is holding its positions." A NATO C-130 transport carrying a NATO rapid intervention unit with a large quantity of ammunition, weapons, and military equipment, landed at Tuzla airport at 1650, the statement says. The general staff of the army of the Srpska republic has learned from reliable sources that rapid intervention forces with their weaponry and equipment have been sent from Frankfurt's NATO base to operate together with members of the Muslim force against Serb units, the statement says. The synchronised attack in the Gorazde area and the abuse of Tuzla airport as a military means (the airport is yet to be opened to humanitarian operations) indicates that UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units have overstepped their mandate and that they bear all responsibility for further escalation of conflict in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says. It adds that the UNPROFOR's present activities fully confirm the assumption that they have openly sided with the Muslim forces and become directly involved in the civil war in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
