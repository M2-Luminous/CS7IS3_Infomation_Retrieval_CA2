This conclusion follows from a ruling by Vologda City Court, which has considered an action against Yuriy Nekrasov, "Democratic Russia's" local leader, by the oblast organization of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Soon after the elections of 12 December last year Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, Doctor of Historical Sciences, published in the newspaper RUSSKIY SEVER an article analyzing the reasons that led to the LDPR's sucess. A specialist in German history, he compared Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's actions with Adolf Hitler's in the Reichstag elections of January 1933 and called the LDPR a profascist political organization. Vologda Liberal Democrats took out a court action to defend their honor and dignity. They demanded a public apology from Yuriy Nekrasov, as well as a sum of 10 million rubles for the moral harm. Sergey Mormin, coordinator of the LDPR's oblast organization, explained in court that they need this money for propaganda work to restore the party's undermined prestige. Some 29 percent of the voters who went to the ballot boxes voted for Zhirinovskiy's party in the 12 December elections in Vologda Oblast. But the Liberal Democrats have been unable to field a single candidate for the elections to the oblast duma to be held 20 March. "More than two-thirds of the citizens who supported us in the last elections," Sergey Mormin explained, "have refused to sign documents in favor of our candidates, saying that we are a fascist party." In the court session Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, relying on works by U.S. and Italian researchers into fascism, named six generic signs of this political trend and illustrated them convincingly with quotations from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's book and speeches. Evidently finding nothing with which to counter the professor's arguments, Sergey Mormin, the Vologda Liberal Democrats' leader, disowned his own leader, telling the court that Zhirinovskiy's actions are a personal matter for Zhirinovskiy and have no bearing on the activity of the whole party. After an investigation lasting more than three hours the court rejected the Vologda LDPR organization's action against Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, chairman of "Democratic Russia's" oblast branch.
