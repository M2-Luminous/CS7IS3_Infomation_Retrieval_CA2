FBIS TRENDS-18APR94-DPRK-U.S. North Korea Signals Continued Interest in Talks With U.S. North Korea Signals Continued Interest in Talks With U.S. SUMMARY Pyongyang has used this year's commemoration of President Kim Il- song's birthday to signal ongoing interest in resuming the dialogue with Washington on the nuclear issue. Pyongyang media so far have not been observed to report or comment on the arrival of the Patriot missiles in the South. END SUMMARY The most direct indication of Pyongyang's desire to resume talks with the United States came in a 14 April KCNA report of a meeting between North Korean officials and foreign visitors invited for the birthday celebration, including representatives of The Washington Times and CNN. KCNA depicted the North Korean delegation, which was headed by party secretary Kim Yong-sun, as insisting that DPRK-U.S. talks "must" be resumed and as contending that the nuclear issue is a matter to be solved between the DPRK and the United States. KCNA further cited the North Koreans as affirming that there is no change in Pyongyang's twin declared objectives of resolving the nuclear issue and improving bilateral relations with Washington. Rhetorical Restraint Pyongyang's latest, albeit indirect, call for talks with the United States was accompanied by a measure of rhetorical restraint at commemorative birthday events. Premier Kang Song-san, keynote speaker at the main meeting marking President Kim's 82nd birthday, used the term "U.S. imperialists" only in reference to the Korean war (Pyongyang radio, 14 April). His harshest indirect attack on Washington came in his standard charge that "the imperialists and reactionaries" are carrying out "antisocialist and anti-DPRK maneuvers" now -"more viciously than ever before." The commemorative editorial in the party paper Nodong Sinmun was even more restrained, eschewing the term "U.S. imperialists" altogether (Pyongyang radio, 15 April). In the past, Pyongyang did not hesitate to use Kim Il-song's birthday to ratchet up its war rhetoric. For instance, last year--in the crisis atmosphere following the Team Spirit U.S.-ROK joint military exercise in March and Pyongyang's announcement of withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the same month--Premier Kang in his keynote speech charged that "dark clouds of nuclear war' had been created by "the U.S. imperialists' reckless maneuvers" and had led to "a touch-and-go situation" (Pyongyang radio, 14 April 1993). Treatment of South In sharp contrast to the measure of circumspect ion shown toward Washington, Pyongyang continued to treat Seoul in harsh tones. Kang in his speech accused "the flunkeyist, nation-selling Kim Yong-sam ring, which flatters and submits to outside forces" of "recklessly" engaging in unspecified "provocative acts" after having lost "the ability to reason." Similarly, in the latest attack on the South Korean government, Nodong Sinmun on 18 April held Seoul responsible for the current stalemate over the nuclear issue (KCNA, 18 April). It accused the South of "stalling" DPRK-U.S. talks in a bid to "obstruct" resolution of the nuclear issue and "accelerate" development of its own nuclear arms while still under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Pyongyang media have so far ignored Seoul's decision to withdraw the demand for an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys as a prerequisite to U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. Implications Pyongyang media treatment of events surrounding Kim Il-song's birthday appeared designed to convey the impression that the regime still hopes to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue with Washington and that, at least for now, talks with Seoul are not on its agenda. Pyongyang could harden its stance toward Washington over the deployment of the Patriot missiles. (AUTHOR: YIM.
