According to AMAP, the incident happened on 11 March when 12 "armed bandits" -- a term used to describe Tuareg "rebels" -- tried to hold the people of Dilly subprefecture to ransom. It did not specify whether the victims belonged to the police or were "armed bandits." There has been an upsurge in armed attacks, often among Tuaregs, in northern Mali since the beginning of March. One such attack led to the death of Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the leaders of the Popular Movement of the Azaouad, signatory party to the April 1992 peace pact between the Tuaregs and the Malian Government.
