[De Klerk] I believe, I am confident, that we are going to succeed. There is no alternative, and in that sense I think this period will be written up as the period beginning a new era which launched South Africa as a very successful state and as a successful nation. On the fears of Afrkaners and other groups. [De Klerk] I believe the Afrikaner nation, and the Zulu nation and all other nations which form part of the greater whole of the South African nation, need not fear for their futures as entities. Already, in terms of the transitional constitution, there is a sufficient constitutional and legal base (to protect them). I believe that as long as there is a commitment among Afrikaner to cherish their language and their culture and traditions, the Afrikaner nation will continue to exist. And it can only exist in interaction with all other South Africans. On the folly of separatism. [De Klerk] I also believe that the new 34th principle (of the Interim Constitution), in conjunction with the others will lead to a dynamic negotiation about the strength of the position of the various cultural groups, nations in South Africa...however, I don't see the guarantee for the identity of Afrikaners or other nations existing in separatism in any way whatsoever. But I think there are various possibilities at which we could look within the framework of the constitution, as to how we could strengthen the security of people who feel strongly about their cultural identity. They are struggling with it, but in Belgium there are interesting examples as to what can be achieved. On a volkstaat. [Afrikaner homeland] [De Klerk] Rather than working for a volkstaat which is unachievable, I think Afrikaners and the Zulus and others should look specifically at other (constitutional) options to maintain their identity. On whether he would do anything differently with the benefit of hindsight. [De Klerk] On the major issues and the major decisions, I have no regrets. On some specifics, yes. With hindsight one would have done certain things differently, approached negotiations about a specific issue maybe differently...things which wasted time. But on major issues no regrets. I would have taken the same decisions, I would have made the same speech on the 2nd of February, I would have called the referendum, I would have abolished the apartheid laws and I would have worked for the type of constitution which we now have. On the Interim Constitution. [De Klerk] I'm happy with the constitution, basically satisfied. It's not perfect, I think it can be improved, but on all the goals which we spelt out in the referendum, we have basically achieved them. We stated 14 principles, departure points, call them what you will. And all 14 are there, in some instances to 100 percent satisfaction, in a few instances we got 120 percent -- we actually started out setting our sight a little bit lower but we got more. In other instances maybe 80 percent, but substantially we have achieved those 14 goals which we strove for. The transitional constitution and the principles, I think, lay a sound basis for the right type of constitution for South Africa. On whether he has considered stepping down. [De Klerk] No, I don't lie awake at night. Really, I haven't thought about it, I have been working so hard. And can I say that, honestly, in the government of national unity I will be number one, even if I happen to come second in the election. I will be number one for the millions of people who are going to vote for me. I will be there representing them in my own right, I won't be there as anybody's number two man. On the possibility of being deputy president. [De Klerk] If I was to be number two in the hierarchy after the election, I have no problem with that. It will be a government of national unity. In a winner-takes-all system it happens quite often that a former prime minister becomes the leader of the opposition. We are moving into a unique situation and I have no compunction about what lies a head. On how the NP [National Party] will perform next week. [De Klerk] We are fighting to become the biggest party. Against even our own expectations and predictions, growing support is already showing up in the opinion polls. We didn't expect it to show so soon. There is a particular surge of support in Natal. And remember, when we talk about being the biggest party, we are not talking about having 50 percent or more of the vote in terms of our new system. On the option of staying out of the new Cabinet as an opposition party. [De Klerk] Well, that is a constitutional option. Nobody is forced into the government of national unity. But such a step would militate against what we set out to achieve. We said it is our policy that there must be power-sharing. We believe the country needs co-operation between the major parties. We need at least a period of stability during which political strife is put aside and we make a great effort at reconciliation and creating stability. And, on the basis of that stability, within the framework of wise and frugal economic policies, creating dynamic and sustained economic growth. The intensive negotiation of the past four years has proved itself to be a powerful mechanism, and this is what a government of national unity is about, it is a constant process of negotiation. Up till now we have been negotiating the constitution. In the government of national unity it becomes negotiation about each and every important issue which governments have to deal with. On his experiences on the campaign trail. [De Klerk] I've had no overwhelming problems so far in this campaign. The real bitterness of the right wing played itself out in 1989. It's still there of course, but it no longer impacts on my meetings and day-to-day activities. The last real problem I had was at Ventersdorp. Vis-a-vis the intimidation from ANC supporters, it has been a regular feature. Where it really got out of hand we laid complaints, and as you know big fines have been levied now. Those were really bad cases. In other instances we lived with it where it didn't get out of hand. Politics isn't for sissies. It's robust and I am not overly sensitive. You must just see to it that you have a very strong microphone and it has, sometimes, a very motivating effect on your own supporters when they see you are not frightened, and especially when they outnumber the others. One of the good experiences was at one of my roadshows where a group of about 80 ANC youths was waving placards, and I think we had about 800 or so. So I said: "Why do we wait for the 27th of April? Let's vote now. All those of you who vote for the National Party put up your hands. It was a sea of hands. And then I said: "All those who vote for the ANC?" About 15 hands went up, and it created a great spirit. On how the relationship with the majority party will work. [De Klerk] We'll have to develop procedures for that. I've had interesting discussions with European leaders who are in similar situations. As a guideline, I would say there must be room for public dissension, because parties will retain their identity. On day-to-day matters, on immediate matters where consensus is reached, obviously we would avoid making the original dissension public. But where we do want to express our disagreement -- that is what Parliament is there for. You could even register your opposition to a decision by taking a vote in parliament. But then, as happens with boards of directors in a company, you vote against it but you acquiesce in the decision of the majority. One would have to limit such things to major policy issues where a party needs to say to the public: "If I had the sole say, this is how I would have done it." It is possible to marry these things. It happens in every practical partnership every day. On whether he will be able to criticise the new Cabinet freely. [De Klerk] Absolutely yes, that is why I emphasise that I am not there on the basis of anybody doing me a favour. I will be there as of right because the constitution says so. Another aspect which gives me confidence is that in negotiations we looked at the problem of what happens if you don't get along well, and we considered whether we should have decision-making processes -- increased majorities, a voting procedure for Cabinet -- and we agreed not to do so because that would militate against the spirit of a government of national unity. That says in itself you must seek unity, you must seek consensus, and we opted for consensus rule with regard to decision-making, without prescribed procedures which introduces a guillotine. Because, once you have those, it is so easy to become confrontational because there is a decisive method in which to get a decision in any event. I want to avoid that and my interlocutors agreed with that. So, if the commitment is there from all sides, this is what the country needs. On "no-go" areas for parties. [De Klerk] I'm not a cry baby about the campaign so far. But what does bother me is when one is prevented from addressing a meeting. That is essentially wrong. A public meeting is a public meeting, and other people from other parties have the right to attend, as long as they don't get out of hand. One must live with it. The fact that there are certain inaccessible areas, or virtually inaccessible areas, is a blot on South Africa's reputation, and we must work to see that really free and fair campaigning, full and open campaigning, can be possible at all times. But you can't be too theoretical about this. I don't think the DP [Democratic Party] ever held a public meeting let's say in Swartruggens -- they don't have supporters there. It is a reality. As a party one analyses where your strengths lie. The difficulty arises where you really know you can make inroads, break into new areas -- this is our position -- and then get barricades. On fears of chaos after election. [De Klerk] I think that is overdone. I don't agree. I think there will be euphoria, depending upon the results of course -- it will determine who will be euphoric and who will not. But I think there will be festivities and activity, and from radicals even maybe last gasp sorts of protest. But I think it will die down soon. I think the public, almost all South Africans, are a bit tired of politics. They want life to return to normal, they want their TV and newspapers to become more relaxing and entertaining. I think that reflects the mood of the whole country; I really think by 11 May things will basically return to normal.
