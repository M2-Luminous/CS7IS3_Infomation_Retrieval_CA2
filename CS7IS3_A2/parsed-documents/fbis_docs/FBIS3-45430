Machinery and electronics are now China's second largest source of hard currency, after textiles. Machinery and electronics products accounted for 24.5 percent of all exports last year, compared with 6.1 percent in 1986. Although the 13 percent growth rate is impressive, Chinese officials are still not satisfied: From 1986 to 1992, machinery and electronics exports grew by an average of 42 percent each year. A senior official with the State Economic and Trade Commission attributed last year's slower growth to the brisk domestic market, which dampened producers' enthusiasm for exports. The rising costs of raw materials and energy also reduced exporters' competitive edge against other countries. Promoting exports of machinery and electronics is a priority of the government. The government hopes to increase such exports to $30 billion by 1995, the official said. The figure is expected to reach $60 billion by the turn of the century, making machinery and electronics the country's No. 1 source of hard currency. In 15 years, planners hope exports will amount to $150 billion. To reach this ambitious goal, the official said, the machinery and electronics industries should develop some mainstay export products, such as factory machinery, ships and automobiles. Besides traditional export markets, Chinese manufacturers should also explore new markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The official with the State Economic and Trade Commission said the government will use financial incentives to help stimulate future exports of machinery and electronics. Banks and financial institutions will provide more long-term loans under preferential terms to support the export of factory machinery, aircraft and ships. Establishment of a national import and export bank may also improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. The country's Chamber of Imports and Exports of Machinery and Electronics Products intends to play a bigger role in maintaining export orders. Domestic exporters, meanwhile, are encouraged to use foreign manufacturers' technology, designs, brands and marketing networks.
