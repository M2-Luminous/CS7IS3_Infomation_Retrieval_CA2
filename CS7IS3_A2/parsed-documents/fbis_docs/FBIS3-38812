Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said this demand will be included in the points that our side will outline on the issues to be discussed at the proximity talks. Mr. Kasoulidhis made the statement this afternoon after the meeting between President Glavkos Kliridhis and UN official Gustave Feissel and added that our side will submit a list of points which will cover all the aspects of the confidence-building measures. Mr. Feissel said after the meeting that he has not received from President Kliridhis or from Rauf Denktas any list of such points and expressed the hope that the clarification of these points would be completed by the end of this week. Feissel also noted: During his contacts, he will make efforts to foster understanding and, in a wider sense, agreement between the two leaders on the issues to be discussed. Mr. Feissel ruled out redefining the Varosha area which will be placed under UN control, and he denied reports that repairs have begun at Nicosia Airport. Mr. Feissel met with Rauf Denktas at noon today. He will have a new meeting with Denktas on Wednesday [9 February], and on Thursday he will meet again with President Kliridhis. The proximity talks will be held under Joe Clark, who is expected in Cyprus on Saturday.
