In a joint press conference with visiting Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly after NATO's fresh ultimatum for the Serbs, Clinton said Serb acts in Gorazde "justify firm action." Papandreou, meanwhile, expressed Greek concerns and reservation for the NATO decision for fear of wider violence, although it did not vote against it. "It's a fire that can spread very fast," Papandreou said. "On the Balkan peninsula, we have really dynamite on our hands," Under the NATO ultimatum, the Bosnian Serbs should stop their assault immediately and pull out their heavy weapons before 12:01 A.M. Sunday (local time) from a two miles radius from the center of Gorazde, one of six U.N.-designated "safe areas," or risk NATO air strikes. The NATO decision also demands that the Serbs allow U.N. Peacekeepers and medical personnel into the enclave, which had been under intensive Serb attacks in recent weeks. Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Papandreou also discussed Athens' relations with Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. For his part, Papandreou offered that Greece would lift its economic embargo on the land-locked Macedonia and stop blocking its membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), provided that Macedonia change some articles in its constitution. As for the Republic's name, which resembles that of the Greek province of Macedonia, Papandreou said, it would set aside for further negotiations. Clinton, expressing understanding for Greece's "legitimate concerns" while calling for the end to the Greek economic blockade on Macedonia, said he was hopeful that an agreement would soon be reached.
