It seems to me that people and, in particular, journalists, are wondering who exactly acquired who. Was it you who acquired the Olbi firm or the Olbi firm acquired you, the Democratic Choice party? [Gaydar] We thought that the first two jokes might be something like this -- the Russia's Choice party bought a bit of Olbi and the latter, Olbi, bought a bit of Russia's Choice. [Medvedev] Do you look upon such jokes with a sense of humor or do you take them seriously? [Gaydar] I approach them with a sense of humor. I treat this as something inevitable. [Medvedev] It was your idea that Oleg Boyko [chairman of the party's executive committee] was one of the party's leaders. Why? [Gaydar] Without any doubt, our party needs intelligentsia and entrepreneurs. It should not be a party of just intelligentsia or a party of just entrepreneurs. In my view, we do better when intelligentsia joins forces with entrepreneurs and we fail when they act separately. In connection with this, the idea of including a respected and prominent entrepreneur in the party's leadership was the right one. [Medvedev] The president did not send his regards or any message of greetings to the congress, so your relations with the president remain somewhat unclear. It was officially stated in the press some time ago that you still were the presidential party. [Gaydar] I really do not like the word "presidential" party. It evokes an image of orderly files of top officials under the president's command joining the party. I do not think the president likes it too much either. We are the party that is without doubt a political and strategic ally for the president. This, however, does not mean that there are no disagreements between us and him. For instance, an edict on the fight against organized crime was published this week. I am convinced that it is a mistake. I am convinced that violation of human rights cannot be justified by invoking most serious situation with criminality. I am convinced that attempts to fight crime by curbing human rights cannot result in anything but administrative racketeering, arbitrariness, and extortion of bribes. I very much hope the president will review his decision, that he will listen to our arguments. Nonetheless, despite our disagreements even on important matters, I am convinced that on the most vital matters of Russia's future, Russian democracy and reforms in Russia, we are allies and our views coincide. [Medvedev] It is clear from the party manifesto what its aim is. It is to win, to win the elections. What is not clear is who will be the main candidate. If the president decides to continue his campaign for the presidential post, will Gaydar fight against him, or will he withdraw from the race? Or is it too early to ask? [Gaydar] We will do everything within our powers to ensure that a single democratic candidate with the best chance of success is put forward and backed. No one's personal ambitions, including mine, God forbid, will stand in the way. [Medvedev] Do you think that with the existing disagreements between yourself, say, Sergey Shakhray [leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy [leader of the YabLoko bloc], is it possible to have a single candidate? [Gaydar] Well, I think President Yeltsin is the most likely choice.
