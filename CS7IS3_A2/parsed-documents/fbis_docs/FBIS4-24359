Li made the remarks during a meeting with bankers from the World Bank and representatives from 17 banks of six countries that are providing loans by means of Expanded Co-Financing (ECO) to China's Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant here this afternoon. During the meeting, Li extended his welcome and congratulations to the bankers for the success of the 120 million U.S. dollar ECO cooperation program for the Chinese plant, saying that China's economy has had sustained development, in which the development of the power industry holds an important position. Long into the future, he said, China will continue to take in foreign funds and equipment to accelerate its development in the power industry and on other infrastructural construction. Li said that for the past several decades, China's power industry has witnessed great progress, but it is still inadequate for the development of the whole national economy and the raising of people's living standards. Therefore, Li said, the Chinese Government has adopted various measures to speed up power development so that it will be developed with an annual increase rate of eight to nine percent in the following five years. Considering this point, said the Chinese premier, the power industry market in China is promising. Li said that in the past 14 years, China and the World Bank have conducted effective cooperation. China has not only received loans from the World Bank but also learned experience in management, he added. China hopes to strengthen its cooperation with the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions in the power industry and other infrastructure constructions, said Li. The World Bank has decided to provide a 350 million U.S. dollar loan for the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant and agreed to provide a guarantee for those foreign banks which provide the 120 million U.S. dollars in loans for the ECO program. Li praised the World Bank and other relevant financial institutions for their efforts in promoting the ECO program with the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant. He said that ECO is a good mode of cooperation, adding that the success of the program shows that the cooperation between China and the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions has a bright future. The Chinese premier said that with development of China's economy, the enhancement of its economic strength and the success of its foreign currency system reform, China's ability to pay back loans in foreign currency is no problem. The representatives of banks that are providing the ECO loan said that they are satisfied with the implementation of the program, which has been accomplished within such a short period of time. The World Bank and other foreign banks will use the ECO program with the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant as reference for the next ECO program with China, so as to expand the scale of cooperation with China, they said. Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister Shi Dazhen of the power industry took part in the meeting.
