FR940527-1-00200 FR940527-1-00014 Column 4 presents the change in Federal rate payments of the combined effects of the revised DRG classification system, and the subsequent recalibration of DRG weights incorporating these revised DRGs, as discussed in section II of this proposed rule. The DRG changes are expected to produce only minimal effects on the distribution of Federal rate payments. The highest gain from DRG reclassification and recalibration is projected at 0.1 percent (for several classes of hospitals), while the largest loss is projected at ^0.3 percent (for urban disproportionate share hospitals with 100 beds or less). As with the previous two columns, the impact of the new wage data in Federal rate payments is isolated in column 5 by holding the other payment parameters constant in the two comparison simulations. That is, the percentage changes demonstrate the changes in Federal rate payments from our FY 1995 baseline_using the FY 1994 wage index before geographic reclassifications based on 1990 wage survey data, after elimination of the separate rural rate and incorporating the FY 1995 GROUPER_to a model substituting the FY 1995 pre-reclassification wage index based on data submitted for hospital cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1991. The only significant changes from the use of new wage data on the capital geographic adjustment factor are on hospitals in Puerto Rico. Urban Puerto Rico hospitals experience a decrease of 7.4 percent and rural Puerto Rico hospitals experience a decrease of 10.7 percent. As is the case with similar decreases in operating prospective payment system payments, these effects are attributable to improved reporting by hospitals. ]Column 6 illustrates the effects of the proposed transfer policy changes relative to a baseline simulation based on current transfer policy. The effects of the changes in transfer policy are similar to those in operating prospective payment system payments. The transfer changes increase Federal rate payments to rural hospitals by 0.5 percent, and decrease Federal rate payments to urban hospitals by 0.1 percent. As is the case with operating prospective payments, this result is due to the fact that rural hospitals benefit from changing the per diem methodology. Column 7 displays the impact of the FY 1995 decisions by the MGCRB compared to FY 1994 reclassification decisions. It includes all of the changes proposed for FY 1995 discussed up to this point. Therefore, in examining the changes for particular hospital groups, the impacts discussed previously appear here as well (for example, the large decreases in Puerto Rico due to the new wage data). This comparison corresponds with the methodology used to determine the GAF/DRG budget neutrality adjustment factor. To accomplish this comparison, we have replaced the FY 1995 proposed capital Federal rate with the FY 1994 Federal rate adjusted by the 1.00115 proposed GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor. Column 8 shows the incremental effects of outlier changes alone. The changes shown in this column closely reflect the changes in operating prospective payments shown in Table 1. Column 9 displays the combined changes from the previous columns, as well as the effects of other factors affecting Federal rate payments, compared to FY 1994 Federal rate payments. The other factors include: the change in the standard Federal rate from FY 1994, the effect of geographic reclassifications on large urban status, and a 1.9 percent increase in outlier payments. As noted in the previous discussion, the effects of changes in geographic reclassification decisions from FY 1994 to FY 1995, in addition to the changes discussed in columns 3 through 6, are shown in column 7. These effects are included in column 9 as well, along with the changes in outlier policy and the changes in the Federal rate and outlier payments. Thus, only the last column reflects the effects of all quantifiable policy changes on simulated FY 1995 Federal rate payments.
