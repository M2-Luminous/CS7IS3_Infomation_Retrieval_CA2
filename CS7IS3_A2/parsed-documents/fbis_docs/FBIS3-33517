Nevertheless, a parity will be established between the Ufir and the URV so that when the URV is instituted as currency, the Ufir may be equal to a certain fraction of the new currency. There would thus be a rate of exchange between the Ufir and the URV in the same way as there is a dollar exchange rate. The proposal to let the Ufir continue along with the URV seeks to head off legal actions. During the stage in which the URV will only be a reference index, the Ufir will continue to be effective with its present structure. However, once the URV is instituted as currency, the Ufir will disappear. The contention of Central Bank Foreign Area Director Gustavo Franco is that this transition system to index taxes will do away with all the legal impediments that prevented the adoption of the URV for tax purposes. The great stumbling block presented by the Federal Revenue Service was a provision established in the National Tax Code stipulating that taxes should be indexed to the past inflation, which ended up by being incorporated into jurisprudence by the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. According to the definition cited in the text of the economic program, the URV would reflect the current inflation and would not be used for indexation purposes. Suggestion -- Special Adviser Edmar Bacha went as far as suggesting that indexing taxes to the URV should be optional. Taxpayers could then choose to index their taxes to the Ufir, the value of which would continue changing, or to the URV, the value of which would be adjusted but to a lesser degree. The Federal Revenue Service questioned the use of the URV for tax purposes because it feared that a disaster similar to the one that took place in 1991 would supervene. At that time the government was defeated time and again at the STF due to the obduracy of the team of former Minister Zelia [Cardoso de Mello, economy minister under Fernando Collor] to use the TR [Reference Interest Rate] as reference index.
