Notes from First Session of Orenburg Oblast Legislative Assembly"] [Text] Orenburg -- There had been a possibility that the session might not take place at all. On the same morning the oblast court might have passed its verdict on an action by V. Shapovalenko, the president's representative. The latter was insistently demanding that the elections in eight districts be deemed invalid. If the court had taken the side of the president's representative and deemed the decision of the oblast electoral commission incorrect, the deputies could have dispersed quietly to their homes. They would have lacked a quorum. The court adopted truly a decision of Solomon -- to send to Moscow a question on how to interpret a particular point in the statute on elections. It is not known when the reply will come or when the court session will now be held. Another surprise awaited deputies at the entrance to the House of Soviets. It was, however, perfectly to be expected. They had to pass through a "corridor of honor" made up of students, teachers, and higher educational institution lecturers. They were standing with placards, sometimes with highly sarcastic epithets addressed to the local power and the central power. The deputies must be given their due: They responded with lightning speed and included this item on the agenda. After these tribulations the session nontheless began with a speech by the chairman of the oblast electoral commission. His speech contained several interesting points. Among the 36 deputies (11 seats are vacant pending repeat elections) 32 are Russian, two are Kazakhs, one is a Mordvinian, and one a Ukrainian. There was not a single representative of the Tatar nationality, the second largest in the oblast, in the composition of the assembly. Let us note that on the eve of the elections the Tatar sociocultural center had raised the question of granting a quota for the Legislative Assembly. How can we not recall those times when people in oblast party committee and soviet executive committee offices calculated, with an accuracy down to two decimal places, how many workers, peasants, and women there must be? Incidentally, there is not a single representative of the hammer and sickle in the present assembly, nor was there in the lists of candidates. The voters proved ill-disposed toward women, electing just one representative of them. The election of the assembly chairman was no mystery. Senior Deputy R. Khramov announced that the only candidate was V. Grigoryev, who until the last day had been chairman of the oblast soviet. The organizing committee had met the previous day, attended by six of its seven members. Five voted for Grigoryev, and one abstained. This was himself. The calm was shattered by Deputy Yu. Nikiforenko. After listing the shortcomings of the single nominee, he proposed also including A. Zelepukhin, leader of the oblast agricultural administration, in the lists for a secret ballot. An alternative for the sake of an alternative, you might think. In our democratic times it would seem a nonsense when a candidate runs for a post all by himself. It really was somewhat uncomfortable to see what happened next. Deputies began simultaneously burning such a lot of incense in praise of the sole candidate that, if they had really been doing so, it would not have been possible to make out faces through the smoke. On the other hand, they told Zelepukhin without beating about the bush: Step down. Although he had not yet, in fact, been included on the lists for a secret ballot. Then the "heavy artillery" was brought up. State Duma Deputy T. Zlotnikova took the floor. Tamara Vladimirovna advanced six theses, according to which it was necessary to vote precisely for Grigoryev. Let us leave aside five of them. The chief one was that Valeriy Nikolayevich is noted for his great decency and honesty. This really is so. He does not have a cottage, such as officials of exalted rank are engaged in building with poorly concealed enthusiasm, and he has not left sumptuous apartments to his children. "He still drives a Zaporozhets," the president's representative, who was sitting next to me, whispered in my ear. He was talking, of course, of private motor transport. The State Duma deputy concluded her speech by saying that, but for Valeriy Nikolayevich's decency and honesty, he would certainly have gotten into the Federal Assembly (!!!). I listened and thought: What were the feelings at this moment of V. Yelagin, senator and head of the oblast administration, who beat Grigoryev in the struggle for this seat on the Federal Assembly? Yelagin concluded the debate. He said that he would be "pleased to work" with Valeriy Nikolayevich. He added: "Not over a cup of coffee, of course." He advised the chief of the oblast agricultural administration to work a little better in his own post. He emphasized, however, that, whomever the deputies elected, he would strive for joint constructive work. Finally Zelepukhin took the floor. He said that he could see for himself that there was a whole host of work in the agrarian sector. He reported that this was the reason why he had declined the recent invitation to Moscow to take up a cozy and quiet post. Just as he was about to sit down again, he said, as though suddenly remembering: "Yes, I withdraw my candidacy." Valeriy Nikolayevich Grigoryev was elected chairman of the oblast Legislative Assembly in a secret ballot. The sole candidate got 35 of the 36 votes. Familiar, is it not? Maybe it was not worth going into such detail about the first session of the provincial parliament. But I am afraid that the oblast Legislative Assembly is doomed to such a scenario by virtue of its composition. For it is heads of rayon administrations and leaders of industrial and agricultural enterprises who form the majority on it. They will assent to the executive, forgetting about their legislative role. Then the Orenburg voters will discover in surprise that they have engaged musicians for the "orchestra" who all play the same instrument.
