Kim made the remarks at a breakfast he hosted for Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, other cabinet members and his senior secretaries at Chongwadae [presidential offices] prior to departing for Japan and China on state visits Thursday. "North Korea is secretly developing nuclear arms despite its promise of denuclearization and is increasing propaganda broadcasts against the South to instigate people to topple the government," he said. "What we can and must do now is win this fight without a war." Kim said he would use his meetings with Japanese Premier Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese President Jiang Zemin as an opportunity to ask for their cooperation in settling the North Korean nuclear row. "North Korea has been insincere and perfidious in the dialogue with us and I thus expected the dialogue to break down. But the situation that developed last Saturday was far beyond my imagination. I cannot help regarding the harsh language used by the chief North Korean delegate while reading from a prepared text, not as that spoken by the delegate himself but as words uttered by the supreme authority of Pyongyang." The government should tell the people the truth to help develop its own national power, he stressed. The government should not create a sense of crisis among the people, as its predecessors did in exaggerating the threat posed by a North Korean water attack, solely to establish its position more firmly. The chief executive noted that irresponsible remarks are being made in certain quarters despite the fact that the people are aware of North Korea's intention since they have access to North Korean broadcasting through TV. He said the government should inform all citizens of any developments pertaining to their safety. On the Patriot deployment, he said the anti-missile missiles are an improved version of those used in the Gulf war and will thus play an important part in the nation's defense. Kim said he expects the UN Security Council will start with a mild resolution on North Korea, with the approach gradually escalating depending on Pyongyang's response. "The government will cooperate closely with the U.S. Government if developments in the dispute at the UN Security Council warrant such cooperation." He said he had taken steps to ensure that he can receive reports from the government 24 hours a day during his seven-day tour of Japan and China.
