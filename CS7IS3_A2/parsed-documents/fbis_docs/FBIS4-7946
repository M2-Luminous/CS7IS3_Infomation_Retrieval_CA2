FBIS4-7946 "dreeu068__a94034" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Earlier Privatization Deals Declared Illegal Earlier Privatization Deals Declared Illegal AU0704092194 Prague CTK in English 1819 GMT 6 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704092194 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- The approval of 13 privatization projects on February 15-16 by the government of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar was illegal, according to a report by the parliamentary Committee for Privatization. The report said that Meciar's government had violated its own privatization concept by agreeing without justification to give advantages to a select group of buyers. Committee member Jozef Zselenak read the report in parliament today. After accepting the report, parliament asked the committee to look into the government's approval of privatization projects approved between February 17 and March 11, the date the Meciar government fell from power. According to the report, the Meciar government approved the direct sale of state companies to pre-selected buyers even if the buyers could not demonstrate their ability to make the first payments. For some firms -- such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal Nemsova, ZOS Vrutky and ZOS Trnava -- the buyers could not demonstrate that they had enough financial resources for developing the company. In several cases, direct sales were approved even when there were competing buyers, whose offers were often better than the approved buyer. Deputies of Meciar's now-opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) attacked the report as subjective, misleading, and "full of lies." One HZDS deputy said the report reminded him of the nationalization of 1948. "I hope the elections are not nullified and the 1950s replayed," he said. Privatization Minister Milan Janicina dismissed HZDS accusations that members of the new coalition government wanted certain privatization projects for themselves, and reassured deputies that all of the 13 enterprises, whose privatizations were rescinded, would be re-entered in the privatization process.
