[passage omitted] "Slovakia is interested in participating in tactical and command and staff exercises of larger dimensions, but not this year," Slovak Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, who represented the Slovak side, told the TA SR correspondent. For 1994, the Slovak Republic is preparing the exchange of smaller units, such as platoons and companies, at reciprocal exercises with other states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). "We cannot afford more, in view of the fact that only 1 percent of the Defense Ministry budget (that is, 104 million Slovak korunas) has been earmarked for the implementation of the Partnership for Peace project," General Humaj noted. Julius Humaj also said that the Slovak Republic would present the presentation document for the Partnership for Peace program in May. "This document cannot be prepared in a few days or weeks," he said, reacting to comments by the NATO political leadership that the partner countries needed more time to draft the presentation document than had originally been expected. Julius Humaj informed the NACC partners of the readiness of the Slovak Republic to make available, within the framework of Partnership for Peace, areas for training as well as training centers for the preparation of members of peacekeeping missions.
