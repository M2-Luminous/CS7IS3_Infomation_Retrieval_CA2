As Mr Major -- who is to visit Washington this month -- moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to the U.S. media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48 hours. But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior official said the Anglo-U.S. relationship was "alive and well and extremely vigorous." In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One senior minister said the president appeared to have put UK-U.S. relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the U.S.'s vocal Irish-American lobby. The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to Mr Adams by the U.S. media, and by the lack of balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said: "Douglas Hurd worked his arse off to get himself on American television screens. He has been pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting." The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the U.S. Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday [1 February] as part of a diplomatic drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. "There was a big tussle in my government about this," Mr Seitz added. He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the U.S. would "act as an encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when it occurs. We will have to wait and see." The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the U.S. vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a U.S. "peace envoy" to Belfast.
