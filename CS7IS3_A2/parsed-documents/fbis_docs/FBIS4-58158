The Bosnian deputy prime minister, who is accompanied by a delegation of government officials, met with our vice president. In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral relations, the Bosnian delegation expressed its hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran's support for the efforts of the Bosnian Government and people to put an end to the inhuman atrocities being perpetrated by the Serbs and to find a humane and just solution to the Bosnian crisis would continue. Upon his arrival in Tehran, Bukvic described the Islamic Republic of Iran as the Bosnian people's best friend, which is an indication of the deep relations between the two countries based on a longstanding and common Islamic culture which transcends all boundaries. In fact, despite the atrocities committed against the Bosnian Muslims and the propagandistic clamor in the mass media of various countries, the Bosnian Muslim nation has few friends. Even among those, there are not many who are ready to extend active support for the territorial integrity, independence, and survival of the oppressed Bosnian nation. The friendship of the Iranian nation with the Muslim Bosnian people, which is rooted in ideological bonds, is an example. During the past two years of an unjust and unequal war against the Bosnian Muslims, the Islamic Republic of Iran has actively extended serious support to the Bosnian people. Unstintingly and in the most difficult circumstances, it has risen in their support. The Islamic Republic of Iran has had to endure political pressures and restrictions and negative propaganda by the common enemies of the Iranian and Bosnian people because of this. The Muslim Iranian nation has always declared its readiness to actively participate in the jihad of the Bosnian Muslims against the criminal Serbs. Recently, the Islamic Republic of Iran reiterated its willingness to dispatch military assistance in order to prevent the Serbs from continuing their crimes and aggression. In any case, the relations between the two Muslim nations of Iran and Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on ideological Islamic tenets, will continue to broaden in the future.
