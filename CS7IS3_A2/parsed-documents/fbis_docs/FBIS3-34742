These remarks by the U.S. President came exactly one week after North Korea called the United States a paper tiger and stated that it will be the loser if another war breaks out in the Korean subcontinent. Despite agreements in principle between the United States and North Korea last month, during the past couple of weeks a strong propaganda war has been waged by the two countries. Pyongyang believes that on the pretext that North Korea is manufacturing nuclear weapons, the United States is engineering plots to cause a war with North Korea. From Pyongyang's point of view, even though North Korea has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and has allowed the IAEA to inspect North Korean nuclear installations, the IAEA--influenced by some countries--has acted contrary to its main duties and is aiming imaginary accusations at North Korea for political reasons. At any rate, for 10 months the topic of North Korea's nuclear arms has been a gauge to measure the pressure in relations between Washington and Pyongyang, and this pressure has fluctuated from threats to encouragements. The recent U.S. threat to impose economic sanctions on North Korea can be studied on two levels. The first is the level of bilateral relations, in which case the sanctions will not be very effective. The second is the level of collective acts, in which case the United States will face two problems. The first problem is that it is difficult to attract the attention of countries, especially the permanent Security Council members and specifically China, on this issue. The second problem is that if these threats materialize, the crisis in U.S.-North Korean relations will enter a dangerous phase because if North Korea is put under economic pressures, it may resort to acts that will have unfavorable consequences.
