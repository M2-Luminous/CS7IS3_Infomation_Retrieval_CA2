Debuque] [Text] The country's export earnings for the first quarter this year rose by 17.8 percent to $2.92 billion -- a $440-million uptick from $2.48 billion in the same period last year. Dollar earnings for March alone amounted to $1.05 billion, or up 24.6 percent from its year ago value of $842.46 million. Month on month, March export receipts exceeded February earnings by a hefty $132 million. The National Statistics Office said this is only the fifth time export earnings for a single month hurdled the billion-dollar mark. The other four times were in September to December last year. As before, electronics and components (composed of micro-circuits and semiconductors) continued to get the lion's share of exports. Dollar earnings in the sector, registering at $302.04 million, accounted for 28.8 percent of total March exports. This followed a whopping 49 percent annual growth. Garments and accessories came in second with receipts valued at $161.44 million. Though earnings dipped slightly by 0.4 percent from the previous month, the sector still absorbed a chunk of export receipts -- about 15.4 percent of total March export earnings. Meanwhile, ignition wiring set and other wiring sets used in vehicles, aircraft and ships ranked third after netting earnings of $32.14 million. This is 36.2 percent higher than the previous year's value of $23.6 million, but 5.6 percent lower than $34.06 million in February. Riding the wave of economic recovery in foreign markets, dollar earnings from exports of woodcrafts and furniture registered at $29.35 million a 15.9 percent jump from last year is $25.33 million. Similarly, demand for frozen and chilled shrimps and prawns leaped by 66.6 percent to $28.33 million. This was tailed closely by cathodes and sections of cathodes of refined copper and gold with receipts ringing up $27.34 million and $22.35 million respectively. Gold in particular, more than doubled its earnings as it posted the highest growth rate of 129 percent. A decline in demand, however, was posted by the coconut oil industry because of competition from other vegetable oils and stunted local production. To show for this, export earnings from coconut oil, though in the eighth slot, fell by 13.1 percent to its March value of $20.89 million. Other top dollar earners of the country were fresh bananas ($20 million) and footwear ($18 million). The ten principal exports altogether recorded earnings worth $661.88 million accounting for 63 percent of total March 1994 exports. Top Markets In the first quarter of the year, the Philippine's trade with the ten major foreign markets registered at $2.41 billion. This is 18 percent higher than $2.04 billion posted in the comparable period last year. For March alone, dollar receipts from the ten top markets amounted to $871.88 million or 83 percent of total export value. The United States remained the top importer of Philippine products with export earnings from that country reaching $360.55 million. U.S. consumers gobbled up 34.3 percent of total exports. Demand for Philippine products there rose 18.5 percent from last year's level as consumers crawled out of a recession. Local products that did well in the U.S. market include garments, electronics and ignition wiring sets. Japan ranked second, with Philippine imports worth $176.69 million or 16.8 percent of the country's total export receipts in March. Third was Hong Kong, with export purchases reaching $55.11 million, followed closely by U.K. with imports worth $51.02 million.
