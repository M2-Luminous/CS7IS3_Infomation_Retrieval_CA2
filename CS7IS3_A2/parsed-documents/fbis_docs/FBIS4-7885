FBIS4-7885 "dreeu067__a94004" FBIS-EEU-94-067-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Council Approves Draft Decree on Price Control Council Approves Draft Decree on Price Control AU0504153694 Sofia BTA in English 1513 GMT 5 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0504153694 Sofia BTA English BFN [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- The National Council for Tripartite Cooperation (of the government, labour organizations and employers) today adopted a draft decree pertaining to the control on the prices of prime necessities. The social partners approved a proposal of Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov envisaging to add another 12 items in the list of government-monitored goods. The goods to be enlisted are all foods, including sunflower oil, cow's butter, yellow cheese, eggs, sugar, sausages, baby foods and legumens. The draft amendment was adopted in connection with the April 1 entry into effect of the value-added tax (VAT). The persistent upward trend of the US dollar and the entry into force of the VAT pushed the prices markedly up. "We believe the current price rise to be the last one this year," Deputy Prime Minister and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev told journalists. He also said that this was part of the cabinet's strategy for the budget's utilization and introduction of VAT. Today, however, he denied that there was any price shock whatsoever, citing figures of the Committee on Prices, according to which the price growth was only negligible. The prices of goods monitored by the cabinet went up by less than 6 percent over the last two weeks of March, according to data of the National Statistical Institute. Anyway, the consumer is free to choose what to believe: the figures or what he sees with his own eyes when shopping. The social partners turned down a proposal made by the Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria to declare a moratorium on the rise of the maximum prices set by the government on electricity, heating, fuels, postal services and telecommunications. Freezing prices could only make some goods vanish from the market, according to Mr. Mincho Koralski, representative of the Union for Private Economic Enterprise at the Tripartite Council. Enterprises will either stop making them or will make them for export only, he said. Widening the range of government-monitored goods to include goods whose prices had been deregulated is accepted as a temporary measure by the social partners. According to them, it will help curb inflation and will be effective only until prices and the market stabilize. All council members backed the decision, though some expressed reservations. Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev believes the measures approved by the Tripartite Council would allow to tighten price control by the local authorities. So far it has been exercised chiefly by the Finance Ministry and the Pricing Committee. The latter, however, has not enough people on its staff to exercise effective control. The draft decree envisages that the municipalities' rights will be expanded, allowing them to use fines paid by violators to hire more full-time and part-time employees and exercise stricter price control. Today's decision of the Tripartite Council is years late, said Mincho Koralski. In his view, the decree will not solve all problems. Its potential is very limited and it will have a minimal effect, Mr. Koralski said. That is why the social partners insist that the government ask parliament to put on its priority list the Price Bill approved by the Tripartite Council and the government a year ago. The social partners also call on the government to come up with a pricing policy concept for 1994. The government is expected to adopt the decree at its next meeting.
