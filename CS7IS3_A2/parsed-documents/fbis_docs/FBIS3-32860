"Cuba is willing to talk with the United States but is not begging and will dialogue with the United States only on an equal footing," Robaina stated this Monday when he called Cuban emigrants who are living in the United States and other countries to a meeting to be held from 22 to 24 April. The Havana conference, entitled "The Nation and Emigration," will attempt to regularize the ties between the Cuban community abroad and their relatives and local institutions. The organizations that are hostile to the Cuban Government have been excluded from this conference. During a news conference, the foreign minister expressed regret that contacts to further immigration negotiations with Washington have not advanced much, and he said this situation "is not due to the Cuban position." According to the Cuban foreign minister, the White House "systematically and repeatedly" breaks the immigration agreement signed 10 years ago, which mandates the United States will grant 20,000 visas a year to Cubans who want to travel to that country. An official Cuban memorandum yesterday accused U.S. special services and Miami exiles of spreading rumors that visas were being granted in order to trigger a massive entry of people to the U.S. Embassy in that capital city. Special operations police and Defense of the Revolution Committee members cordoned off the diplomatic mission, and more than 80 people were arrested in several incidents, official sources have revealed. Robaina clarified that the differences between Washington and Havana and the relations with the community of Cuban exiles "are two separate issues" and that they cannot wait to solve the first issue to start broaching the second problem. The head of the Cuban foreign office urged the Washington government to understand that the Cuban immigrants in the United States include a much wider spectrum than the conservative National Cuban American Foundation, headed by Jorge Mas Canosa.
