He stressed: I am going to this meeting with open proposals and I hope that Albania will show it willingness to improve bilateral relations. The Greek foreign minister said he will raise the issue of Albania releasing the arrested members of the Greek minority party Omonoia, who are being detained at Tirana prison. Papoulias added that the recent incidents in Tirana have cast a shadow on this meeting in Zurich, and as a gesture of goodwill the Albanian Government should have already released the prisoners. Referring to the recent incident at the Episkopi border station, Papoulias reiterated that it would not be beneficial for the Albanian side to insist on its intransigent position. The ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported a short time ago that the meeting between Papoulias and Serreqi began at 1300 today [Greek time] in Zurich. The bulletin adds that Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis and other officials participated in the meeting, which will deal with the entire spectrum of Greek-Albanian relations, particularly the issue of the oppressive measures adopted recently against the Greek minority.
