The Cambodian people would like to solmenly declare that we do not want to exchange Hun Sen for the genocidal gang of blood-thirsty butchers under whose reign of terror many of our grandparents, parents, children, and grandchildren died most miserably in their prison without walls. The Cambodian people cherish and are always ready to follow His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the revered monarch of the Cambodian motherland. The king, however, is living so far away from his subjects. Will he be able to prevent the gang of butchers from murdering his beloved children and grandchildren again as during those three years eight months and 20 days? Only Prince Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] and Samdech Hun Sen have all the potential and all the forces at their disposal to stop the black-shirted murderers from returning to power. If Samdech Hun Sen, who is a patriot and who once saved the nation, leaves the Royal Government and is replaced by the blood-stained bandits, the king's subjects will surely be miserable and wretched again. His Majesty the father of the nation is begged not to listen to the sweet-talking, black-hearted Khmer Rouge who are very good in their divide-to-rule tactics. If they succeed in recapturing power, our revered nation, religion, and king will surely be just history. Seeing this sign of danger, the largest segment of the Cambodian people earnestly implores His Majesty the father of the nation to graciously maintain his trust in the Royal Government born out of the will of the people who are your loyal subjects. Your Majesty should not forget the taste of the 3-year-8-month-20-day regime to which you too were subject. This time, if the Khmer Rouge get the power back, they will not spare you. The common people do not forget, but the common people are afraid Your Majesty might forget. The snare never forgets the heron; only the heron keeps forgetting there is a snare somewhere.
