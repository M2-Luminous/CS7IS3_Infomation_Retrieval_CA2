That which is meant for President Itamar Franco. The White House has already received some signals that the Brazilian president is not willing to attend the summit organized by President Bill Clinton, with the participation of the chiefs of state of the entire hemisphere, except Cuba. The fact that Brazil will have a newly-elected president by that date serves as an excuse for Franco's lack of interest in attending the summit, the intention of which is to implement a political and trade integration project for the three Americas. The reason for Franco's absence, however, goes beyond the date issue. According to a small circle of friends close to Planalto Palace, he simply does not like Clinton. Franco, who is a simple and frank man who appreciates a good piece of coconut-baked pork, dislikes the president of the most powerful country in the world. It is a personal matter. What can be done? It must be a chemical thing.
