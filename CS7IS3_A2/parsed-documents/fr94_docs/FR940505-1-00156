FR940505-1-00156 FR940505-1-00012 (ii) Baseline Reports. As discussed above, EPA currently does not have sufficient information to establish a reasonable baseline military air base emissions inventory from which annual emission targets can be developed. EPA therefore will require military air bases to collect and report data concerning both aircraft operations and other air base operations in the baseline year of 1990, or alternative years as discussed in ``Baseline Inventory and Emission Caps'' above. These reports will be submitted to EPA no later than 180 days following finalization of this rule. These reports would be used by EPA to calculate the military's air base emissions baseline; seasonal emission targets will be established in a subsequent rulemaking action as a series of reductions from this baseline. These baseline reports will include, but may not be limited to, the following information to be provided by each military air base: •Aircraft type and model, engine type and model, and number of landing/take-off operations (LTOs) •Times in mode by engine for each flight •Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time •Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type •GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and annual use hours •All other off-highway equipment activity by fuel type, engine size, and annual use hours •Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by highway certified vehicles (federal owned, contract personnel, privately owned, etc.) operated within air base boundaries Although EPA is not proposing to include aircraft emissions in the FIP program, aircraft emissions are included in the above list of reporting items. EPA believes that information on aircraft operations and emissions will allow it to better review the submitted information on emissions from other sources. Comment is requested on the necessity and usefulness of this information to EPA s implementation of the FIP and to local air quality planning activities. EPA recognizes that detailed information may not be available in each of these categories for 1990. In these instances military air bases may report estimated data; such estimates would be accompanied by a description of the estimation methodology used, including any supporting data. The Department of Defense will be required to identify a reporting entity for military operations at civilian airports; EPA also requests comment on alternative schemes for tracking and reporting such activity. (iii) Annual Compliance Determination Reports. Beginning with a report describing activity during 1999, the FIP will require military air bases to submit annual reports within 60 days of the close of each calendar year. These reports will include information on emissions for that year's ozone season, as described below. EPA will use these reports to determine the military's compliance with the seasonal emissions targets. Initiating these annual reports in 1999 will provide the Department of Defense and EPA with an opportunity to assess data gathering and analysis requirements well in advance of the first emissions target in 2001, as well as providing the DOD with important information on its performance needs prior to the first round of required reductions. Failure to submit annual emissions reports will be subject to EPA enforcement. Annual emissions reports will include the following information: •Aircraft type and model for each flight during the ozone season •Engine type and model for each affected flight •Times in mode by engine for each affected flight •Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time during the ozone season •Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type •GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and seasonal use hours •All other off-highway equipment activity by fuel type, engine size, and seasonal use hours •VMT by highway certified vehicles operating within air base boundaries during the ozone season Military air bases will be required to track and report actual data for the above information categories. Default values will not be accepted for the purposes of determining annual compliance with the military's emissions target. As with baseline reports, the Department of Defense will be required to identify a reporting entity for military aircraft operations at civilian airports; EPA also requests comment on alternative schemes for tracking and reporting such activity. Military air bases will be required to calculate their total hydrocarbon and NO X emissions for the report year's ozone season using the above data and enter these emissions on the report form. Emission calculation methodology will be taken from existing EPA-approved documents. EPA also requests comment on the desirability of issuing additional specific technical guidance concerning emissions calculations for military aircraft operations. ( f ) Exemptions. EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control program for certain types of military air base operations. For example, emissions resulting from actions in response to emergencies, such as those that support operations of the United States forces introduced into hostilities, introduced into situations where involvement in hostilities is indicated, actions to resolve in-flight emergencies, or rendering emergency humanitarian or natural disaster relief should be exempt from reporting requirements and not count towards the military's environmental performance. Other actions which should also be included in this category are those to extinguish wildfires and immediate responses to the release or discharge of oil or hazardous material in accordance with approved Spill Prevention and Response Plans or Spill Contingency Plans. In addition, certain small military facilities with only minimal aircraft activity might be unnecessarily burdened under this program relative to the emissions reductions that might be obtained. Therefore, EPA requests comment on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a de minimis exemption for this control program. ( 3 ) Legal Authority. Section 118 of the Act requires all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, to comply with rules and regulations promulgated under the Act in the same manner and to the same extent as non-governmental agencies. 42 U.S.C. Section 7418. ( 4 ) Issues for Specific Comment. EPA requests comment on the proposed exemption of military aircraft from FIP requirements on the basis of national security considerations, and on the alternative proposals described in this section. EPA requests comment on whether stationary source emission reduction targets are appropriate for use with a military control strategy. EPA requests comment on the manner in which non-Department of Defense government-operated aircraft emission sources should be included in this FIP control strategy. EPA requests comment on the desirability of exempting such sources from the requirements of the control program.
