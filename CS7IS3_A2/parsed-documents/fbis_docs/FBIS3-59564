This briefly is the direction that has come from the commission that was nominated by Research Minister Umberto Colombo at the beginning of August to settle the confusion that had arisen around this question after the ASI [Italian Space Agency] had launched a program with this goal. The commission, which is presided over by Sergio Ristuccia, a magistrate from the Corte dei Conti [State Audit Court] and comprises Francesco Carassa, former ESA [European Space Agency] board president, Gianfilippo Cuneo, an expert in industrial strategy, and Alessandro Minuto Rizzo, plenipotentiary foreign minister, has terminated its enquiry and delivered its findings to Minister Colombo. The ASI had planned a program with a double project. One being the San Marco Scout, managed by Prof. Luigi Broglio and funded with 90 billion lire, with the goal of developing the American Scout launcher of Loral (the former LTV) that has been used up to the present time at the San Marco platform in Kenya. The other has been assigned to BPD-Spazio of the Gilardini-Fiat group with an initial funding of 120 billion lire. This provides for the construction of the Vega rocket (an advanced generation European carrier) and is centered on the development of the elements that have come from the experience gained from the auxiliary rockets produced for the Ariane carrier. A prototype of the new Zefiro engine (that is part of the Vega) was flown in Sardinia in 1992 and a second model was subjected to successful ground tests last May. The conclusions of the commission express a negative evaluation of the plan that was supported by Broglio, because it would finish with Italian money paying for the improvement of an American launcher that would remain such, whilst the advantages for Italy would be few, if not inexistent. However the commission judged the development of an industrial project favorable because it would permit the growth of a technology from which strategic economic and market advantages could be gained. This would provide a know-how that would also make our country competitive in the emerging sector of space transportation of small satellites. The commission had to evaluate whether or not the Italian initiative was valid on both an internal and international level, so as to supply the Ministry of Research, which must choose how to direct the Italian space effort, with objective information. Now that the commission has supplied the preliminary information, the current situation makes it necessary to make a rapid decision, because a delay would provoke the annulment of the evaluations expressed. As a matter of fact the market for small launchers is developing rapidly and as well as various projects put forward by countries like Spain and Brazil that are far from the goal, there are others in the United States (such as those of the OSC [Orbital Sciences] and Lockheed) that have just arrived on the launching ramp, or that will arrive in 1994 and 1995. India is also testing its launcher and Japan has had one for years and is now developing one (the M-5) that is even more powerful. The French have also decided to do something, even if up to now they have not made any precise plans. We have lost two precious years. Another almost unproductive year would be fatal, as we would arrive too late on a market that had already been conquered by others. As far as the cost (estimated at about 400 billion lire) is concerned, it is evident that the best solution would be to involve foreign partners that would assure a reduction of the investment adapting it to the tightness of current budgets and also providing an increased force on the market. However, such adhesions need to be organized quickly so as to protect the primary role of the Italian space industry that must be involved in its entirety. Within the strategies that have already been indicated by Minister Colombo, the effort for the construction of a launcher could consolidate the potential that has already been expressed with success in the sector (by Ariane and IRIS [Italian Research Interim Stage]). This would guarantee acquiring a transport system for which there is already a certain amount of competition since it would have commercial spin-offs in the short term that cannot be ignored. It is precisely this aspect that would serve to balance the nature of the initiatives that have been supported up to now by the ASI, including telecommunications and scientific satellites, and the manned Columbus laboratory.
