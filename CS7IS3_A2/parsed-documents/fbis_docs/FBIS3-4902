"We have found out that the United States has made a substantial change in their schedule," an official at the Economic Planning Board said on Wednesday. For instance, he said, Washington now decided to lower semiconductor tariff by only 0.7 percentage points from the existing 3.7 percent to 3 percent whereas it earlier said they would completely lift tariff on semiconductor. About 110 items in the categories of electronics and non-ferrous metal would be re-examined by the Korean Government for possible change before its final schedule would be forwarded to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Secretariat early next week, the official said. During its recent trade talks with Japan, the United States declared they would withdraw the planned removal of tariffs in the areas of electronics, non-ferrous metal, lumber and distilled liquor. The declaration came after Japan said they would lower tariff on lumber by 5 percentage points from the present 8 percent to 3 percent instead of lifting tariff on lumber altogether. "Now that the United States has revised its market opening schedule, we intend to make a corresponding change," the official said. He added that so far 38 countries including the United States, Japan and the European Union (EC) have submitted their final schedules to the GATT.
