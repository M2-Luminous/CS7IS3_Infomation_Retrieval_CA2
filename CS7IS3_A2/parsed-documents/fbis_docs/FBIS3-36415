[Chubarov, in Russian fading into Ukrainian translation] We have always consistently opposed a referendum on the status of Crimea since such a referendum would be held according to the same mechanism as before, that is, following the will of the majority of the population. We understand that, generally speaking, it is a democratic norm. But the current majority of the Crimean population and its emergence on the peninsula has its peculiarities. That is why the Crimean Tatars have always opposed any kind of referendum here which would decide crucial matters of Crimea's development, ignoring the will of the indigenous people. That is why if the moratorium on referendums is lifted, I can definitely say that we will not take part in such a referendum. [passage omitted] [Marynenko] I asked the deputy chairman of the assembly whether they are relying on Kiev to protect Crimean Tatars if Meshkov does infringe on the legal interests of the Crimean Tatar people in Crimea. [Chubarov] Given the present situation and the present composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and the current president of Ukraine, there is no relying on that. The events of the past three years showed that Kiev took and continues to take an indulgent attitude toward separatists, hoping, perhaps, that it will somehow bring these forces closer and somehow will cool the separatist sentiments in Crimea. Time has proven, however, that this only encourages them. Therefore, given the present composition of the Ukrainian parliament, there is no hoping that Kiev will protect not only the interests of the Crimean Tatars but even its own state interests in Crimea in a more resolute, but legal, way. To fulfill Ukraine's state interests in Crimea and to solve the problems of Crimea is impossible today without solving the Crimea Tatar problem.
