FR940817-0-00014 FR940817-0-00007 Under an existing delegation order, ATF specialists issue label approvals and exemptions from label approvals for both domestic and imported products in the name of the Director. ATF is currently revising this delegation order to authorize specialists within the Product Compliance Branch to approve labels and grant exemptions in their own names. However, the regulations at 27 CFR 4.40(b), 5.51(b), and 7.31(b) specifically require that certificates of label approval (ATF Form 5100.31) bear the signature of the Director before imported alcoholic beverage products may be released from Customs custody. This Treasury decision will amend these regulations so that the Director may delegate to Product Compliance Branch specialists the authority to approve labels for imported products in their own names. Paperwork Reduction Act The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because no requirement to collect information is imposed. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) do not apply. Executive Order 12866 Because this is a rule of agency management, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. Administrative Procedure Act Because this final rule is a rule of agency management that merely redesignates signature authority for certificates of label approval, it is unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
