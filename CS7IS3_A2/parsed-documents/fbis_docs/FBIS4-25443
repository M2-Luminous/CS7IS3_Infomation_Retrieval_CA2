Journalists must adapt themselves to the needs of the new situation; endeavor to publicize Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; publicize the party and government's principles and policies; report news and disseminate information; reflect and guide public opinion; and give full play to its role as the ears, eyes, and mouthpiece of the party and the people. They must also promote the socialist market economy, socialist democracy and the legal system, and the socialist spiritual civilization; and must exert themselves in the struggle for accomplishing the grand goal of socialist modernization. Journalists must be devoted to the cause of socialist journalism; uphold the party's basic line; adhere to the orientation of serving the people and socialism; emancipate their minds and seek truth from facts; carry forward the fine tradition and style of journalism of the party and the people; oppose money-worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism; and step up the cultivation of professional ethics. I. Serving the People Wholeheartedly To serve the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental goal of Chinese journalism. Journalists, led by the party, should adhere to the correct direction in guiding public opinion, give play to their role as the bridge and link between the party and government and the masses, and persist in identifying their responsibilities toward the party and government with those toward the people. They should endeavor to report the party and government's policies and views to the masses promptly, accurately, and thoroughly; to provide news and information in order for the masses to fulfill their duties as masters of the country, to take part in political, economic, cultural, and social life, and to keep abreast of what is happening in the world; to laud the people's creativity and laborious achievements in socialist construction; and to correctly reflect the people's wishes, voices, and demands. They should support correct ideas and actions that conform with the people's interests; dare to criticize and expose erroneous statements and actions, and negative and corrupt phenomena that contravene the people's interests; and actively bring into play the role of public opinion in exercising supervision. They should carry out the mass work enthusiastically, maintaining close contacts with the masses, attaching importance to letters and visits from the people, properly handling their suggestions, criticisms, complaints, and crime-reporting letters and visits, and offering wide-ranging service activities for the people. II. Taking Social Benefit as the Supreme Criterion Journalists should correctly handle the relationship between social and economic benefits, giving top priority to social benefit, and achieving the unity between economic and social benefit under this basic premise. They should publicize patriotism, collectivism, and socialism through news, opinions, pictures, and audio and video products in order to mobilize and unite the Chinese people of all nationalities in dedicating themselves to the great undertaking of building up the motherland and rejuvenating the Chinese nation. They should adhere to the principle of positive publicity and hold themselves responsible to society and the masses, so as to help the expansion of productive forces of socialist society, the upholding of the four cardinal principles and the reform and opening up policy, the maintenance of social stability, and the enhancement of ideological and moral quality, and scientific and cultural standards of the entire Chinese nation. They should not advocate in news reports pornography, murder, violence, ignorance, superstitions, and other materials of vulgar taste to the detriment of the people's physical and mental health; and should foster forward-looking, healthy, civilized social practices. They should strictly follow the government's policies toward ethnic minorities and religion in news reports, safeguarding national interests and unity, and maintaining and promoting the motherland's reunification. III. Observing Laws and Discipline Journalists should conduct themselves within the scope of the Constitution and other laws, conscientiously observing the Constitution, other laws, and the discipline for publicity. They should steadfastly publicize and implement the party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies; they should not use the media in their control to publicize materials contrary to the party Central Committee's decisions. They should safeguard the citizens' rights as stipulated in the Constitution; they should neither slander other people nor violate their privacy. They should gather news through legitimate means, and should respect the views and lawful demands of people they interview. They should uphold judicial dignity. Before the court announces the verdict on a case heard by the judicial department, they should not carry biased reports to predetermine the nature or establish the crime of the case. Reports on cases heard publicly should conform with the judicial procedures. They should keep party, state, military, scientific and technological, financial, and commercial secrets, and take care to protect the state's interests and security. They should safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, as well as the rights to which they are entitled, including that of appeal. IV. Safeguarding the Truthfulness of News Truthfulness is the lifeblood of journalism. Journalists should seek truth from facts, go deep into the realities of life, go among the masses, and step up investigation and study. They may not make groundless accusations, imagine things, concoct stories, resort to deception, or distort facts for sensational effects. They should make every effort to look at a matter from all sides; guard against subjectivity, one-sidedness, and the practice of viewing things in absolute terms; and strive to ensure the overall or essential truthfulness of things. They should carry out work earnestly and responsibly, and avoid false reporting. In case of false reporting, they should assume responsibility on their own and take remedial measures. V. Upholding the Principle of Objectivity and Fairness Journalists should uphold dialectical and historical materialistic viewpoints, proceed from the people's fundamental interests, reflect things as they are, and ensure objectivity and fairness. In covering events, writing news stories, or filing news items, they may not be driven by selfish individual or small-group interests, may not vent their personal anger through the media under their control, and may not file unfair reports. They should implement the principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," respect scientific and practical approaches, and refrain from passing judgment at will or taking sides arbitrarily regarding controversial academic issues. VI. Maintaining the Work Style of Performing Official Duties Honestly Journalists should maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, conduct themselves honestly, exercise self-discipline, and conscientiously observe fiscal and economic discipline, as well as fiscal rules and regulations. They should overcome unhealthy practices in their trade. They may not publish or carry various forms of "paid news stories," trade news stories or newspaper space, demand gifts in cash or in kind, or seek personal gain. They may not accept cash gifts or negotiable securities in any form from the areas, units, or individuals they report. They should strictly distinguish journalistic affairs from operational matters. Reporters and editors may not engage in advertising or other operational activities in order to seek profit. They should maintain an industrious and thrifty work style. They may not make special demands on the areas or units they cover for material comforts or treatment accorded them. VII. Displaying the Spirit of Unity and Cooperation Giving scope to overall superiority through unity and cooperation is a major distinctive feature of socialist journalistic work. Journalists should be modest and eager to learn from the public, through practice, and from their colleagues. Fellow journalists should foster a relationship based on equality, unity, fraternal love, and mutual assistance; promote fair competition in their trade; and combat the practice of deliberately creating difficulties for colleagues or tarnishing colleagues' reputations in order to serve selfish individual or small-group interests. They should respect the copyrights of colleagues and other authors, and combat the practice of copying or plagiarizing the products of other people's labor. VIII. Enhancing Friendship and Cooperation With Press Circles in Other Countries News reporting should be geared toward enhancing understanding, friendship, and cooperation between people in various countries; respecting the sovereignty and national traditions of other countries; opposing hegemonism and power politics; safeguarding world peace; and promoting common development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. They should develop exchanges and cooperation with press circles in other countries, and show mutual respect and safeguard the dignity of the motherland and Chinese journalists during such contacts.
