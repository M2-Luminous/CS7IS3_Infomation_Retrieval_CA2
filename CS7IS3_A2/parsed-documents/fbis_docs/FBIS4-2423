President Li said: The Chinese communist authorities are killing our countrymen and behaving like bandits. Can such a government [zheng fu] be called a government? President Li said the Chinese people should have renounced such a regime [zheng quan] a long time ago. President Li stated: [begin Li recording] A large group of evil forces, (?with the support of) a party, have behaved like bandits. Look, they have killed many of our countrymen! Right? How can such a government be called a government? The people should have renounced it a long time ago! [end Li recording] President Li made this comment at a meeting with 336 township, town, and city mayors--a meeting sponsored by the Taiwan Provincial Government in Chung Hsing New Village. President Li stressed that while the Republic of China now enjoys the most democratic period and greatest freedom in its history, people in government offices should still understand that power comes from the people, and thus the government must properly accomplish all assignments entrusted by the people. People in high office should by no means think they have absolute power.
