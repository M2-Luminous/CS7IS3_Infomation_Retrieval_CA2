Hydrostatic pressure and leak tests (core is not critical): 0 1.a Fuel in the vessel <20% ASME Appendix G Limits (2) + 60 ○F. 1.b Fuel in the vessel >20% ASME Appendix G Limits (2)+90 ○F. 1.c No fuel in the vessel (Preservice Hydrotest Only) ALL (Not Applicable) (3)+60 ○F. 3 2. Normal operation (incl. heat-up and cool-down), including anticipated operational occurrences: 0 2.a Core not critical <20% ASME Appendix G Limits (2). 2.b Core not critical >20% ASME Appendix G Limits (2)+120 ○F (6). 2.c Core critical <20% ASME Appendix G Limits+40 ○F Larger of [(4)] or [(2)+40 ○F]. 2.d Core critical >20% ASME Appendix G Limits+40 ○F Larger of [(4)] or [(2)+160 ○F]. 2.e Core critical for BWR (5) <20% ASME Appendix G Limits+40 ○F (2)+60 ○F. (1)Percent of the preservice system hydrostatic test pressure. (2)The highest reference temperature of the material in the closure flange region that is highly stressed by the bolt preload. (3)The highest reference temperature of the vessel. (4)The minimum permissible temperature for the inservice system hydrostatic pressure test. (5)For boiling water reactors (BWR) with water level within the normal range for power operation. (6)Lower temperatures are permissible if they can be justified by showing that the margins of safety of the controlling region are equivalent to those required for the beltline when it is controlling.
