One of the groups to benefit most will be the private sector, said Yang Dakan of the State Planning Commission's Economic Research Institute. In an article in China Business Times he predicted sustained growth in the private sector, particularly among hi-tech enterprises who will also face ever-fiercer competition. The number of self-employed businesses (those with fewer than eight workers) will continue to grow, he said. He believes there will be 19 million self-employed businesses, a rise of 12 percent over 1993. They will take on 32 million workers, about 15 per cent more than last year. Their contracted capital will be 79 billion yuan ($9 billion), an increase of 35 percent over last year. And their retail sales volume will be about 200 billion yuan ($23 billion), compared with 140 billion yuan ($16 billion) last year. While self-employed businesses benefit the national economy, their bosses are feeling the pressure of increasingly fierce competition. Moreover, State and collectively-owned enterprises, growing more vigorous under the latest reforms, will also be a big challenge, said Yang. According to a survey conducted by the State Committee for Reconstructing the Economic System, people in the private sector said competition was their biggest challenge. The only way to survive the battle is to invest more in their businesses and improve the quality of their service. Yang believed self-employed business people will increase their in vestment to record levels in 1994. In the late 1980s, when the country's first individual businesses were founded, most were small street stalls or minor transporters. Since 1990, private investment has diversified and private scientific and technical service outlets have grown fast. This year many more of these businesses will be set up, said Yang. Half of the self-employed business people are concentrated on the east coast, with far fewer in the vast inland areas. The prospects for the country's private enterprises in 1994 are bright Yang said. His optimistic prediction is based on two facts. One is that some poorly-managed small State or collective-owned enterprises will be leased or sold to individuals. The second is that better-trained workers, especially hi-tech talents will enter the private business sector as the country's maturing labour market enables people to switch jobs. In 1994 there will be 370,000 private enterprises employing up to 5 million people, Yang predicted. Meanwhile, more hi-tech private enterprises (those with more than eight workers) will be set up as more people with higher education plunge into the private sector. The development of hi-tech enterprises must be backed by massive investment. The contracted investment of private enterprises will hit 200 billion yuan ($23 billion) this year, two and half times more than last year, said Yang. As a result, private hi-tech joint ventures and co-operation will boom. Increasing investment will produce increasing profits. Yang predicted the average assets of private enterprises will be 370,000 yuan ($42,000), and the average output value will rise to 100,000 yuan ($11,500) with an average sales volume of 70,000 yuan ($8,000). But while the private sector will be more flexible in management, a development gap is to emerge between the rich east and poor west, Yang said. In cities and towns, there will be 270,000 private enterprises by the end of 1994, doubling last year's figure, while 100,000 will be scattered in rural areas, only 20 percent more than 1993. Similarly, the imbalance between the east and west of the country will widen, Yang predicted.
