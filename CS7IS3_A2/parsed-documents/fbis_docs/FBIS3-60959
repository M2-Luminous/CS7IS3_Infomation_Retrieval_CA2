This observation attracted attention when one of the shaykhs of Hizballah took it upon himself to change the significance that is associated with the life of [Imam] Husayn by presenting that life without mentioning the name of Imam Husayn or any member of his family. Not even Karbala' was mentioned. Instead, the person who was conducting the aforementioned memorial service proceeded to relate the story of al-Ghubayri incident in a mournful stammer, replacing the term, nonbelievers, with the term, Lebanese regime. Instead of speaking about Karbala', he spoke about al-Ghubayri and about the casualties of that demonstration. He spoke about the demonstration, which occurred early this month in 1993 instead of speaking about Imam Husayn and the martyrs who supported him and who lost their lives approximately more than 1,000 years ago. This is actually the first time in the history of political, Shiite Islamic movements that an infringement is made upon what Shiites consider a sacred ritual, one that is always performed on all their religious occasions. That ritual is performed every year on the occasion of `Ashura.' In this sense the life of Husayn is read in a mournful tone to offer oneself consolation, to seek a blessing and a reward, and, at the same time, to stir the emotions by arousing feelings of affection for al-Husayn and for members of his family. When presented in this manner Imam Husayn's life and its significance constitute an important part of the Shiites' heritage, that heritage in which the political and the social are to a certain extent mixed with the religious. Accordingly, changing the significance of Husayn's life in the manner that occurred during the memorial service for the victims of the al-Ghubayri incident is considered reprehensible according to the standard Shiite Islamic practice in this regard. After all, a large segment of Shiite Muslims still refuse to make any change, even in the manner in which a memorial service is conducted. It is known that the aim of those who have been calling for change in the manner in which memorial services are conducted is to highlight the significance of these occasions by adopting an up-to-date manner. But the irony here lies in the fact that Hizballah has always taken a hard-line position, opposing all those calling for change, even those advocating that the gory ritual be changed so that the essence of the occasion can be presented in a new way. Now, however, Hizballah is boldly infringing on the essence of these occasions with one of its shaykhs [religious elders] presenting the life of Husayn during the aforementioned memorial service without making any mention whatsoever of either Imam Husayn or Karbala'. Hizballah's action appears to be bold. Not only does it suggest that Hizballah has the legal and moral right to put its casualties on an equal par with the martyrs of Karbala', but it also has the legal and moral right to regard the al-Ghubayri incident an occasion in its own right equivalent to the Karbala' incident. Accordingly, Hizballah's actions suggest that the party would have no objection to adding the al-Ghubayri incident to those traditions, which are considered sacred by Shiite Muslims. And yet, does Hizballah have the right to take such actions, which suggest that it has not only "the right" to impose a political point of view, but also "the right" to attach to it the religious justifications for making it sacred? Is it right for Hizballah to require not only the party's followers but also all Shiite Muslims to comply with that point of view? In the past Hizballah introduced some political slogans into the Husayniyahs [buildings where Shiites gather for the recital of the sufferings of the Imams], which are recited by Shiite Muslims in Lebanon in an Iranian, not an Arabic accent. And yet, none of the incidents that the party had encountered in the past were placed on an equal footing with the battle of Karbala'. The al-Ghubayri incident was, however, when the life of Husayn was unabashedly incorporated into that incident. The party's leaders, who know quite well the standing that Husayn's life has in the hearts and minds of the Shiite public, found no difficulty in doing that. There is no doubt that the party deliberately wanted to show that Shiites in Lebanon were confused about the difference between the implication of infringing upon the party's standing and that of infringing upon the standing of Karbala'. Hizballah wants to use this "confusion" to create the illusion or to suggest that contradicting the party will be tantamount to contradicting the Shiite Islamic sect in its entirety and not only Hizballah. The party also wants to suggest that it is not possible to contemplate the military elimination of Hizballah because Hizballah, the underdog, will be around and will be coming around every year and assuming crisis proportions, just as the death of Imam al-Husayn in Karbala' comes up every year and is also mentioned on every Shiite occasion. An Incurable Disease It seems clear that Hizballah's aim in pursuing such conduct is ultimately to cover itself in a Shiite Islamic cloak in an attempt to make itself appear larger than it really is. The question of Hizballah in Lebanon would then become a Shiite question and not a fundamentalist one or a partisan one. The notion of what lies behind this approach seems to be the crisis, which Hizballah is going through at this stage during which circumstances around the party are changing and threatening to make the party useless from the point of view of all which had hitherto justified its existence. Such a crisis would have severe psychological effects on Hizballah similar to those that would be endured by a patient who senses that his disease is incurable and that his days are numbered. Hizballah is actually experiencing such psychological sentiments, and these sentiments are growing every day and after each new incident. They are pointing out that the region is moving closer to the point of putting yesterday's Arab-Israeli conflict behind it in a manner that falls short of what is required on the possibilities of a rapprochement between Iran and Washington and also on the matter of extending the reach and range of the state in Lebanon. The problem with Hizballah is that it is the product of these equations. Its significance and its role are also in part products of interactions among these equations. That is why Hizballah and the part it has been playing will undoubtedly drop out of the picture when these equations become history. In this regard the most dangerous matter facing this party is the fact that its internal makeup and its ideological concepts prevent it from renewing itself intellectually and organizationally in a manner that would make it a viable party in the new stage that is coming. The party would then have a new role to play and a new approach to take, both of which would be compatible with the spirit and the prospects of the new stage. For Hizballah renewal would mean abandoning its origins, and that means becoming a party without an identity. In the best of cases Hizballah would become another version of the Amal Movement, and it is known here that a second Amal Movement is not needed here on the Shiite Islamic scene. But even if Hizballah were to succeed in renewing its performance and its ideology--and that is an optimistic assumption--it would be exposing itself to violent internal upheaval that would lead to its dissolution and breakup, as its original component parts move away from each other within the party. Hizballah would once again revert to groups made up of small independent tendencies. Among these groups, for example, would be the al-Da'wah Party, Fadlallah's group, the group, which has security ties with Iran, and so on. Generally speaking then, the party would face dissolution and disintegration, and that means it would cease to exist. Faced with all these probabilities, the best of which signifies the dissolution and demise of Hizballah, leaders of the party are trying during this 11th hour to do something extraordinary to avoid that destiny. Their actions in this regard, however, have been so tense and nervous that they believe that everything that is taking place around them can be regarded as a conspiratorial political plan against Hizballah. On the basis of such suspicions, which are like the hypochondria that often afflicts elderly patients and those who are on their death beds, the party cannot become convinced that after being fattened for the past 11 years--the time during which it was exploited politically--it will be prepared for slaughter and sacrificed soon like a sheep on the altar of the settlement, on the altar of a new stage of relations in the region, or on the altar of relations between the region and international powers. It is this sentiment that explains why the party sees any dispute between it and the state as an attempt by the latter to liquidate it. It is known that the threat of Hizballah's liquidation comes neither from the state nor from any other internal party, but rather from the nature of its organizational and political makeup. And that was one of the tools that Hizballah used during the foregoing stage. But when the sun does set on the last act of that stage in the region, it will also set on all its effects and its entire rationale. There are observers who believe that there is a tendency within Hizballah's leadership, which realizes that the party's crisis stems from the nature of the challenges of the coming stage, a stage that rejects Hizballah's role and makeup. And yet that tendency is trying to conceal that fact so that it can prolong the party's life. It is trying to create within the party's ranks a passive unity that is not based on "harmony within the party." Instead, that passive unity draws its lifeblood from the assumption that "what is outside the party is to be feared." That is why this tendency is magnifying the sense that exists primarily within the party at this stage, and that sense is that there is an enemy lying in wait for the party. This tendency is magnifying the sense that the party is also being targeted by a conspiracy. This tendency is counting on getting the party's ranks and all its groups preoccupied with the subject of security and that of getting ready to confront "the other." That would keep them from devoting their attention to the new conditions around them and subjecting those conditions to scrutiny and analysis. After all, such scrutiny and analysis, should they take place, would create within the party a debate, which the party's current leadership would not be able to contain. Such scrutiny and analysis would also expedite the internal dissolution of the party because in facing the question about the party's destiny rather than any other tactical or supplemental question, each one of the centers of power within the party will be trying to apply pressure to the others so that its own view might prevail, become the view that the other centers of power must adhere to, and provide it and the party with a way out. In pressing its point of view, each center of power will indicate that it will drop out of the party if its point of view is not adhered to. These centers of power say that they will walk away from the party since they do not have to stay in it simply because the other powers in the party have a different point of view. They say they will not wait voluntarily for what is thought will be the party's liquidation. Postponing such a discussion under the pretext of having the party devote itself to getting ready to confront outside conspiracies is actually tantamount to pursuing a policy, which cannot be pursued indefinitely. Having conceded that, postponing this discussion is nevertheless considered an ideal policy for the party in its current position, given the nature of the party's principal character and leader, namely, Sayyid Husayn Nasrallah. Although the vast majority of Hizballah's members and cadres who had been Nasrallah's partners in intense field work have confidence in his approach to security and organization, the party's elders do not have that much confidence in him. Even those who like to use theological standards in dealing with him do not have much confidence in him. It is this quality that is associated with the secretary general of Hizballah that makes the matter of starting an intellectual, political discussion related to jurisprudence within the party a precarious step, given the absence of a leader who can make an intellectually decisive statement. And yet, having the party confront security deadlines at this stage requires that its organizational readiness be upgraded, and that is consistent with Sayyid Nasrallah's capabilities because the party has confidence in the skills he has in this regard. Running Away to the Imam And yet, running away from the problem to the imam within the party is countered in some segments by a clear inclination to think calmly and deliberately about what the party has to do to get out of its crisis safely. These segments that are affiliated with Hizballah, especially those that have funds, are of the opinion that the party has to be diligent in [its efforts] to acquire Shiite characteristics so that fundamentalism in Lebanon and the new, rising political Shiism would become synonymous. Thus, it would become impossible for any internal or external power to think of doing away with fundamentalism in Lebanon as it is represented by Hizballah, because to think along those lines would be like thinking about doing away with a sect, not a [political] party. To think along those lines would endanger the fundamental balance of the country, not just one number in a political game. There are several reasons why making this equation workable in the material world does not appear to be easy. Most important, there is the Amal Movement whose presence represents a dominant Shiite tendency, on the one hand, and a substantial national tendency, on the other. There is, therefore, a bold line of distinction between rising political Shiism, as represented by Amal, and partisan fundamentalism, which can be found among Shiites, as represented by Hizballah. Although these facts are keeping Shiites from becoming a rising fundamentalist [movement] in Lebanon, providing Hizballah with a cover or a religious front, their importance is not diminished by the fact that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan, the distinguished Ja'fari mufti, linked what Hizballah might face to what is being planned for Shiite Muslims as a sect in Lebanon. He made that link in the speech he delivered at the memorial service for the victims of the al-Ghubayri incident. In the eyes of the vast majority of Shiites this link will appear to be emotional and unjustified. In fact, what Shaykh Qabalan said is being thoughtlessly cited in a manner that would move Shiites in Lebanon to become a sect-like entity whose existence will be contingent upon new and developing political factors. And yet, what must be believed is that the presence of Shiites in Lebanon is not the subject of a wager about whether a new political incident will or will not occur. It is instead something that has to do with the survival of Lebanon as an entity. The presence of Shiites in Lebanon is something that draws its lifeblood from matters that go beyond changing and alternating political equations, no matter how far-reaching these equations might be. At any rate, Hizballah, for a variety of reasons that have to do with its interests, will be compelled to apply pressure so that it can protect itself behind a Shiite front. Furthermore, there is a tendency within Hizballah that is trying to open its doors to other Islamic and Christian Lebanese sects. Proponents of that tendency are of the opinion that at this stage the party has to abandon the shrill positions it has been taking in Lebanon so that it can become a Lebanese party rather than a fundamentalist party, which can be attacked easily. And yet that approach continues to be weak because of the party's makeup, role, and hardline concepts, all of which have been reviewed above. Two Possibilities While proposals within Hizballah for the party's development and renewal continue to be tantamount to cries in the wilderness, those within the party who have more influence are those who lay out the choices for the situation in the future, using the same standards, which the party has been using to weigh the positions that it must take. The standards that are being referred to here are those which attempt to play the game of regional considerations, particularly as they manifest themselves in Iran. Accordingly, proponents of that way of thinking who have the lion's share of influence on the party's decisions argue about which one of two possible occurrences is more likely. The first possible occurrence involves Tehran and Ankara. Recently, it became evident to both Iran and Turkey that Soviet Asia will not become the new area where they can exercise their regional influence because the republics in that section of Asia continue to look at Russia as their big brother who can solve their problems. Accordingly, Tehran and Ankara, particularly Tehran, will find themselves compelled to intensify the process by means of which their regional policies would be steered toward the Arab East and concentrated there. That will breathe new life once again into Hizballah as a factor in Iran's foreign policy that is to be weighed in. Consequently, the party will have new regional reasons to help it surmount the dividing line of having its role terminated in the coming stage. The second possible occurrence is one that can be noted with pleasure, but it is one that calls for reservation and caution. This is because Iran could be persuaded with regional gains or with desperately needed economic gains, provided its foreign policies in the region are held in check. If Iran is persuaded by these temptations, Tehran might either tell Hizballah to take a step backwards, or it might cut it off and let it face its destiny all by itself. But why would Tehran respond now to temptations such as those that have already been mentioned? In answering that question proponents of the second possible occurrence in Hizballah say that there are several reasons why Tehran would respond to these temptations. Most important, economic conditions in Iran are deteriorating, and there is a desperate need for foreign assistance. Actually, Japan has been playing an active role for quite some time to persuade Iran to accept the following proposition: Tokyo will try to help Iran internationally by persuading the West to ease the blockade placed around Iran. [Toyko said] "You, Iranians, however, will have to help us prove that you have abandoned those foreign policies that provoke the United States of America." It seems that Tehran has been trying, even as we speak, to deal with this Japanese proposition with much attention. It is going along with it little by little. However, the prime minister of Japan recently approached Iranian leaders and spoke to them courteously. He told them, "If you want the assistance we give you to be more effective in ending the undeclared international blockade against you, you will have to refrain from actions that oppose the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement." And now the Japanese are waiting for Iran's answer, and the answer that Iran will give Tokyo will be one that we, of course, will not hear. If Iran's answer is "yes," that will undoubtedly mean that Hizballah has lost the basic dimension it has had in the region for a decade. During that time that dimension has been the secret of Hizballah's survival. When that time comes, Hizballah may find that the only thing it can do to serve its own purpose is to proclaim the slogan, "Death to Japan."
