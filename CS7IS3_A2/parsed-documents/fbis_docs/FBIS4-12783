V. Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--A senior Turkish official held high-level talks here Monday [11 April] on the Middle East peace process and bilateral relations and said later Ankara attaches much importance to developing economic cooperation among the countries of the Middle East. Ozdem Sanberk, under-secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, said his talks here also covered the strife in former Yugoslavia as well as the implications for Turkey and Jordan of the continuing international sanctions against Iraq. "Since Jordan plays a crucial role in the ongoing Middle East peace process, the Jordanian side elaborated in detail this particular issue," Mr. Sanberk told the Jordan Times after talks with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan. Describing the talks as very fruitful, the Turkish official said there were "no problems whatsoever between Turkey and Jordan on the bilateral level," and that "we noted with satisfaction that our visas concerning the international as well as regional issues are widely coverging." [sentence as published] The Jordan News Agency, Petra, said Minister al-Hasan and Mr. Sanberk reviewed progress in the peace process and the implementation of U.N. Security council resolutions 242 and 338. Mr. al-Hassan briefed Mr. Sanberk on the continued siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah and reaffirmed Jordan's call for an end to the damaging inspections of all ships bound for Jordan. In his interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Sanberk restated his country's stand that Iraq should abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions. "Iraq must adopt a clear stand to give confidence to her neighbour Kuwait," he said. At the same time, he said, the embargo on Iraq continues to hurt the people of Iraq. "It has also created a very heavy economic burden for Turkey," said the official, whose country has been calling for an easing of the sweeping 44-month-old international sanctions against its neighbour. "The same problem also exists for Jordan," he said of the impact of the sanctions. "We hope that the point for lifting the embargo would be reached soon. Cooperation between Iraq and the U.N. must be intensified to this end. "The U.N. long-term monitoring programme (of Iraq's weapons) must be put fully into practice without delay and be effectively implemented in order that the oil embargo is lifted," he said. Answering a question, the Turkish official said the outcome of recent municipal elections in Turkey where Islamic activisits put up a strong showing had no impact on the secular principles that the country was founded on. "in the modern Turkey founded by Ataturk, Turks are devout, as always, and the religion is perceived as an individual choice, an individual realisation of oneself," he said. "Islam is not reduced in its political dimentions and... the results (of the elections) reflect not the religious expression of the individuals but their political preferenes within the normal functioning of a multiparty democratic system," Mr. Sanberk said. He said Turkey, which is waging a war against the separatist Kurdish Labour Party (PKK) in the southeast, wanted "her partners and neighbours to abide by their commitments not to give shelter to those who resort to indiscriminate separatist violence." The official conceded that the Kurdish problem has led to disputes between Turkey and some of the European countries which have accused Ankara of violating human rights in its battle agaisnt the PKK. But, he said, several countries have in Europe as well as the U.S. itself "declared (the PKK) a terrorist organisation," and France and Germany had banned PKK activities in their territories. "It is obvious that terrorism is a gross violation of human rights and is aimed at the same time at the destruction of fundamental aspects of freedom and democracy," he said. Mr. Sanberk said Turkey expects the Middle East peace process to create a better atmosphere for regional economic cooperation. In this a context, he said, a "peace pipeline" project--which will bring Turkish water to the Gulf states and others in the region--"is still on the table." "It can only be materialised should the countries of the region see its realisation in their interest and effectively participate in their realisation," added Mr. Sanberk, in an apparent reference to the financing needed for the project. When it was first proposed several years ago, the project was estimated to cost about $12 billion. Revised estimates put the cost at between $15 million and $20 million [numbers as published]. In Ankara on Monday, visiting Israeli Foreign Miniter Shimon Peres said Turkish and Israeli experts would look into the possibility of various projects for the shipment of water from Turkey to Israel. One idea is that water from Manavgat River could be carried in plastic containes and floated on the Mediterranean to Israel.
