It is understood that of the 468 investigation and study projects launched by the municipality last year, 352, or 75.2 percent, had been completed by the end of the year. Of these, more than 90 percent have been used in actual work. Leaders of Beijing Municipality took the lead in undertaking investigations and study. Last year, Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing municipal party committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan conducted investigations and study on more than 30 occasions in various districts, counties, universities, colleges, institutions, factories, mines, shops, and remote villages in rural areas. They familiarized themselves with local situations; handled official business on the spot; asked questions directly; and examined, amended, approved, and passed on investigation reports. Motivated by the leaders, all leading cadres in various departments, districts, and counties took the initiative to undertake projects and participated in investigations and study. Most departments used the investigation and study results as the criterion for evaluating cadres' performance of their duties. Some units even established a cadres' investigations and study responsibility system for inspecting and supervising cadres' work on a regular basis. A key factor of Beijing's fruitful results in conducting investigation and study lies in the combination of leaders with the rank and file and professionals with the masses. Relevant departments under the municipal committee worked concertedly with counties and districts in carrying out key municipal investigations and study projects. While conducting investigations and study for their long-term development plans, Xicheng, Dongcheng, Congwen, and Haidian Districts invited experts and scholars from scientific research institutes and universities to tackle key problems together. In this way, they complemented each other with their knowledge and improved the quality of investigation and study results. Beijing Municipality also persistently geared investigations and study to serve policymaking and trouble-shooting purposes. In choosing investigation and study topics, the municipality emphasized the pertinence and timeliness of projects. As a result, most projects were related to improving work to a higher level or solving difficult and hot issues. While applying investigation and study results, the emphasis was put on investigating and solving problems at the same time. The municipal foreign economic and trade department, in view of declining foreign trade and exports in the first quarter last year, promptly organized investigations and put forward and implemented immediately six countermeasures, thus stopping the decline in exports and increasing exports by 12.3 percent last year, the highest in history. The municipal urban construction department, based on citizens' reports on problems existing in transportation and the city appearance, conducted investigations and study and put forward 10 suggestions for comprehensive improvement. Implementation of these suggestions has brought about initial successes. Haidian District conducted investigations and study focused on ways to scale new heights in the new technology and industrial development and experiment zone, and summed up questions in the fields of capital, qualified personnel, and development space, thereby helping the municipal government formulate relevant policies.
