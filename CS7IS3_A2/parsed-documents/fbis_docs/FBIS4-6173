FBIS4-6173 "dreas075bb_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 INTER-ASIAN AFFAIRS ASEAN Officials Prepare First Regional Forum ASEAN Officials Prepare First Regional Forum BK1704122494 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 17 Apr 94 p A2 BK1704122494 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION English BFN [Text] Senior officials of ASEAN will meet in Phatthaya a week tomorrow to discuss remaining matters concerning the forthcoming first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok. The senior officials are expected to agree during the three-day meeting on the structure and formalities concerning the Forum as well as agendas for discussion. They will also discuss preparations for the 27th ASEAN Ministerial Meetings (AMM) to be held for two days immediately prior to the Regional Forum, which is scheduled for July 25. Should all matters not be decided on during the meeting in Phatthaya, the officials will meet again next month prior to the preparatory meeting set for May 23 and 25 for the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC), according to a senior ASEAN official. The annual PMC meeting, which includes ASEAN states and their seven dialogue countries, will be held on July 26 and 27 following the ARF. At a previous round of ASEAN senior officials' preparatory meetings in March, three issues were proposed for discussion at the Forum. They were: Asia-Pacific security now and in the future, confidence building measures and preventive diplomacy. According to the official, Indonesian officials will be asked during the meeting in Phatthaya to elaborate on how to frame the discussion on preventive diplomacy. There was also a proposal that a group of "eminent persons" or a committee could be set up to follow up on issues being discussed so they could be proposed at the next ARF. The official added that there could be new proposals concerning how to make the ARF more meaningful. He did not elaborate. Senior officials at the Phatthaya meeting will also have a working lunch with ASEAN-based Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) to discuss new ARF input from the academic institution. The first ASEAN-ISIS meeting was held in Singapore last year. The senior officials however already agreed that the ARF Forum will be attended by foreign ministers from 18 countries comprising the six ASEAN states, seven ASEAN dialogue countries, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea as ASEAN observers and China and Russia as ASEAN guests. The ministers could each be accompanied in the meeting by either one senior officer or one interpreter. They also agreed that the Forum should aim first at promoting confidence building and that the topic of discussion should neither be too broad nor too restrictive and the discussion neither too academic nor too light. The Forum, they agreed, should rather make all participants comfortable enough to speak out. Such an atmosphere in itself will encourage candid discussions that will lead to the realization of the meeting's aspiration for confidence building. They also agreed in principle to the concept of a UN Arms Register in response to the Philippines' proposal on setting up a Regional Arms Registry as a means to promote confidence. The Phatthaya meeting is unlikely to further elaborate on such a proposal, however, the same official said. Concerning the AMM meeting, Burma will be attending as the guest of the host, Thailand, and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, as current chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, will convey this message when he visits Rangoon on Tuesday and Wednesday. A Thai source yesterday said discussion among ASEAN members about Burma's participation could be open-ended depending on developments inside Burma, despite the initial ASEAN consensus on Rangoon's participation. Cambodia will be attending the AMM meeting as ASEAN's special guest. Thailand might call for an ASEAN approach to the current situation in Cambodia, the source said without elaborating.
