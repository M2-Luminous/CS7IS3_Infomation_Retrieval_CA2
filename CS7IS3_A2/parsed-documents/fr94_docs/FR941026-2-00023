Take notice that on October 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso) tendered for filing and acceptance, pursuant to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act certain restated tariff sheets. El Paso states the tendered tariff sheets restate the take-or-pay Throughput Surcharge and Direct Bill amounts for the period from March 1, 1990 through July 31, 1994 in order to remove certain ineligible costs required by Commission orders issued on June 16, 1994 at Docket No. RP90&hyph;81&hyph;00, et al., and Docket No. RP91&hyph;26&hyph;000, et al. The restated Transportation Statement of Rates tariff sheets are included in Original Volume No. 1&hyph;A, First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A, Second Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A, and Third Revised Volume No. 2 of El Paso's FERC Gas Tariff. The restated Direct Bill amounts are included in First Revised Volume No. 1 and Second Revised Volume No. 1. El Paso states that it is requesting waiver of the notice requirement of Section 154.22 of the Commission Regulations pursuant to Section 154.51 to permit the tendered tariff sheets to become effective on their indicated dates. El Paso states that no party will be adversely affected by the waiver since El Paso is merely restating tariff sheets to reflect revised rates for previously effective periods. El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's affected interstate pipeline system customers and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
