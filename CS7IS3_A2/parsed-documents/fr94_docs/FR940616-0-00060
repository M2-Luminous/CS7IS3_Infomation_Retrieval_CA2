FR940616-0-00060 FR940616-0-00009 §1.1109 Form of payment. (a) Fee payments should be in the form of a check, bank draft, on money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications Commission or by a Visa or MasterCard credit card. No other credit card is acceptable. Fees for applications and other filings paid by credit card will not be accepted unless the credit card section of FCC Form 159 is completed in full. The Commission discourages applicants from submitting cash and will not be responsible for cash sent through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as deficient. Third party checks ( i.e., checks with a third party as maker or endorser) will not be accepted. (1) Specific procedures for electronic payment will be announced by Public Notice. Applicants must submit a written request to the Commission for authorization to make electronic payments of a fee for applications and other filings, as follows. (2) No electronic payment of an application fee will be accepted unless the payor has obtained the written authorization of the Commission to submit application fees electronically. It is the responsibility of the payor to insure that any electronic payment is made in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures will result in the return of the application or other filing and the fee payment. (3) Payments by wire transfer will be accepted. Prior to making a payment by wire, the payor shall obtain the approval of the Managing Director or his designee. A completed FCC Form 159 shall be submitted to the Managing Director or his designee prior to initiating the wire transfer. * * * * * (d) The Commission may require payment of fees with a cashier's check upon notification to an applicant or filer or prospective group of applicants under the conditions set forth below in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section. (1) Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or organization has made payment, on one or more occasions with a payment instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and such failure is not excused by bank error. (2) The Commission will notify the party in writing that future payments must be made by cashier's check until further notice. If, subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by cashier's check, the party's payment will not be accepted and its application or other filing will be returned. * * * * * (f) The Commission will furnish a stamped receipt of an application only upon request. In order to obtain a stamped receipt for an application (or other filing), the application package must include a copy of the first page of the application, clearly marked ``copy'', submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should be the top document in the package. The copy will be date-stamped immediately and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the date stamped copy of the application. No remittance receipt copies will be furnished. 8. Newly designated §1.1110 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §1.1110 Filing locations.
