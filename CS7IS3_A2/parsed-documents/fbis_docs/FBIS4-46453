That Is the Possible Result of Budget Cuts"] [Text] Recently our newspaper has repeatedly addressed the problem of financing defense expenditure. We have done this by no means out of corporate or lobby interests, but because we are convinced that only a profoundly indifferent and incompetent person could stand by and observe the way in which, on the pretext of demilitarizing the country and converting military production, the actual destruction of the Army and Navy and simultaneously of the economy itself is taking place. Why of the economy? Because once again the idea that all economic matters can be rectified at the Armed Forces' expense is being trotted out. In the four years in which politicians and economists have diligently put it into effect, this idea has become fairly decrepit and has brought no improvements to people's lives. And, although expressed in 1990 prices, the military budget has "slimmed down" to half its size, the situation both in the Army and the economy has deteriorated. It would seem to be high time to abandon this approach toward budget procurements and to look at things realistically. But this kind of enthusiasm cannot be observed in our economic departments. It is much easier to cross out one figure on paper and put down another -- slightly smaller -- one than, say, to properly organize tax collection so that the budget's income element increases rather than catastrophically decreases. Thus, according to Economy Ministry data, in the first quarter the federal budget received 3.4 trillion rubles [R] less than expected in taxes and dues. Naturally, the Finance Ministry never has any money. Furthermore, financing military expenditure only to the extent that the empty treasury purse is filled, as has been the practice recently, is also directly damaging the country's economy. For this reason, the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Military Budget and Financing Main Directorate has estimated that nonproduction expenditure in 1993 totaled R870 billion, which again required an increase in the defense budget. How is this sum made up? The Defense Ministry was forced to pay over R490 billion because scheduled deadlines for paying for ordered output were broken, bank credits obtained by supplier enterprises and included in the cost of military output came to R306 billion, penalties for late payment for transport services totaled R37 billion.... In the past year the financing of the draft Russian Federation Law "On the State Budget for 1994," which preserves the level of defense expenditure proposed by the government, has created a ludicrous situation in the Army and Navy. The sum of R37.1 trillion represents a mere 42 percent of the requirement, and this money could be enough only to pay personnel. There can be no question of paying the defense complex, building housing, etc. In short, this sum cannot actually be apportioned to sections of the military budget. Therefore, it has never been seriously discussed. At one time the Finance Ministry officially evaluated the draft military budget at R55.5 trillion. Even this compromise level of appropriations, enabling the Army to survive somehow, requires considerable adjustment of the state defense order approved by the Russian Federation Government in December, including for housing for servicemen, not to mention a reduction of the range and volume of weapons and equipment being purchased. The military budget is now 60 percent "social" in its structure, and further cuts in it will inevitably hit people who as it is do not have sufficient guarantees regarding their daily lives. In these conditions the Russian Federation Government, without coordinating with the Defense Ministry, is submitting to the Duma a draft law on suspending a number of articles of the Law on the Status of Servicemen, and is attempting to abolish privileges which have existed since prewar times. How is this to be viewed? If we closely analyze what makes up the remaining 40 percent of defense expenditure, it is evident that it contains a considerable volume of enforced expenditure not directly associated with military activity. Over R3 trillion, for example, is required for the withdrawal of troops from foreign countries near and far and for providing them with amenities in a new location. It requires considerable expenditure to maintain a state of emergency in "hot spots" and to carry out peacekeeping activity within the former USSR. The military budget is being used to maintain space centers, the air traffic safety service, hydrographic and air navigation services, lighthouses, and much else that not only the Armed Forces but the entire country needs. After all, this comes to trillions of rubles, and an adjustment for them should also be made in the budget. But, even taking the annual budget of R37.1 trillion, the Defense Ministry is not currently being given the full volume of funding -- as of 15 May it had already received R4.5 trillion less than it should have. While the military department owed a total of R6 trillion for the period January-April. An impressive figure, it cannot be denied. But this is not what gives rise to serious alarm -- the lack of resources makes it impossible to properly prepare compounds for winter and transport all the essentials to Far North areas. Operational and combat training of troops and maintenance of the material base and military equipment are being disrupted. Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly drawn the attention of the government and parliamentarians to the fact that it is necessary to find a solution regarding this year's budget without harming the country's defense capability. But his instruction of 3 March 1994 has still not been implemented. On 6 May the president supported an amendment to the draft budget made by the State Duma Defense Committee and envisaging an increase of the "National Defense" item to R55 trillion. One wants to believe that this figure will find support among State Duma deputies when the federal budget is finally approved. This level of appropriations will not, of course, solve all the Armed Forces' problems, but at least it will make it possible to avoid many minor and major misfortunes which are knocking increasingly loudly at the door....
