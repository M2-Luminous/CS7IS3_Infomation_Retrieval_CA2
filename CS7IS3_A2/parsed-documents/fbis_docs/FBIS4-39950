[Begin recording] [Marynenko] Esteemed Valeriy Mykolayovych, talking about the Black Sea Fleet, you will probably agree with me that this problem conventionally, as it were, falls into two categories: Strictly speaking, these are the ships and the infrastructure. This, at any rate, is how the mass media have lately been reporting on all those problems associated, I would like to underline, with the Black Sea Fleet. But, once again, I have analyzed reports by the mass media, you know, and have (somehow) come to the conclusion that the issue of the ships also conventionally falls into two categories: While earlier we spoke of the ships as having already been divided, we now say that ships have already been counted, with so many to belong to Russia and so many to belong to Ukraine after the division of the Black Sea Fleet. I would like you to clarify the situation with regard to the above problem, please. [Shmarov] I think there are somewhat more problems than those enumerated by you. [passage indistinct] I would like to return for a while to the origins of this issue and recall that the negotiations have been held since 15 April when the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement on this issue, where it was noted that the navies should be separated within (quite) a short time. [passage omitted] As for the problems, problem number one is, (undoubtedly), the amphibious means, or ships. Problem number two is, certainly, the infrastructure that you mentioned, i.e. the (fleet's) shore infrastructure and everything that is land-based, in this particular case, on the territory of Crimea, with all the Black Sea Fleet's property being considered such as the land-based airfields, communications and combined-arms units, marines, and machinery that belongs to these arms of service. This is a very large number of complex facilities. The third problem, I would say, is -- now, in addition to what you named -- the problem of the (status of) bases, i.e. the problem of bases and (the status) of bases. [passage indistinct] The fourth problem, I would say, is the problem of the people who are now serving on board ships and in (inland) facilities. They are today provisionally subordinate to the two presidents, i.e. (subordinate) to two states and (are within) two states. Today, however, their living conditions are more or less (stationary), stable, while what we are proposing they do tomorrow is something else, which again is quite a problem. [passage indistinct] As for broad coverage of this and large-scale (advertisements) of our achievements, we agreed with the Russian delegation not to make any general statements and not to provide information for the general public, because what we have done by now concerns people and today, when we have not finished yet and have no final decision signed by the presidents, [to provide that information] would be (like jumping the gun). So until then, no doubt, we have no right to cause anxiety among the people. [passage indistinct] I can say, however, that, indeed, we have already carried out the final division of the fleet. I mean the final division, rather than making a list. We proceeded from the fact that we must form two fleets, rather than just splitting up materiel according to the principle of accountancy, as it were, with the remainder of the value being calculated etc. (Instead), we for quite a long time have been working to create two fleets, two forces, and I would not say it was simple. We believe that those forces must jointly ensure both the security of Ukraine (in the south) and, undoubtedly, the security of Russia and its (strategic) interest in that theater or that basin, no doubt communicating with each other, undoubtedly so. I think that their future is a joint strategic mission. [passage indistinct] The main position of ours on this issue is this: First, our unalterable principle is that everything that is on the territory and soil of Ukraine and the territory of (Crimea) is the property of Ukraine. We acted in accordance with that principle from the outset of the negotiations [words indistinct] and we cannot offer anything other than that, because this is what is required by our laws and this is how our state wants it today. That is our property. [passage omitted] [Marynenko] Does the Russian side realize how much renting this infrastructure, that you once again said belongs to Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, will cost? [Shmarov] I do not think it does in terms of specific figures, because it was not practiced in the former union. [passage omitted] Now, as for the bases. It is a common secret that the bases of the Russian Navy and those of the Ukrainian Navy are the stumbling block at these negotiations. At the first stage, Russia unconditionally pushed for Ukraine to base its Navy in Odessa or Nikolayev and that was that. They did not even want to talk about Crimea. Understanding the importance of these negotiations and searching for ways of resolving this problem by peaceful means, as it were, i.e. by way of negotiations, the Ukrainian side, on the other hand, after all, consented that, all right, let Sevastopol be the Russian Navy base. At the same time, however, Ukraine proposed that other bases in that very Crimea belong to Ukraine. [Marynenko] Tell me please, at this meeting with the Russian side, was understanding reached, as it were, or is the problem still quite complex? [Shmarov] [Words indistinct] I have already said that we are definitely making headway. [passage indistinct] [end recording]
