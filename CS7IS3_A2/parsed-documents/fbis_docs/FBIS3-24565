Morocha, Moscow Electronic Engineering Institute; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] The existence of purely transverse acoustic waves along the boundary of two isotropic half-spaces first described in Akusticheskiy zhurnal Vol. 24 No. 4, 1978 is discussed, and it is noted that if both half-spaces are piezoelectric crystals, a purely acoustoelectric wave may propagate along their acoustic contact boundary without an intermediate layer. An attempt is made to demonstrate that a new type of purely transverse wave may propagate parallel to the acoustic contact planes of two piezoelectric 43m crystals whereby the acoustoelectric field is localized in the near-contact layer whose thickness is on the order of the wavelength, i.e., the wave amplitude attenuate on either side of the contact boundary equally as fast as in ordinary Rayleigh waves. The structure of the purely acoustoelectric Stonley wave is plotted. The source data and the outcome of acoustoelectric parameter analysis of the new type of purely acoustoelectric waves for such contacting piezoelectric crystal pairs as GaAs with ViGeO[.sup]20[/], InSb with InAs, ViGeO[.sub]20[/] with ZnS, ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with InAs, GaAs with Si, ZnS with Si, and ViGeO[.sup]20[/] with Si are summarized. It is shown that the use of the new type of purely acoustoelectric waves whose existence is predicted in the article may be promising in monolithic integrated acoustoelectronics for developing functional devices with a latent acoustic channel, e.g., active and passive acoustic waveguides without losses, multilayer delay lines, acoustoelectric amplifiers and generators, convolvers, etc. Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 2 Russian, 2 Western.
