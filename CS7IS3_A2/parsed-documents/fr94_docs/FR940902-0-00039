FR940902-0-00039 FR940902-0-00010 Work Experience The provisions of §627.245 of the interim final rule set forth requirements pertaining to work experience. The work experience activity is related to other activities in which there is work-based training, such as entry employment experience and limited internships, but the activities may differ due to the circumstances of the work experience assignment. Such circumstances could include whether the participant is an adult or a youth, whether the host employer is public, private non-profit, or private for-profit, whether an employer-employee relationship is established, and whether there is an expectation of continued employment, or whether the activity is a short-term training opportunity. For example, entry employment experience and limited internship in the private sector are not allowable activities for adults. ``Work experience'' is available only in the public or private non-profit sector. The Department acknowledges the relationship among these activities but chooses not to provide specific definitions beyond that for work experience so as not to arbitrarily limit development of types of work-based training activities. The Department wishes to encourage a variety of approaches to these activities. For that reason, §627.245(a) is revised by deleting the reference to limited internships and entry employment experience. The definition of work experience clarifies that work experience is primarily a training, not an employment, assignment. The words ``employing agency'' are removed from the interim final rule to address the concern that work experience automatically establishes an employment relationship. A few commenters noted that the provisions of paragraph (b) of the interim final rule that dealt with the types of individuals for which work experience would be ``suitable'' did not adequately reflect the circumstances under which it would be appropriate to use work experience. The final rule is revised to delete this characterization of the individuals for whom work experience is appropriate. The paragraph now only states how work experience is to be designed. In response to comments criticizing the limitations on the duration of work experience, entry employment experience, and limited internships, the Department has decided to remove the limitations. The Department believes that this change will permit the development of activities that may better meet the individual needs of participants and the final rule indicates that this should be reflected in the ISS. The Department expects that discrete periods of work experience participation will be limited in duration; although, in response to comments and in recognition of successful program models, the Department acknowledges that an individual may benefit from participation in multiple work experience opportunities. Many commenters asked for removal or revision of the provision that work experience is suitable for individuals who have been ``out of the labor force for an extended period of time *␣*␣*.'' They pointed out that this is difficult to interpret, may vary depending on the previous experience and other characteristics of the participant, and is the kind of provision that could unnecessarily lead to varying interpretations and audit exceptions. The final regulations provide only that work experience should promote the development of good work habits and basic work skills. In addition, it is the Department's belief that the work experience activity provides an excellent opportunity to provide non-traditional employment opportunities, in a variety of settings, for women and youth. Several commenters suggested that the prohibition of work experience in title III be removed or revised. Since title III dislocated workers generally have, by definition, previous employment under which work habits and basic work skills are developed, the provision in the interim final rule is not revised. Finally, a few commenters asked for clarification of the requirement that work experience be combined with basic or occupational skills training_particularly in light of one of the examples provided in §628.535. This is addressed in the discussion of §628.535, but by way of general guidance, the prohibition may not be addressed by combining work experience with any of the other proscribed stand-alone activities such as job search or job club. Subpart C_Payments, Supportive Services, Benefits, and Working Conditions A number of comments were received on Subpart C of the interim final rule, Payments, Benefits and Working Conditions. The Department has rethought its positions in response to these comments and the final rule contains a considerable number of changes. Subpart C is revised, retitled, and renumbered. The following discussion is intended to clarify the Department's position on payments and supportive services and identifies the changes from the interim final to the final regulations. In keeping with the Amendments' emphasis on targeting services to the hardest-to-serve and the need for longer-term interventions, these regulations clarify the widened array of payments, supportive services, benefits and working conditions available or required under the Amendments. The Amendments provide for comprehensive supportive services and for their allocation to the training-related and supportive service cost category. The regulations implement these provisions and also provide for clarification of the various types of payments for title II programs. Some payments can be allocated to the training-related and supportive services cost category while others can be allocated to the training cost category. The treatment of specific expenditures is provided for at §627.440 of these regulations. Service Strategy Overview A number of commenters expressed confusion regarding appropriate documentation procedures and requested clarification on the requirements and the mechanisms for providing payments and supportive services to participants. Several commenters suggested that while the legislation clearly intended to increase supportive services and payments, the requirements in the interim final regulations would probably limit their usage. In response, the final rule is revised to minimize the amount of documentation necessary to establish an individual's need for supportive services and payments while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent misuse of program funds.
