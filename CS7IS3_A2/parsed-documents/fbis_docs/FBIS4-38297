Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that "this is a firm and irrevocable position regardless of the statements and threats of Iranian officials which are not based on any legal or historical ground relating to these islands which were forcibly occupied by Iran in 1971." They added that "the statements of Iranian officials on the islands and Tehran's talk of eternal sovereignty over the three strategic Gulf islands reflect a conceited and arrogant Iranian mentality and Iranian policy toward the neighboring states, governed by upstaging and charges of treason, hegemony, and service to Zionism which Tehran knowns well. [no closing quotemark as published] The sources were commenting on the statement of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesman who said that the UAE's position "opens the way to Zionist hegemony." The sources described the statement of Mahmud Mohammadi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, and his reaffirmation of "Iran's eternal sovereignty over the three strategic islands in the Gulf," as a "violation of the spirit of the era and of the international will that disputes should be settled by peaceful means and recourse to the international community if negotiations between the two sides fail." [passage omitted] The sources said that "Iran's continued occupation of the islands reflects a mentality of hegemony. The logic of occupation is rejected, be it in Palestine by the Zionists or in the Gulf by the Iranians." [passage omitted]
