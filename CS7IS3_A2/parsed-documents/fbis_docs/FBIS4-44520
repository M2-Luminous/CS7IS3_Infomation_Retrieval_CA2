In such a financial system, every financial institution is internally driven to succeed, to reform, and to forge ahead. Externally, financial institutions are under enormous competitive pressure from other institutions to go forward. There is also a macroeconomic regulatory and control mechanism that both serves as an effective restraint and spurs microeconomic activities. To achieve the above-stated goal as soon as possible, we must decide carefully what to do in hopes of making a breakthrough. The 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee has done just that for us and it is to further regularize the functions and systems of the central bank, establish a policy-oriented bank, and gradually transform existing large state banks into commercial banks after turning over the policy-based business to the policy-oriented bank. The core issue here is the commercialization of large state banks. It is a major part of the deepening of financial reform in China in the days ahead. What Are Commercial Banks? A commercial bank is a financial enterprise that buys and sells the right to use funds like a commodity, pursues profit as its principal objective, exercises decision-making authority in its operations, is accountable for its profits and losses, assumes risk on its own, and has a self-discipline mechanism. It is the thrust of reform to turn all financial institutions in China into commercial financial institutions as defined above, with the exception of the central bank and policy-oriented banks. As a matter of fact, so far large and small shareholding banks, urban and rural credit societies, and small and medium-sized state banks such as Zhongxin Industrial Bank and Guangdai Bank have basically become this kind of financial institutions. Even large state banks have begun the transition to commercialization and are expected to complete the process in the next few years. Meanwhile, the commercial financial institutions mentioned above will evolve into typical or representative commercial financial institutions. New urban and rural cooperative banks and other financial institutions will be set up. Foreign-funded financial institutions are also slated for a period of rapid growth. By then China's financial system will basically have everything a modern banking system ought to have. Compared to the existing large state banks, the typical commercial bank has the following features: 1) Buys and sells financial services and the right to use credit funds like a commodity. In the past the government treated large state banks as the implementors of policies and managers of the economy. How much money the banks should lend and to whom were both decided by the government. After these banks became commercial banks, both the financial services they can provide and the right to use funds became commodities. Will a bank provide services and lend money to a particular enterprise? How much? Questions like these will now be answered by the bank and the enterprise themselves through discussion. When the business of making policy-mandated loans is turned over to the policy-oriented bank, commercial banks will be absolved of the responsibility of supplying enterprises with working capital. No longer will they be held accountable for the difficulties faced by mismanaged and unprofitable enterprises whose products do not sell well after their application for a loan is turned down. In most cases the government also will stop directly ordering a commercial bank to extend credit to a certain enterprise. It would no longer be proper for the government to continue using simple administrative tools to control their business activities. Instead it should adopt policies to create an environment conducive to banks doing business based on their own self-interests. 2) Profit enhancement as one of the principal operational objectives All enterprises must make a profit. In a socialist market economy, the enterprise which does not make a profit cannot survive for long. As a financial enterprise, a commercial bank must have a well-defined profit objective and must organize and mobilize all its employees to work hard to achieve that objective. The profit motive is the engine that drives all its operations. Whether or not an enterprise truly regards the numerical profit objective as its primary operational goal essentially distinguishes a state commercial bank from its predecessor, a large state bank. Will a commercial bank do any less social good if it looks upon profit or economic return as its principal operational goal? The answer is that not only will it not do less social good, but it may on the contrary generate more social benefits. A bank realizes its social good through its business activities. The purpose of allowing a bank to assess its own bottom line is precisely to enable it to put its business on a sounder footing. When a commercial bank becomes more successful in its business, when idle funds in society are put to full use, when the bank is able to lend more loans with the projected economic return and provide more financial services for the economy, then the economic benefits to society and hence to the entire nation will automatically be even greater. When large state banks go commercial, they become state commercial banks. As state commercial banks, they should no doubt comply with national laws and policies in an exemplary manner, particularly those in the field of finance. They must look at the bottom line without, however, being preoccupied with profit-making exclusively. The problem now is that the profit motive of these banks is not strong enough. We need to further liberate our thinking and take measures to intensify it. 3) Linking workers' earnings to the bank's financial performance After a large state bank is transformed into a commercial bank, its employees' earnings should be linked to its performance. If the bank is well-managed and its profit goes up, so should the incomes of its employees correspondingly. If the bank is mismanaged and its profit drops, perhaps even replaced by a loss, the earnings of its workers should likewise decrease. This is an important way to fully energize a commercial bank, a measure essential to making the bank internally driven and externally pressured and turning it into a truly modern financial enterprise. However, how a bank's bottom line is linked to workers' incomes is something that needs to be examined carefully. In the future, after the banks' profit becomes average profit, we should take a leaf from the book of the typical large enterprise and work out a commercial bank wage and incentive system closely linked to a bank's margin of profit. That way the earnings of a bank's employees will be even more in line with its profitability. 4) Adopting a new internal management system Large state banks and commercial banks are two different kinds of banks with different operating mechanisms. Naturally their management systems are also different. After a large state bank is transformed into a commercial bank, the first order of business is to craft a management system that meets the needs of a commercial bank. Such a system should include an operations management system, a financial management, and a personnel management system, etc. A personnel management system, for instance, should comprise a strict employee performance evaluation system complete with rewards and penalties in order to put a total end to the phenomenon of good workers and bad workers being treated in the same way. The bank president should be granted the power to hire and fire employees. The "iron rice bowl" should be smashed in the course of time. Business Operations Of Commercial Banks The operations of a commercial bank can be summed up in a traditional way as "deposit, lend, and remit." Deposit means accepting deposits, lend means making loans, and remitting means sending remittances, or, as they put it loosely, "account transfer and settlement." Deposits. Under state regulations, a commercial bank derives its funds from the capital invested by its owner. It is also entitled to take a predetermined percentage of the funds in its account transfer and settlement line of business in accordance with the principle of "accept payment first, make payment later." Yet another source of funds is deposits. While there is a numerical ceiling to the first two sources of funds, deposits have enormous potential for growth. As long as a bank is making all the right moves and works hard, deposits can keep growing strongly. Thus deposits often represent the principal source of funds for a commercial bank. Take Zhongxin Industrial Bank, for instance. In 1992 its liabilities and net assets amounted to 33,587,740,000 yuan, including 19,858,550,000 yuan, or 59.1 percent, in deposits. How much money a commercial bank lends and hence the overall scale of its operations is determined by the sources of its funds. For this reason a commercial bank typically takes deposits most seriously. Commercial banks offer the same kinds of deposits plans and methods that large state banks have offered for years. As competition heats up, however, they will come up with an endless range of innovative practices and programs and keep improving their services. Interest rates too will become more flexible and elastic within the limits set by the state. If they meet the requirements, commercial banks can also raise funds by issuing bonds. Issuing bonds in essence resembles taking deposits, which is why it is mentioned as part deposits here. Making loans. Lending is the principal way in which a commercial bank puts funds to use and the primary source of its profits. Let us again look at the situation in Zhongxin Industrial Bank in late 1992. Its credit balance stood at 19,395,380,000 yuan, 57.8 percent of the total amount of funds applied. Since commercial banks assume risk themselves and are accountable for their own profits and losses, they normally select whom they lend money to most stringently, limiting their borrowers to those enterprises whose products are popular and relatively profitable and which are well managed. Pre-lending investigations and post-lending supervision are also major priorities for a commercial bank. Among the various kinds of loans, the proportion of unsecured loans has been dropping while that of secured loans and discounting of bills has gone up. Each and every single loan comes with a specified time limit; it must be paid off by the due date. The amount of lending by a commercial bank is no longer determined by the national credit plan or other administrative tools. However, the bank must practice assets to liabilities ratio management and submit to the restraint of fund sources so as to ensure that it is fully able to pay its depositors. In other words, whatever the circumstances, whenever a depositor demands to withdraw a sum of money, the bank must have the money on hand to make such a payment. Commercial banks are required to purchase a set amount of treasury bonds, but whether they should be allowed to buy enterprise bonds and shares has yet to be considered. Countries like the United States do not permit commercial banks to purchase shares and bonds as a form of investment, while just the opposite is true in Germany and Switzerland. Most people in China are opposed to commercial banks purchasing enterprise bonds and shares. Under the "Decision of the State Council Concerning Financial Reform," "state commercial banks shall not invest in non-financial enterprises." In my opinion, commercial banks as a rule should not be allowed to purchase enterprise bonds and shares for fear of over-extending the use of funds and causing a credit crisis and to prevent the stock market and bond market from undermining bank credit. However, in the course of converting state enterprises into modern enterprises, we should allow a portion of the old bad debts to be converted into shares to be held by the loan-originating bank. Account transfer and settlement. This is what a commercial bank does when loans are paid off, labor fees paid, and other sums transferred in society. Since account settlement and transfer involves various banks, uniform methods of settlement must be established by the central bank. By going into the account transfer and settlement business, a bank can collect a service charge or take a cut of the sum settled, on the one hand, and attract customers to open an account with it, thus boosting its deposits, on the other. (Before a bank would do transfer and settlement for you, you must deposit a sum of money there.) For this reason, account transfer and settlement is a fiercely competitive part of a bank's business. Competition helps shorten the settlement process, improve customer services, and accelerate economic development. The central bank must do a good job in public inter-bank lending and note settlement. Commercial banks should be authorized to handle inter-bank account settlement within their own system on their own. Nevertheless, account settlement between different banking systems and between the branches of banks that are either unwilling or unable to set up a banking system should go through the public banking group organized by the central bank. Note settlement too should be processed by the central bank or by a bank designated by the central bank. Account transfer and settlement by a commercial bank will be more service-oriented and freer from administrative supervision compared with similar services offered by the large state bank of the past. The bank can only do what the two parties--the payer and the payee--agree upon. The payer and the payee, on the other hand, will each play a stronger role in disciplining itself and monitoring the other party. Say an enterprise asks a bank to collect a sum of money. If the other enterprise refuses to pay, all the bank can do is to return the commission. It will then be up to the two enterprises to arrive at an agreement through discussion. Banks should be allowed to overlap one another's scope of business. That way enterprises can choose banks and vice versa, thus achieving genuine competition in the field of banking. When that comes to pass, enterprises which make popular marketable products and are well managed and profitable can borrow on favorable terms, enabling them to develop even faster. In contrast, enterprises whose products fail to move on the market and which are poorly managed and are barely profitable or even downright unprofitable are either denied credit or forced to borrow on harsher terms, This will prompt them to move quickly to turn themselves around. Difficulties in Bank Commercialization Although the course of changing large state banks into commercial banks is now set, a number of sticking points remain. It will be some time before the conversion process is fully complete. Among the major problems are: 1) It is difficult to find a substitute for banks as the sole source of enterprise working capital any time soon. For years state enterprises relied solely on bank loans as the source of their working capital. Bank loans account for 80 percent of the working capital of all state enterprises in the nation. At the moment one-third of state enterprises are losing money openly while another one-third are doing so under the surface. They are bad credit risks. If commercial banks decide whether or not to extend credit strictly in accordance with the principles of commercial banking, a large proportion of enterprises will not qualify and should be denied new loans, even told to pay off old loans. But if that really happens, these enterprises will have to go out of business. This is not just an economic issue, but also a major political issue. Nobody says this is what banks should do and it is not something the banks themselves dare to do. 2) We have yet to figure out what to do about the bad debt inherited from the past. Of the current loans of the several leading state banks, not a few are essentially uncollectible. They include bad debt the material base for which is no longer existent; they are still on the books only because the accounts have not been audited and losses reported. Others represent the minimum amount of funds necessary for the survival of an enterprise. The money should have come from the enterprise's capital, but since the capital was not there, bank loans were resorted to as a substitute. As long as the enterprise continues to exist, there is simply no way the money involved can be freed up. That is to say, there is little hope the loan will be repaid. How much do these essentially unrepayable loans amount to? There is no precise number, but some people have estimated them at 40 percent of the value of all loans at least. They constitute a burden on the banks as well as the enterprises. The debtor state enterprises not only have the obligation of paying off the loans, but they are also required to pay interest. Saddled with such a burden, how can they enter the market and compete with private enterprises, individual enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises that are practically debt-free? For large state banks, being stuck with so many uncollectible loans, including some which are about to be written off, naturally also constitutes a burden. As long as this problem remains unsolved, large state banks will be unable to enter the market unburdened, ready to compete with other financial institutions on a level playing field. Measures to Spur Bank Commercialization The transformation of large state banks into commercial banks is a pivotal measure in China's drive to deepen financial reform. Since the course is set, we should embark on the process steadily and firmly. 1) Unify ideological understanding True to the spirit of the "Decision," it is now our set policy to deepen reform, energize banking, and establish a new financial system suited to the needs of a socialist market economy. However, as long as large state banks are not converted into commercial banks with despatch and their operating mechanism overhauled thoroughly, the banking industry will remain dormant and a new financial system will have a hard time coming into existence. Should large state banks continue to operate by the old mechanism, they will suffer setbacks and perhaps even a gradual decline in their competition with other financial institutions, losing their original commanding place in the banking industry. This is a crucial issue with implications for the continued leadership of state financial institutions in the entire banking industry. Thus it is not a question of whether large state banks are willing to go commercial. Rather they must do so as soon as possible. The last thing the central bank and all large state banks should do is to hesitate and waver. Instead they must be determined to take effective measures to effect this transformation over time. 2) Work hard to expedite the materialization of a modern enterprise system. Banking is a comprehensive sector whose every activity is closely related to the enterprise. Banking reform must proceed in tandem with enterprise reform, a point thoroughly demonstrated by the two difficulties described above. Clearly, if we fail to set up a modern enterprise system and continue the operating mechanism of the product economy, the numerous money-losing enterprises will not be able to turn themselves around. Nor can we let them go bankrupt simply because there are so many of them. The only thing they can do is to survive on bank loans. Under the circumstances, it will be impossible to cut back on new loans, not to mention collect old ones. How then can we even begin to talk about transforming state banks into commercial banks? On the other hand, we cannot just sit here and wait for the materialization of a modern enterprise system before moving to commercialize large state banks. Whenever possible, we should start taking small steps in such areas as credit and account settlement to build up a momentum for creating a modern enterprise system. When the latter process picks up steam, in turn driving the transformation of banks, we can then quicken the pace of bank transformation. 3) Accelerate the creation of an operating mechanism for commercial banks. Waste no time in ending from bottom to top some of the institutions and practices formed in the era of the product economy and gradually develop a new set of systems such as a personnel management system, a fund or business system, and a financial system, suited to the operations of commercial banks. Creating these systems is tantamount to deepening financial reform. We must liberate our thinking and have the courage to emulate some of the practices of banks in the West. Actually that is what we have been doing and the results have been quite satisfactory. We should go further on that front in the future. 4) Take feasible measures to solve the problem of bad debt. Considering every practical circumstance, we may take the following actions to wrestle with the banks' bad debt problem. a) If the debtor enterprise has decided to turn itself into a shareholding state enterprise, the debt may be reconstituted as the bank's investment in the enterprise, in effect turning the IOU into shares. The bank will then cease to be a creditor. Instead it becomes a shareholder and takes part in managing and supervising the enterprise. b) Some enterprises do not meet the requirements for the transformation into shareholding enterprises for the moment but may do so in the future. In this case, we may convert the loan into transferable bonds, that is, turning it into enterprise bonds first and, later, shares when the enterprise adopts the shareholding system. c) There are some enterprises which cannot be converted into shareholding enterprises. In this case, the loan in question may be converted into low-interest long-term enterprise bonds that may be paid off in stages. Each year the enterprise is required to set aside a portion of its retained profit to pay off a part of the loan. Other methods may also be used to raise funds to repay the loan. d) In case the debtor is no longer around or nobody can be found who can be held responsible for repaying the loan, it should be reported in its full value and written off outright. That way enterprises would be free to enter the market unburdened. Large state banks too can be converted into commercial banks sooner.
