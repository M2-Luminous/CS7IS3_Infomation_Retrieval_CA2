FR940825-0-00015 FR940825-0-00003 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 94&hyph;030&hyph;2] Mexican Fruit Fly; Treatments for Regulated Articles AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the Mexican fruit fly regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment for grapefruit. This action will provide an alternative treatment for grapefruit that require treatment to be moved interstate from regulated areas in Texas and California. Adding this treatment will facilitate the interstate movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Michael B. Stefan, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 640, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens (Loew), is a destructive pest of citrus and other types of fruit. The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas. In order to prevent the artificial spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas, the regulations in 7 CFR 301.64 through 301.64&hyph;10 (referred to below as the regulations) restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas in quarantined States. Quarantined States are listed in §301.64(a), regulated articles are listed in §301.64&hyph;2, and regulated areas are listed in §301.64&hyph;3(c). Regulated articles are most often certified for interstate movement after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is free from the Mexican fruit fly, or that the premises of origin is free from the Mexican fruit fly and the regulated article has not been exposed to the pest. There are cases, however, where a regulated article or its premises of origin cannot be determined to be free from the Mexican fruit fly. In such cases, a certificate will be issued if the regulated article is treated in accordance with §301.64&hyph;10, or a limited permit may be obtained to move the regulated article interstate to receive one of the treatments specified in §301.64&hyph;10. On June 20, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 31561&hyph;31562, Docket No. 94&hyph;030&hyph;1) a proposal to add a high-temperature forced air treatment to §301.64&hyph;10 as an alternative treatment for grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi ), one of the regulated articles listed in §301.64&hyph;2. The high-temperature forced air treatment was developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an effective alternative treatment against the Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. We solicited comments on our proposed rule for a 30-day period ending on July 20, 1994. We received one comment by that date, from a State department of agriculture. The commenter supported our proposed rule with the expectation that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service will ensure that the treatment will be conducted in accordance with the approved time and temperature schedule and that treated grapefruit will be identified as such and protected from Mexican fruit fly infestation until it has left the regulated area. We believe that the provisions of §301.64&hyph;4 regarding conditions for the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas and the provisions of §301.64&hyph;5 regarding the issuance of certificates and limited permits for the movement of regulated articles sufficiently address the commenter's expectations. Section 301.64&hyph;5 also requires that treatments be monitored by inspectors to assure compliance with the regulations. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. This final rule amends the regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment to the list of approved treatments for Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. There are approximately 1,500 citrus grove owners and 50 shippers who stand to benefit by having an additional treatment option for grapefruit to be moved interstate from a regulated area. Adding another treatment will not increase the amount of grapefruit moved from regulated areas in Texas and California because most citrus and other regulated articles moved interstate by owners and shippers qualify for movement without requiring treatment. Treatment becomes necessary only when the regulated articles or their premises of origin cannot be certified as being free from Mexican fruit fly. Cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation have been the two treatments available for grapefruit; the availability of the high-temperature forced air treatment will simply provide another treatment option when treatment is required. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This document contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).

Accordingly, 7 CFR part 301 is amended as follows: PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 1. The authority citation for part 301 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 150bb, 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 161, 162, and 164&hyph;167; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c). 2. In §301.64&hyph;10, a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows: §301.64&hyph;10 Treatments. * * * * * (e) Grapefruit. (1) High-temperature forced air as follows: (i) Minimum size: 3.5 in (9 cm) in diameter (ii) Minimum weight: 9.25 oz (262 g) (iii) Minimum initial pulp temperature: 77 ○F (25 ○C) (iv) Caution: Grapefruit larger than 3.7 in (9.5 cm) in diameter and 14.2 oz (402 g) in weight may suffer cosmetic damage as a result of this treatment. (2) These steps must occur in order: (i) Place the grapefruit in a chamber and seal the chamber. (ii) Heat air in chamber to 104 ○F (40 ○C) for 120 minutes. (iii) Heat air in chamber to 122 ○F (50 ○C) for 90 minutes. (iv) Heat air in chamber to 126 ○F (52 ○C) and maintain temperature until the grapefruit center reaches 118 ○F (48 ○C). (3) The treatment must be administered in a sealed, insulated chamber. The air may be heated in the chamber or hot air may be introduced into the chamber.
