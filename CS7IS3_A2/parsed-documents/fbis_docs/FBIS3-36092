The promise to bring Crimea back into the ruble area under the Russian umbrella, abandoning the ruined Ukrainian economy to itself, will be short-lived, they say, in view of Moscow's indifference and [Ukrainian President] Kravchuk's hostility. So he will soon be a president with no powers, like the queen of England. But Yuriy Meshkov does not seem at all like a queen. And Crimea is not reminiscent of England. It is much more like Karabakh, Georgia, and the Moldovan lands of the Dniester, where offended and desolate men have been attacking each other, first in the elections and the referendum, then with ultimatums, and last with hatred and weapons, in order to defend their own "sacrosanct" rights. [Cucurnia] Mr. President, you said today that soon the citizens of Crimea will be summoned to a referendum on independence. You went on to explain that you do not intend to take the republic out of Ukraine and that there will be no territorial problems. In our country we say that you cannot eat soup and blow on it at the same time. How do you intend to reconcile these two positions? [Meshkov] The status of an independent republic is not an end in itself. We have only one wish: to salvage ourselves. That is, to set our economy back on a sound footing. If in order to do so it is not necessary to modify Crimea's status, then we will not do so. But if anyone tries to obstruct us, then we will be forced somehow to guarantee our autonomy in the economic field. [Cucurnia] Do you mean that you reserve the right to leave Ukraine? [Meshkov] I personally do not see the need for it, but the political situation is very complex and unpredictable, precisely because of the disastrous economic situation. In our country there is no longer any stability, there is so much crime, so much disintegration and poverty that social explosions and revolts cannot be ruled out, and we must defend our citizens. [Cucurnia] At your news conference you said that you want to turn Crimea into a bridge between Russia and Ukraine. But apart from the deafening silence on Russia's part and Kravchuk's attempts at reconciliation, the whole of western Ukraine rejects the very idea of your independence. Do you not think that somebody will try to blow up your bridge? [Meshkov] The experience of the former Soviet republics has set in motion some obscure and ambivalent mechanisms, a mixture of centrifugal thrusts and hopes of reintegration. Unfortunately the former prevailed in the initial phase and paved the way for a tide of nationalism in the lands of the former USSR. Leadership groups came to power that have neglected economic problems, since they were busy with gaining and retaining power. Those who were most keen to break the bridges and to isolate themselves, such as Ukraine, have suffered the most. Crimea's territorial problem is certainly not the most serious problem that Ukraine has to face, keeping in mind the fact that even outside Crimea feelings have changed and many people long for what they have lost. [Cucurnia] Mr. President, according to the official figures, over a million people voted for you yesterday. How many of them do you think voted for a reunion with Russia? [Meshkov] The nostalgia that we all feel for that stable and secure past that we knew is perfectly understandable; the memory has not disappeared from our awareness. Just as communist ideology has not disappeared. It is wrong for the international economic structures to lay down the law, without taking account of the situation and minds of the people who make this economy function. And people now are being forced to choose: Behind us we have left a secure world that turned into decline and poverty when we were promised a market economy. Whether to move forward toward these horrors, or to rebuild a decent life? Those who voted for me do not want a return to communism, but they do want to reform the economy and to restore everyone's fundamental rights. We give priority to the rights of the citizens, not those of the state. The state must concern itself with the people, and not vice versa. But if the international community abandons us, unless it tries to influence the decisions adopted by Kiev, which has shown itself to be incapable of economic management, unless Ukraine's brutal actions are discouraged, the situation in Crimea could really become red hot. [Cucurnia] But are you aware that Crimea is surrounded by the interests of two nuclear powers, Ukraine and Russia, not to mention Turkey, which has promised support to the Tatar minority, who hail from these lands? [Meshkov] I feel the full burden of the responsibility that I have shouldered. These are hard and embittered times. I am perfectly well aware of the gravity of the situation, especially since I learned that the director of the CIA devoted his report to the issue of the elections in Crimea. But nobody will understand our problems and the fact that Crimea's internal structure rules out the explosion of conflicts. The only thing that could provoke these people is economic collapse, in which case social processes will become impossible to control. But we have no internal ethnic or religious conflicts or any nationalist movements seeking justice against history. Russia and Ukraine have always been good neighbors. The only serious problem is the Black Sea Fleet, and Ukraine should have the courage to admit that it is Russian and indivisible. [Cucurnia] What about the Tatars, who opposed your elections with all their strength? [Meshkov] I am disappointed about the statements by their leader Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as received], who has said that he cannot rule out armed resistance by the Tatars for a solution of their national problems. This really is too much. Fortunately, the Tatar intelligentsia and a large proportion of the people do not agree with these statements. Be that as it may, it cannot influence the Crimean citizens' legitimate desire to build a viable future.
