FBIS3-6471 "dreas053_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-053 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 North Korea ROK Creating `Deliberate Obstacles' to Exchange SK1803012594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 17 Mar 94 SK1803012594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 17 Mar 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] The South Korean puppet clique's insincere attitude lacking will for dialogue [taehwa uijiga omnun pulsongsilhan taedo] has created severe obstacles [omjunghan nangwan] to North-South working-level contacts for an exchange of top-level special envoys, which have been arranged after a long time [mochorom maryondoen]. According to Seoul radio, in a meeting with reporters on 15 March, Yi Yong-tok, South Korean puppet unification board minister, made absurd remarks that the Panmunjom working-level contacts for the envoy exchange would end in failure, that the result of the contacts is unpredictable, and the like. Puppet defense minister Yi Pyong-tae also openly talked about resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise this year when he met with the U.S. undersecretary of defense that day, saying that the exchange of special envoys between the South and the North was unlikely to be realized. The puppets' insidious remarks of discouraging [chanmurul kkionnun] the working-level contacts for the envoy exchange vividly show that the Kim Yong-sam group has no will to discuss pending issues between the North and the South. It is entirely related to the South Korean puppet clique's unjust behavior [pudanghan chosawa kwallyon toemnida] that the North-South working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys, which have been resumed according to the agreement reached in the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States, went four rounds in March but failed to get anywhere. The South Korean puppets' maneuver to create deliberate obstacles [inwijogin nangwan] to the envoy exchange was utterly proven in the seventh working-level contact. The South side objected to our side's proposal for announcing a joint communique informing that the two sides reconfirmed the will for the envoy exchange and agreed to exchange special envoys at an early date. It also blindly [toponoko] objected to our side's suggestion that the issues of observing the principle of national independence, deciding on the way of national reunification, and promoting the great unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft agreement with regard to the missions of special envoys. The measure our side has taken is a constructive [konsolchogin] proposal that creates a significant momentum not only for hastening the envoy exchange but for making a new starting point in North-South relations and giving hope to all compatriots who are concerned about the prospect of the envoy exchange. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are trying to prevent the envoy exchange from being realized and are driving the talks to a dangerous situation by stubbornly insisting that they cannot accept the epochal measure proposed by us.
