The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;26&hyph;03 Fokker: Amendment 39&hyph;9099. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;205&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes, serial numbers 11003 through 11241 inclusive, 11991, and 11992; certificated in any category, and equipped with any of the following Dowty Aerospace Gloucester main undercarriage unit part numbers: 200427003/004/005/006/007/008/009/010, 200633001/002/005/006, 200642001/002/003/004/005/006, 200739001/002/003/004, 200752001/002/003/004, or 200782001/002/003/004/005/006/007/008. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (d) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the main landing gear (MLG), accomplish the following: (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this AD: Within 3 months after the effective date of this AD, perform an eddy current inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the MLG in accordance with Fokker Service Bulletin F28/32&hyph;149, dated August 30, 1991. If any cracked subassembly is found, prior to further flight, replace it with a new subassembly, or a serviceable subassembly that has been identified previously with service bulletin number ``32&hyph;161R'' on its nameplate, in accordance with Dowty Aerospace Gloucester Service Bulletin 32&hyph;161R, Revision 2, dated January 7, 1992. (b) In lieu of performing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD, verify that the items specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished with respect to the main undercarriage unit of the MLG on the affected airplane(s). Operators who verify the accomplishment of all of these items are considered to be in compliance with the requirements of this AD. (1) The main landing gear overhaul period has not exceeded 12,000 landings or 12 years, whichever comes first; and (2) The last overhaul was accomplished in accordance with Dowty Aerospace Landing Gear (DALG) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM), dated September 1977 or later; and (3) Any repairs accomplished during overhaul were accomplished in accordance with the DALG CMM, dated November 25, 1992 or later; or any repairs accomplished prior to November 25, 1992, but later than September 1977, were performed with concurrence (concession) from DALG. (c) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install on any airplane a main undercarriage unit, having any of the following Dowty Aerospace Gloucester part numbers, that has not been identified previously with service bulletin number ``32&hyph;161R'' on its nameplate, or that has not been verified to have met the items specified in paragraph (b) of this AD: 200427003/004/005/006/007/008/009/010, 200633001/002/005/006, 200642001/002/003/004/005/006, 200739001/002/003/004, 200752001/002/003/004, or 200782001/002/003/004/005/006/007/008. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) The inspection shall be done in accordance with Fokker Service Bulletin F28/32&hyph;149, dated August 30, 1991. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
