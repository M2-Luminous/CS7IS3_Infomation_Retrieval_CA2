FR941122-1-00074 FR941122-1-00017 The red snapper stock assessment completed by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, in September 1994 indicated that the spawning potential ratio (SPR) has increased from less than 1 percent in 1984 to about 2 percent in 1994. This increase is due to the conservation measures already in place. However, the FMP has a goal of 20 percent SPR for all reef fish, and a target date for recovery of the overfished red snapper stock by the year 2009. Based on data in the assessment and the FMP's rebuilding schedule, the Council's Reef Fish Stock Assessment Panel (SAP) calculated the allowable biological catch (ABC) as having an upper limit of 6.00 million pounds (m lb) (2.72 million kg (m kg)). The Council's Socioeconomic Panel (SEP) recommended that the ABC be established specifically at 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg). Based on the SAP's and SEP's reports, the Council recommends a continuation of TAC at the upper end of the ABC range, 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), for 1995. A 1995 TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg) is consistent with the FMP's rebuilding program for red snapper, and is within the framework bounds established in the FMP. NMFS is requesting public comment on the Council's recommended TAC for 1995. Proposed Management Measures Associated With Red Snapper TAC The FMP's framework procedure requires that allocations of the red snapper TAC be based on a historical 51/49 commercial/recreational harvest ratio. A TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), therefore, results in a commercial quota of 3.06 m lb (1.39 m kg) and a recreational allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg). The recreational fishery is managed by bag and minimum size limits, currently 7 fish and 14 inches (35.6 cm), respectively. The 1994 stock assessment showed that the recreational fishing harvest greatly exceeded the recreational fishery allocation in 1992, 1993, and is expected to do so in 1994. To ensure that the recreational fishery does not exceed its 1995 allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg), the recreational harvest must be reduced by about 43 percent from the 1993 harvest level, estimated at approximately 5.10 m lb (2.31 m kg). Preliminary estimates presented to the Council by its staff indicated that a 15-inch (38.1-cm) size limit and 5-fish bag limit together would achieve a 38-percent harvest reduction from the 1993 level, assuming the validity of a 33-percent release mortality utilized in the stock assessment. The remaining necessary harvest reduction of 5 percent is expected to result from the proposed catch restriction for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew. The Council heard extensive public testimony from charter vessel and headboat operators who claimed that severe adverse social and economic impacts would result from reduction of the red snapper bag limit, particularly if decreased to less than five fish per customer. Several of these operators suggested elimination of red snapper harvest by the charter vessel and headboat operators and crew to help achieve the necessary reduction in recreational harvest (compared to 1993 levels). Industry representatives who testified to the Council characterized that measure, considered as an alternative, as less disruptive than a severe reduction in the bag limit. The Council, following its review of all available information, determined that more restrictive red snapper size and bag limits are necessary to avoid additional overruns of the recreational allocation that could lead to overfishing. Accordingly, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing: (1) A reduction of the bag limit for red snapper to zero for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew; (2) a reduction of the daily bag limit for red snapper to five for other persons; and (3) an increase in the minimum allowable size of red snapper to 15 inches (38.1 cm), applicable to red snapper taken under the bag limit. If adopted in final, these measures would be made effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. The proposed reduction in the red snapper recreational catch is designed to maintain allocations between the recreational and commercial sectors and to ensure that the total red snapper harvest in 1995 remains within the TAC level, thereby adhering to the FMP's stock rebuilding program. Since the Council submitted its recommended 1995 management measures for red snapper, NMFS has completed a new evaluation of the probable magnitude of the 1994 and 1995 recreational red snapper harvests; this analysis assumes implementation of the proposed measures for 1995 contained in this rule. Based on this evaluation, NMFS is concerned whether these proposed measures will adequately constrain recreational catches to the level of the sector's allocation in 1995. This recent evaluation shows a clear increasing trend in the proportion of trips to offshore waters that are returning with red snapper that may, in part, result in recreational fishery catches well above the allocation. The Council is expected to review this recent information on anticipated recreational fishery catches. Comments are invited as to whether additional adjustments to bag limits and size limitations may be needed to meet stock recovery goals. In addition to changes in recreational fishery measures, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing, a delay in the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. The proposed delayed opening date was requested by fishermen to help ensure that the fishery would remain open during the entire Lenten season when there is a higher demand for fresh fish. The Council's recommended changes are within the scope of the management measures that may be adjusted by the framework procedure for adjusting management measures referred to at 50 CFR 641.28 and specified in the FMP. The Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, initially concurs that the Council's recommended changes are consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the national standards for fishery conservation and management and other provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and other applicable law. Accordingly, the Council's recommended changes are published by NMFS as a proposed rule for public comment.
