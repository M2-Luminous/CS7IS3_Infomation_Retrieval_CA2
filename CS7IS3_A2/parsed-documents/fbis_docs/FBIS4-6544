They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation between the Czech Republic and Malaysia, and the export of traditional Czech goods here. At the press conference Zieleniec mentioned Czech glass, saying that he had seen Bohemia Glass products in several Kuala Lumpur shops. He and Mahathir had agreed that joint companies were a suitable form of cooperation, Zieleniec said, adding that the two countries could work together in Vietnam, for example. They did not talk about specific projects, he said, because this was up to individual companies. Asked by local journalists what the Czech Republic could offer Malaysians interested in cooperation, Zieleniec replied that the Czechs offered the same possibilities to everybody. He also declared that he believed in the rapid signing of two agreements, on trade and the protection of investments, and had given proposals for them to Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian trade and industry minister. There had been no talk for the meantime about a further necessary document, that on the prevention of double taxation, Zieleniec said. He told journalists that he had conveyed an invitation to the Czech Republic from Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus to Premier Mahathir. Relations between the Czech Republic and Malaysia began to develop properly in the 1980's. The main Czech exports to Malaysia are engineering products and consumer goods, including glass, pianos and sporting and hunting equipment.
