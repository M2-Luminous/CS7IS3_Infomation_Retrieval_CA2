Shamil Basayev was born in 1965 in Chechnya. After serving as a firefighter in the Air Force he entered the Moscow Institute of Land Management. In 1988 he was dropped from the second course because of bad grades but he remained in Moscow until 1991. He worked, in his words, "as one of the Chechen cooperators" in a trade-intermediary limited liability partnership. At the beginning of 1991 he returned to his homeland and immediately entered the CPC forces. Just five days after the conflict in Abkhazia began he arrived there as chief of the first detachment of confederates. In January 1993 at a joint session of the Presidential Council and the Parliament of the CPC, Mr. Basayev was appointed commander of the CPC expeditionary corps in Abkhazia. He was assigned the duties of "coordinating, uniting, guiding into the necessary channels, and supervising the flow of arriving volunteers." Later confirmed by an edict of Vladislav Ardzinba in the position of deputy minister of defense in the Gudauta administration, Shamil Basayev stated that his rights extended only to the mountain volunteers--only a part, albeit an extremely significant one, of the Gudauta armed forces. It is Shamil Basayev's conviction that "It was in Russia's interests to have the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict grow into war so that both sides would be brought to their knees." The confederates knew ahead of time about the forthcoming introduction of a military contingent. He evaluates the Georgian troops as rabble who have to be called an army only because the Georgian Government has supplied them with uniforms and weapons." Georgia's defeat in the war is explained by the absence of order in the government and the army and the "whole idea--the idea of the sovereignty and unity of Georgia." In Mr. Basayev's words, Russia granted no military aid to Abkhazia. To the question of why the Russian Federation ministers of defense and foreign affairs did not deny the report about such aid, Mr. Basayev noted that he "cannot answer for all the babble that goes around Moscow." The weapons, including the latest costly tanks and aircraft, Mr. Basayev asserts, were purchased privately: "There are many ways of making money--why did Abkhazia need anybody's help? The CPC commander in chief personally has 18 automatic Kalashnikovs, one machine gun, and three pistols: "There are gobs of weapons in the Caucasus. In the Northern Caucasus everyone is looking for a weapon, they all buy them, but they will not fire!" In his opinion the Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus, which gives warning about many possible conflicts, can take credit for that. In the opinion of Shamil Basayev, the Fifth CPC Congress has transformed the Confederation's troops into "peacemaking forces."
