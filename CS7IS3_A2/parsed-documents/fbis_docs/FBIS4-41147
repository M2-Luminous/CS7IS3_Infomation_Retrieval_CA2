Immanuel Kant's Homeland: The Struggle of the Ideal and the Material"] [Excerpts] The problems of Kaliningrad Oblast do not allow politicians a minute's peace. Recently, the enclave was visited with a great fanfare by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who spoke at length about its strategic importance. However, Kaliningrad is also the district that gave the Federation Council its chairman, Vladimir Shumeyko. He ran there under the slogan of setting up a free economic zone, and an edict on creating it was signed by the president right after the votes were counted. Yesterday, the oblast's problems came to the attention of joint, carefully organized hearings of State Duma and Federation Council committees. Their leitmotiv was the politically low-risk, albeit hardly new, idea of making the oblast Russia's economic, political, and military outpost. [passage omitted] The Kaliningrad hearings could not, however, be contained within the limits of a purely economic discussion. Sensational reports were heard that Germany, Lithuania, and even Belarus have been recently calling -- so far unofficially -- for postwar borders to be redrawn, implying primarily Kaliningrad Oblast's alienation from Russia. The problem of having an enclave and protecting national interests finally came to dominate the statements of nearly all speakers. Historical exposes were also to be heard. One of the popular theses was that neither Lithuania (which has never owned Klaipeda and, moreover, received Vilno [Vilnius] only from the USSR), nor Germany, which lost the war, has the right to lay claim to the former East Prussia. A Foreign Ministry representative, who did not wish to keep aloof from the debate, recalled that it was Germany that sponsored the well-known resolution by the European Parliament on Kaliningrad in February. It stressed the enclave's "special nature" and emphasized the need to give it the right to forge direct ties with European structures. The Foreign Ministry, however, did not manage to avoid criticism. It was taken to task by the deputies for "bungling the opportunity" of granting extraterritorial status to the railroad connecting the oblast with the rest of Russia. The main result of the hearings was the recommendation to both parliament chambers that the drafting of a law on a special status for Kaliningrad Oblast should be considered a priority in their lawmaking activity in 1994. It cannot be ruled out that the consideration of the bill may acquire dialectical features: "Kantian idealism" (that is, political rhetoric) may sweep the State Duma owing to Zhirinovskiy's efforts, while entirely "Marxist materialism" may gain the upper hand (with Shumeyko's blessing) in the Senate.
