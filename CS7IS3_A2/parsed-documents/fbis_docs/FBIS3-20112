Mario Segni [Pact for Italy leader] was flanked by socialist former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato; Republican Secretary Giorgio La Malfa; Valerio Zanone, former Liberal Party secretary and chairman; and prospective Popular Party Secretary Buttiglione. "We are competing," the Pact leader said, "because in fact there is not a two-pole system; we represent the only government alliance. The rest are merely electoral alliances, a fraud. Neither of the two could form a solid government even if it did gain a majority." La Malfa, with his political expertise, drew journalists' attention to the physical presence of the center. "As you can see, there are a lot of us at this table; and we are all here together. The others cannot do this, however, neither on the Right nor on the Left. This is the proof that the two poles do not exist." With the help of some slides from the marketing bureau experts, which were shown and commented on by economist Mario Baldassarri, the Pact highlighted what it considers its adversaries' weak points. Forza Italia has presented 39 proposals for tax reductions and spending increases. That would cause the public deficit to increase from 160 to 220 trillion lire, while the ratio of the debit against GDP would rise from 117 to 125 percent. According to the Pact's analysis, the pole of freedoms would bring us higher taxes, less development, and more unemployment. The center accused the National Alliance of pursuing "19th century style statism" and of intending to reintroduce corporations into the economy and into society. The League, however, was accused of having drawn up a "program for the republic of the Po Valley" that would grant greater powers to Milan than those currently held by Rome. The criticisms of the left-wing front were no less severe. According to the center, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] is presenting "unacceptable and statist proposals"; it is advocating "real socialism in inexorable installments"; it threatens to increase fiscal pressure to 50 percent. As for Communist Renewal, according to the Pact, it still embodies the old paradox of the "party of struggle and of government." In other words, its internal inconsistencies concern not only tax on treasury bills but also our exit from NATO. In their exchange with foreign journalists, Segni and his group strongly emphasized that their alignment represents the utmost renewal. "It was I," the promoter of the "yes" vote proudly recalled, "who promoted the referendums and who set this process in motion." Furthermore, there has been such extensive renewal within the Pact's ranks that 85 percent of its candidates are not former parliamentarians but ordinary members of society: One of the prominent figures at the conference table was university lecturer Augusto Fantozzi, considered one of Italy's top tax experts, who is running for the Senate in Rome. Following these claims, it was natural that questions would center on the personal background of the speakers, from Segni to Guiliano Amato, from La Malfa to Zanone, all representatives and survivors of the First Republic. Former Prime Minister Amato made it clear that his decision to withdraw from politics was an entirely personal one: "I have not put myself in quarantine, and I intend to contribute to the change, both as a citizen and as an academic." As for La Malfa and Zanone, it is well known that the former has relinquished his candidacy, while the latter is running for the Senate in a particularly difficult constituency -- central Turin -- in order to counter "a right that is liberal-democratic in name alone." "The institutional reform is still only half finished," Segni said in order to explain the transition, stressing the need to change the electoral law by introducing two rounds and the direct election of the prime minister. The Pact leader, the center's candidate to the prime ministership, is still the only politician officially in the race for the premiership, and it is perhaps partly for that reason that he says repeatedly that "the vote for the center is not a wasted vote," since "it excludes the extremes" and averts the danger of Gianfranco Fini's [Italian Social Movement and National Alliance leader] entering the government, or the PDS and Communist Renewal together.
