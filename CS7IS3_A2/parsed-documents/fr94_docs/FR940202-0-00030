Thus, the total gross receipts are 43 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4.5 million) is greater than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($43 million×10%=$4.3 million). Therefore, there is a substantial valuation misstatement. Example 4. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return for the taxable year: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) Attributable to Member A $1,500,000 (2) Attributable to Member B 3,000,000 (3) Attributable to Member C 2,500,000 n,s Total section 482 adjustments 7,000,000 (ii) Members A, B, and C have gross receipts of 20 million dollars, 35 million dollars, and 40 million dollars, respectively. Thus, the total gross receipts are 95 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment (7 million dollars) is greater than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($95 million×10%=$9.5 million). Therefore, there is a substantial valuation misstatement. Example 5. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return for the taxable year: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) Attributable to Member A $2,000,000 (2) Attributable to Member B 1,000,000 (3) Attributable to Member C 1,500,000 n,s Total section 482 adjustments 4,500,000 (ii) Members A, B, and C have gross receipts of 10 million dollars, 35 million dollars, and 40 million dollars, respectively. Thus, the total gross receipts are 85 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4.5 million) is less than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($85 million×10%=$8.5 million). Therefore, there is no substantial valuation misstatement even though individual member A's adjustment ($2 million) is greater than ten percent of its individual gross receipts ($10 million×10%=$1 million). (d) Amounts excluded from net section 482 adjustments_ (1) In general. An amount is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the requirements of paragraph (d)(2), (3), or (4) of this section are met with respect to that amount. (2) Application of a specified section 482 method _(i) In general. An amount is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer establishes that both the specified method and documentation requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) are met with respect to that amount. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a method will be considered a specified method if it is described in the regulations under section 482 and the method applies to transactions of the type under review. A bona fide cost sharing arrangement is considered a specified method. See §1.482&hyph;2A(d)(4). An unspecified method is not considered a specified method. See §1.482&hyph;3T(e) and §1.482&hyph;4T(d). (ii) Specified method requirement. The specified method requirement is met if the taxpayer selects and applies a specified method in a reasonable manner. The taxpayer's selection and application of a specified method is reasonable only if, given the available data and the applicable pricing methods, the taxpayer reasonably concluded that the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in §1.482&hyph;1T(b)(2)(iii). For examples illustrating the selection of a specified method consistent with this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), see §1.482&hyph;1T(b)(2)(iii)(C). An application of a specified method provides the most accurate measure of an arm's length result if it provides a more accurate measure of an arm's length result than any alternative specified method and any alternative application of the method chosen. Thus, it is not necessary for a taxpayer to conclude that the selected specified method provides a more accurate measure of an arm's length result than any unspecified method. Whether the taxpayer's conclusion was reasonable must be determined from all the facts and circumstances. The factors relevant to this determination include the following: (A) The experience and knowledge of the taxpayer, including all members of the taxpayer's controlled group. (B) The extent to which accurate data was available and the data was analyzed in a reasonable manner. A taxpayer must engage in a reasonably thorough search for the data necessary to determine which method should be selected and how it should be applied. Furthermore, a taxpayer must use the most current reliable data that is available before the return is filed. In this regard, the expense of collecting data relative to the dollar amount of the transactions in question is a factor that may be taken into account in determining the scope of a reasonably thorough search for data.
