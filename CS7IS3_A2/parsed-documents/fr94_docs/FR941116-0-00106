FR941116-0-00106 FR941116-0-00021 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043: I.D. 110894A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Apportionment of reserve. SUMMARY: NMFS is apportioning reserve to supplement the 1994 total allowable catch (TAC) specified for yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), November 9, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the TAC specified for yellowfin sole in the BSAI must be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve to continue directed fishing for this species. Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning 20,000 metric tons from the reserve to the TAC for yellowfin sole. This apportionment is consistent with ยง675.20(a)(2)(i) and does not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TAC is equal to or less than the specification of acceptable biological catch. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act and 50 CFR 675.20(b)(2), that good cause exists for waiving the opportunity for public comment and the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries are currently taking place that will be supplemented by this apportionment. Delaying the implementation of this action would be disruptive and costly to these ongoing operations. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: November 9, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
