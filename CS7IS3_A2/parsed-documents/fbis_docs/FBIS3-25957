Zheng Hongye, chairman of CCPIT, made the statement when interviewed by XINHUA recently. He said that in 1993, CCPIT's experimental work in this regard witnessed fruitful results, and it will try to standardize the practice. During the past year, CCPIT received over 180 overseas business delegations to China, up by 50 percent over the previous year, 12 of which came with their government leaders. Meanwhile, CCPIT provided various services for business people worldwide concerning exhibitions abroad, reception of overseas exhibitions to China, trade marks, patents and law, as well as promoting economic and trade ties between the two sides of the Taiwan straits and dealing with the Sino-U.S. most-favored-nations [MFN] issue. Zheng stated that CCPIT aims to promote Sino-foreign trade, introduce overseas investment and advanced technology and conduct activities of various forms in Sino-foreign economic and technological spheres, so as to enhance China's business ties with other countries and regions. So far, CCPIT has relations with over 360 business bodies in more than 160 countries and regions covering trade, commerce, finance, enterprises, industrial property rights, exhibitions, law and consultations. It also enjoys cooperative relations with relevant organizations in over 50 countries and has set up bilateral cooperative councils with some countries. CCPIT now has nearly 300 domestic branches and more than 20,000 enterprises as domestic members. With its network worldwide, the chairman noted, it will function better as a go-between for China's economic and trade relations with other countries and regions. As China's economy develops, China's non-governmental businesses will be more active and play a more important role in China's foreign trade. On Sino-U.S. trade relations, he said that although there are some frictions, the two economies are strongly complementary, adding that business people in the two countries are enthusiastic about Sino-U.S. business activities and hope the MFN status granted to China by the U.S. can be unconditionally extended. He continued that CCPIT is to push forward the development of Sino-U.S. business ties through non-governmental channels. On business exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, Zheng said that Taiwan's investment in China's mainland has risen during the past few years due to the economies on the two sides of the straits being complementary, though two-way business exchanges have not yet been realized. He hoped that the Taiwan authorities can help realize the two-way exchanges as soon as possible so as to enable business people from the Chinese mainland to visit Taiwan at an early date. If business disputes across the Straits can be solved through arbitration bodies, it will be conducive to the development of such exchanges, the chairman noted. He said that CCPIT is also facing challenges such as the role of CCPIT in building a socialist market economy, calling it "a new task". On this point, he said that CCPIT is to strengthen its coordination and service through self-reform to meet the demands of a new situation.
