FR940721-2-00027 FR940721-2-00019 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Chicago Operations Office; Financial Assistance Award; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute AGENCY: Energy. ACTION: Intent to award based on an unsolicited application. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announced that pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to provide additional funding and extend the budget period for Grant No. DE&hyph;FG02&hyph;91CE23810 based on an unsolicited application received from Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (ARTI) for Phase IV of the project, Materials Compatibility and Lubricant Research to Accelerate Introduction of CFC_Refrigerant Substitutes. The determination to extend this grant is based on the following information: A technical evaluation of the proposed project was performed pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and (e). The proposed project assists DOE in carrying out its mission of seeking alternative refrigerants for Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in refrigeration and insulation in an effort to reduce the deleterious effects of refrigeration chemicals on stratospheric ozone. ARTI has made available substantial and unique facilities and resources not available elsewhere. This includes considerable amounts of information that are proprietary to the member industries participating in the project. It is determined that the proposed project is meritorious in significantly improving the information data base upon which new refrigerants and lubricants can be selected, and refrigeration equipment can be designed to utilize these chemical compounds. The probability of success is extremely high due to the high level of industry participation and commitment to the effort, particularly cost sharing or in-kind support. The key personnel assigned to the project have capabilities critical to the accelerated development of alternative refrigerants and the refrigeration equipment required to effectively utilize these new chemical compounds. DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct such an effort. This effort is not considered suitable for competitive financial assistance. The DOE share of funding is estimated at $3,190,000 and ARTI's cost share is estimated at $226,493 for a two-year budget period estimated to be from September 30, 1994 through September 30, 1996.
