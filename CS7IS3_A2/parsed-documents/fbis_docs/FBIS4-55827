Commenting on the appeal issued to the Serb and Muslim sides last night by Yasushi Akashi, UN secretary general's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, calling on the warring sides to begin negotiations on a global cessation of hostilities, Karadzic said that the Muslim forces ar launching major offensive operations along the entire front.

Karadzic said that he does not know the details of Akashi's draft plan for an urgent cessation of hostilities, but he added that an earlier draft made by Akashi and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin represent a good basis for further negotiations.
