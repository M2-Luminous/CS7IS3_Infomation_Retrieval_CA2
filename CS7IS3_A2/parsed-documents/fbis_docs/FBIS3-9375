Although scheduled to start at 0930, this, the highest trade union forum, began its proceedings after a 45-minute delay. This was because of the late arrival of President Berisha, guest of honor at the congress. Berisha, whose office is a few yards from the Palace of Congresses where the BSPSh were meeting, entered the hall to applause, creating the kind of image we had long forgotten -- that of a political leader attending a trade union meeting. Berisha made his presence all the more strongly felt when he announced to the floor that he "had followed developments within the BSPSh with close attention." It is not known whether this phrase of the president may constitute a warning to the fractionist group within Xheka's "anticommunist" trade union. It could be the reason for the head of state's attendance at the BSPSh Congress. None of the separatists figured in the list of members of the Presidium who were to chair the plenary sessions. Three years after its foundation, the BSPSh finds itself on the verge of a split. Not even the opening speech made by veteran trade unionist Llukan Prifti could evoke the old days of ferment and struggle against communist governments. There were harsh words about "attempts at division" even in the report on the BSPSh's three years of work, delivered by BSPSh Secretary Vilson Qendro. According to Qendro, divisive individuals within the ranks of the trade union are incited by political parties who wish to take over the uncompromising struggle that the BSPSh is waging in the interests of workers. Qendro called them "the spawn of the dictatorship," and accused them of using "gangster methods" in their activities. Nevertheless, he did not mention any names in his speech. According to the report as delivered, the struggle of the BSPSh is now moving into a new phase. Its coalition with right-wing parties led to their assumption of power. The government has now reduced to a minimum its dialogue with the trade unions and parts of the legislation now approved can be considered antidemocratic. Meanwhile, according to Vilson Qendro, the BSPSh now demands wages linked to the inflation index, an end to lay-offs, and the distribution of national assets in the form of vouchers. The first sessions of the BSPSh Congress showed no signs of these conflicts, which will not, apparently, be made public this time either. The atmosphere in the hall and Berisha's greeting encouraging Xheka may finally have tilted the scales in favor of the present Presidium. The congress will continue its proceedings today, its second and final day.
