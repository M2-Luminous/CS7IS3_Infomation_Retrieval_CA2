On the Danger of Separatism in the Economy"] [Text] The simplest way to confuse any question is to introduce the principle of joint responsibility and joint administration. If several structures are concurrently answerable for the realization of some function, we may say with full assurance that confusion and muddle are guaranteed, and that in the "gaps" between the joint administration there will always be a place for abusers, for corruption and bribery. Considering the fact that certain regional administrators assume functions which are characteristic only of the state, the danger of emergence of a new separatism is quite real, and Article 72 of the Constitution will present us with many more surprises. The decline of the local soviets was characterized by a sharp increase in their politization and a striving toward so-called "sovereignty" to the detriment of their obvious tasks: The creation of conditions for normal life of their electors--the taxpayers. Many regional administrators even today believe that their sovereignty consists of "lowering" state functions to the level of the region, which after this appears to them as a reduced copy of the state. Then the policy of the region may, in their opinion, differ from the policy of the state, and especially the economic policy. This constitutes the primary error in some cases, and the fine calculation and intent in others. We will note that if there is an economic policy of the regions which differs from such policy of the state, then, in the normal understanding, the state simply does not exist. Regional administrations want first of all to permit and distribute, rather than to develop the rules of such distribution which are known and understandable to all, and under which the subjective decisions of bureaucrats will no longer be needed. Kamchatka Governor Biryukov, for example, believes that the oblast has not only its own economic policy, but also its own foreign economic policy. Attempting to hinder one of the enterprises in his oblast in obtaining permission for foreign economic activity, the governor writes to the minister of foreign economic relations: "The oblast administration categorically objects to the request by AO UTRF (the name of the enterprise), which runs counter to the foreign economic policy of the oblast." Can such a thing be? After all, foreign economic policy is an attribute only of state power, and it is reduced ultimately to developing principles of foreign economic interaction with various countries (preferential, common, discriminatory), concluding interstate treaties and agreements, and establishing a system of export-import tariffs and duties. Can the regions themselves develop such principles? Obviously not. Otherwise, that which is prohibited in one region will be done through another, and the unified economic space specified in the constitution will simply disappear. It is easy to note that the interests of individual regions may contradict each other. Here is the simplest example: A region which produces bread is interested in its export, while bread consuming regions are interested in having the bread remain in the country. Foreign economic policy is not the mechanical sum of the foreign economic interests of the regions and may exist only as an all-state policy, but one which takes into consideration the management-economic structure of the regions. Therefore, Mr. Biryukov's aspirations to his own specific oblast foreign economic policy are, in the very least, untenable. They are untenable and contradict the constitution, as well as the wishes of the participants of the Khabarovsk Kray administration collegium to prohibit the export of food and other goods from its territory. Moreover, the law on enterprises and entrepreneurial activity is contradicted by the desire of the deputy head of administration of Primorskiy Kray to set quotas on fishing primarily for those enterprises which "bring more benefit" to the kray. And, after all, he, Novikov, as the former secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee], knows better than others what is best for the kray. Having assumed all-state functions, the regions often make decisions which are fraught with grave consequences for several generations of their citizens. The reason for this is political infantilism and, evidently, serious personal interest. Here is a rather telling example. The governor of Sakhalin Oblast, Ye. Krasnoyarov, in his decree No. 284 dated 5 November 1993, granted the inter-regional joint-stock bank for economic cooperation (MABES) "Sakhalin-West", which had sprung up unexpectedly, was not known to anyone and not backed by its own assets, the status of a bank serving as an agent of the oblast administration for (and I quote) "organizing and coordinating work associated with the implementation of financing projects and programs for the socioeconomic development and reconstruction of Sakhalin and the Kurils." In section 3 of the decree, Ye. Krasnoyarov generously allocates the bank R100 million from the oblast budget (let us be frank--Sakhalin taxpayers' money) as the initial contribution to the MABES. As an aside, we will note that the firm which Krasnoyarov managed before he became governor, "Pilenga-Godo," was one of the founders of this bank. Thus, the generosity by oblast Governor Ye. Krasnoyarov was of benefit to one of the bank's founders--the entrepreneur Ye. Krasnoyarov. It is an interesting story in economic independence. But that is not all. One of the subsections of section 7 of the decree is addressed to the government with a request to allocate preferential credit to the bank in the sum of R5 billion for a term of 5 years at a rate of 20 percent per annum. Have you noted any state interests here? Or what about Sakhalin interests? Well, are Gaydar and Fedorov not correct when they say that those who are "gratified" by the public wealth will drag away the entire budget to preferential credits for themselves and their good friends? If someone has remembered about inflation now, it would not be bad to understand that this is one of its visible components. And there are many such smart governors in Russia. Let us proceed ferther, since the crowning touch is section 5 of the above-mentioned decree. It should be quoted in its entirety, since the "intent" of the neophyte of politics and economics has become clear to everyone: "5. To allocate to the MABES `Sakhalin-West' as a guaranteed security for obtaining foreign currency credit along the bank's existing credit line the export goods and raw material resources (fish and marine products, timber, oil, metals, etc.) which are at the disposal of the oblast administration's territorial fund, as well as undeveloped mineral deposits (oil, coal, zeolite, facing stone, etc.), uncut forest areas and other raw material resources in the oblast in accordance with the established procedure." Section 6, which provides for the annual allocation of R1 billion and $2.5 million to the bank from the oblast budget, appears as an innocent prank next to this. Up until now, I believed that banks, "trading" in money, must themselves create their own assets and then give credit to interested parties at the appropriate interest rates. After Krasnoyarov's decree, I began to doubt this. We may hope that the underlying meaning of the governor's decree is understandable even to those who are not experienced in politics and economics. If a bank, having received many millions in foreign credit, "suddenly" finds itself insolvent, then everything that is listed in the above-mentioned section 5 will become the property of the foreign creditor or will demand immediate repayment of the credit from the state budget, i.e., at our, the taxpayers', expense. Are there any other questions about Ye. Krasnoyarov? Perhaps only for the president's administration. After all, their appointments are too "exact." Ye. Krasnoyarov is by no means the only one. And so the doubt arises: Will such governors not drag the country away piece by piece? Is this not where the most refined separatism is formulated, which is indulged by certain federal departments, pursuing their own not quite unselfish interests? In connection with the tendency to assume someone else's functions, we will try to understand what the economic sovereignty of regions ultimately consists of. The fact is that we have always lived in a system where, due to the actual confiscation of the surplus product and taxes, all the funds collected by this method went into the highest level budget, and were then distributed by regions on the basis of "plan" guidelines. It is necessary to re-create the principle under which each region will supply itself with all that is necessary (by producing or buying). After all, living in a country, republic or oblast, we are in fact living in an entirely specific region. It is only here that we need a home, municipal services, roads and schools. What good are statements to the effect that we have free education if there is no school in a specific village? Can Bratsk develop normally if out of the R100 billion in taxes collected here it gets only R20 billion? Improvements are possible if the very concept of taxes includes the principle of their divergence, or payments made by the lower budgets to the higher ones. Under such a tax structure, the regions on whose territory billions of rubles worth of products are produced will cease to be constant humble supplicants. It is obvious that only the rich regions are able to support central administrative organs, an army and other structures. At the same time, the state expenses themselves must be significantly reduced. It seems, however, that the economic sovereignty of regions consists only of the right to collect taxes and use them for the benefit of the citizens living on their territory. This is really a basic necessity, because it is imprudent to collect taxes in the regions, to "take" them to Moscow, and then to distribute them throughout the regions as budget allocations or subsidies. Other economic functions belong either to the state, or to the enterprises. The task of the local administrations, then, is not to "drag and prohibit," but to create such conditions under which the effect from the activity of enterprises and citizen taxpayers would be maximal. There is no need, and it is simply dangerous, to equate state regalia to the uniform of the region. Moscow Mayor Luzhkov once said about himself: I am an economic manager! These are the right words. Especially now, when most of the managers of the regions are former directors who think that the state is simply a large factory or kolkhoz [collective farm]. The Gaydars and Fedorovs know what buttons to push in order to get the necessary result thousands of kilometers away from the "control panel." This is economics. We, the "wise" voters, have with our votes helped to remove market economists from management of the economy. If we are now controlled by the Biryukovs and the Krasnoyarovs, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
