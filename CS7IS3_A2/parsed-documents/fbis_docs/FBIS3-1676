Commenting on Bangladesh-Chinese relations, he said: China is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. Bangladesh cherishes the Bangladesh-Chinese friendship very much. As time passes, this friendship will continually and steadily develop. Mustafizur Rahman highly commended China for its accomplishments in reform and opening up to the outside world. He said he believed that China will play an increasingly important role in international trade and economic relations. He held that China's rapidly increasing importance in international economic relations will be conducive to further improving the global situation. He indicated: The Bangladesh people will continue to cooperate with the Chinese people and will make joint efforts to build a righteous [gong zheng 0361 2973], fair, and peaceful world. In his speech, Qian Qichen said that as friendly neighbors, China and Bangladesh enjoy a profound, traditional friendship. To develop friendly relations and cooperation with Bangladesh is a firm policy of the Chinese Government. Commenting on international relations issues, Qian Qichen pointed out: Since the end of the cold war, the world has been progressing toward multipolarization, and international relations have undergone some positive changes. However, we have yet to attain peace and development, which are the two main themes facing mankind. At present, invigorating the economy has become the common aspiration of peoples of various countries, and giving priority to economic progress is becoming a main factor influencing the development of international relations. Developing countries should strengthen coordination and cooperation, should preserve peace and stability, should promote common economic growth, and should make active efforts to establish a new international political and economic order. Qian Qichen expressed his hope: Based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and guided by the spirit of mutual respect and holding consultations on an equal footing, various countries in South Asia will properly resolve existing problems among themselves so as to further enhance regional stability and prosperity. Qian Qichen also refuted allegations spread by certain people about the so-called "China threat" and about China's expansion into the Indian Ocean. He stressed: China has been pursuing unswervingly an independent foreign policy of peace and will never seek hegemony. He said: China will not attempt to establish a sphere of influence or build a military base in any part of the world. China is and will remain a force for preserving world peace and stability. Senior Bangladesh Government officials, Army and Navy generals, friendly figures, and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Xujiang attended the banquet.
