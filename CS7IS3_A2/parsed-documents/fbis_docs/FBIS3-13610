A statement issued by the group said that "the U.S. President's recent statements reflect his continued support for the Zionist enemy's racist and settlement policy. Proof of this is the U.S. Administration's position at the Security Council and its obstruction of merely a statement condemning the ugly massacre committed by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed what the Zionist settler had done, namely the murder of 40 worshipers, and have since themselves killed over 50 people so far." The statement said: "The peoples of the Islamic world view with great anger the U.S. Administration's position, which treats the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem with contempt." The statement urged the Islamic nation "to condemn the U.S. position on the Palestinian issue and express popular anger at this position, which is totally biased toward the Zionist enemy." Concluding the statement, the Muslim Brotherhood group said: "We remind the U.S. Administration that its interests are linked with the peoples of the Islamic world. It is impossible for the current situation to continue as it stands. Ignoring the Arabs' and Muslims' rights in Palestine, in particular holy Jerusalem, negates the United States' neutrality and possible mediation in resolving the Palestinian issue -- which is clearly reflected in the current negotiations."
