The report begins by saying that "Pemex announced on 3 March that the drop in the price of hydrocarbons on the international market does not create the right conditions for the federal government to place pretrochemical plants on sale this year." The report adds that "Pemex believes in 1994 the oil sector in general will experience the worst period in recent history and predicts that both prices and profitability in the sector could be even lower due to the high surplus already in existence in international supplies, which will lower the final value of plants." Therefore, the report notes, "the government has decided that the privatization of the state-run petrochemical industry will be the responsibility of the next government, as an increase in the price of goods and services is expected by 1995." After analyzing possible strategies Pemex could follow to improve its financial situation, the article says government officials have said "investments in the petrochemical sector will continue normally," adding that "investments along the lines of 135 million new pesos are planned this year, part of which will be channeled to strategic projects." Finally, the report cites official sources saying that "an increase in the import of petrochemical products reflects a tendency in world trade, as countries like Germany, the United States, Japan, and France have become large importers even though they are also the largest producers."
