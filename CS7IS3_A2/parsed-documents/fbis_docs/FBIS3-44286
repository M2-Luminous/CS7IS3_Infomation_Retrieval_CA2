Chien said he has received no reports about the matter from the Lesotho Government or from ROC diplomatic workers stationed in the African nation. Chien admitted, however, that the ROC Government has tried its best to improve relations with the new Lesotho government which took the power in April this year after a general election. "Pitifully, the efforts were made in vain," he said. Lesotho resumed diplomatic relations with the Republic of China and broke ties with Beijing in April 1990. After that time, Chien said Beijing officials maintained contacts with and extended financial aid to exiled parliamentarians from the Basotho Congressional Party (BCP) there. The return of exiled BCP parliamentarians and losses suffered by pro-ROC lawmakers in April 1993 elections resulted in the abrupt change in Lesotho's political stage this year, Chien explained. Meanwhile, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) reported Thursday that Lesotho's break in diplomatic relations with the ROC was caused by an alleged attempt by two ROC citizens to bribe two Lesotho cabinet ministers. Chien called the report "groundless." However, Chien explained that the ROC Government contributed financial aid to Lesotho, Swaziland and Malawi last year when the three African countries were hard hit by drought.
