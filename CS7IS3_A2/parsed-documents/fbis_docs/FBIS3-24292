On the one hand, this stems from the fact that the conduits of American foreign policy have found out that a number of new independent states can play a visible role in the international arena. This comes first and foremost from these states' claims on entire components of the Soviet nuclear legacy. Ukraine and Kazakhstan have demonstrated that they are in no hurry to fulfill their commitments to turn into non-nuclear states. The Lisbon protocol on nuclear arms, in keeping with which Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus were supposed to become non-nuclear states, remained unimplemented. A real prospect emerged of the former Soviet republics nationalizing not only conventional arms and armed forces, but also strategic nuclear arms. These arms would enable Ukraine and Kazakhstan to become major nuclear powers and to a certain extent (since intercontinental ballistic missiles on their territory were intended during the Soviet period for the conduct of war against the United States) to present a threat to the United States as well. It was the realization of a possible development of events along this scenario that prompted the Clinton administration to develop a more active policy in this direction, using mostly "the carrot method." One has to say that the leaders of Kazakhstan and Ukraine have been quite successful in using the United States' interest in resolving this issue to obtain the economic and political support they need and raise their status in the international arena. In the case of Kazakhstan, President Nazarbayev's willingness to sign a nuclear nonproliferation treaty opened him the door to the White House. The Ukrainian position turned out more controversial. At the trilateral meeting of Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk in Moscow in January of this year, Ukraine reaffirmed its commitment to give up nuclear weapons, but has managed to successfully avoid precise formulae that would specify the time frame for making good on this commitment. It took additional efforts on the part of American diplomacy, including doubling the volume of economic aid that will be provided to Ukraine--to $700 million--to get President Kravchuk to give more precise assurances regarding keeping his old promises during his visit to Washington. The second factor that compelled Washington to invite the leaders of several new independent states is the emergence of a sort of an instability belt on the territory of some former Soviet republics. Acute political conflicts and civil wars in a number of them are beginning to affect the international situation as a whole. These conflicts are taking place along with the bloody war in Yugoslavia and show that with the end of the Cold War a greater part of the former socialist countries may become seats of tension, undermining the stability of the entire system of international relations. At the same time, Washington is very suspicious of Russia's attempts to take upon itself the functions of a guarantor of peace and stability in the CIS countries, including the use of military means. The participation of the Russian Armed Forces in peacekeeping operations in the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Tajikistan raises fears in Washington that our country may be trying to restore the empire. Many American politicians demand of the Clinton administration to make it clear to Russia that restoration of the empire by force is impermissible. Shevardnadze's visit to Washington is a testimony to the United States' willingness to take a more active position with respect to conflicts on the CIS territory, and in particular in the Transcaucasus. Such an approach may eventually produce considerable problems in Russian-American relations. After all, Russia today claims at an official level a "special role" in the CIS, proclaiming practically all the former Soviet republics a zone of its vitally important interests. Naturally, the entry of a third country into Russia's bilateral relations with Georgia or any other republic will be perceived in Moscow with great dismay, even if that third country is the United States, with which Russia is, as was announced at the latest summit, in a "mature strategic partnership." Judging by all signs, there has emerged a considerable gap between the declarations of strategic partnership between Russia and the United States and the real mechanism of interaction between the two states, a mechanism for reaching agreement on their interests. It appears that this gap not only is not diminishing, but keeps growing, making relations between two former Cold War adversaries extremely fragile. As the scandal in connection with the arrest of the Ames family on the charges of espionage in Washington showed, despite assurances of strategic partnership, Russian-American relations may be turned back and enter a period of cooling and alienation. And the recent visits to Washington of the presidents of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Georgia may present a cause for further complications in the relations between Moscow and Washington.
