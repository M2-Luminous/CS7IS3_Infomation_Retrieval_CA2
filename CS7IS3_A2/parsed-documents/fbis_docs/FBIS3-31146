A delegate from Elbasan, who did not agree with the dissolving of this commission, said that it's early to undertake such an action, but one of the leaders of the party, Mr. Gramoz Ruci argued that this is the opinion of specialists and the majority of the leading council of the Socialist Party. The leading committee of the party will set up basic party organizations even abroad in accordance with the foreign laws. The delegates who discussed in the conference supported the request of the Socialist Party for premature elections, for the functioning of the round table of the parties as well as for the release of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano, who is in prison since July last year, accused for corruption in the case of the Italian aid granted to Albania during the time he was the premier of the country.
