Its main function was to coordinate the activity of the Ministries of Communications of the Union republics in the sphere of organization of intercity and international communications. After the breakup of the USSR, Sovtelekom was reorganized into Intertelekom, whose founders remained the Ministries of Communications of the CIS countries. However, Intertelekom did not last long--until the Minsk conference of the heads of state of the CIS in December 1993. The reason for its "demise" was the registration in September of that same year of the joint-stock company Rostelekom, which the Russian part of Intertelekom joined. In the words of Mr. Belov, general director of the Rostelekom joint-stock company, the three stages of the development of the company personify the old Russian saying: "The first son is for God, the second is for the Tsar, but the third is for my support." [end boxed item] Yesterday in Moscow's President Hotel, Vladimir Bulgak, minister of communications of the Russian Federation, awarded the Rostelekom joint-stock company a license to provide intercity and international communications services on the territory of Russia. The baptism of the new enterprise, which was registered in September of last year, was held in the Uspenskaya Church of the Novodevichiy Monastery. Rostelekom acquired priority right to the development of a digital communications system in Russia. In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the Ministry of Communications preferred the Western path of development of the industry, in which all the company operators that provide communications services function on a commercial basis, and the ministry retains for itself only regulatory functions. About 20 international operators are now functioning in Russia. In addition, Rostelekom enjoys the obvious preference of the Ministry of Communications. As Mr. Bulgak declared, "all flowers should grow, but Rostelekom will be the main bunch of flowers in the flower bed planted by the ministry." Thus, given sensible protectionism on the part of the Ministry of Communications, great prospects obviously await it. It would be possible to bring the Russian communications system up to the world level by means of a gradual replacement of the existing analog network by a modern digital network; however, in the words of Mr. Bulgak, the construction of a parallel digital network will be cheaper by a factor of four to five. In the first stage of the creation of a modern Russian digital system of international communications, Rostelekom in April 1993 built its western Moscow-St. Petersburg-Copenhagen sector. As Rostelekom's General Director Oleg Belov reported, the joint-stock company is now performing work on the eastern and southern sectors of this system. To complete the eastern project by the end of 1994, which includes the construction of a Russia-Japan-Korea submarine fiber-optic cable line, a main Nakhodka-Khabarovsk line, and an international telephone station in Khabarovsk will require more than $50 million and 30 billion rubles [R]. The southern project will connect the fiber-optic lines of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Italy (the volume of investments will total about $50 million and R70 billion). The establishment of the Moscow-Khabarovsk digital line will unite the western, eastern, and southern sectors, and will guarantee the receipt of income from the international traffic between Europe and Asia. The construction of this line will cost $220 million and R125 billion. It is planned to complete all projects in 1996. In addition, for the general "digitization" of Russia, the Rostelekom joint-stock company plans to build 50 new international stations and 50,000 kilometers of digital fiber-optic and radio relay lines starting in 1995. This project, which has been given the name "50 x 50" is calculated for 10 years and will require $15 billion and no less an amount of rubles. In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the joint-stock company is the structure that is capable of attracting such resources, inasmuch as no one will invest in a state company other than, perhaps, the government. After the presentation in the President Hotel, its participants (including guests from 27 foreign firms) set off for Uspenskaya Church where a church service was held in honor of Rostelekom's being granted a license. It is possible that this is tied in with the date of the event--13 January--although the license itself absolutely fortuitously has the lucky number 777.
