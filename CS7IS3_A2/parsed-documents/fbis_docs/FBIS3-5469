He added that in a meeting which focused on external economic activities held earlier this year, the government emphasised improving and simplifying investment procedures so that investors would have less trouble in applying for investment licence. The law on foreign investment introduced in 1987, is considered of the more open compared with several other countries in the region. However, rules governing investment procedures are very complicated, taking much time and creating a lot of trouble for investors. At the moment it takes about six months or even a year to get a project licensed, often having to be submitted to up to as many as 10 authorised offices for approval. The meeting, Mr Xuan said, also discussed measures to secure the implementation of the licensed projects. It affirmed that great efforts should be made in 1994 to make the investment environment in Vietnam more favourable. Regarding the export processing zones (EPZ), Mr Xuan said there was nothing to worry about the matter of losing the nation's sovereignty (as a number of people once believed) when opening EPZs. It depends on the state management in EPZs on Vietnam's laws. The most important thing is to create favourable conditions to attract more investment into the EPZs. Mr Xuan further said that the setting up Tan Thuan EPZ (Ho Chi Minh City) had the potential to be successful. To date investors had registered to establish their enterprises, factories and companies in more than half of the available area. Other EPZs such as ones in Linh Trung (Da Nang), Haiphong and Soc Son (Hanoi) are expected to be successfully formed.
