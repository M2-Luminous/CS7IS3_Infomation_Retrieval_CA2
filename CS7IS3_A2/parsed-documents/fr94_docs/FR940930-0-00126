FR940930-0-00126 FR940930-0-00025 The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plants set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to Tetramolopium capillare , all of the prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issued. The species is not common in the wild and is only rarely cultivated. Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Office, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). Tetramolopium capillare is not presently listed as an endangered species by the State of Hawaii. Both populations of this species occur on State land. Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species act. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). State law prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4). State laws relating to the conservation of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). The State also may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Conservation district lands are regarded, among other purposes, as necessary for the protection of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Requests for amendments to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private landowners (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is mandated to initiate changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora and fauna within the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5.1). Hawaii environmental policy, and thus approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``*␣*␣* the State's unique natural environmental characteristics *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``Protect endangered species of individual plants and animals *␣*␣*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). Federal listing, because it results in State listing, also triggers these other State regulations protecting Tetramolopium capillare . Listing under the Federal Act would also provide additional protection to this species by making it an offense for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
