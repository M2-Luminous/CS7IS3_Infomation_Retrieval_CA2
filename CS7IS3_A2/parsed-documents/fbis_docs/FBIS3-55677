Both generals have been sent back to Russia on the orders of Andrejs Rucs, the chairman of the local government of Vidzeme district of Riga, when representatives of the local government went to a property of the house management enterprise of the Russian Army at 9 Krusta Baznicas Street this morning in order to take it over according to the local government's resolution. Taylakov and Vodopyanov threatened to set guards at this and two other sites due to be taken over, but as the sites were already under control of the Home Guard, Rucs decided to send the generals out from Latvia to avoid incidents. Rita Aksenoka, aide to the prosecutor general, reports that corpus delicti can be seen in the action by the local government officials. The proceedings were instigated according to Clause 162 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Latvia, which deals with abuses of power and authority, and Clause 125, which deals with illegal detention. The case is being investigated by the prosecutor's office's department for particularly serious cases. Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring the Russian troop withdrawal, reports that both generals have already returned to Riga. According to the LETA news agency, Russia has discontinued the talks on troop withdrawal from Latvia in this connection.
