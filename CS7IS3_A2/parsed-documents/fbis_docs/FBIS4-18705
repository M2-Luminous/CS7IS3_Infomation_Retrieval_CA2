Next will be Turkey as a whole." This statement was made by Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan... That is how he addressed the jubilant supporters of his party, who were rejoicing over their political party's victory in the local elections. Erbakan's speech was covered by the television networks. Scenes from rallies were shown during his speech, scenes recalling those after Imam Khomeyni's Islamic Revolution in Iran. This heightened the uneasiness in the people who watched the Erbakan events on their television screens. The claim that the Prosperity Party doubled its votes is wrong; it increased its votes by three percent. Nevertheless, the fact that its supporters are concentrated in large cities had a bearing on the outcome of the local elections. Erbakan's statement that they have "liberated Ankara and Istanbul" has created anxiety in the broad masses, that is, the other 81 percent of the people. The question that is being asked is: From whom have they liberated Ankara and Istanbul? Obviously, 81 percent of the people did not regard themselves as prisoners of a foreign and hostile force until yesterday. Is it that this man who claims that they have "liberated Ankara and Istanbul" wishes to announce that the ideology he represents has become widespread in the country? Both a Muslim and a Democrat The Prosperity Party's supporters have complained about an increase in provocative activities aimed at deepening the anxiety of the people and describing that party as a bogeyman. Their complaint is justified. However, they must remember that they have to take an understanding approach if they wish to be treated with understanding. No one can describe the jubilant feeling of the supporters of the Prosperity Party as being excessive--that is, provided they behave and avoid disrespect for the values that make Turkey a free and modern country.... We can still recall the appalling incidents during the victory rallies held by the Republican People's Party supporters in the 1970's. However, jubilation must not be allowed to create a wave of confrontation. We have a difficult transition period ahead of us. It will be a matter of honor for the Turkish people to prove that the Islamic faith can be maintained in a democracy. It will be an opportunity for the local administrations to deal with this difficult era without serious problems. The Turkish people cannot abandon their freedoms. They cannot achieve the level of prosperity they deserve by regarding half of the world as their enemy and turning their backs on it. If the Prosperity Party's concept of a Just Order paves the ground for green Communism [Communism under the guise of religion] and if the mayoral offices that have been taken over by that party act in a way reminiscent of despotic Arab behavior, the Prosperity Party's fate will definitely be similar to that of the Social Democratic Populist Party, which scored a significant victory in the local elections in 1989 but suffered a serious defeat in the 1991 general elections. Our Democracy is Durable No one must fear the Prosperity Party. We must not be daunted by religious people who get organized. Nor should we be daunted by the attire they choose to wear, attire which we believe represents horrible regimes. Those people have not come from Iran, Iraq, or Libya. Furthermore, neither they nor those who disagree with them will leave this country. We shall all coexist. Many people behaved in an unruly way after the Democratic Party come to power in 1950. They offended each other with their vengeful activities. Furthermore, they challenged those who tried to limit them by saying "there is democracy in this country." However, 40 years have passed since then and Turkey's democracy has matured. Obviously, from time to time we forget that fact and become emotional and worried. In view of this, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu's statement, which was carried by SABAH yesterday, has been very useful. He eased people's anxiety and, as an experienced administrator, gave a lesson to the mayors who support the Prosperity Party on their duties and powers. Governor Kozakcioglu is a Good Example The Prosperity Party's officials and supporters have not won a victory against the state, nation, and democracy. In fact, they owe their victory to the state, nation, and democracy. Their success will depend on the respect they show for those values. It is true that the people have given them the stage. However, they will be removed by the people if they fail to realize that fact. Before that, however, they will confront the laws of this country. The worried majority of the masses were reassured by Governor Kozakcioglu's statement that interference in the people's daily life, the way people dress, and the people's rights and freedoms will be penalized and that the people, state, and contemporary way of life are not unprotected. The statement was also designed to save the Prosperity Party from paying dearly for the activities of ignorant and unruly individuals who misunderstand democracy. Kozakcigolu is a good example of the daring and able governors our country needs at the present time.... We hope that the officials who have graduated from schools for clergymen and preachers will also regard him as an example.
