It is basically a matter of having the necessary ministries and organizations and eliminating superfluity from the administrative apparatus. What was adopted, following an analysis of our realities, is what is needed today in a sovereign decision that reflects the people's political and technical will. What is sought with this measure, in short, is to begin to shape a more agile, operational, expedient, and skilled central state administration. This measure has nothing to do with prevailing neoliberal guidelines that ask Third World countries to cannibalize the state to benefit an idyllically conceived and managed free enterprise supposedly beyond class interests, multinationals, and global hegemonic hubs of power. The goal of the reorganization of our central administrative bodies is to improve the operation of a state which responds to the interests of the majority with a clear and specific understanding of the interests it serves, which are none other than those of the working people. It is obvious that if one of the basic priorities of the specific reality we face is to stimulate the economy and boost efficiency, the Ministries of Economy and Planning and of Finances and Prices have to absorb certain organizations and institutions linked to those priority activities. The same is happening with another priority activity of our economy, tourism. If, because of current circumstances and in an irreversible manner, we have to rely on foreign investment under the conditions established by the Cuban state, including economic cooperation, this endeavor has to have a dynamic and efficient ministry to steer this effort. In essence, the reorganization of the bodies of the state's central administration is a measure which responds to the demands of today's reality, the needs we have to face in the special period in a world we cannot change and into which we have to incorporate ourselves in terms of trade, finance, and certain economic relations, without relinquishing our cardinal principles and the altruistic goals of our sociopolitical project.
