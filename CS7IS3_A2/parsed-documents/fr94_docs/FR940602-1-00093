FR940602-1-00093 FR940602-1-00014 EPA evaluated the option of allowing State siting meetings to substitute for the pre-application meeting, and, for the reasons discussed above, decided not to include it in today's proposal. However, the Agency is requesting comments on this issue. Specifically, the Agency would like to hear comments on reasons for or against allowing State siting meetings to automatically substitute for the pre-application meeting. c. Applicability of the public notice at permit application. The requirements for the permitting authority to provide public notice when it receives a permit application, like the pre-application meeting requirement, would not apply to permit modifications, because similar requirements already exist for both class 2 and class 3 permit modifications that would make the requirement redundant. Specifically, under ยง270.42 (b)(2) and (c)(2), the permittee must send a notice of the modification request to all persons on the facility mailing list and publish the notice in a major local newspaper. The notice is required to give, among other things, the location where copies of the modification request and any supporting documents can be read and copied. EPA believes that this requirement effectively substitutes for the public notice at application in the case of permit modifications. Unlike the pre-application meeting requirement, the public notice requirement will apply to permit renewals. A public notice for permit renewals is appropriate because the renewal application may be significantly different from the original permit application, warranting early public involvement. For example, facilities may decide to propose major changes, such as addition of a new unit, at the time of permit renewal, separate from any modifications processed during its original permit. In this situation, the results would be an application that is new in certain key respects. The permitting authority should give the public the same notification as it would for a new permit application, even though the public may already be familiar with the general scope of operations at the facility. In addition, since permit renewals generally occur 5 to 10 years after a facility is permitted and operating, a notice of the permit renewal alerts the public to the fact that the facility plans to continue operating. A public notice at permit renewal also would allow the public to compare changes between the initial approved permit and the permit renewal application to determine the magnitude of any proposed changes. Finally, the notice could serve as a mechanism for updating the facility mailing list, which may not contain a thorough list of people who are interested in the facility. The requirements for the pre-application meeting and the notice at permit application would not apply to post-closure permits. Post-closure permit applications raise a narrower set of issues and a narrower range of alternatives. The public may be adequately involved through notices at the draft permit stage. Furthermore, the post-closure period does not involve the same ongoing relationship between the facility and the community as the operating period. EPA is requesting comments on whether current requirements are adequate to ensure public involvement, or whether today's proposed requirements for public notice at application submittal should apply to post-closure permits. d. Applicability of the information repository. The information repository is a public participation tool that the permitting authority can use at any time during the permit process. As proposed, the permitting authority may require the facility to establish a repository during the permit review process for a new facility, or at any time during the life of a facility when the Director determines a repository is warranted due to significant public interest in the facility. The need for an information repository will be decided by the Director, based on decision criteria discussed elsewhere in today's preamble. It is important to have a repository requirement that the Director can adapt to different facility situations and public information needs. Thus, the Agency has allowed the Director the flexibility to decide whether and when a repository is established, for what activity, how long it must be maintained, and where it is housed. 5. Detailed Discussion on the Proposed Public Involvement Requirements a. General considerations regarding public notices. EPA is proposing new requirements for public notice in order to address public concern that community members are sometimes unaware of hazardous waste permitting activities or that public notice about a facility comes too late in the RCRA process. EPA believes that appropriate public notice is necessary to fully inform communities and involve them in permitting decisions involving hazardous waste facilities. By appropriate public notice, the Agency means that sufficient information is provided in a timely manner to all segments of the public throughout the permit process. Towards this end, EPA is proposing additional public notices throughout the permit process. These new notices will require the permitting authority to notify the public when it reaches certain points in the permitting process (e.g., application submittal, prior to a trial burn). This provision will give the public the opportunity to become involved in the decision-making process. As a result, the public may become more informed about the various steps of the permit process and the time requirements of each step. Similarly, a widely-distributed notice may reach interested individuals who otherwise may not have known about the opportunity to be on the facility mailing list. To address this issue, EPA is proposing requirements under ยง124.31(c)(1) concerning the distribution of the public notice for the pre-application meeting. This notice will be the first activity required by the RCRA permit process; EPA believes that stronger requirements resulting in a wider initial outreach are appropriate at this juncture. EPA is not proposing that implementing agencies follow the new distribution requirements for subsequent notices. Such a requirement would be redundant since, as a result of the widely distributed notice of the pre-application meeting, the permitting authority would have a list of interested people that it could contact as part of the mailing list. The Agency recognizes that the means by which a notice is effectively distributed is highly community-specific. The permitting authority may find any of a variety of distribution mechanisms effective, depending upon such factors as population density, geographic location, expanse, and cultural diversity of a community, when such mechanisms are used in conjunction with required notice activities. EPA has learned, through discussions with States, Regions, and outside parties (environmental and industry organizations), of a number of mechanisms for distributing notices. Facilities and agencies may voluntarily use the methods that are most practical for disseminating information throughout their community. Several of these methods that go beyond today's proposed requirements, and which may be voluntarily implemented, are discussed below: Press releases. Permitting authorities and industry alike have used press releases to successfully alert the local community to specific activities. A press release to one paper may be picked up by other local papers with no cost to the original party. Press releases have the advantage of providing in-depth coverage of a subject in a forum that can be widely distributed within a short timeframe. 40 CFR 124.10(c) specifically cites press releases as a method that permitting authorities can use to promote public participation.
