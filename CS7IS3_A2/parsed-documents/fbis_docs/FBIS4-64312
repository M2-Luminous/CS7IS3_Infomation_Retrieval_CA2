They will be the first two neutral countries to do so. Switzerland also is interested in the offer made by NATO last January to all CSCE members for cooperation. However, the Federal Council probably will wait until the results of the referendum on the blue helmets are released before it makes its intentions known. Indeed, the peacekeeping operations fall within the scope of activities under the Partnership program. [passage omitted]
