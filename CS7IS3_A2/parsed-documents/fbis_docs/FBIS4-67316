Listed among them are the capture of 112 kilograms of pure heroin, seen as a new blow given to the Balkan drug connection, for the head of which, now in Spain, the Romanian police will demand extradition. Another success was the seizure on 23 April, jointly with the German police, of 55 kilograms of heroin and the apprehension of two persons in Turkey, one in Germany, and two in Romania. On 11 May the Syrian citizen Muhammad Khalal was caught while selling one kilogram of pure heroin worth $30,000. The cooperation with the German and Dutch police forces made possible the dismantling of another connection that used to operate on the route Constanta- Bucuresti-Arad-Netherlands, which trafficked 6,000 kilograms of hashish. In collaboration with the Chinese police, 10 criminals were caught, all involved in two sadistic assassinations and assaults. The same gang is suspected of having killed a fellow citizen and of having then disposed of his body by chopping it in a concrete-mixer, which they subsequently dismantled and had its parts dispersed. Another case regards four groups of racketeers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) reported to have committed several robberies against tourist groups. The latest remarkable feat is the capturing of a 12-person gang involved in the stealing and trafficking of 30 million lei worth of electrolytic copper from Zlatna, and of 20 million lei worth of gold-bearing mud. Implicated in this affair is, as General Pitulescu said, the "Emperor of Gypsies Everywhere, Iulian I." [passage omitted]
