The ranking government official also confirmed that all Nicaraguans favor an intensification of democracy and reject violence. [Begin recording] [Lacayo] To date we have issued bonds worth over 600 million cordobas [figure as heard] as compensation without regard for the nationality of the beneficiaries. The only problem with foreign citizens is that they are subject to special procedures at the Foreign Ministry aimed at maintaining good relations with their governments. On this occasion we are dealing with the Spanish, German, and U.S. Governments, and they have all received equal treatment. Nevertheless, in accordance with the law, the Foreign Ministry is giving priority to U.S. citizens. [Unidentified reporter] Returning once again to the conference you held in Costa Rica, did you agree on anything with Dr. Sergio Ramirez? [Lacayo] I agreed on many issues with Dr. Ramirez and Mr. Aleman because we are all in favor of an intensification of the democratic system. We fully agreed on that. We all favored a special market economy that will foster progress and well-being for the Nicaraguan people, especially the poorest sectors. We all agreed that violence can never again be used as a means of achieving a change of government in this country. We all agreed on the importance of strengthening the conviction that a democratic system is the best means of changing the government. We also agreed that the management of the economy, community projects, and production resources are priorities, which is exactly what the government's economic policy is doing. We agreed on so many issues that the students wanted to know where our disagreements lay. [end recording]
