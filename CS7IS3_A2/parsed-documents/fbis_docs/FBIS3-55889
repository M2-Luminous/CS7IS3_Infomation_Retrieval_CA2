This was the assessment of the State Duma's first day of work voiced by the executive secretary of the Russia's Choice faction Sergey Yushenkov in his interview with INTERFAX. In his opinion, one can already make a conclusion that one of the largest factions in the new Russian parliament, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (leader -- Vladimir Zhirinovsky), "has good organization and discipline and acts exclusively in accordance with its leader's instructions." Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the bloc Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev- Lukin, believes that "the conflict in the State Duma will be a permanent one under the present structure of the parliament." At the same time, this will not affect the fate of economic reforms in Russia, he said. During his conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent he reminded that according to the Constitution adopted in December, all issues related to economic reforms had been handed over to the Russian president. "The reforms' future is in Mr. Yeltsin's hands," he noted. Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice bloc) believes that there is a balance of political forces in the State Duma, there are about 50 percent of democrats and 50 percent of conservatives in it. He thinks that many radicals, including the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, came to the State Duma "with the aim to participate at the presidential 1996 elections." The Duma will be "a difficult and clamorous one but it will not abandon the legal political activity, which the deputies have acquired during the elections, another time," Burbulis is convinced. He again categorically spoke against any opportunity to cooperate with Zhirinovskiy and his party. Leader of the communist party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov estimates the beginning of the Duma's work as "a natural normal process of getting accustomed under the new situation" given the fact that "neither the chairman nor the deputies have appropriate experience of parliamentary work." However, he believes that the majority of the Duma's deputies demonstrate "sound sense and do not resort to excessive polemics." He hopes that today the deputies will manage to solve the issue on the number of factions and not to lower it to less than 35 people. Thanks to this, he said, we'll manage to gather leaders of deputies associations on Tuesday evening and develop a draft of joint proposals. Mikhail Poltoranin (Russia's Choice) believes that the Duma works nonconstructively. Under this situation, he said in his conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent, "I would like to rise and say: Dear Misters, according to available information, there are still reserve tank shells in the Taman division, that's why, let us work more constructively."
