Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said it was of "capital importance" that the EU leaders name a successor to Delors at their summit on the Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday. In a letter to the leaders outlining the summit's agenda, he said failure to do so would not leave the European Parliament enough time to properly ratify the eventual nominee before he is due to take office on January 5. Diplomats here have predicted that the EU leaders might not be able to break their deadlock at Corfu. Germany and France are backing Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene for the job. But outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers has said he wants the position on the grounds that the Netherlands is alone among the EU's six founding members never to have held the job for a full term. The nominee must be chosen unanimously. A third official candidate is the EU's British trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who has the support of London. Papandreou warned that delaying the decision would mean cutting into the European Parliament's ratification time and thereby violate "the letter and the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty." The treaty, which came into effect in November last year, gives the European Parliament the enhanced right to accept or reject the EU's nomination for president and his colleagues on the EU Commission. However, Papandreou, who will chair the summit, said he was willing to accept high-level horse-trading involving candidates for the top positions in other international organisations. The secretariat of the EU's Council of Ministers is looking for a new chief, as is the World Trade Organisation which will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The same applies to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Western European Union, the EU's developing defence arm. And NATO might soon need a new secretary-general. Heading the Corfu summit's agenda is a partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. President Boris Yeltsin will sign the accord on Friday, after dining with the EU leaders on the Greek island on Thursday night. Also on Friday, the EU will formally accept four new members. Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will sign their accession agreements. However, membership is certain only for Austria, where voters approved EU membership in a referendum earlier this month. The other three countries are holding referendums later this year. In his letter, Papandreou invited the EU leaders to hold a post mortem on this month's elections to the European Parliament, which reflected widespread voter apathy. There will also be debates on asylum policies and ways to fight unemployment, drug smuggling, international crime, racism and xenophobia. The EU leaders are to discuss a joint approach to the G-7 summit of seven industrialised countries in Naples on July 8-10. The Greek leader said particular attention would be paid to an initiative to help finance the permanent closing of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where the world's worst civilian nuclear accident occurred in 1986.
