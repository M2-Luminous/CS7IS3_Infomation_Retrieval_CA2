"We will try to have working-level preparatory talks in a way that won't be bound by agenda topics," Yi said. Testifying before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, Yi said that in the past, many proposed high-level inter-Korean talks failed to take place due to haggling over agenda topics. He said the South cannot disregard the North's nuclear past, adding, "This stand of ours was explained to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and our understanding is that Mr. Carter duly conveyed it to the North Koreans during his recent visit to Pyongyang." Yi who is also National Unification minister observed that a third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level meeting could take place earlier than expected if the Carter-Kim Il-song agreement could be made a governmental agreement between the two countries. On the issue of supporting the North's construction of light-water reactors, Yi said the South can agree to such support only after North Korea made clear a plan to give up their nuclear development. The construction of two 900,000kw-class light-water reactors North Korea wishes to have would cost about 3.6 to 4 billion dollars, Yi said.
