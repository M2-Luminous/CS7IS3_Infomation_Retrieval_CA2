FR941130-2-00036 FR941130-2-00022 [OPPTS&hyph;62143; FRL&hyph;4921&hyph;4] Accredited Training Programs Under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Action: National Directory of AHERA Accredited Courses (NDAAC); notice of availability of new edition. SUMMARY: Effective November 30, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA Accredited Courses (NDAAC). This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the Federal Register . The November 30, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on August 31, 1994, may be ordered through the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports. ADDRESSES: Parties interested in receiving a brochure which describes the national directory and provides ordering information should contact: EPA AHERA-NDAAC, c/o VISTA Computer Services, 3rd Floor, 6430 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817, Telephone: 1&hyph;800&hyph;462&hyph;6706. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses and organizations. Previously, EPA had published this listing in the Federal Register on a quarterly basis. The last Federal Register listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities. Dated: November 16, 1994. Susan B. Hazen, Acting Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29379 Filed 11&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
