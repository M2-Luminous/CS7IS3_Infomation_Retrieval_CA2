The Political Affairs Group had its first session yesterday, and it discussed the establishment of a SAR representative office on the mainland. Members also discussed a report by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee on Sino-British relations. Lu Ping, deputy chairman and secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee, and relevant mainland members came to Hong Kong specially to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Lu Ping. Leung Chan-ying, leader of the Hong Kong side on the Political Affairs Group, described the group's first meeting in Hong Kong as having a good atmosphere and high efficiency. Yesterday's meeting of the Political Affairs Group was held at XINHUA Hong Kong Branch's villa in Stanley. After the meeting, the two leaders briefed the press about their meeting. Xiao Weiyun, the Chinese side's team leader, said that as usual, the meeting had assessed the current situation. In addition, the group also discussed the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR's representative office in Beijing and reviewed issues mentioned in previous meetings in order to draft a work report for submission to the third plenary meeting of the Preliminary Working Committee. The group will continue to discuss these issues today. Leung Chan-ying said that Article 22 of the Basic Law specifies the relationship between the Hong Kong SAR and the central and local governments, and the provision mentions that the SAR Government may set up a representative office in Beijing; at the same time, various central departments and various provinces or localities may also set up representative offices in Hong Kong. However, the discussion remains at an initial stage, and the final answer will be found in one to two years. He added: Concrete operational forms to be further considered include future connections between the various departments of the SAR government and the central government. Will such connections be built between specific departments directly or effected through a unified channel? What will the rank of the representative office and its personnel be, and when is the right time to set up such an office? This will have close a relationship with the establishment of the SAR in the initial stage. He pointed out: In the future, the relationship between the SAR and the central government will not only be limited to the appointment of officials and certain political decisions; many economic issues will also be involved. For example, civilian aviation is one such issue. The handling of many affairs requires a close relationship between the SAR and the central government. However, the details have yet to be considered further. Before the meeting, no member spoke to the press. Reporters were divided into two groups. One group were reporters from the electronic media, and the other were press reporters. They were allowed into the meeting room to take photographs for five minutes. During the photo-session, some reporters asked Lu Ping why he did not talk with people on the spot in coming to Hong Kong, when he would speak publicly to Hong Kong people, and whether his refusal to meet the Hong Kong governor was against the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport. Lu Ping just smiled and did not say anything.
