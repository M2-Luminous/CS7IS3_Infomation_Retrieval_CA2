There are no obvious regulations which restrict the entry of foreign investment advisory firms, but they say that the high costs associated with entering the market impede their participation. U.S. investment advisory firms operating in Japan have compiled a confidential report entitled, "Outlook for Deregulation of Investment Management Services in Japan." The report suggests, "U.S. investment advisers licensed to provide discretionary investment advisory services should be allowed to expand into the management of pension funds, investment trusts, and other assets which are amenable to management as investments," specifically calling for a single license to cover investment advisory functions, discretionary accounts management, and investment trust management services. Under the existing Japanese regulations, a U.S. investment advisory firm wishing to engage in investment trust services must apply for a separate investment trust license from the MOF and operate the activity as a separate subsidiary. Once the firm has been licensed, it must establish a separate office with independent staffing, equipment and office space which doubles its expenditures. According to a U.S. investment advisory firm, "investment advisory services and investment trust services are mutually complementary," and the Japanese system of requiring separate licenses can only be considered "excessive protection of the domestic investment trust industry." They are especially distressed about this because "U.S. investment advisory firms in Japan are actually operating at a loss." Another reason the U.S. side is taking a firm stand on this matter is that Japanese investment advisory firms operating in the United States are free to provide investment trust services. The U.S. side has lost patience with the formidable Japanese market barriers and has recently formed a government-private sector task force to fortify its market-opening demands. A typical example of such efforts is the "Investment Management Subcommittee" of the ACCJ. The subcommittee maintains close contact with the U.S. government by holding regularly scheduled monthly meetings with financial authorities at the U.S. embassy in Japan to discuss the closed nature of Japanese financial markets. Actually, among the informal requests made by the U.S. Government in the area of investment trust deregulation, two items 1) mutuality of investment advisory services and investment trust services and 2) freedom for investment advisory firms to manage all classes of pension fund assets, have been discussed at the regularly scheduled meetings of the subcommittee and the U.S. embassy. Mr. Donald J. Mulvihill [as transliterated] of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan, who serves as chairman of the subcommittee, stresses the need to work as a "team" with the U.S. Government in saying, "Even if we seek deregulation separately, the MOF lacks the willingness to entertain our requests." The Japanese have begun to act on the reform of investment trust markets in response to U.S. demands. On 22 June [1994], the Investment Trust Research Council, a private research unit of the MOF Securities Bureau's director general, will complete its work covering this area. U.S. investment advisory services will focus on the conclusions of this research council which had been studying the fundamental reform of investment trust services. Sources in the administrative office's of MOF reveal that the draft of the report to be issued by the Investment Trust Research Council is expected to present a dual position for and against the issue of mutuality of investment advisory and investment trust management services. However, aside from U.S. investment advisory firms, the domestic banking industry has also stepped up its demand for mutuality in connection with turf battles within that industry. The U.S. is gaining confidence that the mutuality issue will be resolved in its favor in view of the "many allies within Japan itself." The domestic investment trust industry assumes a conservative position and officially opposes the mutuality issue saying, "Problems will arise if investment advisory services provided to large investors and investment trust services involving a large number of investors are combined." However, the true sentiment of the industry was expressed by a major investment trust contracting firm's president when he said, "We will not oppose the mutuality concept if entry into the pension fund markets is approved." The basic policy of the MOF concerning investment trust reform as expressed by the Securities Bureau is, "We hope to revise obsolete legislation." Precisely because of this position of the MOF, the view that "mutuality" will be an easy concession to U.S. demands as long as Japanese domestic industry sources do not pose major resistance is gaining prominence.
