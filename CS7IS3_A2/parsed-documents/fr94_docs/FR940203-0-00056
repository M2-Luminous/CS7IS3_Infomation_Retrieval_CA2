FR940203-0-00056 FR940203-0-00017 The Navy has requested a take of four species of pinnipeds and 17 species (or species groups) of cetaceans by harassment, injury and death (Table 2). The proposed activities would occur in the Southern California Bight (SCB), an area with a potentially high density of marine mammals. Potential impacts to marine mammals include both lethal and non-lethal injuries, as well as physical and acoustic harassment. Injury or death may occur as a direct result of the explosive blast (concussion) itself. Injury may include damage to internal organs, as well as to the auditory system. Harassment of marine mammals may occur as a result of non-injurious physiological responses to both the explosion-generated shockwave, as well as to the acoustic signature of the detonation.
