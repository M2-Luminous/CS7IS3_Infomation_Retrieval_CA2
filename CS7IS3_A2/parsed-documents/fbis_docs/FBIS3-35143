A source close to the Moroccan delegation currently visiting Brussels told MAP bureau here that the Moroccan delegation had from the start pointed out that the negotiations directives adopted by the European Ministers' Council last December 6 were insufficient in commercial and financial matters. The Moroccan side renewed commitment for more open trade relations with the European Union and called for a necessary and vital balance between the agricultural and industrial sectors. The open relations, the delegation argued, would be started progressively and framed by support measures. The delegation underlined that pending the setting forth of the new trade relations, and in view of the new data stemming from the Uruguay Round it is necessary to adapt the current cooperation accord in order to maintain the preferences granted so far to Morocco and especially to maintain the flow of Morocco's exports of fruits and vegetables. The European Union confirmed in this respect its readiness to preserve Moroccan trade gains especially regarding fruits and vegetables, the same source said. Regarding the financial sector, the Moroccan side pointed out that the development of financial cooperation should be adapted to Morocco's socio-economic conditions, the financial constraints entailed by the adjustment policy and its will to promote privileged relations and more intense exchanges with the European Union. Morocco deems its counter-proposals accurate, comprehensive and realistic given the cooperation possibilities with the European Union and the complementarity between their economies. The delegation that handed to the European officials the memorandum of counter-proposals was led by Moroccan Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Taieb Fassi Fihri [title and spelling as received].
