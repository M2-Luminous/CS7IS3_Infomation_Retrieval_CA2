The meeting between Mr. Kliridhis and the U.S. official has been set for 1700 today. Mr. Lamb had a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas this morning. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President Kliridhis will also stress to the U.S. official that the only thing that can be done at this time for an agreement is for the Turkish side to accept the UN document as it stands. Responding to questions, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the Greek Cypriot side will cooperate fully with the UN secretary general with the aim of having the 21 March document accepted, because without its acceptance any dialogue would be fruitless. Mr. Kasoulidhis also noted that many things will become clear at the Kliridhis-Lamb meeting this afternoon. He also gave a negative answer to a question on whether pressure is being exercised on our side. Mr. Kasoulidhis further expressed the view that the United Nations will not continue to be hopeful after the end of April that Rauf Denktas will change his stand if he does not accept the document by then. The government spokesman also said that representations have been made to third parties on their intervention with the UN secretary general to amend his original report, but the spokesman did not make it clear who these third parties are. Responding to a question, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that if third parties want to contribute toward a Cyprus solution they can do so provided they realize that the very initiative of the secretary general's representatives is in danger of failing if the time limits are not observed and the international organization is discouraged from remaining firm on the result it had decided upon. Responding to a question whether the government is satisfied with President Clinton's election commitments, the government spokesman said that it is too early to answer this question because, as he noted, the Cyprus Government would first like to see the U.S. reaction when the effort it is making to have the Turkish side agree fails. At the same time, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the government has made it clear since last year that it is prepared to proceed with talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue by using Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas.
