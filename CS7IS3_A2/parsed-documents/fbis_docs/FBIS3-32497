It also granted a 10-day extension to the political parties to present nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils. Last week, the legislative plenary was asked to extend the deadline for the implementation of this law, known as the "Antipiracy Law" six months. Several sources, who do not know the parliamentary procedures for such actions, had said the extension had already been granted. It was not until Wednesday night, however, when the legislative commission presented a report favoring a four- month extension that Congress issued a decree stating the law would take effect on 15 June 1994. Originally, it was to take effect on 16 February. Board members of the Savings and Loan Cooperative Association, Video Supply and Marketing of El Salvador, Association of Cassette Distributors and Reproducers of Eastern Salvador, and the Committee of Cassette Venders and Reproducers requested the deadline be extended. The law to develop and protect intellectual copyrights, which was approved on 15 July, regulates all issues related to intellectual copyright and, at the same time, promotes and protects the literary, artistic, scientific, and industrial copyrights of Salvadoran nationals. This law stipulates that firms that distribute and sell music cassettes or rent video cassettes must pay royalties to the creator. With this extension, Congress is giving those firms four more months to adjust to the situation. The deadline for political parties to present their lists of nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils ended yesterday. Since most parties had not prepared their lists, however, Congress extended the deadline 10 days. Political organizations must present a list of council nominations to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Among other things, the Vote Receiving Councils count the votes after the voting period ends and record the result on the corresponding electoral certificate.
