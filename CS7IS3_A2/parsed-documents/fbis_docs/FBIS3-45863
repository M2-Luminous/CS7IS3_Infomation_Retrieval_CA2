"If they are accurate, we certainly will seek clarification from the Russian Government," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said in reference to remarks reportedly made by Kozyrev to the Russian ambassadors to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Moscow has withdrawn all troops from Lithuania, but not from Latvia or Estonia. The three Baltic nations were under the jurisdiction of the former Soviet Union, but Washington had never recognized the legitimacy of this arrangement. "Foreign Minister Kozyrev's comments are certainly at odds with statements signed by (Russian) President (Boris) Yeltsin and (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton in Moscow," McCurry said. McCurry's remarks came only hours after Kozyrev reportedly said that if Russia withdrew its troops, it would create a security vacuum in the region. While asserting that the rights of ethnic Russians in the Baltic countries should be protected, Washington has all along demanded that Moscow pull its troops out quickly.
