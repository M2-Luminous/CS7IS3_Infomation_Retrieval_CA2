FBIS4-13610 "drnes078__a94004" FBIS-NES-94-078-A Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 ANNEX Arab-Israeli Talks Israel-PLO Economic Talks Nearing Conclusion Israel-PLO Economic Talks Nearing Conclusion TA1704091294 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English 17 Apr 94 p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA1704091294 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST English BFN [Report by Jose Rosenfeld] [Text] Palestinians in the autonomous areas will be able to sell gasoline for 15 percent less than the price in Israel as part of the economic agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said Friday the agreement could be concluded at the end of this week's round of discussions in Paris, as the sides have already reached agreement on most of the issues on the table. At a news conference called to report on the progress reached in the last round of talks, which concluded last Tuesday, Shohat denied that the closure of the territories was designed to put pressure on the Palestinians at the negotiating table. However, he admitted that the closure created tension last week with the Palestinian delegation, which, in reaction, deferred negotiations on labor issues. Shohat reported that the sides have reached final agreement on agriculture, energy and industry. The sides have also reached a conditional agreement on taxation, which will be finalized when they agree on a Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the autonomous areas. Shohat added that there is still disagreement on the creation of a Palestinian currency, which Israel opposes. Budget Director David Brodet said that the energy agreement which allows the Palestinians to sell gasoline for 15 percent less than the price in Israel may increase the competition in Israel. However, the Palestinians received this concession from the Israelis based on commitments by oil-producing countries to provide them with below price crude oil. The energy agreement, like the industry agreement, sets the industrial, safety and ecological standards on the respective products covered. Unlike the industry agreement, the energy agreement sets the standards for all the petrochemicals entering the autonomous areas. By contrast, the industry agreement only sets standards for products that will enter Israel from the areas. Industrial products remaining in the areas will not need to conform with those standards. The agriculture agreement also allows for free trade between the autonomous areas and Israel, with the exception of tomatoes, cucumbers, eggs, potatoes and chickens, said Brodet. Those products will be subject to quotas which will be gradually phased out over a four-year period. Shohat said that discussions on labor relations will take place this week. He added that both sides benefit from Palestinian labor in Israel, and that Israel will impose neither a ceiling nor a floor for Palestinian labor and will retain the right to control the workers' entry into the country. Shohat also said that three-quarters of the income tax collected from Palestinians working in Israel will be forwarded to the autonomous authorities since they will provide the workers with services. The only remaining bone of contention on taxation is the rate of VAT in the autonomous areas. Shohat reported that the Palestinians want a VAT of between 15 percent and 16 percent, while Israel wants it between 16 percent and 17 percent. The sides have agreed to impose the same duties, with exceptions for equipment essential for development of the autonomous areas and limited imports from Arab countries. The Palestinians will be able to impose whatever income tax rates they want. Shohat said that although the economic agreement could be concluded this week, the Palestinians will only move based on the progress achieved in the political talks in Cairo. He added that there are no impediments on Israel's side to sign the economic agreement before the political agreement. If the economic agreement is ready before, only the issue of coordinating the imposition of duties at Palestinian points of entry will be required, Shohat said. Shohat rejected the notion that the closure is being used as a means to put pressure on the Palestinian negotiators. As proof, he pointed to the NIS [new Israeli shekels] 28 million the government is spending in the territories to fund public works during the closure. "The closure decision is a decision that derives exclusively from security considerations, despite the fact that even with the closure terrorist acts occur," said Shohat.
