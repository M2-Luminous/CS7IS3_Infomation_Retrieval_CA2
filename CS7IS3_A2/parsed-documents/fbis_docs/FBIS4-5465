By 2010, the world will be consuming 48 percent more energy than it did in 1991, said the 1994 edition of the IEA's world energy outlook. "The inexorable increase" in energy demand is ascribed to an expected rise of over 70 percent in global gross domestic product (GDP) during the period, IEA Executive Director Helga Steeg said in a news conference in Tokyo. The annual report said energy consumption among the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will increase by 28 percent between now and 2010. Oil demand in the OECD will rise to 45 million barrels per day, up 18 percent over 1991 consumption. The rise in oil demand, an average pace of 0.8 percent a year, occurs entirely in the transport sector, the report said. With a gradual decline in OECD oil production expected to continue, the OECD's dependency on imported oil will increase to nearly 70 percent by 2010 from 58 percent in 1991, the report said. In order for the OECD to secure the demand, production in the Middle East and Venezuela needs to double over the next 16 to 17 years, the report said. World coal consumption will grow at 2.1 percent per annum. Such demand from countries other than the OECD will rise at 3.8 percent a year with China accounting for over half of the expected increase. The forecasts are based on the assumption that oil import prices will average 17 dollars per barrel in 1994 and 1995 in the IEA countries and rise to 28 barrels by 2005, after which it remains flat. The outlook is also conditional on a modest macroeconomic growth in the OECD in the early years of the forecast amid the continuing recession in Japan and Europe. The outlook for the world energy demand indicates global carbon dioxide emissions will grow 50 percent by 2010, Steeg said. Emissions in the OECD will continue on an upward pace while those in the rest of the world will more than double, she said. "This picture will be slowed but not fundamentally changed under low economic growth assumptions," Steeg said. Forecasting region-by-region energy demand, the report said consumption in Japan and other OECD Pacific areas is expected to grow at 1.8 percent per annum over the forecast period, a slower growth than that over the last decade. "Energy-intensive industries will continue to relocate from Japan to the rapidly growing Asian countries," Steeg explained. Japanese nuclear output capacity is expected to almost double over the forecast period, the report said.
