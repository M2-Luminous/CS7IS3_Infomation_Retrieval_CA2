Saying that Kozyrev's initiative "deserves great attention," Krajisnik added that the Serb side would support it "if arbitration agents who will reach a just solution are found." Krajisnik stressed that the Serb side believed that it was necessary to agree on a cessation of hostilities and replace the war with political negotiations, but without "prejudicing solutions." "We would be ready to accept arbitration, but the Serbs have had negative experiences with the work of the international community which has on several occasions displayed bias and sided with the Muslims," the president of the republic of Srpska assembly said. "In any event, we advocate the establishing of peace and talks, but without a solution being imposed on any side in the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik said.
