It's a pleasure to greet you. [Endara] Thank you very much. Good morning to all of you. I wish you the best. I feel very well here in Colombia. It has been very pleasant for me these last couple of days to be with President Gaviria, with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, two people whom I shall always remember because of the friendship they have bestowed on me and on the Republic of Panama. [Rodriguez] I understand that the last armed soldier left the Canal Zone and that there are no longer U.S. soldiers? [Endara] Yes, that is right, but not armed soldiers, because all soldiers are armed. The last combat soldier left. It was a combat brigade that left. That was the last combat brigade. There are soldiers left. Although they have weapons, they are not combat weapons. There are, for instance, the military police, the doctors, and other essential components. [Rodriguez] Mr. President, undoubtedly one of the topics to be analyzed and one which is of interest here at this summit, although it is not on the agenda as the presidents said from the beginning, is the topic of Cuba, the topic of President Fidel Castro. Yesterday, in his second speech he said that if one wants to speak of democracy in Latin America, another summit like this one would have to be held in his country. What is your opinion? [Endara] I think we are quite clear on what democracy signifies. Of course, he has declared himself to be a Marxist-Leninist, and he has another concept of democracy, which we are acquainted with after meeting people who subscribe to this ideology. Of course, we have always respected that concept of democracy, although we may not agree with that proletarian dictatorship that we believe is fundamentally undemocratic. I think there is much truth in what Commander Fidel Castro said, but there is also much truth in what was said by the presidents of Chile, Honduras, and I don't remember who else, but they all stated some truths. We envision a democracy as one in which the people express themselves through elections or express themselves through freedom of speech, manifesting total support of human rights, which unfortunately is nonexistent in Cuba. We have to discuss this with him, and I believe we will have an opportunity to do so this afternoon. [Rodriguez] Dario Arizmendi, President Endara is there. [Arizmendi] Greetings to the president of Panama. Mr. President, what will be the outcome of the topic raised by Cuban President Fidel Castro yesterday when he criticized precisely the rest of the Latin American presidents for not dedicating a single sentence of their 15-minute speeches to the U.S.-imposed blockade against Cuba? [Endara] I believe the criticism was not directed against all the presidents. I believe the criticism was... [pauses] it was a very friendly criticism. I don't know if you had the opportunity to hear what he said. It was very friendly criticism. He referred especially to those presidents who referred in their speeches to freedom and democracy in Cuba. He maintains that, in addition to mentioning that, they should have mentioned the blockade, the great achievements by Cuba in social aspects, particularly in terms of medicine and education. I believe that Castro is suffering from these truths, but the presidents also mentioned other truths which is that these big social achievements must go hand in hand with what we understand as democracy and liberty, as exists here in Colombia, for instance, and in the other Latin American countries. [Arizmendi] President Endara, do you think it is possible that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit declaration of Cartagena de Indias will include an explicit paragraph, precisely regarding the blockade against Cuba? [Endara] I don't believe so. I believe this is a topic we are going to broach, that is if we broach it again it will be at a private meeting attended by the presidents and foreign ministers. Now that is not the only topic we are going to discuss in this private meeting. We will broach other topics, which we could perhaps mention at a given moment, but we cannot at this moment. [Arizmendi] We imagine that the case of Haiti will also be on the agenda of that private meeting, won't it? [Endara] I don't believe so. I cannot say that there is no country that wants to broach it, but I don't think so. This is a topic fundamentally for the OAS, and it was discussed in Belem, Brazil, only a few days ago. [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, do you think that the summits are going to be institutionalized and that this one has been more fruitful than previous ones? [Endara] Yes, of course. I believe that one of the great achievements of the summit in Cartagena de Indias has been institutionalizing the summits. It is now taken for granted that the summits will remain as a permanent thing in our countries. The fact that we have the host countries up to the year 2001 is a clear indication of the interest in maintaining them. I think that the great achievement, the preliminary achievement of the summit of Cartagena de Indias is precisely that. The first three summits were to sound out the situation to see if they were successful. Here in Cartagena de Indias it has been proven that the summits are like one of those big trees that will flourish and have many flowers. [Arizmendi] One last question, Mr. Guillermo Endara, and expressing our thanks in behalf of our program, what will you dedicate yourself to when you turn over power in the coming weeks? [Endara] I will return to my law practice. Former presidents do not receive any pension or privilege in Panama. I think the only thing they get is a large automobile license plate, which I would rather pay for. I will dedicate myself to my law practice, which is what I have done all my life. Of course, I will not leave politics, although there is no reelection until after 10 years. Still, it is crazy to think of 10 years ahead. I will dedicate myself to my party, which is a very large and good party. As of now I can anticipate, without fear of being wrong, that in the year 1999, the Arnulfist Party, with the same candidate it had this year, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, is going to win by a broad, a very broad margin. [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, thank you very much for being with us. We hope that the rest of your stay with us will be a very pleasant one. [Endara] Thank you very much.
