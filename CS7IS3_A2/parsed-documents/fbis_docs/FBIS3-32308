The objective of this meeting slated for the second half of 1994 is "to cloud the broad continental recognition that Cuba has received in Latin American summits," published GRANMA, the official Communist Party of Cuba mouthpiece. If Washington "intends at this stage to use their summit against Cuba, we believe they are too late. All the world's unipolarity could not attain such a goal, as anachronistic as it is shameful," according to the newspaper. President Fidel Castro had also condemned this summit of Latin American heads of state organized by Washington when closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting held in Havana on 28 January. "They want to hold summit meetings without Cuba, to make us even more isolated, to make their criminal blockade even more rigorous," Castro said when referring to Washington's decision announced by Vice President Al Gore during a visit to Mexico. The Cuban Government has taken part in three Ibero-American summits -- Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991; Madrid, Spain in 1992; and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil in 1993. GRANMA also charged that Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella had spoken as if he were the official State Department spokesman when he said in Washington that the summit had been postponed until Secretary of State Warren Christopher completes a tour of the area. OAS spokesmen praised the summit but warned that it should not be held without the OAS because there is no need to duplicate continental mechanisms. One previous summit of American heads of state was held in Panama (1955) and summoned by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. The other was held in Punta del Este (Uruguay/1967) at the request of Lyndon B. Johnson. The Cuban newspaper recalled statements attributed to Professor Henry Raymont, an expert in Latin American studies, who says that the United States should have summoned the summit within the framework of the OAS, from which the Fidel Castro government has been suspended since 1962.
