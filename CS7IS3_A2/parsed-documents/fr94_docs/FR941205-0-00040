FR941205-0-00040 FR941205-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;77&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9081; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes, that requires installation of additional vent areas in the central fuselage. This amendment is prompted by an analysis which indicated that an explosive decompression could not be vented adequately with the currently installed floor venting system on these airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers and crew in the event of an explosive decompression of the fuselage. DATES: Effective on January 4, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., Customer Support Department, Adams Field, P.O. Box 3356, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36098). That action proposed to require installation of additional vent areas in the central fuselage (Modifications 253627A and 253661B). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
