The rally was attended by 'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; 'Umar al-Shihabi, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Political Bureau member; and representatives from the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad Movement, Hamas, the PFLP, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, al-Sa'iqah, and Fatah-the Uprising. The rally was also attended by representatives of the Arab liberation movements in Syria, Palestinian nationalist figures, and a large crowd. Abu-'Ali Mustafa delivered a speech on behalf of the APF at the rally in which he condemned the unforgivable reprehensible crime and stressed that the Palestinian people will pursue the struggle until victory. He said that the crime which spread from the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque to the Galilee, the Negev, Gaza, and Nazareth did not come as a surprise to our people. The evil Zionist enemy commits dozens of crimes against our Palestinian people daily. He added: Some say that the crime has come as a result of the rashness of a person in Hebron. We say that this crime is not the first and will not be the last in the Zionists history that is replete with crimes and that Israel is responsible for it. Abu-'Ali Mustafa added: If the Israeli enemy says that it was a psychopath who killed the defenseless people in the Ibrahimi Mosque, then who are the psychopaths who daily attack the people of Palestine in Janin, Nabulus, Gaza, and Jerusalem? Is he the psychopath who attacked al-Aqsa mosque and southern Lebanon? He said that our people will fight until they attain victory. Our people will fight with faith and patience in spite of all the hardships, and Palestine will remain Arab in spite of them, and we will fight with all that we have, and the intifadah continues and rages in all places. We pledge to our martyrs that we will continue to fight until we score victory. [passage omitted]
