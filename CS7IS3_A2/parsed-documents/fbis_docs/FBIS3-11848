FBIS3-11848 "drlat059_o_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 Colombia EL TIEMPO Publishes Document on Havana Meeting PA2503191394 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 20 Mar 94 p 19A PA2503191394 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "The Document of the Summit in Cuba"] [Text] The presence and meeting of guerrilla leaders in Havana, including the participation of Bishop Nel Beltran, during the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Summit for Solidarity and Self-Determination of the Peoples, not only emerged as a revelation from the accounts of witnesses to a ranking state official, it is also set forth in writing in an intelligence report. EL TIEMPO obtained this document as the last piece of confirmation of its information sources, who met with ranking officials and consulted firsthand sources. Contrary to what the sources said, the document does not mention Ivan Marquez as having participated in the summit, but does confirm other reports already published by this newspaper. The original source of the intelligence document is precisely a ranking, reliable official in the state secret service. "This is what military intelligence knows about the summit in Cuba," the source told EL TIEMPO. This is why this paper attributed the document to the Armed Forces intelligence service. Yesterday, however, in a fax sent at 1011 to EL TIEMPO, Brigadier General Fernando Tapias Stamelin, chief of the D-2 Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces, explained that the document had not been issued by the military intelligence service. On Friday, during a brief talk with journalists, Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman said the report "did not emanate from military intelligence." EL TIEMPO published the letter from General Tapias and a copy of each page of the report today: Doctor Hernando Santos Director, Newspaper EL TIEMPO Santa Fe de Bogota. Page 31 of the respective 18 March 1994 edition of the newspaper EL TIEMPO, in a four-column report entitled "Military Intelligence Knew About the Summit," mentioned a restricted three-page report, which allegedly emanated from military intelligence. According to the article "the details of the unique summit appeared one by one, and, of course, there was mention of the presence and participation of Monsignor Nel Beltran in the Havana summit. In five paragraphs and two subparagraphs, the military intelligence services briefly mentioned how much they knew about the participants in the meeting. After the Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence directorates, which comprise military intelligence, were consulted, all affirmed that the document cited in the article does not coincide with any report issued by the aforementioned agencies and, therefore, could not have been released to any journalist. Yours truly, [signed] Brig. Gen. Fernando Tapias Stamelin Chief of the D2 Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces [The following report appears alongside the previous letter, enclosed in box format, with the word RESTRICTED at the top and bottom of each of the three pages of the report] [Page 1] Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, Self-Determination, and Life of the Peoples, held in Havana (Cuba) between 26 and 28 January 1994. Havana (Cuba) PCC [Communist Party of Colombia], FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], ELN [Army of National Liberation], and the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] -- The "Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Summit for Solidarity and Self-Determination and Life of the Peoples," which was attended by PCC members and subversives of the FARC, ELN, and EPL was also attended by insurgents from 35 Central and South American countries, including members of the Mexican Zapatist movement, the Salvador Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement of Peru. Those in attendance included: 1. ALBERTO GUTIERREZ BERMUDEZ -- Alleged head of a FARC column, who read a communique by the Colombian subversive groups at the meeting. He has been living in Havana for two months in Apartment No. 2, Building D-3, Zone-7 Alamar in eastern Havana. Other subversives of the ELN and EPL also live in this building. Together with other individuals from Central and South America they receive subversive training at the international aid camp "El Caimito" located in the vicinity of Havana. 2. IVAN ROMERO and JORGE ORTEGA -- Members of the Central Committee of the PCC and officials of the CUT [United Workers Confederation] who cooperate with the FARC, supplying it information on security organizations and persons who can be kidnapped in the middle Magdalena region and Santander. 3. HERNANDO VILLATE -- Physician, sergeant-at-arms of the PCC, who in his speech criticized the Colombian Government with regard to human rights violations. [Page 2] 4. JAIME CAICEDO TURRIACO -- PCC president. 5. LUIS EFRAIN VILLAMIL -- PCC member. 6. ALBERTO SANGUINO -- Colombian worker youth. 7. CAMILO CASTELLANOS -- representative of the Cinep [Center for Research and Public Education]. 8. MARIO GIRALDO VELEZ -- for the Trotskiyite Posada Communist Party. 9. HERNAN DARIO CARDONA -- president of the Community Federation. 10. ALFONSO ROMAN -- of the Socialist Renewal Movement. 11. TERESA QUINONES -- of the International Women's League for Peace and Liberty (IMPAL). This meeting carried out a campaign to discredit Colombia, basing itself on the alleged abuses and violations of human rights by Colombian authorities. To this end, members of the "Group of Peoples Organizations of the Dominican Republic" collected signatures among the participants, denouncing tortures and mistreatment to which Dominican prisoners are allegedly subjected to in Colombia. Apparently AIDA ABELLA coordinated training for the members with the FARC. [Page 3] The Colombian subversives who travel to Cuba do not use visas. They board a plane in Caracas or Cancun, using the Viasa or Adeco airlines, on the Buenos Aires-Caracas-Cancun-Havana route. They enter Cuba with a "tourist card" given to them by the Caribbean representatives, Asisturis or Asertur, of which RICARDO BALLESTEROS ALFONSO and JOAQUIN AMARIS AMARIS, PCC members, are co- owners. This is how GUILLERMO LEON SAENZ VARGAS (alias Alfonso Cano) of the FARC and LEONEL PARDEO of the EPL traveled to Havana on 25 January to meet on 26 January with Father Nel Beltran, FIDEL CASTRO, and other unidentified persons with the intention of defining a strategy to exert pressure through organizations such as Amnesty International and human rights organizations so that the national government will establish a dialogue with the guerrillas, based on a bilateral cease-fire.
