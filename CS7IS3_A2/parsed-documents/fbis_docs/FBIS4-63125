"For the moment we are unable to say exactly which countries are involved, but we reject such an approach. We cannot accept such a link because Ukraine has done everything to speed up joining NPT", he told a press conference. Sir Leon Brittan said he was satisfied Ukraine was proceeding with nuclear disarmament despite the Kiev parliament's failure to join NPT.
