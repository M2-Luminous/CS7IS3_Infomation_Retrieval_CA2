We extend our warm congratulations to the session and wish it great success. In the past year, Chinese people of all nationalities, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, resolutely implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; made headway in reform, opening up, and modernization; and scored tremendous achievements on all fronts. The national economy developed in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, with the gross domestic product breaking 3 trillion yuan, and advanced further in all social undertakings, and continuous improvement of urban and rural residents' life. The situation is heartening. The new situation arising from reform and construction has put forth new tasks and requirements for people's political consultative conferences, and has provided a more favorable opportunity and condition for them to open up a new situation in their work. In the past year, the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, on the basis of the work and experiences of the previous committees, earnestly organized the implementation of the tasks laid out by the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, worked hard to explore new ways to exercise the functions of political consultation and democratic supervision under the new situation, and took part in the administration and discussion of state affairs focused on the work of the party and the government, thereby achieving significant progress in all fields of endeavor and bringing about a more lively situation. The CPPCC National Committee's Standing Committee held a total of five meetings; made numerous constructive suggestions and proposals concerning major issues in the political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic fields; and injected new vitality in the administration and discussion of state affairs. All special committees worked energetically to score notable results. They have been highly valued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as relevant departments and local governments, which have already adopted some of the suggestions and proposals. The CPPCC National Committee also achieved breakthroughs in developing exchange and enhancing friendship and cooperation with foreign countries, expanding contacts between people at home and Overseas Chinese, and promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification. Meanwhile, the CPPCC National Committee actively organized its members to make suggestions for reform and development, to take part in the anticorruption drive, and to help handle motions made by members. The fruitful results of the work in these areas crystallize the painstaking efforts of CPPCC organizations and members, and reflect the vigorous vitality of people's political consultative conferences. This year is a very crucial one for China's progress in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The result of the work has a very important bearing on the relationship between reform and development in the future. The party and state have decided on the basic principles for their work, namely, to implement the guidelines of the 14th national party congress as well as the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in an all-around way; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; to maintain political stability; and to promote sweeping social progress under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. The burden shouldered by the CPPCC committees at all levels is even heavier. We believe that the CPPCC committees' work will surely meet the needs of the new situation, enjoy new development, and blaze new trails. The CPPCC committees have the strong points of abundant intellectual resources, far sightedness, and broad channels. These strong points are extremely valuable and play an important role in China's modernization. The achievements scored by reform and opening up over the past 16 years include a large number of outstanding contributions by CPPCC members. The CPC Central Committee highly appraised their contributions. At the Fifth Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that our united front "has a bright future and bright prospects." As the CPPCC committees' work continued to make new strides forward and score new achievements in recent years, the fine tradition -- "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing honor and disgrace" -- shines forth with new splendor. There are many new contradictions and problems that need to be solved in our endeavor to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy in the new year. The CPPCC committees must unite the masses of the people to support the governments to implement various reforms and to promote integration between reform, development, and stability. We believe the CPPCC organizations and CPPCC members will surely be able to carry forward their fine tradition, to give full play to their own strong points, to improve the concrete results of participating in and discussing government affairs by closely revolving their efforts around the central tasks of the party and state, and to make suggestions for and make greater contributions to seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. During the session, members will examine and discuss the work report of the CPPCC National Committee's Standing Committee, amend the constitution of the CPPCC National Committee, attend the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress as observers, and hear and discuss government work and other reports. We hope members will give full play to their role of political consultation and democratic supervision, actively participate in and discuss government affairs, speak out freely, draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, and make the session a democratic and realistic one that is marked by unity and arouses the enthusiasm of all participants.
