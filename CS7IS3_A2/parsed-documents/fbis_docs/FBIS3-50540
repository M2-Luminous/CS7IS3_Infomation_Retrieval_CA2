Usually, 1 January is not a day of mass demonstrations or a day for official commemorations or speeches, because the Cubans also take part in the worldwide 1 January hangover, although it is true that the average family budget does not allow the majority to get involved in any overindulging on New Year's Eve. In its latest edition, the official daily GRANMA says, "We have to look at 1994 with optimism, hope, and trust, because we are already 35 and the revolution will prevail." It reports that 1993 "will be remembered by millions of honorable and patriotic Cubans who have known how to firmly resist the onslaught of this difficult period." [passage omitted]
