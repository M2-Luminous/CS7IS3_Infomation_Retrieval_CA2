FBIS4-17374 "drsov079_b_94060" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 RUSSIAN NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military & Nuclear Issues `Experts' on Zenit-2 Reusable Booster `Experts' on Zenit-2 Reusable Booster LD2304175494 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1322 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304175494 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] At 12:02 Moscow time on Saturday the military-space forces of the Russian Defense Ministry launched a reusable booster Zenit-2 with a space craft Cosmos aboard. Commenting this event, experts of the military space forces point out that in the framework of the state military space program Russia continues to supplement the grouping of satellites used in the interests of the Defense Ministry. The reusable booster Zenit-2 is used to boost into orbit different space crafts with the disposable weight about 12.5 tonnes to the height of 200 kilometers (it was designed by the design bureau Yuzhnoye, the city of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine). In accordance with the Russian state order which is in force till early 1995 the scientific-industrial association Yuzhnoye in Dnepropetrovsk will produce 3-5 reusable boosters Zenit-2 annually. Zenit-2 was created in the frameworks of the program Energiya- Buran to be used as a side-mounting booster. In addition, there are certain plans to use Zenit-2 instead of the returnable booster Soyuz to boost manned space crafts into orbit. In addition, scientists are considering the issue to launch space crafts of the type Soyuz-TM into the near-earth orbit with a decline 51.6 grades from the Russian cosmodrome Plesetsk. The construction of a launching site consisting of two launching devices of the reusable booster Zenit is being completed here. The first launch from the cosmodrome Plesetsk is scheduled for 1997. Experts also do not rule out possibility to use the boosters Zenit in the program of the international space station on the project Alfa. At present only one launching site situated on the cosmodrome Baykonur is used to launch Zenit boosters. Another one was completely destructed during the explosion of a rocket on October 4, 1990. There are no plans on its restoration. Experts of the military space forces assert that Zenit-2 booster is an ecologically pure rocket (its fuel -- kerosene, liquid oxygen is the oxidizer). The over-all weight of the rocket is 259 tonnes. Until now Zenit booster was used only to boost space crafts into orbit in the interests of the Russian Defense Ministry. A new modification of the rocket Zenit-3 is being developed on the basis of Zenit-2. It will be used to boost space crafts into geostationary and planetary orbits.
