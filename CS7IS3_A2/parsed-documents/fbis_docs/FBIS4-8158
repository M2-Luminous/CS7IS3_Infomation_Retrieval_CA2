Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova took part in today's session. After the session, our correspondent Bibiana Gunisova asked the committee's deputy chairman, Jozef Kosnar, to assess the session: [Begin recording] [Kosnar] As ensues from our committee's portfolio, the main points on the agenda were the points of departure for, and the risks of economic development. These include risks related to the period covering not only this government's term of office but especially the risks of the budget economy up until the end of 1994. We also considered ways of eliminating these risks and creating a possibly more favorable point of departure for the development of both the budget economy and the macroeconomic indexes in the following period--that is, in 1995. [Gunisova] From your point of view, are these risks appropriate? [Kosnar] These risks are greater than the previous government was willing to admit when approving the 1994 state budget. [passage omitted] [Gunisova] In your opinion and according to the committee for the national economy and the budget, are the proposals for tackling economic problems presented in the government's policy statement acceptable and realistic? [Kosnar] This is a peculiar situation. The debate was very simple. No serious objections were raised against the measures, the philosophy or the outlines of concrete solutions, or the more detailed explanation presented by the ministers and the deputy prime minister. However, when it came to the vote, a certain party discipline prevailed, and so the result of the vote was that the resolution did not receive the simple majority needed for it to be adopted by the committee, due to the fact that the deputies for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia opposed this goverment policy statement.
