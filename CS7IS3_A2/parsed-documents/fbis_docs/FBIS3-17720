However, there are several objections with regard both to the accession procedure and the contents of the actual program. The acceptance procedure (the "16+1" formula) virtually deprives CIS countries of the right to collective security. The 16 NATO countries decide whether a particular country can participate in the program and basically set the terms for participation. My second observation regards the content of the program. First of all it envisages standardization of the communications and then the weapons of countries taking part in the program. This will naturally deal a very serious blow to the interests of our military-industrial complex. These two points are the most serious, and representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Ministry, and the Security Council have not yet provided answers to these objections. It is true that, in addition to a market agreement, a number of presentation programs have been envisaged, and it is these programs which will in fact designate the degree to which a particular state will participate in signing up to the "partnership," and hence the costs to be borne by that state in implementing the program. There are other objections connected with Russia's status as a nuclear state with a powerful military-industrial potential. Consequently Russia is simply signing up to a program which has been formulated without its participation, and this is somewhat damaging to its prestige. Moreover, the program itself is a veiled way of expanding NATO. All these issues need to be looked at as a whole, and therefore we have reached two conclusions at our parliamentary hearings. The first is this: If Russia joins the "partnership," it should put forward a number of conditions with a view to alleviating any negative consequences. The second conclusion is that the "Partnership for Peace" program should be regarded merely as part of the establishment of a much more overarching security system linked to new realities following the end of the Cold War.
