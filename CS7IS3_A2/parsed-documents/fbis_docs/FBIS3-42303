Official sources told LANKAPUVATH that according to latest intelligence reports, Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has retreated to his 14 jungle base hideout in Weli Oya in the northern Mullaittivu District to avoid any contact with the public of Jaffna, particularly academicians and religious leaders who are bringing increasing pressure to bear on Prabhakaran to stop this wanton campaign of terrorism in which as many as 12,000 Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil civilians have been brutally slain by the LTTE. In fact, the intelligence reports revealed that Prabhakaran was in Mullaittivu at the time the team of Catholic clergy led by archbishop of Colombo Most Rev. (Dr.) Nicholas Marcus Fernando visited Jaffna and were able to hold talks only with Anton Balasingham whose credibility rating is very low as he is used by Prabhakaran as a mouthpiece for spreading disinformation. Meanwhile, a senior citizen of Jaffna, a professional, told LANKAPUVATH that the average man in Jaffna was not one bit interested in LTTE's battle cry of Eelam. All they wanted was an end to 10 years of suffering and to live in peace and harmony with their Sinhala and Muslim brethren. The people of Jaffna cannot be fooled by the LTTE anymore, he said. He claimed that the multipurpose cooperatives in Jaffna to which the food and other essentials were shipped regularly by the Sri Lankan Government, were run by the LTTE who plundered 30 percent of the essential supplies for use of the terrorist organisation. A further 30 percent of supplies from Colombo were used to feed 225,000 refugees. The senior citizen said that people were now fed up with LTTE repression and described Prabhakaran's rule as a fascist dictatorship where people had no freedom of expression or movement. Anyone wanting to leave the peninsula even for a few days, had to provide another person as surety and Rs. [rupees] 10,000 for an exit permit plus Rs. 500 to cross the Jaffna Lagoon from Sangupiddy to Kilali. He said that any family wanting to leave the peninsula had to sign all their property and hand over the ownership to the LTTE and to pay Rs. 25,000 each for a permanent exit permit. Even then one member of the family was required to remain in Jaffna so that the LTTE will have a hold on the family wherever the others are and continue to extort money from them on the threat that the remaining members of the family would be executed if the Tiger demands are not met. He said that all this was ample proof that the LTTE was in no way interested in the welfare of the Tamils, but a plain and simple brutal terrorist organisation whose leaders were using slogans such as Eelam to deceive the Tamils and feather their own nests.
