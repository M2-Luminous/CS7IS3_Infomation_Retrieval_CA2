Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan gave important speeches. [passage omitted] In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: It is not easy to make the whole municipality's tree coverage rate rech 40 percent. Leaders at all levels and various departments must hold responsibility to the people, formulate good plans and guarantee their implementation. Leaders at all levels must enhance their sense of making the municipality green. In addition to clearing up the occupied wooded areas and forbidding the people from occupying greenbelt areas, they should also tap the tree-planting potential. At present, many units can plant trees and flowers in their neighborhoods but they fail to do so, therefore, they have great potential for planting trees. Starting from each and every street, we should investigate the tree planting potential of all units along the street and urge them to plant more trees, to speed up their efforts in tree planting and to do good things for the people. It is necessary to resolutely stop the act of damaging trees because this is the most uncivilized. Strenuous efforts should be made to plant trees in major areas and along road bridges. In his speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Enabling the tree coverage rate to reach 40 percent is one of the important tasks of realizing the goal of becoming well-off. We should share the tasks with the lower levels, conduct inspection every year, and must not settle accounts during the last minute. The key to realizing the tree- planting target lies in the city proper. It is difficult to plant trees in the city proper. If we fail to do a good job in planting trees in the city proper, greenbelt areas will be encroached upon rather than expanded upon. If the city proper can guarantee the fulfillment of the greening task, the suburban and outlying areas will also be able to fulfill their tasks. All relevant departments should support this. The meeting also heard briefings given by the municipal planning commission on the municipality's key construction items next year. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee; Zhang Baokang, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi and Qiang Wei, members of the standing committee of the municipal party committee; Li Yongan, secretary of the municipal discipline inspection commission; Ren Tieying, vice chairman of the municipal people's congress standing committee; and Feng Mingwei, vice chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also attended the meeting.
