Isingarin, by GUDOK correspondent T. Shirshova, Alma-Ata, under rubric "On the Commonwealth's Main Lines": "Seeing the Prospects"] [Text] The Kazakhstan republic's Ministry of Transportation was the scene of a meeting between Transportation Minister N. Isingarin and representatives of the branch press: three railroad newspapers and a GUDOK correspondent. The participants in the meeting touched upon various questions pertaining to the current status and prospects for developing the railroads of Kazakhstan. We were publishing that conversation today. [Shirshova] Nigmatzhan Kabatayevich, could you please discuss the state of affairs on the republic's railroads? Does the branch correspond completely to today's requirements? [Isingarin] If one speaks about our railroads immediately after the collapse of the Union, during that period they were capable of providing for the necessary volume of freight and passenger shipments. It was also impossible to complain about the rate to which they were provided with equipment, since, beginning in the 1970's, there was active development of Kazakhstan's main lines, especially the Virginland Railroad. But after the break in the economic ties among the former union republics, certain shortcomings were revealed. The configuration of our railroad network does not correspond to the internal railroad-car flow. For example, the republic's center is not linked with the western rayons of the republic. The economy, under conditions of sovereignty, requires the development of those structures which, when Kazakhstan was part of the Union, would not have been given the go-ahead, since there was no need for that. For example, today the petroleum-gas industry is developing in West Kazakhstan. But in specifically that part of the republic there is no capability of organizing rail shipments in full volume. Could we have previously built a petroleum refinery in Aktau? I would scarcely think so, since we got our petroleum products from Russia. After the separation, Kazakhstan's railroad workers proved to be without the industrial base that they needed. And currently not a single finished article is being produced in our republic to meet the needs of railroad transportation. That is the main problem today! In addition, railroad transportation has proven to be not ready for the changed trends in passenger flows. Previously even the people on business trips were sent basically to Moscow. But currently the number of passengers leaving Alma-Ata and going to Alma-Ata has doubled. The volume of shipments within the republic has increased. But our pool of passenger cars has become obsolete, they are wearing out, and there is simply a catastrophic shortage of them. And so we simply cannot carry approximately 20-25 percent of our potential passengers. Because of the break in the economic ties and the failure to receive payments, there has been an increase in the freight shipments within the republic. Previously the virgin lands received petroleum products from Omsk and Tomsk, and last year they came from Guryev. East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk Oblast used to receive coal from Kuzbass, but currently we bring it in from the Shubarkul deposit (Kazakhstan), that is, a distance that is twice as long as previously. There has arisen a problem with improving the system of administering rail transportation in the republic, because the previous union scientific and normative base has been lost. [Shirshova] How, then, will the branch develop in the future? [Isingarin] Most probably Kazakhstan's rail transportation will be constructed according to the Russian model. Therefore we are attempting to preserve close ties with the RF MPS [Ministry of Railroads]. This is expressed in a number of agreements that were signed by Kazakhstan Mintrans [Ministry of Transportation] and MPS. We support branch publications -- the ZHELEZNODOROZHNYY TRANSPORT magazine and GUDOK newspaper. Incidentally, GUDOK once published an article in which, in particular, it was mentioned that Isingarin is dreaming of creating an MPS of the Commonwealth countries. That is true. And I shall even add that I proposed creating a company on the scale of the CIS -- "Gruzovoy Vagon -- 1520"-- in order to unite all the railroad-car pools and to create on their basis an intergovernmental structure in which each country would be a shareholder with its own railroad cars, but in which there would be a single repair base and a single system for regulating the pools. But nothing has happened yet. The politicians are still holding onto their sovereignty, even if it harms the situation. Currently I am proposing creating from the Commonwealth's railroads a transnational railroad company with a single scientific-technical policy and a single leadership. The people of Kazakhstan are ready to forgo a certain part of their sovereignty for this purpose. But we shall all be winners since we shall not create our own scientific-technical base in each country. The transnational company could be created on the basis of the Russian MPS, but so far the CIS countries are probably not ready for this idea. Although the European Community's Commission on Transportation already is a kind of ministry for Europe's transportation. But for the time being the situation is forcing us to think about independent steps. We are uniting our own scientific forces, and with the aid of the Russian Academy of Transportation we are creating a national scientific center. Much is being done in our republic to manufacture spare parts. The steel-casting plant in Pavlodar produces parts for automatic couplers, and the motor-vehicle repair association in Alma-Ata produces elements for attaching reinforced-concrete ties. We have to produce 30-40 percent of the spare parts that we need. Currently we are also creating a plant base for repairing equipment. We shall also produce certain things, for example, passenger cars. For this purpose we intend to increase our business relations with Germany, Russia, and Turkey. Today we are unable to carry all the passengers across West Kazakhstan, and we also have a complicated situation with such shipments in the south of the republic. It is necessary to create new routes, and to make a number of trains daily ones. For this purpose we are attempting to purchase a hundred passenger cars in Germany. [Shirshova] What is the rate policy on the railroad main lines? [Isingarin] The rates are regulated by the state. Everyone thinks that the railroad workers must not suffer any losses from the shipments, but at the same time the republic is experiencing a sharp increase in the prices of energy carriers, although in our republic they will soon exceed the worldwide prices. But if there is another rise, the railroad workers will also be forced to raise the rate for shipments. This will impact upon the clientele. And the raising of the prices of their output will lead to the ruination of the railroads themselves. So everyone has to behave very cautiously. [Shirshova] A problem that is no less urgent today is the problem of nonpayments. What are the railroad workers undertaking in order to get the money that is owed to them? Aren't they suffocating from their debts? [Isingarin] At one time the Kazakhstan government made the decision: no freight would be shipped without prepayment. But currently, one after another, decisions are being made that require the railroad workers to ship without prepayment, whether it be coal, or grain, or gas for the population. As of today, we are owed 1.5 billion tenge. At the same time we ourselves have become debtors. The Virginland Railroad, for example, owes Russia almost 200 billion rubles. All this has led to a situation in which the railroad workers have been forced to accept output as a form of payment on account, to pay for the shipments. For example, it was decided that half the Ekibastuz coal that is en route to Russia should be channeled into paying off the miners' indebtedness to the railroad workers. We shall transfer that money to the Russian MPS in order to pay off our debts. The Kazakhstan government supports this kind of reciprocal settlement: there is no other alternative. [Shirshova] How have the market and the new relations had an effect on the operation of transportation? [Isingarin] Railroad workers were among the first in the republic to sense sharply the uncontrollability of the market. The volume of shipments dropped by one-half. Recently we resolved the question of preferential payment for them. If the customer has money for prepayment and has freight, the railroad workers guarantee to him that he will receive shipment benefits. We want to attract freight in this way. [Shirshova] Do the railroad workers have any hope of getting money in exchange for shipments? I am talking about indebtedness to three railroads of 1.5 billion tenge. [Isingarin] At the present time there is a republic-wide reciprocal offset. If it proves to be possible to carry it out intelligently, the railroad workers will be able to count on success. Starting in February of last year, the railroad workers have been attempting to get payment of shipments without invoice acceptance, but they have been unsuccessful... [Shirshova] We like to make parallels with the state of transportation abroad. But the countries in the near abroad give their railroads subsidies for their development. Can the Kazakhstan railroad workers count on this? [Isingarin] Only a rich country can give subsidies. As you know, the republic's budget at this moment is in a very difficult situation. There won't be any subsidies. In addition, railroad transportation, unlike many other branches in Kazakhstan, is currently operating at a profit. The only problem is that the profit drowns in the reciprocal debts. [Shirshova] Will the existing system of administering rail transportation be preserved? [Isingarin] We have already discussed among ourselves various alternatives and have decided that, at this stage, it is more desirable to preserve the existing system of administration. When the economy settles down, the questions of material-technical supply are resolved, and the market requirements are defined, then we shall also improve the administrative system. If one speaks about the economics of railroads, the reduction in shipments will continue for many years. We shall not return to the volumes of the 1980's in the foreseeable future. In addition, there has been an intensification of labor. Even if, within, say, 20 years, we do return to that volume of shipments that we used to have, we shall cope with it with a much smaller continent of workers. Our hope is to open two new international through-shipment main lines: the Trans-Asian and the Eurasian main lines. [Shirshova] Today China is worried about the rise in prices for through shipments by way of Kazakhstan. There is less freight than one would like. What is the reason for this? [Isingarin] The Chinese railroad workers are waiting things out. They are building 1620 kilometers of second tracks between Urumchi and Lanchow. As soon as the construction is completed in 1995, a broad exit will immediately open up for a flow of freight, and it is our task not to create any barriers to this flow, either in the form of customs barriers or rate barriers. It is necessary for us to think about how, in the year 2000, we can guarantee the shipments of freight from China in a volume of 10 million tons, of which 5 million will be by rail. I feel that we must be able to carry the same number of millions in the direction of Turkey and Iran. If that through shipment occurs, the volume of work will undoubtedly increase and this will simultraneous resolve a number of problems linked with personnel downsizing, earnings, etc.
