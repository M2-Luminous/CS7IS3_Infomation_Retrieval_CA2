Addressing the forum "Reality and Prospects for Russia's Economic Development," he said that the Moscow administration would work out a privatization program of its own. He accused the Committee for State Property, led by Anatoliy Chubays, of sacrificing economic results to politics and of squandering state money. He categorically disagrees with the Chubays-developed program, according to which the privatization of enterprises in 1994 will be based on their balance cost in 1991 prices. The 1.5 Tn rubles at which the Committee for State Property estimated the property to be privatized for vouchers will not suffice even for maintaining this committee's bloated staff, stated Luzhkov. He also said that the idea of democratic privatization was a failure and that the voucher funds will be a failure, too. The privatization program violates the law on property, sets the federation and its constituent members against each other, and disregards local conditions and specific features of individual branches and enterprises. He emphasized that Moscow would be guided by its own interests and by the need to replenish the state treasury and stimulate industrial production. "If the Chubays program is not revised, we'll have many troubles," he said.
