Addressing the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institute, Hurd remarked that Turkey is becoming increasingly closer to Europe. He noted that ways to advance this process will be explored during the talks in Ankara. Hurd explained that this process will be accelerated if Turkey resolves its economic problems such as high inflation and the budget deficit as soon as possible. Noting further that Turkey has great knowledge and experience concerning its geographical region, Hurd declared that Britain understands the struggle waged against terrorism and believes that this problem will be surmounted within the framework of democracy.
