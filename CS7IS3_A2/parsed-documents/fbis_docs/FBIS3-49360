In connection with the death of Clinton's mother today, Zieleniec expressed hope that the programme of Clinton's stay in the Czech Republic would turn out well, although minor and even basic changes could be expected. Regarding Polish and Hungarian criticism of the arrangement whereby the meetings between Clinton and leaders of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) would be bilateral rather than taking the form of a Visegrad Four meeting, Zieleniec said that the programme had been made according to the American side's wish to hold a regional meeting in Prague. He said the programme was being intensively discussed with all the participants. It is natural as the meeting is being held in Prague that Clinton's talks will have both bilateral and multilateral aspects, Zieleniec said. It is not expected that Clinton will deliver an extensive speech on the occasion -- the debate would rather concentrate on particular problems, Zieleniec said. Nor is it expected that a joint document will be signed. The visit and the discussions will be extremely important not only for the security of the Central European region but for the whole of Europe and the world, Zieleniec said. He said Central Europe was also participating in the search for a new face for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) which had lost the form it originally had in a bipolar world. For the Czech Republic, membership in NATO as in other integrated groups was a question of historic, civilisation and cultural identity rather than a question of resolving concrete problems, Zieleniec said. He said the Czech Republic's efforts to obtain NATO membership were not in competition with other countries. The U.S. Partnership for Peace project was important because it opens up space for initiative rather than defining particular form of relations. Although the Czech Republic welcomes it, this does not mean that it considers it an ideal solution, Zieleniec said. The openness of this project would enable each country to individually develop relevant activity according to its possibilities and needs. "It is a project which fits the general philosophy of our approach towards the transformation of our state," Zieleniec said. He said that the project's political dimention should be more clearly defined so that it was not merely confined to joint military exercises, exchanges of military experts and so forth but also included political criteria. NATO faces the task of gradual transformation into an alliance concentrating on certain civilised values, which requires extremely intensive political activity within nato as well as activity aimed at its expansion, Zieleniec said.
