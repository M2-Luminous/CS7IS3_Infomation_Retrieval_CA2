At today's session, several deputies delivered reports on miscellaneous issues. Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb told deputies about the course of negotiations with Russian experts on the merger of the Belarusian and Russian financial systems. Then, Myechyslaw Hryb expressed his opinion on yesterday's increase in prices for bread and baked goods. He said that the question of who had adopted this decision is being clarified because the government had earlier promised that there would be no price increases in February. [Begin Hryb recording] We are currently clarifying this issue along with the government. Why has the production of bread and baked goods been cut and who is to blame? We will later discuss this issue. In my opinion, we should control all prices. [end recording] Later, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich took the floor and said that the new prices for bread and baked goods will be suspended and those guilty will be punished. Then, the lawmakers continued to discuss draft laws. They discussed the draft Supreme Soviet decree on limiting the state's foreign debt and on the use of foreign credits. This issue is very complicated, some financial violations and official abuses have been discovered, therefore the decree should foresee that in the future these negative tendencies be excluded. The deputies decided to continue work on this document. Later, the deputies introduced some amendments and supplements to the law on investments in Belarus. Then, the Supreme Soviet dismissed Minister of Justice Leonid Dashuk in connection with his appointment to a new job. I spoke with People's Deputy Gennadiy Lovitskiy, acting chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State Security [KGB]. [Begin recording] [Rudkowski] Gennadiy Mikhaylovich, you had to examine the resolution of the Republican Strike Committee [BZK] on holding an indefinite political strike. What did you learn? [Lovitskiy] According to the Supreme Soviet decision, the general prosecutor of Belarus has issued a warrant to investigate this issue. The examination of the BZK resolution from 26 January, adopted at a joint session of the leadership of the BZK Council and its Executive Bureau is being conducted. This resolution ends with the following words: All of you should fight against this regime! The resolution is signed by BZK Chairman Zimin. I want to remind everyone that this examination is being performed legally, without any political background, I am categorically against it; we will assess its legality and take corresponding measures. [Rudkowski] What will happen if the strike is held? [Lovitskiy] If the strike is legal, it will be held. Currently, there are different approaches to this issue. I do not want to draw any conclusions, we require a legal investigation of this document. [end recording]
