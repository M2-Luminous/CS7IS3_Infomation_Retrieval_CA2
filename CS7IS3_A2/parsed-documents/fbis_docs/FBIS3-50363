According to the generals, a lack of funds not only makes it difficult to implement tasks that have already been planned but also determines the fact that the process of the Army's technical deterioration will not be stopped. This pessimistic analysis was presented to President Lech Walesa, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during their first visit to the Polish Army's General Staff on Thursday [27 January]. In the presence of Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Mieczyslaw Wachowski, minister of state in the President's Office, the officers presented results of analyses and of conceptual work pertaining to the Army's new model. The meeting was closed to the press. According to the plans, an "aerial-mobile," land-aerial army is to be established within two years, whose basis will be provided by armored forces, landing-storming forces, the air force, and aerial cavalry, Major Mariusz Jedrzejko told us. He is the spokesman for the Collegium of Armed Forces' Commanders of the Republic of Poland and the only person authorized to inform the press on the contents of Thursday's talks. The only reason the General Staff could be happy with the talks (the General Staff, according to recent announcements by its chief, General Tadeusz Wilecki, is to become the chief institution for commanding the Polish Republic's Armed Forces) was that there were unanimous declarations made by both the head of state and the Cabinet chief that they care very much for defense issues. President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak announced that they will support the necessary legislative changes that would make it possible to continue with the reforms in the area of the defense system. They also expressed their interest in the idea of establishing a National Defense Fund that would collect financial means from society. These would then be devoted primarily to purchasing modern combat equipment.
