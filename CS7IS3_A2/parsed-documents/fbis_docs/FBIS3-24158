Among the claimants to the deputy pie are about 300 presidential representatives in the localities and 250 chairmen of local councils; there are six officials of the special services, Defense Minister Radetskyy, and 28 former and current members of the Ukrainian Government. For the first time, there has truly emerged the paradoxical situation of competition among the nomenklatura. In many regions of the state, especially in its central part, the following pattern of intranomenklatura "apportionment" may be observed: Competing against each other are the local presidential representative, the local council chairman, envoys of the Kiev teams of Plyushch and Kravchuk, a local kolkhoz chairman and the director of a small plant.... The fact that the nomenklatura has not been able to share the positions among "its own" is in itself cause for surprise, but no less interesting is the fact that there is now practically no one to head the Ukrainian Government. The following persons have suspended the performance of their official duties for the duration of the election campaign: Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy; Deputy Prime Ministers Yevtukhov, Landik, and Zhulynskyy; Ministers Shpek, Pyatachenko, Kaskevych, Dotsenko, Karasyk, and Golubchenko; State Television and Radio Company Chairman Okhmakevych, who, in the confusion of the elections even organized his own micro-party; and Arbitration Court Chairman Prytik. The state is being run by deputies. From circles close to the president's, this information has come: Despite the fact that in his public statements, Kravchuk demonstrates full confidence in the victory of "his people," the real situation there is close to panic. One may consider as indirect confirmation of this the fact that at least five presidential advisers are registered as candidates for people's deputy of Ukraine. One could also evaluate this as an attempt by the president to gain the support of at least a modest circle of deputies in the new parliament; however, the facts testify that no aspirants to the vacant adviser's positions are to be found among the nomenklatura members. It seems as if the current elections are a matter of life and death to the nomenklatura. "What is happening now in Kiev around the national-democratic forces," says Les Tanyuk, member of the Rukh leadership, "reminds one of a return to 1989." The mysterious disappearance of Mikhail Boychishyn, who seriously impeded Rukh's operational activity, became the beginning of a total examination of this organization by various interested institutions. It is well known that the accounts of Rukh's Ukrainian sponsors have been frozen, and incidents have multiplied of persecution of Rukh figures on the part of criminal circles and of unlawful searches of the apartments of Rukh leaders, especially outside Kiev, where the nomenklatura still comports itself like a bull in a china shop. Although there is no information that would make it possible to draw fairly well-founded conclusions about the beginning of a single-minded campaign against Rukh, which its leaders insist is the case, the fact remains that a year ago Rukh did not feel such forcible pressure. It seems that Ukraine is gradually turning into a big Crimea, with its political terrorism and game-playing during the election preparations. The nomenklatura really did their homework and invented a mass of simple and painfully understandable "double plays," which allowed them to win the elections before the elections. If naive Western observers come to the polling stations after 20 March, then they, aside from the hospitable nomenklatura receptions, with the obligatory champagne and caviar, will receive every opportunity to become convinced of how fairly and in what complete conformity with the law the elections were being held. The nomenklatura is winning the elections now, not burdening itself with the invention of subtle and hardly perceptible mechanisms. The professional nomenklatura members in Krivoy Rog set up debates among the candidates without any warning to the voters. Tuesday, 25 January, an absolutely normal workday, is memorable to industrial Dneprodzerzhinsk for a rally that was held by the director of the Azot joint-stock company, Aleksandr Leonidovich Levchenko, who was running in the 83d Electoral District. Probably in order to stir up the interest of the future voters, he conveyed the workers to imeni Garanina Square in four buses, at the expense of their home enterprise. The free "hooky day" made everybody very happy. In Nemirov's Electoral District No. 58, there are five nomenklatura members competing against one another simultaneously. One of them is Comrade Kotsyuba, famous throughout all Ukraine. It is not such a big deal that Oleksandr Pavlovych has not managed to be president, even--he is a busy man, these things happen. It is not such a big deal that the documents for his registration were gathered by people with a high profile in Nemirov--workers of the local court and bar. Kotsyuba turned out to be enough of a "heavy hitter" for the people in Vinnitsa that he was already registered after 26 January, and the presentation of Rukh's local branch to the court was left with no answer of any kind. There are enough violations in the capital, as well. In one of Kiev's electoral districts, the local communist organization produced an excerpt from its party conference, which "nominated" candidates for people's deputy. An independent examination of the home addresses of people who were allegedly present at the conference established the participation of "dead souls." It turns out that Communist Party pensioners were making use of the old discount cards of former CPSU members who had long ago left Kiev or who had recently died. The popular verbal flourish "a Communist remains a Communist, even after death" has at last found its own practical application. The battle of the nomenklatura clans of the village, rayon, oblast, and "Kievan" levels is steeped in mutually exclusive interests. Many members of the nomenklatura, not wishing to experience happiness in cities of millions, have dashed off to the modest towns and villages and have been surprised to see there not only their former colleagues from the parliament, but also the fact that the local nomenklatura has in fairly serious fashion been working with the voters through the delivery of mineral fertilizers and the construction of kindergartens. The phenomenon where, as in Nemirov, several nomenklatura candidates are nominated to compete among themselves is a sign not only of the fact that the local regions enjoy a "promising" reputation among members of the nomenklatura (remember that among the "sons of Lieutenant Schmidt," educated Moscow and polar Minusinsk did not enjoy popularity, while all of the "sons" were ready to travel to Bobruisk and Vitebsk at once), but also of a more important circumstance--among the nomenklatura there exists no single "leading and guiding center." It is not inconceivable, however, that in a situation of mutual removal of candidacies in favor of a more successful nomenklatura member and of repeat elections, such a center, spontaneously or not, would still emerge. Now it is possible to observe several such centers--Kravchuk's, Plyushch's, and those of the defense and agrarian sectors, among whom mutual understanding is not achievable. True, the internal conflicts of the nomenklatura are balanced out by discord among the democratic candidates. Meanwhile, the experience of the latest presidential elections demonstrates that it is impossible to convince the democrats to cede their single club to a competitor, whereas the nomenklatura is saved by its instinct for self-preservation.
