Several days ago the management of the territorial branch of the Sibenergo energy generating amalgamation threatened to disconnect the eastern part of the Baykal region from the single power grid of Russia for delays in the payment of debts. Partially the threat was put into effect: Electricity supply to the Chita region from neighbouring regions was reduced almost by three times. As a result of it, a schedule of switching off cities and districts one after another began to be implemented today. Industrial enterprises are being supplied with electricity under an emergency regime. Freight and passenger traffic at the trans-Siberian railway line may come to a standstill. Commenting on the situation, Valeriy Lomako, first deputy head of the regional administration, told ITAR-TASS that the local government authorities are trying to prevent a complete energy blockade of the area by holding talks with Sibenergo. A compromise has not yet been reached, because the region has no money to pay the debt, and there are no other sources of financing in sight. In the opinion of Lomako, the conflict between the region and Sibenergo can hardly be settled without the interference of the Russian Government.
