The shipment of coal was preceding normally. When suddenly the alarm on the control panel went off -- one of the skip elevators had broken down. They replaced the electronic part of the instrument, but there was no change.... The duty engineer discovered the cause and reported that a sensor containing a radioactive source of cesium 137 had been stolen. Only with the help of this device is it possible to spot in the shroud of coal dust the critical moment which is followed by an inevitable accident. Several hours had passed after the emergency situation near Shakterskiy, when a still more alarming signal came from the city of Dzerzhinsk. Here three vials disappeared at once during the work shift. The robbers did not stand on ceremony, and carried them off together with their lead containers, which weigh 100 kg each. The disappearance from industrial enterprises of radioactive isotopes with an activity of three curie is no laughing matter. Hence, the events were immediately reported to officials of the Donetsk Oblast Association for the Protection of Public Health. The official investigation uncovered many circumstances of the theft of the lethal vials -- customers have been found abroad and, for the sake of relatively paltry sums of hard currency, people are exposing themselves to the risk of a slow death. These thefts, which are taking on the character of a real disaster for Donbass enterprises, are already becoming customary. Twenty-one such "accidents" -- this is how the emergency situations involving radioactive isotopes are described in official documents -- have been recorded in the oblast. But whereas until recent times 14 cases were caused by unpremeditated actions and circumstances, seven in the last few months have been the result of thefts.
