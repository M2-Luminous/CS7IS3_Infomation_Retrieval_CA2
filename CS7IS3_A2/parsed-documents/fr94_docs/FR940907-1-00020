ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve revisions to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on November 17, 1993, for the purpose of implementing a program of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: To be considered, comments must be received by October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Scott Southwick, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relative to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations.
