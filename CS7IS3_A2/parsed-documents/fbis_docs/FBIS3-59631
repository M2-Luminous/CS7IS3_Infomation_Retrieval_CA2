Then there are another 4,394 areas suspected of military and weapon pollution. These figures have been reported by the Federal Environment Agency in Berlin. With the "Administrative Agreement on the Regulation of Ecological Pollution" (Administrative Act on Pollution Financing, Federal Gazette No 58, 25 March 1993, p 2842), the Federal Government and the new laender have agreed to share the costs. This agreement ties in with the exemption clause in the Environment Law. According to it, the responsible land authorities in eastern Germany may exempt investors from liability for already existing pollution. In all, more than 60,000 such exemption applications have been submitted, but until now only a fraction of them have been decided. For the exemptions which receive a favorable decision the administrative agreement provides that the Trust Agency and the land, with commensurate participation by the buyer (at least 10 percent), share the costs at a ratio of 60:40. This regulation applies to existing Trust Agency businesses or those privatized after 1 January 1992. For the so-called large projects, the cost sharing is 75:25. For the Large Brown Coal Cleanup Project the financial basis was set at DM 1.5 billion annually until 1998. For the Large Chemical Project, with the individual projects Buna AG, Leuna-Werke, Filmfabrik Wolfen, Chemie AG Bitterfeld and Hydrierwerk Zeitz, about DM 2.3 billion must be anticipated, according to present estimates. For another 14 large projects agreed on by the Trust Agency and the laender, a funding requirement of about DM 100 million, respectively, is assumed. These projects are: - Berlin: The region of the Spree Industrial Area (Adlershof, Rummelsburg, Ober- and Niederschoeneweide, Johannisthal sectors) - Brandenburg: The Kreis Oranienburg region (Hennigsdorf, Velten, Birkenwerder, Oranienburg, Hennigsdorf Business Park sectors) - Mecklenburg-West Pomerania: Neptun-Warnow-Werft Rostock, MTW Schiffswerft Wismar - Saxony: Saxonia AG Freiberg, Olefinwerke AG Boehlen-Lippendorf, Lautawerk GmbH - Saxony-Anhalt: Erdoel/Erdgas-Gommern GmbH (Salzwedel/Peckensen development region), Mansfeld AG (Rohuette Helbra, copper-silver mine), Magdeburg Rothensee region) - Thuringia: Kali-Werra AG (Merkers), Kali-Suedharz AG (Sondershausen, Bleicherode, Sollstedt, Bischofferode), Rositz Administration and Third-Party Rights Exploitation Association. In addition to these billion-mark sums, the federal government is providing another DM 13 billion for accident prevention measures in the region of the Wismut enterprises.
