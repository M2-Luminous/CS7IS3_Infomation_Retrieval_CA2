Rivero said the conclusion of the school year is less than 45 days away and already 7,000 graduating university seniors have been informed where they will have a job. There are ongoing talks with authorities to determine where the rest will work. Rivero said a great effort is being made to guarantee jobs for all graduating students. Cuba is enduring severe economic difficulties following the loss of its main foreign markets as a result of the disappearance of the socialist camp in Europe and of the Soviet Union and as a result also of the tightened economic blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States more than three decades ago.
