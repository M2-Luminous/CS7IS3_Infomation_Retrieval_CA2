There probably would be no reason to delve into the subject of the Duma today had it not been for one somewhat alarming aspect of its activities. Among other documents presented for the consideration of Duma members was the Statute on Material Support of the Activities of the Deputies to the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. The deputies came up with a lot of comments and amendments. What is it that the parliament members are not happy about? The list of amendments indicates that it is mostly the level of their own material support. It came out, for instance, that Duma members are not happy with a salary that amounts to 90 percent of a federal minister's salary plus bonuses for the special nature and intensity of the job, as well as for length of service. It does not look much compared to commercial structures, and, judging by all signs, they feel insulted at being equated to ministers. There was a multitude of proposals, including this: to set a Duma member's salary at $3,000 paid in ruble equivalent... In the end they finally agreed on the following: to set a Duma member's salary as equal to that of a federal minister plus bonuses... Somewhere on the plus side of half a million. And 40 days vacation. A lengthy discussion ensued on the topic of the size of reimbursement for various expenses such as telephone calls and other unforeseen deputy expenses. The discussion reached its peak when the matter of providing Duma members with transportation came up. Parliament members were not about to accept a motor pool service on request. Some insisted on having a phone in the car. The majority, however, were most pleased with the proposal of S. Baburin, veteran of Russian parliamentary life, to assign an official car to each deputy. It is easy to visualize: 450 cars (one for each member of the State Duma) idle the entire workday around the parliament's perimeter waiting for a call like this: "Deputy Baburin's car--to the entrance!" It is, of course, both convenient and prestigious. I think, however, that Deputy N. Travkin was right in trying to explain to his colleagues what kind of blow to their reputation such decisions produce. They did not listen to him, however. In short, the entire course of the discussion on the matter of deputies' material support graphically demonstrated how strong among us is the conviction that it is so much better to champion people's interests on a salary no lower than that of a minister and to look at the outside world from the window of a personal chauffeured car...
