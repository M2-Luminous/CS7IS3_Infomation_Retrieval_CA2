On the second day of sessions in Belem do Para, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim spoke of Cuba's reintegration into the OAS Assembly and insisted on the need to reevaluate Cuba's situation within the hemispheric community. Outgoing OAS President Joao Baena Soares, as well as Brazilian President Itamar Franco, recommended during last night's inaugural meeting that Cuba's reintegration be studied. This topic was not on the agenda of the meeting, which will conclude on 10 June.
