Subsequently, the values of bilateral trade and investment are growing accordingly. Statistics from the Customs Department show that the total trade values between Thailand and Laos in 1991 and 1992 were recorded at 3.15 and 4.01 billion baht respectively. From January to October 1993, the value of Thai-Lao trade rose to 4.93 billion baht. Taking into account the illegal trade activities along the common border, the actual trade values could be five times more than those in the official records. However, the governments of the two countries have imposed a ban on trade in certain types of commodities. Since the two countries share a common border as long as 1,730 kilometers with 14 temporary and permanent border crossing points, it is not easy to prevent smuggling of such goods, as restricted products are available in the markets on both sides of the common border. Ninty-five percent of commodities on sale in local market places from the northern to southern regions of Laos come from Thailand. Both the Thai and Lao Governments admit that they cannot really control trade between their two countries. Although Thai goods are now occupying the Lao domestic market, it is very likely that they will lose their lion share in the near future, as happened in the case of the Vietnamese and Burmese markets, which are now being flooded with goods from China and Singapore. No Thai merchandise is on sale in those markets except a few along the borders areas. This is a clear evidence of the failure of the Thai Government's trade policy. The Thai Government has always overlooked the significance of these neighboring countries. The Commerce Ministry, in particular, seems only to pay attention to distant markets. Recently, the Chinese and Lao Governments signed an agreement on trade cooperation and goods exchange. Hence, Chinese goods will definitely push Thai products out of the Lao market in the next one or two years if the Thai Government remains idle and does nothing to prevent such an eventuality. Touring different markets along the Thai-Lao border, trade restrictions are the main obstacle. Laos itself is unable to produce certain goods for its own domestic consumption; it has to depend on neighboring countries like Thailand. The goods flow into the country through both legal and illegal channels. We are worried that in the next one or two years, when Vietnam is capable of producing more goods and the roads to Laos are improved, Thai goods will not be able to compete in the Lao domestic market. We know that the tentacles of the Thai mass media can reach every corner in Laos and attract Lao consumers to Thai products. Why doesn't the Thai Government do something like revising the laws and regulations to promote trade between the two countries and help Thai goods compete with products from China and Vietnam. We believe that the present Thai Government can solve the problem because it is not "that stupid." However, it must be sincere in dealing with the problem. It's a pity that Thai business people engaging in the trade between the two countries are left struggling to safeguard the Lao market without any assistance from the government. Many have already given up and are simply waiting to see the end of the Indochina market for Thai goods. It is not too difficult for the government to recognize past mistakes and take the necessary action to keep the entire Indochina market for Thai products. By so doing, it will sacrifice some of our immediate benefits for the sake of long-run interests. The government must sign trade agreements with the Indochinese countries, China, and Burma; lower tax barriers; and reduce import duties on agricultural products from these countries. We can buy raw materials and agricultural products from neighboring countries and sell our finished products to them. I want to see the day when the Indochinese countries regard Thailand as "Japan No. 2".
