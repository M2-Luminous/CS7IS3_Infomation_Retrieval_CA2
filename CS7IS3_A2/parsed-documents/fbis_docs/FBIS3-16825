I have three tasks to fulfill during my visit to Ukraine, stated U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry at Borispol airport. The first task is to strengthen and renew relations with our old friends; second, is to continue working with the Ukrainian Government and the Defense Ministry to step up the implementation of the very important trilateral Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. agreement signed by Presidents Leonid Kravchuk, Boris Yeltsin, and Bill Clinton in Moscow in January of this year; and my third task will be to cooperate with the Ukrainian Government within the framework of the program of economic development and conversion of military industrial enterprises. The U.S. delegation is planning to visit Pervomaysk and acquaint itself with how a variety of programs on dismantling nuclear weapons according to the Moscow trilateral agreement are being implemented. After that, Secretary Perry will visit a classified site in Dnepropetrovsk, the biggest production complex specializing in missile equipment production. For the first time in the history of such enterprises, the Pentagon chief later emphasized, a U.S. secretary of defense will have the opportunity to personally observe operations at one of these sites.
