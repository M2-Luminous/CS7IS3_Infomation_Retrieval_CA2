Tianjin Municipality saw foreign investment valued at US$120 million in place in the first quarter of this year or 120 percent up over the same period last year while Guangzhou Municipality registered foreign capital valued at US$489 million or 80.8 percent. Foreign investment in Beijing, Shanghai and Fuzhou showed various gains. Foreign investment tended to have an increasing share in newly approved joint-ventured enterprises and items while some consortia and leading companies tried to have a more-than-50-percent share in their investment in enterprises and items in a bid to grab the decision-making or dominant power. Solely foreign-funded enterprises, meanwhile, are increasing with 85 out of 194 foreign-funded enterprises newly registered last month in Shenzhen being of such kind. There were 637 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved between last January and March in Beijing and 554 such enterprises in Tianjin, with each city having pledged foreign investment of over US$1 billion. The utilization of contracted foreign capital indicated a gain with US$1.945 billion in Shanghai and US$3.384 billion in Guangzhou. Tertiary industry has become a popular sector for foreign investment with a rebound in investment in real estate. There were 161 items of tertiary industry invested by foreign businessmen in Shanghai during the first quarter of this year. The pledged foreign capital introduced for these items was put at over US$1 billion, making up 60 percent of the gross foreign capital. Tianjin saw 35 foreign-related real estate items signed during the first quarter with pledged investment valued at US$170 million. Some overseas groups including the Hong Kong Lai Sun Group entered the real estate market in Shanghai while the Beijing branch of L & D Limited was very busy with real estate items. As small- and medium-sized items tended to integrate into one another, the number of main consortia, items invested and the value involved in investment were both on the rise. Some 11 internationally known companies including the McDonald's Restaurants of the United States and Sony of Japan made investment in Shanghai while some 30 multinational companies such as General Motors of U.S., the ABC company of Switzerland and Siemens Ag. of Germany are now holding negotiations on items for investment or on the establishment of headquarters in China. In Guangzhou there are consortia and companies from 19 countries and regions competing with one another for investment. Contracted foreign investment signed with seven countries and regions including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao and the United States was valued at over US$20 million on average. By the end of last March, ten out of 42 top wealthy ethnic Chinese figures around the world who have invested in Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Russia joined forces recently to set up a military-turned-civil high technology industry base in Pudong New Zone. There are to date some 5,000 branches of Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas companies and groups set up in Beijing and high grade office buildings are in great demand for foreign investors. Branches of Hong Kong companies running in Guangzhou no longer dominate the municipality while the United States and Japan and Germany are setting up branches there at a rapid pace. Foreign investors tended to make use of their profits for reinvestment into their invested items while some of them have even increased their investment to a great extent. Tianjin saw 26 foreign-funded enterprises have their investment rise by US$77.05 million during the first quarter of this year. Medium- and long-term investment is growing with an eye on long- term economic results instead of short-term investment. Siemens, AG. is scheduled to set up 20 to 30 joint-ventured enterprises in the Mainland in the coming two years with total investment valued at US$500 million. Yaohan of Japan plans to open 1,000 supermarkets by the year 2010 while New World of Hong Kong will make investment totalling HK$30 billion in the Mainland. A projection said that 1994 would be a boom year when foreign investment in the Mainland would grow more and more.
