The premier, in an interview printed in the Thursday morning edition of South Korean's daily TONG-A ILBO, repeated Tokyo's position of seeking a peaceful resolution on the issue through dialogue. Hata also made clear that in response to North Korea's alleged push for nuclear arms, Japan will take "responsible" action within the bounds of the constitution, which bans the use of force in settling international disputes. Noting Tokyo wants to forge future-oriented ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region based on repentance of its wartime wrongdoings, Hata said the Japanese Government is contemplating how to express remorse toward South Korea. Historians say around World War II, Japan sent to battlefront brothels an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 women, mostly from the Korean peninsula, then under Japanese colonial rule. Because Japan and South Korea are neighboring countries with common values of freedom and democracy, Hata said, Japan will strive to promote exchanges at all levels, deepen mutual understanding and step up bilateral cooperation in the international community.
