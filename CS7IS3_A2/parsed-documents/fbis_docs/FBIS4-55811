He fired from Nedzarici at Mojmilo and Dobrinja, from Brekin Potok at Kosevo stadium and Jezero, and with an antiaircraft gun and machine gun from (Orlovac) at the Kosevo stadium and Grdonj, while an M-84 machine gun was firing indiscriminately from Kromolj at Brekin Potok and Pionirska Dolina. By the way, in the 100 days since the [NATO] ultimatum, the Serb aggressor has violated the cease-fire exactly 1,375 times. The consequence of this is 11 killed and 106 wounded members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps. Today started on the Ilijas front with artillery attacks by the chetniks. One tank and three howitzers from (Ubare) and mortar batteries from Srednje fired at Korita and Jasen. Two howitzers from (Medojevici), and a tank and howitzer from (Nabozici) fired all day at Jasen and Meskovac. Infantry attacks followed. On two occasions the chetniks attempted to break through our defense lines at Jasen and (Polom), but without any success. In these attacks the aggressor suffered serious losses, with about 20 chetniks killed and a number of others put out of action. Despite the serious losses the chetniks did not abandon the attacks. They had attempted a further three breakthroughs at Jasen by late afternoon, while other parts of the front were exposed to artillery attacks. These are still under way but with reduced intensity. This has been a statement by the 1st Corps Information Service.
