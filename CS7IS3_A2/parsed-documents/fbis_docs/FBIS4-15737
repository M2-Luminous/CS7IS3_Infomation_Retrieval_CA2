Yeltsin's main tasks are to reinforce the political mutual understanding between our countries and to get economic cooperation moving. He will meet with King Juan Carlos and Premier Felipe Gonzalez and will sign the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation that was initialed in Moscow back in April 1992. But this relates to the political side of the visit; as for economic relations, these will boil down to the expression of good intentions. According to every indicator, the level of mutual trade -- which was not distinguished by any great achievements in any case -- simply collapsed last year. Russian exports were almost entirely made up of raw materials, and sales of machinery and equipment fell. At the same time, Russian imports from Spain -- with foodstuffs predominant -- almost doubled. Over the past year trade turnover between our countries has fallen 46 percent. According to the Russian delegation members, Boris Yeltsin will not be raising the question of "unfreezing" the unused part of the $1.5-billion Spanish loan granted to the USSR in 1990. By early 1993 Moscow had not repaid its debt on the half of this sum that has already been "consumed." Moreover, the Spanish Government has no spare cash. So in practice Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic relations, has very little room for maneuver on achieving a breakthrough in the development of trade relations with Spain. On other point: The Russian president, contrary to the considerable speculation about his health, will not be undergoing medical treatment at the Barcelona hospital where he underwent an operation in 1990. He will not even be visiting it. But Yeltsin will meet at his residence with the doctors who treated him.
