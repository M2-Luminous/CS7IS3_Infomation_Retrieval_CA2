The league should seize the opportunity to further emancipate the mind. The league should also accelerate reform and opening up and develop the market economy in both cities and the countryside. This was stressed repeatedly by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, during his recent inspection tour of Jirem League. From 25 to 28 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region, led comrades in charge of the pertinent departments and bureaus under the regional party committee and the government to conduct a four-day inspection of Jirem League. Wang Qun and his entourage expressed sympathy and solicitude for the disaster-afflicted people in Qiandemen Sumu in Jarud Banner. They also convened a forum with the participation of comrades in charge of industrial and commercial enterprises, township and town enterprises, and monetary units, and listened to the work reports of party committees of Jirem League and Tongliao City. Wang Qun and some other leading comrades fully affirmed and highly appraised the achievements scored by Jirem League despite the natural calamities to its agriculture and animal husbandry and despite the numerous problems facing the urban economy. Wang Qun stressed that from now on attention should be paid to the following five aspects. First, in the light of existing difficulties and problems, the league should enhance morale instead of feeling discouraged and should approach the situation in a correct and all-around manner. As a big agricultural league, Jirem League is furnished with good conditions in various fields and is provided with the foundation for continued development. As a small industrial league, Jirem League should depend on development, transformation, and exploitation to resolve industrial problems. The league should depend on increasing revenues and reducing expenditures and on accelerated development, which is most essential, to alleviate its fund shortage. The league is vast in territory, rich in natural resources, but small in population. Provided with good opportunity, topographical advantages, and support of the people, the league has great potential in becoming prosperous. Agricultural areas should develop the breeding, the pastoral areas should develop the feed growing, and the entire economy should be oriented to the combination of agriculture, industry, commerce, and trade in order to exploit latent advantages. Second, all levels of party committees and governments and all functional departments should concentrate energies on reform, economic development, and national unity, which is the key of the present work, in order to ensure the smooth progress of all the work of this year. This year, the league should concentrate on resolving major contradictions and carrying out reforms in rural and urban areas to accelerate development. Reform cannot remain in words and in slogans, but should be carried out in a resolute, practical, and painstaking manner until practical results are achieved. It should strive to improve the economic efficiency of rural and pastoral areas and pay attention to key projects, rather than undertaking "minor scattered projects." Third, to resolve monetary and financial problems, the league should depend on boosting the economy. The policies set forth by the state should be studies and applied well, and tax work should be stressed. Support should be given to the development of the tertiary industry, township enterprises, and individual and private sectors of the economy. Jirem League is not a place where "the mountains and the rivers end" but is a place "filled with dense willow tress and bright flowers." It should accelerate reform and depend on its own efforts to develop the economy. Financial, planning, and tax departments, as well as banks, should closely cooperate with one another to halt deficits. The league should be good at making and accumulating money. It should run mobile corporations that are opened to the outside world and are oriented to science and technology. It should also run the economic entities that are linked with peasant households. Because such economic entities are linked with both leading enterprises and numerous households, the government should provide them with preferential policies and conditions, as well as sufficient land. Cadres in their prime should be sent to the first lines to grasp reform and development in an effort to build up capable and high-efficient leading bodies at all levels. Fourth, the league should strengthen the forces of tax, banking, industrial and commercial, financial, and political and legal departments, as well as corporations and enterprises. As for fund shortage, in addition to obtaining more funds from the regional authorities, the league should depend primarily on the market economic law to control the funds. In the right order of importance and urgency, by aiming at ensuring key projects, we should spend more limited funds on the enterprises that are the best in terms of economic returns. The funds should be distributed in line with new ideas and new methods. By adhering to the combination of cropping, breeding, and processing and the combination of trade, industry, and agriculture (animal husbandry), the league should engage in developing large-scale market, major commodities, and large-scale circulation. The leading enterprises should make great efforts to continuously improve their level. The league should set its sights high to build itself into the modernized agricultural and livestock product base of northeast China. Fifth, the league should strengthen party leadership, persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands, strengthen ideological and political work, manage social order in a comprehensive manner, and create a good political and social environment for reform and development.
