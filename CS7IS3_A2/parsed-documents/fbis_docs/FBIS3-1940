The Central Party Committee has set great store by strengthening the work of RENMIN RIBAO and created good conditions to make a breakthrough in the work of RENMIN RIBAO after the 14th Party Congress was held. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau gave a lot of important instructions to RENMIN RIBAO on propaganda work and newspaper office construction and set very high demands on the RENMIN RIBAO. At the forum, Shao Huaze conveyed to participants important instructions and guidelines given by key leading comrades of the Central Party Committee not long ago after they had listened to the work report of the RENMIN RIBAO as well as the work plan on publishing local editions and further running RENMIN RIBAO well. Shao Huaze said: In order to more specifically publicize the party line, principles, and policies in a more timely fashion, and to more effectively provide comprehensive information for local economic construction and social development, the Central Party Committee has consented to RENMIN RIBAO's proposal of publishing local editions. On 1 January, the RENMIN RIBAO East China edition will be first published in Shanghai, which is an important step in reforming the official party newspaper. Shao Huaze said: Preparations for publishing the RENMIN RIBAO East China edition have just begun, time presses, the tasks are arduous, there are a lot of difficulties, and we need strong support and help from leaders and the broad masses of Shanghai Municipality and of various provinces in East China. Shao Huaze extended heartfelt thanks to party committees, governments, and concerned departments of Shanghai Municipality and of various provinces in East China for their enthusiastic support of RENMIN RIBAO over the years. Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Committee, attended the forum and delivered a speech. He said: RENMIN RIBAO has done a good job after the 14th Party Congress was held, and leading comrades of the Central Party Committee fully affirm the work of RENMIN RIBAO. The fact that RENMIN RIBAO is going to publish an East China edition in Shanghai can more closely link up guidelines laid down by the Central Party Committee with real conditions of East China, thus helping the propaganda of RENMIN RIBAO draw closer to reality, to the masses, and to life. This is a ground-breaking measure which propaganda departments of Shanghai Municipality and of various provinces should fully support. Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, also made ebullient remarks at the forum. Zhou Ruijin, deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO, presided over the forum, which was attended by over 100 people in Shanghai Municipality, including leading party and government comrades, leaders of concerned commissions, offices, bureaus, prefectures, and counties, leaders of key news and propaganda units, and leaders of some noted enterprises. In addition, on the afternoon of 24 February, Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Huang Ju, mayor off Shanghai, met Shao Huaze, director of RENMIN RIBAO, and his party, and supported and welcomed the Central Party Committee's approval of the publication of a RENMIN RIBAO East China edition in Shanghai, saying that they would vigorously give all kinds of support.
