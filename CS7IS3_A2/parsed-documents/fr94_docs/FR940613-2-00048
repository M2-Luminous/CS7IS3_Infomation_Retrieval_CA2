FR940613-2-00048 FR940613-2-00032 The existing form of transaction by which both federal and state mutuals convert was developed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``FHLBB'') in 1974. What happens, essentially, is that the mutual sells itself, for cash, to whoever buys its newly issued stock. Various categories of potential purchasers get priority. In general, depositors stand at the head of the line. To the extent depositors and others with priority rights do not subscribe for stock, an attempt is made to sell it locally. If stock is still left over, it is sold to investors with no particular connection to the converting institution. The FHLBB was conscious, when it first wrote rules for conversions, that there might be value to the right to subscribe for stock in a conversion. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth raised only $20 million of new capital in converting, whoever got to buy the stock would have a claim on $120 million of net worth. In such a situation, the stock would almost certainly be worth much more than the buyers had paid for it. For about a year, in the early '70s, the FHLBB took the view that rights to buy stock in a converting institution should be distributed to its depositors, who could either exercise and become owners or sell the rights for their intrinsic value. The FHLBB subsequently abandoned this approach, however, primarily out of concern that depositors would shift funds from association to association, hoping to capture the intrinsic value of the rights when the conversion occurred_and on a scale that could be destabilizing. At the same time, it adopted the current approach, which included an ``appraisal'' requirement, providing that a converting institution issue and sell its capital stock at a total price equal to the estimated pro forma value of such stock in the converted institution. Because of moratoria imposed in 1973 and 1974, the existing form of transaction was not tested in great numbers until the '80s. At that point, it worked quite well, because many converting institutions had little net worth or economic value, and the market was extremely wary even of those that did. Depositors and other investors who subscribed for stock got securities with a market value approximately equal to what they paid for them. Problems With the Existing Process In the last two-plus years, as non-viable institutions have been closed and the industry has returned to health, the existing form of transaction has delivered windfalls to those who subscribed. In the more than 100 standard conversions in 1992 and 1993, the trading price at the end of the first day has exceeded the subscription price by, on average, 26%. In 40 instances, this price increase (the ``pop'') has exceeded 30%; in 6 instances it exceeded 50%. As it has become obvious to everyone familiar with the process that buying stock in a conversion is an easy way to make money, a class of `'professional depositors'' has emerged_wealthy individuals and investment partnerships with $50 to $500 accounts at literally hundreds of mutuals across the country. Investment banking firms active in the conversion arena advise us that there are perhaps 500 to 1,000 such professional depositors, and that they can take the account list of almost any mutual in the nation and recognize hundreds of names at sight. These professional depositors buy the maximum amount of stock allowed_and consequently the overwhelming majority of the stock issued in almost every conversion. Market participants have told us that in a typical conversion, less than 5% of depositors participate at all_and that the majority of them are professionals or insiders. Giving depositors the opportunity to subscribe for stock has not resulted in broad distribution of stock among them. The vast majority of depositors in mutual savings institutions keep their savings there precisely because they are risk-averse. They are likely to read and ignore or discard the offering circular. The money they keep in a savings institution has been put aside for retirement, or for emergencies, or for the down payment on first house, and cannot be invested in an initial public offering. They do not participate. The existing conversion process does not benefit them at all.
