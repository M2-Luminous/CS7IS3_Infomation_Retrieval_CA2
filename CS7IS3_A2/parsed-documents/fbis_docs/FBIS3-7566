While hoping to settle the issue through diplomatic efforts and avoid having to impose sanctions, the government instructed various ministries and agencies -- with the Prime Minister's Office playing the leading role--to study relevant laws and ordinances, taking into account the various ways the UNSC may consider imposing sanctions. Chinese cooperation is necessary within the UNSC to decide on imposing sanctions against North Korea. The effectiveness of sanctions also depends on China, which borders North Korea. For the government, however, studying the matter will involve constitutional issues linked to revisions in the security policy, and human rights issues. If imposing sanctions becomes a reality, serious political problems are expected to develop. Restricting Exchanges Japan almost imposed sanctions on North Korea in connection with the 1983 incident in which terrorists tried to bomb ROK VIP's in Rangoon, and the 1987 incident in which an ROK airliner was blown up. Those sanctions consisted of four points: 1) Restrictions on contacts between diplomats of the two nations; 2) prohibition, as a rule, on civil servants' visits to North Korea; 3) prohibition, as a rule, on entry by North Korean civil servants into Japan and strict screening of North Korean civilians regarding their entry into Japan; and 4) suspension of specially approved flights between Japan and North Korea. This time, the government is considering the possibility of implementing a measure to reject reentry permits to Korean residents in Japan who have temporarily gone back home to North Korea. There are approximately 700,000 North and South Koreans residing in Japan, of which about 200,000 are said to be North Koreans. Approximately 100,000 North Korean residents have returned there permanently since the end of the Korean war. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some 15,000 North Korean residents visited North Korea and reentered Japan in 1992. It is believed the majority of them "returned home" to visit their relatives who have remained there. In some quarters of the government, there are officials who strongly oppose the idea of refusing reentry permits, judging: "Since North Korean residents in Japan have been given permanent residence status, it would be a problem from a humanitarian point of view to impose restrictions on reentry permits." The government is also considering plans to suspend trade relations. In 1992, trade between Japan and North Korea totaled approximately 60 billion yen. In the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, there is a provision for placing trade under the control of the trade minister. As a result, the application of this provision has been suggested. Suspension of Remittances to North Korea In some quarters of the U.S. Congress, deep-rooted concerns have been voiced about remittances to North Korea by residents in Japan, arguing this may be one factor contributing to the country's economic activity. However, the Japanese Government does not have a good grasp of the actual situation. The government needs to revise the finance minister's notifications based on the Foreign Exchange Control Order [FECO] if it wants to "stop the remittances." The FECO says that a system, in which government approval is required to remit money abroad, can be introduced by issuing ministerial notification only when there are special reasons, such as UN resolutions. In the past, such measures were taken when economic sanctions were imposed against Iraq and Libya. Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials said: "Japan can cooperate with the United Nations in imposing economic sanctions by adding North Korea to the notification list." On the other hand, the government can impose restrictions on the flow of funds, money, carried out of the country by travelers. The maximum amount of money a person can carry out is 5 million yen. However, it seems the MOF is studying the possibility of strengthening checkups at ports, and of taking measures designed to reduce this limit for travelers going to North Korea by revising ministerial notifications. There is no doubt that such regulations will invite criticism that it is a discriminatory policy against North Koreans living in Japan. After the 1987 incident, in which a Korean airliner was blown up, violence and threats against North Koreans residing in Japan became a social problem. At a news conference held last month, Prime Minister Hosokawa commented on how Japan will deal with the issue of possible sanctions against North Korea, saying: "We must take the human rights issue into consideration." He said this because of the aforementioned incidents. Blockading the Seaborne Supply Route The Japanese Government believes the possibility of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula is currently very low. However, it is inevitable that military tension will rise should a blockade in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea begin. It is expected that most U.S. military personnel, weapons, military ships, and aircraft will be sent to the ROK via Japan to prepare for such a situation. U.S. military bases in Japan will have no choice but to become strong points for supplying fuel, ammunition, and food. Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty stipulates the U.S. military can use U.S. military bases in Japan "for the purpose of contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East" even when an armed attack is not made on Japan. The Japanese and U.S. Governments are expected to consult each other prior to using U.S. military bases for this purpose. The Defense Agency [DA] and Foreign Ministry interpret Article 6 to mean there are no legal problems in using U.S. military bases in Japan. As for the issue of Maritime Self-Defense Force [SDF] ships joining any blockade, the majority of Japanese people think, in relation to the right of collective self-defense which is banned by the constitution, that "participation in the blockade is impossible unless Japan introduces a new law that is equivalent to the law for cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations (PKO)" (according to a senior DA official). The issue of logistics support, and supplying food and fuel to U.S. military ships involved in military operations will be a focal point. The DA is of the view that in order to provide logistics support, it is necessary to clarify the SDF's power by revising the Self-Defense Forces Act. It seems likely that the issue of signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) with the United States will emerge. This agreement is required for Japan to offer transportation services, and to provide ammunitions and fuel to the U.S. military.
