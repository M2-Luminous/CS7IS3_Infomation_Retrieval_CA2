The amendment will be forwarded to Parliament for inclusion in the interim constitution. Parliament will also consider an amendment to the 13th constitutional principle on the position of the Zulu king. The amendment was accepted together with a resolution committing all the parties to accepting the election results. The amendment came about as a result of an agreement on Tuesday between President F W de Klerk, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. It reads: "A provincial constitution may, where applicable, provide for the institution, role, authority and status of a traditional monarch in the province, and shall make such provision for the Zulu monarch in the case of the Province of Natal/kwaZulu". The resolution on the elections committed all the parties to "free and fair elections and to doing everything to put a stop to the violence in our country". "We will accept the results of the elections and will abide by the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission in respect of the fairness and freeness of the elections. We will not resort to violence under any circumstances in order to pursue political objectives," the resolution said. Earlier both Mr Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer alleged that the IFP had settled for a lot less than was originally offered with regard to the Zulu king. Mr Meyer said it was clear that the IFP had hoped to postpone the elections by its tactics. IFP negotiator Walter Felgate said the IFP had acted not in its own narrow interests but in the interests of the entire country.
