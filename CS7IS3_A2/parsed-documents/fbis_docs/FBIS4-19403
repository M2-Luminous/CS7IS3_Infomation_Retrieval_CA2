Leotard told a press conference the men had helped 1,238 people -- 454 of them French nationals -- flee the country, where thousands have died in a week of savage ethnic, political and criminal violence. The bodies of two French soldiers killed in the fighting were flown home to France, Leotard said, along with the corpse of a woman and three French pilots killed in the plane crash a week ago in which the heads of state of both Rwanda and Burundi died. Their deaths triggered the current violence.
