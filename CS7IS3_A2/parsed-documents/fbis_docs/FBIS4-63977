However, confusion over the lists -- what should go to whom -- is delaying a resolution. This essentially simple solution to the situation -- taking everything and dividing it all up -- brings a wry smile to fleet officers' faces. After such a division it will scarcely be possible to speak of the Russian and Ukrainian fleets' possessing even basic combat effectiveness, because the Black Sea Fleet was created as a single entity to carry out fully defined tasks. Moreover, another perfectly natural question arises here: Is Ukraine capable of maintaining such an enormous structure on its own, given the republic's very grave economic situation? And even that is not all. Financial difficulties aside, a whole raft of other problems arise, particularly cadre problems. It is not clear how and where the Ukrainian Navy commanders will train the officer personnel for their own fleet. But the division of the ships is only part of the solution to the problem. The Russian ships will continue to be based in Sevastopol. Howver, the status of that city has still to be defined. The Russian side would like everything to remain as it was, but that does not suit Ukraine. A Russian military base in Sevastopol is fine; but Sevastopol as a whole as a Russian military base is not. The delicate issue of the fate of the Black Sea Fleet is being decided on this occasion not by the presidents but by the Russian and Ukrainian heads of government, even though previously Kravchuk and Yeltsin were dealing with this problem on their own. The faulty-telephone ploy -- the premiers themselves are not authorized to make any kind of final decision without the sanction of their presidents (Chernomyrdin and Zvyahilskyy are obliged to continually consult their chiefs) -- also drags out the negotiations. It is no secret that relations between Borya and Lenya (which, according to Boris Nikolayevich, is how the chiefs of Russia and Ukraine used to address each other not so long back) have markedly cooled of late. As the saying goes, friendship is all very well, but money is a serious matter. And the reason for this was Yeltsin's message to Kravchuk after the official Ukrainian authorities stated that they were ready the pay the highest price for Crimea. Boris Nikolayevich did not beat about the bush: The Ukrainian authorities should not try to resolve the Crimean issue from a position of strength. Leonid Makarovich had a ready response: He stated that the Russian president's message to him was not in keeping with international norms, which, translated from diplomatic into colloquial language, means "Keep out of our business!" Meanwhile, as many analysts note, inflaming passions over the Crimea plays into Kravchuk's hands. The upcoming presidential election has no attraction for Kravchuk. His only chance of remaining in the saddle is to postpone or call off the election altogether. However, that is a high-risk venture as, if he fails to keep the situation under control, in the eyes of international opinion he will lose the image of a politician who, despite everything, was able to avoid the worst-case scenario and keep Ukraine from collapsing. Moscow has gladly joined in this game. Both legislators and representatives of the executive -- literally all of them -- have expressed their opinions on the Crimean events. Taking their cue from the "battle of the iron chancellors," the local "Napoleons" have likewise gotten down to political business. Thus -- to the annoyance of the current Crimean authorities -- pro-Ukrainian forces have announced the creation of a Crimean Rada, that is to say, a parliament. This is the third legislative authority now in being on the peninsula: A Crimean Supreme Council and a Crimean Tatars' assembly function in one way or another. While the politicians are crossing swords, the people of the Crimea are worried by something else: What effect will the current battles have on the vacation season -- after all, the more vacationers, the greater the takings. It is to be hoped that the inhabitants of the peninsula will not be the losers in this situation.
