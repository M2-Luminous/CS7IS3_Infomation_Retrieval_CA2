FR940622-1-00062 FR940622-1-00027 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Part 1023 [Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;100 (Sub # 6)] Single State Insurance Registration [Petition of Lee's Permit Service, et al.] AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment due date. SUMMARY: By decision served May 24, 1994 (59 FR 27002, May 25, 1994), the Commission sought public comment by June 14, 1994, on a proposal to revise its regulations pertaining to registration by motor carriers with States. The Commission now is extending the due date for comments to June 28, 1994. The National Conference of State Transportation Specialists (NCSTS) has advised the Commission that it is holding its annual conference between June 12 and 16, 1994, and that its membership will have the opportunity to discuss the Commission's proposed amendments at the conference. As the conference will not end until after the original due date for comments, the NCSTS requires an extension of the comment period. The Commission therefore is granting an extension to give the NCSTS the time it needs to formulate and submit its comments. DATES: Comments must be submitted by June 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send an original and 10 copies of comments identified as such and referring to Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;100 (Sub-No. 6) to: Interstate Commerce Commission, Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Washington, DC 20423.
