He said a few platoons were sent in to "stabilise" the area where more than 20 people have died since Sunday night in fighting between hostel dwellers and Thokoza residents. The decision was taken at a meeting on Tuesday night between the SADF and NPKF "to avoid further bloodshed" in the townships, Maj Visser said. "Since April 18 the security situation in the Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus area deteriorated to such and extent that the commander of the NPKF in the area, Lieut Col Quentin Painter, requested the assistance of the SADF in the area. On Wednesday, the SADF were patrolling "hotspots" while most NPKF units had been confined to barracks, he said. Maj Visser added: "The NPKF is now busy with a reassessment of the situation and will present this to the NPKF Command Council as we are going to present our reassessment to the chief of the army regarding our involvement in the area from now onwards." Thokoza was quiet on Wednesday.
