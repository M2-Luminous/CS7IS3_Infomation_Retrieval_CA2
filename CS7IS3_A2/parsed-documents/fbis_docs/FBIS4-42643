Giorgio La Malfa, during a pause between the rallies of the European election campaign, drew up a balance sheet of the moves made so far by Berlusconi's new government, three weeks after its birth and 24 hours after the rapping on the knuckles from the Bank of Italy's governor. "Liberalism? I believe not a trace of it is left," the Italian Republican Party secretary said. "But, above all, there is no trace of the coherent economic policy which the country badly needs." [Petrini] Deputy La Malfa, let us start with what the Bank of Italy's governor had to say. Do you approve? [La Malfa] I should say so. Fazio's words were a polite but firm way of urging the government to make its economic policy clear. [Petrini] Judging from its platform, the majority should be pursuing a policy inspired on liberal principles: fewer taxes, deregulation of the labor market, individualism. Is this so? [La Malfa] These were the principles inspiring the election campaign. Before the elections, the majority proposed an economic expansion policy to be implemented by reducing taxes. However, a problem has now arisen: Such a policy does not accord with the necessary reconstruction of public finances. What does the government intend to do? Will it pursue the liberalism it proclaimed during the election campaign or will it follow [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's road, trying to reconcile support for economic recovery with the attempt to reduce the debt? [Petrini] In your opinion, what path is it following? [La Malfa] In my view, it is making a U-turn, going back on the liberal intentions vaunted during the election campaign. [Petrini] Does this mean that the "gap" in public finances will force the government to take back its promise of reducing taxes? [La Malfa] Most probably. I do not have any precise figures, but I know from my own experience that, every year, an adjustment in the region of 15 to 20 trillion lire [L] is necessary. This is without taking account of the fact that possibly certain figures were underestimated in this year's budget too. [Petrini] What is your assessment of Berlusconi's first steps in the past three weeks? [La Malfa] As regards privatization, the government stepped heavily on the brake. It decided to retain 51 percent of the INA [National Insurance Institute] for the Treasury and to continue government control through the "golden share" mechanism in public-sector companies. In these companies, it has not hesitated to appoint its own people to the boards of directors, as the Rasi-Telecom case shows. As regards the Alitalia issue, [Transportation] Minister Fiori immediately blocked the company reorganization plan which had been prepared by two capable managers such as Riverso and Schisano. [Petrini] Still, a first decree on employment has been drafted. [La Malfa] The law on employment is a copy of [former Labor Minister] Giugni's. As far as the South is concerned, I have noticed a contradiction in relation to the approach advocated during the election campaign, and I see nothing new in relation to the past. [Petrini] What do you think of Gasparri's remarks on Bankitalia? [La Malfa] Gasparri, the National Alliance's chief economist, vetoed the appointment of Padoa Schioppa who, among other things, is Bankitalia's senior director and therefore the most natural successor to Dini's post [at the Bank of Italy]. This stance is creating enormous embarrassment for the Bank of Italy's governor. If he appoints Padoa Schioppa, he will be challenging the government, and if he does not, then it means that the Bank of Italy has given up its own independence. At this point, I can only hope that what is involved is just an untimely remark, and that Berlusconi will immediately distance himself from it.
