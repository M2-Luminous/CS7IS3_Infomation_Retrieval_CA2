FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 27, 1993, June 24 and July 1, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 68398, 59 FR 32686 and 33958) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Grounds Maintenance District Ranger Office Building & Wahweap Housing Units, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Page, Arizona Janitorial/Custodial Military Traffic Management Command, 1312th Medium Port Command, Compton, California Janitorial/Custodial National Weather Service, Los Angeles International Airport, 10445 South Sepulveda Boulevard, Los Angeles, California Janitorial/Custodial Naval Air Station, Building 2739, Whidbey Island, Washington Janitorial/Custodial Criminal Justice Information Services Complex, Clarksburg, West Virginia This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
