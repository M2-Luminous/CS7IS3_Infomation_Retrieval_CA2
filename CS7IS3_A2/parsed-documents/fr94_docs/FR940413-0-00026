List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 190 Bankruptcy. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to the authority contained in the Commodity Exchange Act and, in particular, Sections 1a, 2(a), 4c, 4d, 4g, 5, e, 8a, 15, 19 and 20 thereof, 7 U.S.C. 1a, 2 and 4a, 6c, 6d, 6g, 7, 7a, 12a, 19, 23 and 24 (1988 & Supp. IV 1992), and in the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular, Sections 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761&hyph;766 thereof, 11 U.S.C. 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761&hyph;766 (1988), hereby amends part 190 of chapter I of title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 190_BANKRUPTCY 1. The authority citation for part 190 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1a, 2, 4a, 6c, 6d, 6g, 7, 7a, 12, 19, 23 and 24 and 11 U.S.C. 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761&hyph;766. 2. Section 190.08 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: §190.08 Allocation of property and allowance of claims. The property of the debtor's estate must be allocated among account classes and between customer classes as provided in this section, except for special distributions required under Appendix B to this part. The property so allocated will constitute a separate estate of the customer class and the account class to which it is allocated, and will be designated by reference to such customer class and account class. * * * * * 3. Part 190 is amended by designating appendix to part 190 as appendix A to part 190 and revising the heading and by adding appendix B to part 190 to read as follows: Appendix A to Part 190_Bankruptcy Forms * * * * * Appendix B to Part 190_Special Bankruptcy Distributions Framework 1_Special Distribution of Customer Funds When FCM Participated in Cross-Margining The Commission has established the following distributional convention with respect to customer funds held by a futures commission merchant (FCM) that participated in a cross-margining (XM) program which shall apply if participating market professionals sign an agreement that makes reference to this distributional rule and the form of such agreement has been approved by the Commission by rule, regulation or order: All customer funds held in respect of XM accounts, regardless of the product that customers holding such accounts are trading, are required by Commission order to be segregated separately from all other customer segregated funds. For purposes of this distributional rule, XM accounts will be deemed to be commodity interest accounts and securities held in XM accounts will be deemed to be received by the FCM to margin, guarantee or secure commodity interest contracts. The maintenance of property in an XM account will result in subordination of the claim for such property to certain non-XM customer claims and thereby will operate to cause such XM claim not to be treated as a customer claim for purposes of the Securities Investors Protection Act and the XM securities to be excluded from the securities estate. This creates subclasses of customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account (a person could hold each type of account), and results in two pools of customer segregated funds: An XM pool and a non-XM pool. In the event that there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer class segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds, all customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined and will be paid pro rata out of the total pool of available XM and non-XM customer funds. In the event that there is a shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer segregated funds, then customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the XM pool of customer segregated funds, and customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the non-XM customer segregated funds. Furthermore, in the event that there is a shortfall in both the non-XM and XM pools of customer segregated funds: (1) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool, all customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata; and (2) if the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement of the non-XM pool, non-XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available non-XM segregated funds, and XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available XM segregated funds. In this way, non-XM customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall. The following examples illustrate the operation of this convention. The examples assume that the FCM has two customers, one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts. However, the examples would apply equally if there were only one customer, with both an XM account and a non-XM account. 1.
