Although these rules vary by the type of sport played -- some are simple while others are extremely complex -- basically, the same rules apply in each sport regardless of where it is played. Since matches are played with the same rules, they can generate tremendous enthusiasm in players and spectators alike. In J League matches, although I did notice violations of rules by some players, I was not convinced the referee's application of rules was correct either. This type of situation is creating a barrier to the internationalization of Japanese soccer. The key to internationalization lies in common rules and fair application of those rules. This is not limited only to the field of sports. In order for all nations to compete and grow together, healthy competition is essential. In the field of economy, in order to prevent each country from making its own rules and using these rules as an excuse to close its market to other nations, GATT was created, a place where countries could get together and establish common rules governing tariff and trade. It was the United States which led the way, selling the idea of GATT to the rest of the world. That same United States, however, recently handed down its ruling concerning uniform patent rules, a decision which clearly violates the principle of internationalization. The U.S. has refused, for the time being, to change its system based on the principle of granting patent to the first to invent. There are two types of patent systems, depending upon who will be granted patent, viz., to the first to invent or to the first to file an application. Although, at a glance, the system granting the patent to the party who can prove it was the first to invent appears logical; in practice, it is extremely difficult to legally establish who really is the first to come up with a given invention. The United States is the only country among industrialized nations which still is using this system. The system designed to grant the patent to the first to file an application, on the other hand, simplifies examination and authorization processes. This is the system adopted by most advanced nations, such as Japan and Western European countries, across the board. Today, when technology is spreading across national borders, if countries do not have a uniform patent system, it is not possible to generate healthy competition in technological fields. The patent tends to create various problems which hamper internationalization, viz., examination setups, the duration of patents, and application of patents in foreign languages. For the past 10 years, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has been working on the creation of new international rules by reconciling various countries' systems. Based on the debate conducted at WIPO, a draft for the World Patent Accord Convention was completed last year and was to be adopted at a diplomatic conference. The focal point of the conference was whether the United States would be willing to change its "first-inventor" system. In response to the requests of various countries, Japan has been preparing for changing its setup by reducing the time required for examination and submitting applications in English. Almost all requests made by the United States to other countries have been accepted. Because of the council's report, the Bush Administration was leaning toward the "first-applicant" system. The situation was changed overnight, however, when the Clinton Administration took over. The shift to the first applicant system was to be reexamined. In spite of the wishes of the various countries which had been anxiously watching the United States's move since last summer and waiting for its response by postponing the diplomatic conference, the U.S. recently decided to adhere to the "first-to-invent" system. The firmly-rooted opposition of individual investors, academic circles, and organizations (that do not have patent specialists on their staff) to the "first-to-apply" system appeared to have succeeded. The realization of the patent convention, toward which the world's advanced nations had devoted their efforts during the past 10 years, once again has become remote. We realize that changing the existing system of many years at the request of foreign countries is bound to meet with strong resistance. However, they should know that in the matter of patent systems, all participating countries have made a concession of one kind or another, thereby equally sharing the pains resulting from such concessions without which new international rules could not be written. Only by competing fiercely on the common ground, can we develop superior technologies and achieve widespread use of those technologies. I wonder if the most recent ruling by the United States may have the effect of pouring cold water, as it were, on the rising trend of technological internationalization. The United States had been edgy about the continuing copying of its technologies and designs occurring in the developing nations. At the same time, however, it had continued to give preferential treatment to its own patent applications by going back and recognizing pre-application dates as legitimate dates of inventions, whereas with foreign applications field, they considered only the dates of applications as the legitimate dates of inventions. This may have been the reflection of the direction into which the Clinton Administration's technical policy is moving, viz., placing greater emphasis on industrial technology over science and application development over basic research. To be sure, as long as the present system is maintained, the chances are that the United States most likely will have the upper hand in most litigation concerned with intellectual property. It is a fact, nevertheless, that the respect which the world had held for the United States, a country which led the world in free competition under the slogan of fairness, will be severely damaged, because the situation is too much like a soccer game with one participant playing with an advantage of not having an off-side rule.
