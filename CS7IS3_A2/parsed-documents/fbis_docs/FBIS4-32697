Whereas two-thirds of Slovaks consider the conditions for the development of the Hungarian minority generally favorable, and almost one-third even consider the Hungarian minority to be preferred, more than one-half of the Hungarian minority assess their rights and conditions for development as limited, and only less than one-half consider them favorable. The distribution of views is similar to that ascertained in fall 1993. Tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations has declined over the past few months. Whereas, in October 1993, 40 percent of the citizens of Slovakia (41 percent among Slovaks and 34 percent among ethnic Hungarians) were afraid of a violent solution to the disputes between Slovaks and Hungarians in southern Slovakia, in May 1994, only 28 percent of respondents (30 percent among Slovaks and 11 percent among Hungarians) considered this danger realistic. Among citizens of Slovak nationality, one can discern a slight increase in accommodating attitudes toward Hungarians. The proportion of Slovaks who believe that members of the Hungarian minority are less concerned about Slovakia's well-being than Slovaks declined from 56 percent in October 1993 to 47 percent in May 1994. At the same time, there has been a slight increase in the acceptance of the demand for bilingualism among Slovaks. The minority's demand to write Christian names and surnames in the native language is now encountering somewhat greater understanding among citizens of Slovak nationality. Similar to the entire past four years, tolerant and accommodating attitudes of Slovaks toward Hungarians can be encountered more frequently in ethnically mixed regions than in purely Slovak regions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conditions for the Development ofthe Hungarian Minority in Slovakia(Views of | |Slovaks and Hungarians--FOCUS, May 1994) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Slovaks |Hungarians | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conditions are limited |2 |57 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conditions are favorable |67 |43 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hungarian minority is pr-|31 |0 | |eferred | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do You Consider the Demand forBilingual Names [of Communities] Justified?(Pe-| |rcentage of Slovaks Who Fully orPartially Agree--FOCUS, May 1994) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Respondents in districts in which eth-|45 | |nic Hungarians make up under 1 percen-| | |t of the population | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Respondents in districts in which eth-|54 | |nic Hungarians make up between 2 and 1| | |9 percent of the population | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Respondents in districts in which eth-|62 | |nic Hungarians make up between 20 and | | |49 percent of the population | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Respondents in districts in which eth-|63 | |nic Hungarians make up more than 50 p-| | |ercent of the population | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
