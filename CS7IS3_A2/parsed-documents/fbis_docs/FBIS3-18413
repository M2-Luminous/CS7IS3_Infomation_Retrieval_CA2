He has learned there are additional agreements to the transit treaty, which, however, are being kept secret by the negotiators. It was agreed that, regarding the weight limit of 38 tonnes per truck, Austria will adopt the guidelines of the European Union [EU]. That is to say, if a truck driver from the EU is caught with a heavier load, he will be liable to prosecution, but, in contrast to Austrians, he need not pay a fine. Haider literally calls this a dirty trick. [Begin Haider recording] One talked of tough negotiations while the negotiators themselves were soft at the negotiating table. Thus, considering the individual main points of the negotiations, one has the feeling that the white flag of capitulation had been hoisted before the beginning of the struggle at the negotiating table. Klima, Mock, and their clique spoke strong words at the beginning of the negotiations. Provincial governors had also expressed what was essential -- for example, the Tirolean governor's comments on the transit treaty, which are actually not at all in line with the results. Thus, one can say that the delegation to the negotiations was largely hoodwinked in Brussels or it was pulled back when the chancellor finally pulled back and did not permit the delegation to maintain its tough line, simply because he wanted to achieve a result. [end recording] Haider has called on the government to negotiate with the FPOe on what can still be done to save the agricultural sector. After that, the extraordinary FPOe congress on 8 April will decide whether to make a positive or negative recommendation for the referendum. The Greens do not share the satisfaction with the outcome of the negotiations in the least. Madelaine Petrovic [Greens floor leader] asks who can still believe that this government will change Europe if it is not even able to adhere to minimum conditions, for example, the observance of the transit treaty. [Begin Petrovic recording] The result of the negotiations differs widely from the few conditions of the Nationalrat for the Austrian Government. The Austrian Government had clear instructions regarding neutrality and the maintenance of the full duration of the transit treaty. Neither of these things has been ensured now. The transit treaty in particular has been so flagrantly and crassly violated that I am actually sure that this will affect the elections in the laender where diet elections will be held in March and that the numerous transportation initiatives in Austria will not tolerate it. [end recording] This evening, the Greens want to hold first negotiations with Tirolean transit opponents on possible blockades. In contrast to the other two opposition parties, Heide Schmidt from the Liberal Forum regards the transit solution as an acceptable compromise. [Begin Schmidt recording] I am satisfied with the fact that we have opened the road to an important objective for Austria, that is, to become an EU member. It is absolutely possible that more might have been achieved on one point or another. However, in my opinion, as a member of the opposition, one also has the duty to see the objective and not to dish out petty political blows. [end recording] Heide Schmidt clearly recommends a yes vote in the referendum.
