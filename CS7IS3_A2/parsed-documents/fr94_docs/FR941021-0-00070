FR941021-0-00070 FR941021-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Navy 32 CFR Part 706 Certifications and Exemptions Under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972; Amendment AGENCY: Department of the Navy, DOD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined Large Harbor Tugs YTB 780 and YTB 789 are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special functions as Large Harbor Tugs. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Commander K.P. McMahon, JAGC, U.S. Navy Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400, Telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that Large Harbor Tugs YTB 780 and YTB 789 are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Rule 21(c), pertaining to the location and arc of visibility of the sternlight; Rule 24(c), pertaining to the towing lights displayed by power driven vessels when pushing ahead or towing alongside; Rule 27(b)(i), pertaining to the lights displayed by vessels restricted in their ability to maneuver; Annex I, section 2(a)(i), pertaining to the height above the hull of the masthead light; and Annex I, section 3(b), pertaining to the placement of the sidelights, without interfering with their special functions as Large Harbor Tugs. YTB 780 and YTB 789 are tugs of special construction and functions. They perform towing services for naval vessels. In the case of these tugs, the mast is hinged and is lowered only when the tugs are actually engaged in towing alongside or pushing ships having radically flared bows or sponsoned sides and sterns. When the mast is in the lowered position, the masthead lights, and task lights mounted on this mast, cannot be displayed. During such operations only the pilot house top-mounted auxiliary masthead light, sidelights, and sternlight will be exhibited. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the placement of lights on these vessels in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessels ability to perform their military functions.
