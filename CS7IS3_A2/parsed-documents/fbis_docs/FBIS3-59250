It was launched this month with the support of six member states (UK, Netherlands, Spain, Germany, France and Greece) and with the financial aid of the Energy Directorate of the European Commission. Its first chairman is Ton van der Does, director of the Dutch CHP office. Cogen Europe, with its main office in London, will have the task of: (a) identifying the regulatory and institutional barriers to cogeneration development in Europe and acting to reduce them at the policy level; (b) collaborating on relevant issues with other key European energy associations and industries; (c) quantifying the potential for cogeneration in Europe. Speaking at the launch, Mr. van der Does said that the association will work toward better cooperation between key actors in the European energy scene in order to "establish a clear and positive policy framework for cogeneration." "The Brussels institutions now have a professional and focused organization with which they can work to resolve the many challenges facing cogeneration in the 1990s," he continued. The creation of this association, he feels, reflects the absence of clear recognition by EU and many national policy makers of the significant benefits of cogeneration schemes, whether industrial, small-scale or city-wide. While conventional power generation is often only 35 percent efficient (up to 65 percent of the energy potential being released as waste heat), cogeneration technology stops this by using the heat for industry, commerce and home heating. Cogeneration therefore increases the overall efficiency of energy use -- up to 85 percent and beyond -- giving primary energy savings of about one-third.
