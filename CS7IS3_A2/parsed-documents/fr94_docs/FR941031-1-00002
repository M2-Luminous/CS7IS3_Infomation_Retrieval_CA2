FR941031-1-00002 FR941031-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 92 [Docket No. 94&hyph;097&hyph;1] Horses From Spain; Change in Disease Status AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning the importation of horses to remove Spain from the list of countries in which African horse sickness exists. We believe that Spain is free of African horse sickness, and that restrictions on the importation of horses from Spain to prevent the spread of African horse sickness into the United States are no longer necessary. This action relieves unnecessary restrictions on the importation of horses from Spain. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, P.O. Drawer 810, Riverdale, MD 20738. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 94&hyph;097&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. John Cougill, Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 758A, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7834. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) state the provisions for the importation into the United States of specified animals to prevent the introduction of various animal diseases, including African horse sickness (AHS). AHS, a fatal equine viral disease, is not known to exist in the United States. Section 92.308(a)(2) of the regulations lists countries that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) considers affected with AHS, and sets forth specific requirements for horses which are imported from those countries. APHIS requires horses intended for importation from any of the countries listed, including horses that have stopped in or transited those countries, to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY, for at least 60 days. Spain has applied to the United States Department of Agriculture to be recognized as free from AHS. Spain's last diagnosed case of AHS was on October 29, 1990. From December 1990 through December 1992, Spain conducted an extensive AHS vaccination program. Effective November 30, 1993, the European Union declared Spain to be free of AHS. APHIS has reviewed the documentation submitted by the Government of Spain in support of its request. An APHIS official also performed an on-site inspection of two of Spain's Animal Health Ministry's laboratories. The APHIS official inspected both the Laboratory of Animal Health and Production at Algetes and the Regional Laboratory of Animal Health and Production at Cordoba. Both laboratories have been heavily involved in eradication, vaccination, research, and surveillance activities for AHS. The laboratory at Algetes serves as the European Union's Reference Laboratory for AHS and is responsible for providing verification of any suspected positive test result for the AHS virus submitted by the 17 regional laboratories in Spain. In 1993, the regional laboratory at Cordoba tested 180 spleen samples from horses in Spain that died of unknown causes or were killed in traffic accidents; all results were negative for the AHS virus. The APHIS official conducting the on-site evaluation concluded that the laboratory systems are highly effective and contributed to the eradication of AHS from Spain. Based on the information discussed above, we believe that Spain qualifies for removal from the list of countries, in ยง92.308(a)(2) of the regulations, which APHIS considers affected with AHS. This proposed action would relieve restrictions which require horses imported from Spain to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY, for at least 60 days. This proposed action would allow horses from Spain to be shipped to and quarantined at ports designated in ยง92.303, and would reduce the quarantine period to an average of three days to meet the quarantine and testing requirements specified in ยง92.308.
