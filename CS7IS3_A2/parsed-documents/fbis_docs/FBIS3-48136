Top leaders of the government and the seven-party coalition during a meeting are expected to confirm their policy that the package be enacted during the current Diet session, which ends Saturday, by gaining a compromise with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a joint committee of both houses. Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito and chief negotiator from the coalition, will meet his LDP counterpart Yoshiro Mori on Monday afternoon to seek consent from the LDP. Senior officials of the House of Representatives steering committee on Monday will also discuss the issue of forming the joint committee. The coalition hopes to decide on setting up the joint committee at a Diet plenary session Tuesday. The future of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is in doubt after the upper house rejected the reform bills he has pledged to enact before the current Diet session ends. Tokyo stock prices plunged in the morning session amid Japan's political turbulence with the 225-issue Nikkei stock average tumbling 727.07 points to 18,580.36 at 10 A.M. Hosokawa, who took office last August as the first prime minister from outside the LDP in 38 years, has vowed that he will take "political responsibility" if he fails to achieve political reform, suggesting he will dissolve the lower house for a snap general election or make his cabinet resign en masse. As the package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes at an upper house plenary session, has already passed the lower house, it can be enacted if it is passed again by the lower house by a two-thirds majority, or if a joint committee of 10 members each from both houses works out a compromise that wins approval by a majority vote from the two houses. A tug-of-war between proponents and opponents of political reform within the LDP has intensified. A proponent group of LDP parliamentarians led by former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will urge LDP President Yohei Kono Monday afternoon to seek a compromise with the coalition through a joint committee of both houses, party officials said. Another LDP group led by former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama decided Monday morning to call for a council to seek enactment of the anticorruption measures separate from the package, party officials said. The government package is designed to clean up Japan's scandal-tainted political system, completely overhauling the mechanism for electing the lower house and tightening curbs on political funds.
