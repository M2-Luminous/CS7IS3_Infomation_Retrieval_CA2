The Czech Republic is represented by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. Our special correspondent Klara Stejskalova reports from the venue. [Stejskalova] Partnership for Peace is an important practical step toward full incorporation of the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic alliance, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said at the beginning of his speech. We regard the political program of Partnership for Peace as being of equal importance to the military program. We cannot imagine, however, the principles of partnership being challenged by one country gaining a special status. Our interest in NATO is linked with (enhancement of) European security. But enlargement will be meaningful only if the alliance adapts itself to new conditions. Any Russian demands to subject NATO to the CSCE are unacceptable to our side. At the conclusion of his speech Minister Zieleniec recalled President Havel's participation in the commemoration of the Allied landing in Normandy. His participation was a symbol of the continuity of our co-responsibility for the fate of Europe. [passage omitted]
