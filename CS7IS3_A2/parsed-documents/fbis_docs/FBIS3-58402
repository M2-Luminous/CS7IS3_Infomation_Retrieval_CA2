Socialists in the European Parliament are now demanding the right of formal approval before the deal, with the promise of a multi-billion pound boost for the global economy, can be signed. The 198-strong group of socialist Euro MPs, the biggest political bloc in the Strasbourg parliament, decided at talks today to use the GATT accord to flex their muscles as part of a long-running bid to exercise power. The move holds no serious threat of upsetting the agreement but it could be delayed while Euro MPs challenge the formalities in the European Court of Justice, if necessary.
