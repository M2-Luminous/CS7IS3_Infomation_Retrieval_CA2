However, worldwide discussions and explorations on the significance and effects of the recent conference are far from concluded. We may put it that the Seattle conference was the most conspicuous of all world events that could play an important readjusting role in the Asia-Pacific region and the global pattern in the wake of the end of the Cold War. The Seattle APEC Conference comprised three parts: First, the fifth routine session of the APEC ministerial meeting on 17-19 November; second, the unofficial summit of the 12 sovereign states of the 15 APEC member states and regions on 20 November; and third, bilateral talks outside the conference, of which, the most notable was the official meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton. The activities of these three parts overlapped each other and formed into a rich and colorful picture which has given much food for thought. The ministerial meeting viewed the prospective direction of Asia-Pacific's economic development, the unofficial summit instilled a very important political essence in APEC, whereas at the bilateral talks, especially the official Jiang Zemin-Clinton meeting, some important bilateral relations were explored and viewed anew from the higher tier of common interests on a regional or even global scale. Obviously, the APEC conference far exceeded the range of its original role, and is shaping into an important force that affects Asia-Pacific and even the global pattern. On the issue of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the ministerial meeting adopted the "Declaration on the Framework of Trade and Investment," established a committee for trade and investment, conducted coordination, and augmented cooperation between members on global trade and investment to promote regional free trade and reciprocal investment; firmly supported APEC members, who are not GATT members to become signatories; and were determined to add political pressure for the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round before 15 December 1993. The APEC conference accepted Mexico and Papua New Guinea as new members, and decided to admit Chile to next year's ministerial meeting; nevertheless, no more new members are to be accepted for the next three years. The non-official meeting of leaders issued a "Statement on Economic Prospects," which believes that the Asia-Pacific region will play an important role in the world economy and take the lead in economic development and trade expansion, calling for the continuous removal of the region's barriers to trade and investment and improving education and training to make progress in telecommunications and communications as well as environmental conditions. The leaders agreed to hold a conference for finance ministers, founding a forum of Pacific industry and commerce, and formulated plans for education and business volunteers to develop and promote tertiary education and the exploitation of human resources in the region. During the conference, leaders of various countries conducted frequent bilateral contacts. President Jiang Zemin met 14 leaders (including newly accepted members). The Jiang Zemin and Clinton meeting was the first Sino-U.S. summit since February 1989. Just as Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who is concurrently foreign minister, put it, this important meeting was positive and constructive. Although they were not talks, it was impossible to resolve all of the problems, and neither side would change its basic position, it is expected that Sino-U.S. relations will improve somewhat. The important significance of the meeting lies in defining anew the foundation for improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations. Superficially, the aforesaid results of the conference did not seem to have made any specific arrangements for the Asia-Pacific pattern with the end of the Cold War. We would rather say that the conference reflected the concept of the "New Pacific Community," and the "Asia-Pacific Economic Community" Clinton set forth did not materialize, and this portends the surfacing of new contradictions and confrontations which could result from the U.S. strengthening its control over the Asia-Pacific Region. However, should we analyze the situation further, we may find that it was by no means accidental that these interrelated measures were all adopted in the short span of three or four days. The Seattle APEC Conference has revealed the following major tendencies in the world situation with the end of the Cold War: 1. The role of economic strength has become markedly prominent in the balance of international forces. The significance of Clinton's new strategy for the Asia-Pacific region does not lie in building an Asia-Pacific community within a short period (the "Statement on Economic Prospects" issued by the Summit was confined to saying "we have conceived the idea of building an Asia-Pacific economic community"), but in the change from the past U.S. Asia- Pacific strategy based on security and bilateral arrangements to a strategy of giving simultaneous importance to security and economics and multilateral as well as bilateral arrangements. From a contemporary angle, it is imperative to give relative prominence to the economy and multilateral arrangements because of the excessive attention paid to security interests and bilateral arrangements in the past. This falls in line with the U.S. goal of reinvigorating the economy, and is conducive to the U.S. maintaining its leading position and role. From a long-term view, facing the challenges of the 21st century cannot be done without exerting efforts in achieving new breakthroughs in science and technology and economic growth. This being the case, the share of economic factors will increase with the development of the situation. Clinton's new strategic concept spans the 20th and 21st century, and should not be neglected. It will inevitably exert effects on the Asia-Pacific and global pattern. 2. Weight of Asia-Pacific Region in the global balance has markedly increased. The Seattle APEC conference has arranged the host countries for the next four sessions: Indonesia in 1994; Japan in 1995; the Philippines in 1996; and Canada in 1997. In addition, the unofficial summit decided that a summit would be held in Indonesia. Here, we do not have to deal with the sustained growth of the Asia-Pacific economy strengthening the region's role in the global position, because from the site of the next four sessions, one can see that Asia-Pacific will become the central area of global concern. We shall wait and see whether or not the unofficial summit will become institutionalized, but we can almost be sure that the 1994 meeting in Indonesia will be an enthusiastic one, and the 1995 meeting in Japan will not be inferior. Thus, an Asia-Pacific summit might gradually take shape aside from the G-7. The rise of the Asia-Pacific is an irresistible trend, which will become a conspicuous characteristic of the post-Cold War world. 3. China's place and role also show a rising trend. Under the circumstance of drastic changes in the world situation, China, as a developing socialist power, has maintained stability. The success of the policy of reform and opening up have brought a high rate of economic growth, which has become in increasingly active factor in the Asia-Pacific and global situation. While the United States has readjusted its Asia-Pacific strategy, it will be very difficult to realize its strategic goals in Asia-Pacific without a corresponding readjustment in its policy toward China. The evolution of the post- war situation in the Asia-Pacific region shows that should the United States fail to correctly handle its relations with China, it will lose the foundations of its strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. It seems that President Clinton has come to see this point, and his official meeting with President Jiang Zemin was actually a wise move. Obviously, the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations is where the common interests of the two countries lie; furthermore, this not only concerns China and the United States by any means, but inevitably has a global significance, which is self explanatory. President Jiang Zemin said: "What sort of world will be led into the 21st century is an important issue that leading members of our generation must earnestly explore and resolve," and he added, "we can accomplish something." It seems that the Seattle APEC conference has made a positive stride forward in this direction.
