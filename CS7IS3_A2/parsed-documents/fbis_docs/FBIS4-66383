And rules are being made to crack down on exporters who abuse foreign intellectual property rights, according to Cai Cheng, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress. Customs will aim to prevent pirated goods from being shipped out of the country, he said. And on the domestic front law enforcement bodies will investigate ``major and important'' cases in cooperation with the departments of science, technology, culture, public security, industry and commerce. Intellectual property rights courts are already operational in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the booming special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong. The Central government will improve its supervision of law enforcement by local authorities, Cai said. But while the government will do its best the non-governmental sector is being encouraged to help, Cai said. Lawyers and auditors and professional science, technology and culture associations must all do their bit. ``When organized, they can provide services, including legal consultancy and investigations into complaints,'' he said. According to official statistics, an average of 13,000 cases of trademark abuse and counterfeit goods are reported every year, including 500 that directly affect foreign companies. Cai attributed this to the fact that intellectual property protection is still new in China. ``But the country is sincere and serious in its effort to improve,''he said. The country is now a member of the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization and has signed the Paris Convention on Industrial Property Rights Protection, the Madrid Convention on International Registration of Trademarks and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
