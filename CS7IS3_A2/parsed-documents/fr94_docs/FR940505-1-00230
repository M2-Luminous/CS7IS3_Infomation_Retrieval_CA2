FR940505-1-00230 FR940505-1-00012 As an alternative to requiring all interstate truck fleets to participate in the fleet averaging program, EPA is proposing to allow fleet owners, at their option, to comply with a use restriction on higher emitting engines. Beginning in 2001, any time a non-fleet averaged truck which does not meet the enhanced vehicle heavy-duty engine standards and has multiple-state registrations operates in the state, it would be allowed to make no more than one stop in either the South Coast, Ventura, or Sacramento FIP areas. This requirement would apply to all such trucks, regardless of whether or not the base of operation is in California. Any pickup or delivery would be considered a stop. Also, such trucks making a stop in one of the FIP areas would not be permitted to make more than a total of two stops statewide including any stop in a FIP area. An operator who could show that a trip into California will involve no driving in the South Coast, Ventura, or Sacramento FIP areas would be allowed to operate freely throughout the rest of the state. Of course, any vehicle which meets the enhanced heavy-duty engine standards or is part of a fleet complying with the averaging requirements would be able to operate throughout the state without restriction. EPA would enforce the delivery restrictions by random vehicle checks and inspection of driving logs. EPA could inspect papers at weigh stations and at pickup and delivery points. Any evidence that the restrictions had been violated would subject the operator to a maximum fine of $25,000 for every day in violation. EPA is requesting comment on a further penalty of revocation of the right to register in California if multiple violations are recorded. EPA also requests comment on an option under which, beginning in 2005, only engines certified at or below the 1998 federal 4.0 g/bhp-hr NO X standard would be allowed in trucks with multiple-state registrations operating in California. This requirement would also apply to all trucks, notwithstanding the base of operations. Preventing earlier models from operating in California is intended to reduce the emission contribution from the interstate portion of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet. It would ensure that the cleanest national trucks are used in California. EPA would begin the two-stop limitation in 2001 and the clean multi-state truck requirement in 2005. The Agency believes that this would allow sufficient time for them to be implemented without overly disrupting trucking operations in California. EPA requests comment on the proposal to require trucks operating in multiple states to participate in the fleet averaging program (with and without the option of choosing usage restrictions). EPA also requests comment on whether or not owners of such fleets should also be required to have their 1999 and later model year trucks meet the enhanced vehicle standards, similar to requirements for in-state fleet owners. Comments are also requested on all aspects of the discretion to limit stops of higher-emitting trucks in the FIP areas, and on the alternative of limiting entry of older high-emitting trucks into the state. 8. Alternative Fuel Availability As discussed earlier, the proposed enhanced heavy-duty vehicle standards will present significant feasibility challenges for diesel-fueled and gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. At this time compliance with the standards is more certain through use of alternative-fueled vehicles. As described above, such fuels could include methanol, ethanol, compressed or liquified natural gas and possibly others. These fuels are not widely available for vehicle use at this time. Thus, to the extent that fuels other than diesel and gasoline are chosen for compliance, the availability of fuel for these vehicles could be of concern. California regulators have also faced this concern during development of the LEV program and have addressed it through regulation, as described below. California's existing fuel availability rules require major fuel suppliers to provide alternative fuels at a minimum number of their retail outlets. The minimum number of fuel outlets for each alternative fuel depends on the number of in-use vehicles requiring that fuel (20,000 is the current minimum trigger for fuel availability) and on how many years the fuel has been required under the fuel availability program. For 1994&hyph;96, the requirements apply only within the SCAQMD, while for 1997 and beyond, they apply throughout the entire state. For example, the first year an alternative fuel is designated a required clean fuel (i.e., the number of vehicles on the road requiring that fuel exceeds 20,000), at least a total of 90 fuel outlets must provide the fuel. In the second year, the minimum number would increase to 200. The required number of retail outlets could be greater if more than 20,000 vehicles required that alternative fuel. These outlets would be allocated to each of the major fuel producers in the region according to the amount of motor vehicle fuel they supplied. The fuel outlets would have to be geographically dispersed throughout the applicable region. It is uncertain at this time how many enhanced heavy-duty engines will be alternative-fueled since technologies which will meet the standards are still being developed. Most of the heavy- duty vehicles are found in fleets, where fuel availability is easier to control. Therefore, California's fuel availability requirements appear to be sufficient. Therefore, EPA is not proposing any additional alternative fuel availability requirements. However, EPA requests comments on this issue and what, if any, additional actions may be appropriate to insure fuel availability. 9. Fleet Averaging Program The enhanced program for heavy-duty vehicles will reduce emissions as planned only if people continue to purchase new vehicles and retire old ones at past rates. If people keep their old trucks longer than they have in the past or buy used vehicles from out of state, the emissions reductions would be substantially less. Because these reductions are critical for achieving attainment, EPA needs to ensure that vehicle turnover continues to occur at historical rates.
