FR941021-0-00039 FR941021-0-00002 (ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that installment paid prior to Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), being signed by the borrower. This amount will include the unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date. (iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside. (3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion. Interest will not accrue on the interest portion set-aside. (4) The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final due date of the loan. (5) There are no additional security requirements attached to the DSA program. All existing security instruments will remain in effect. (6) The original Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), will be stapled to the respective original promissory note or assumption agreement filed in the County Office operational file. A copy will be stapled to the copy of the promissory note or assumption agreement filed in position 2 of the borrower's case file. (7) Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), will be used as the source document to process the DSA through the Automated Discrepancy Processing System (ADPS). Until automation capabilities are implemented, Exhibit A should be placed in a pending file and the borrower's account flagged ``51&hyph;S.'' The Finance Office borrower account status reports will reflect the amount(s) set-aside for each loan. (8) The National Automated Tracking System (AGCREDIT) will be utilized to document the notification and servicing scheme associated with this subpart. (9) The loan(s) will be considered current after the installment(s) is set-aside and, therefore, debt writedown or net recovery buyout may not be subsequently approved under subpart S of this part, and loans may not be made under §1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter, unless the set-aside is reversed as set forth in §1951.958(b)(2) of this subpart or the borrower becomes delinquent on the non-set-aside portion. (c) Adverse determination. Borrowers who do not meet the requirements for the DSA program will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower becomes more than one installment behind on any FP loan while processing the DSA request, or while an appeal is being considered, and the second installment cannot be paid current prior to Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), being signed, the DSA request will be denied and/or any associated appeal request withdrawn. Being denied set-aside based on the failure to meet the not-more-than-one-installment-behind requirement is not an appealable issue, but is reviewable. The letter to the borrower will describe in full detail all the reasons for the adverse decision. Borrowers denied DSA will continue to be serviced in accordance with subpart S of this part. §1951.958 Supervision and servicing of borrowers with DSA. (a) Supervision. Borrower supervision will continue as set forth in subpart B of part 1924 of this chapter. (b) Servicing. FP loans will continue to be serviced in accordance with the appropriate servicing regulations. (1) Payments applied to the amount set-aside will be processed as a miscellaneous payment on Form FmHA 451&hyph;2, ``Schedule of Remittances.'' (2) The set-aside will be reversed and Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), cancelled if, prior to the first scheduled installment due date after set-aside, the current borrower needs a writedown in order to develop a feasible plan or a net recovery buyout in accordance with subpart S of this part or loan assistance set forth in §1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter. The Finance Office must be notified by memorandum of the set-aside reversal prior to the time assistance is granted. A copy of the memorandum will be attached to Exhibit A and remain stapled to the promissory note or assumption agreement as indicated in §1951.957(b)(6) of this subpart.
