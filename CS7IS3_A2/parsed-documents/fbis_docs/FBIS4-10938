FBIS4-10938 "drlat076_l_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-076 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 Bolivia Armed Forces Head Condemns Reports on `Virtual Submission' Armed Forces Head Condemns Reports on `Virtual Submission' to DEA PY1904231194 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 1 PY1904231194 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS Spanish BFN [Text] La Paz -- The Bolivian Armed Forces commander, General Fernando Sanjines Yanez, energetically condemned reports on the virtual "submission" of the Bolivian institutional system to the DEA and the violation, according to several reports, of national sovereignty. Shortly after the end of a ceremony to celebrate the Army Engineering Command's 33d anniversary, Gen. Sanjines Yanez categorically stated: "It is our duty to see that the Bolivian institutions or foreign organizations established in our country respect our Constitution and demand that they all, with no exceptions, respect the country's physical integrity and national sovereignty." Sanjines added: "The Armed Forces will never tolerate the violation of our country's integrity or sovereignty; this cannot be and less still will the Armed Forces allow it." The Armed Forces' commander made this statement shortly after the DEA created a big scandal in Bolivia and Costa Rica due to its anti-drug operation procedures involving Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, right-hand man of alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded as the key witness to clarify charges that the Movement of the Revolutionary Left has "links to drug traffickers." So far, Government Ministry authorities have not come up with an explanation on the flight or abduction of Fernandez, in which the DEA appears directly involved together with Bolivian security forces and, particularly, the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN]. Government Minister German Quiroga and Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga both asserted that the DEA did not abduct Fernandez, that he "escaped" on his own. Information from abroad, especially Costa Rica, however, state the opposite -- that is, that Fernandez arrived in and left Costa Rica accompanied by DEA agents. This complex situation prompted opposition legislators in the last few hours to summon the government minister to Congress to give an official and detailed report on the developments in order to definitely determine the DEA's participation in the investigations into "narcolinks" that, without much evidence, FELCN reported involved top-ranking MIR leaders. In the meantime, several institutions, such as the Armed Forces and others, condemned the charges of DEA intervention and demanded that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada call for "greater respect for Bolivian dignity" in view of "U.S. interventionism."
