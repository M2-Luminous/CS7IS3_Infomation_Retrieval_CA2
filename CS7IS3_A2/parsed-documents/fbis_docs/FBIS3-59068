The national secretary of the Socialist Party believes that we are witnessing "the end of Balladurmania." Will the left wing begin to recover from its bitter defeat last March? It is expected that 742 prominent individuals, ranging from Martine Aubry to Dominique Voynet, will publish an appeal for the organization of social transformation sessions in today's issue of LE MONDE. The phrase used is a little obscure, but it is not likely to conceal the ambitious nature of such an operation. Although Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, one of the principal artisans of these sessions, may deny it, this is indeed an undertaking that will probably, in the long run, result in a new unity on the left. Already, the Socialists, of course, but also the Communists--both orthodox and reform, the Ecologists, Radicals, and representatives of the associative movements, as well as trade-union leaders, have responded positively to this appeal. In an initial phase, these sessions will involve the organization of six demonstrations scheduled to take place in the course of a circuit through France. The first, planned for 5 February in Paris, will have a question as its theme: "Why change society?" But this dynamic move toward unity has just been given a major forward thrust by the repeal of the Falloux Law. After all, the first event of these sessions will basically take place....in the street. This will occur this coming 16 January when the leftist organizations hold their demonstration "in defense of public education." [Mace-Scaron] Can the left wing regain its unity in the field? This coming 16 January, for example, with the demonstration against the repeal of the Falloux Law? [Cambadelis] The left wing certainly can do that, but this is not the issue. All of these forces and everyone who is committed to public education, to schooling for all and to equal opportunity, will mobilize. All republicans should be present. By means of its attacks on public education, the government is sacrificing the values of the Republic on the altar of short-term electoral calculations. These values are secularism and free education. [Mace-Scaron] When you use the old formulas in this way, are you not afraid of being criticized as "archaic?" [Cambadelis] The spontaneous inclination of our society to designate "socially disqualified individuals" can only be counteracted by a deliberate policy of support for the right to a second chance, to continued equality of opportunity. Because these are the Republic's schools, schools that welcome children without regard to their social origins, religion, or philosophy. Whatever may be said about it, public education remains the leading venue for social advancement, integration, and training for citizenship. `The Rending of Our Society' [Cambadelis continues] With the redirection of the effort made toward private education, to the detriment of public education, it is to the right of center that the archaic attitudes are returning in force, accompanied by a more acute risk of tearing our society apart. We are witnessing the institutionalization of two educational networks financed by public funds, that is to say everyone's money. One can easily see how the wealthier people and those less fortunate are being separated. [Mace-Scaron] Aren't you impressed by Mr. Balladur's "know-how?" [Cambadelis] Not at all. And I am obviously not the only one. Jacques Chirac even believes that the government is not going far enough where the employment problem is concerned. He is not wrong in his criticism, even though the policies he proposes for correcting the situation are not those we advocate. But can one support a government that is not moving in the right direction on the unemployment issue? Paradoxically, following the vote of confidence in Parliament, the prime minister has spoken much more frequently in personal terms and has used more superlatives. The machinery is seizing up, confidence is dwindling, and appetites are growing keener. This is a sign of the end of Balladurmania. The government is showing a lack of imagination in dealing with unemployment, a lack of determination with regard to the nationalist movements in Europe, and a lack of tolerance where the problems of society are concerned. [Mace-Scaron] Aren't these social transformation sessions a "remake" of the union of the left, with Dominique Voynet playing Robert Fabre's role? [Cambadelis] I doubt that Michel Rocard thinks he is Francois Mitterrand. It is not a question of drafting a joint program, but of encouraging a debate on ideas in order to respond to the expectations of the French people. Why, after having experienced the disaster of unemployment, the collapse of Communism, the rising tide of inequalities, the consolidation of nationalist sentiments, the urgency of ecological needs, the biological revolution, the triumph of humanitarianism, the party crisis, etc., would anyone want us to return in 1994 to the strategy defined in Epinay in 1971? We are living in a new era that demands a situational review. Reading patterns have blurred and political references and identification have been overturned or thrown out of phase. Following the General Assembly of the PS, we reaffirmed our principles. New ideas have emerged, and internal life has calmed. Now it is necessary to face up to all of this without the desire to dominate. There can be no great movement in society without the major debate on contradictory concepts that must precede it. That is the price of the rebirth of a great movement in search of change for our society. [Mace-Scaron] Isn't it a little bit hypocritical to make it appear that this operation is not being directed by the PS? [Cambadelis] The PS has proposed, and the protagonists in social transformation have disposed. Simply because Michel Rocard contemplated the future, or because Lionel Jospin sponsored this initiative--neither of these things makes the sessions the property of the PS. The initial proposal has been substantially enriched. Leaders in the ecological field have altered its center of gravity by setting a deadline for social change. Organizational leaders have refocused the sessions on the daily concerns of the men and women of France. The friends of Messrs. Herzog, Fiterman, and Rigout have tried to promote debate on the remodeling issue. The sponsors of these sessions, of whom a list is being published today, are simply leaders who believe that the transformation of society is necessary, and from this point of view, they oppose the conservatism that is currently in power. What is being sought is a discussion of the basics. The problems of alliance and the electoral issues will not be taken up. [Mace-Scaron] In two weeks, the PCF [French Communist Party] will elect a new secretary general. Do you hope that he will be more of an advocate of unity than Georges Marchais? [Cambadelis] I would remind you that it was Georges Marchais, after all, who signed the joint program. I think that something is happening in the Communist Party. In three weeks, our arrangements will be made. As for the future of the Communists, it belongs to them, and it is for them to decide. The announcement that a leader at the top level will attend each of the sessions made by Georges Marchais at the most recent meeting of the PCF Central Committee shows that a transition from the bunker strategy to that of debate may perhaps be under way. [Mace-Scaron] Shouldn't the PS pursue an evaluation of the achievements and failures of the left wing, analyzing the reasons for the distortion of its economic policy or the monarchic aspect the presidential institution has taken on? [Cambadelis] As former minister Anicet Le Pors noted recently, it is necessary to undertake a critical analysis of what one has done and what one has been in order to make a new start. The PS is therefore continuing its work of review, while at the same time opening up new prospects. The younger generation insists on this. I would refer, as evidence of this, to the imminent publication of the book by Martine Aubry as well as that by Pierre Moscovici.
