Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, Christine Stewart, and an executive from the publication sponsoring the event opened the conference entitled "Second Roundtable With the Government of Cuba," which formally begins two days of working sessions tomorrow behind closed doors. The Canadian Government supports increased investments in Cuba not only because they contribute to this country's development, but because they also benefit Canada, the minister explained. Canada currently exerts a great deal of influence in foreign investments in Cuba's mining sector, not only in the traditional nickel sector, but also in exploring for gold, lead, copper, and oil deposits. Stewart conveyed the Canadian Government's willingness to further promote the flow of capital toward Cuba. It was also announced in Ottawa today that developmental aid will be made available, as well as $360,000 in emergency food aid, which will be granted through the World Food Program. A larger amount, $720,000, will be donated to the food program in 1995. Meanwhile, Lage stressed the importance of having such a renowned publication as THE ECONOMIST organizing this conference, as well as having Canadian companies such as Sherrit Inc. cosponsoring it. The conference has an even greater significance in light of the current economic hardships Cuba is facing. Octavio Castilla, spokesman for the conference and deputy minister for foreign investment and economic cooperation, believes the most significant message conveyed by Lage was that regardless of all the flaws the Cuban legal system might have, there is a willingness to analyze those flaws and to implement reforms that further encourage the introduction of foreign capital. More than 100 businessmen and officials from Europe, Canada, the United States, and Latin America are participating in this conference. Formal reports will be given tomorrow by Enrique Martinez, vice president of the Cuban Central Planning Board; Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas; and Ernesto Melendez, president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.
