GENERAL PROVISIONS The purpose of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] is to create in the country conditions for the unfettered practical expression of the creative abilities of the people populating the country and assiduous use of our country's natural resources. The LDPR program is a program of our society's development in accordance with its needs without any outside interference. A member of the LDPR is a person who does not separate his personal interests from those of the motherland; --he is a creator, making a contribution to fulfillment of the motherland's priority goals, which are aimed at preserving peace and raising the living standard of the entire population of our vast country. The LDPR's political activity is aimed at restoring by peaceful means and preserving the Russian state built over centuries; restoring and protecting the country's borders; ensuring inside the country peaceful cohabitation of all the peoples populating it--large and small--with the right to preserve traditions and customs, develop national culture, and exercise freedom of conscience. Russia is a motherland without any kind of discrimination. II. DOMESTIC POLICY Domestic policy is implemented by the executive branch, headed by the president, on the basis of observing the law and freedom of entrepreneurial activities. Strict observance of the law is the main guarantee of establishing and maintaining order, an immutable condition for building and functioning of a law-based state. The internal system is based on the administrative-territorial principle: the basic unit is the province (oblast). There shall be no national state entities on the territory of Russia. Legislation is enacted by the Parliament (State Duma), formed by holding elections on the territorial principle. The parliament adopts laws, adopts a Constitution, and amends it if necessary. The entirety of executive power is vested in the head of state--the president, elected by citizens eligible to vote, through a secret ballot. The president appoints the prime minister, who forms the cabinet of ministers, which is approved by the president. The president has the right to disband the parliament, call for new elections, and veto laws. The president is answerable to the parliament in the event he commits anticonstitutional actions. The judiciary is independent from the legislative and executive branches. All citizens are equal before law and enjoy equal rights. III. THE ECONOMY The goal of the LDPR's economic policy is to create a life of dignity and well-being for every inhabitant of Russia--gradually, without "revolutionary leaps" or cataclysms. This is impossible to accomplish by "decrees from the top": This task can only be accomplished by uniting society and providing everyone the opportunity to work in peace and creatively, to support themselves and their family, while enjoying life. Only a central power, and only with active and concerted help from the regions, can put in motion the production flywheels of such an immense country as Russia. Russia possesses the necessary resources--raw material, land, industrial, and human, including intellectual--to enable it to develop its own economy fast, without any prompting or enslaving credits from "outside." It is necessary to ensure for everyone the opportunity to participate in production. Unprofitable enterprises and those producing output that is not in demand should be retargeted and provided with resources to produce goods in short supply and spare parts for our equipment. The population should not experience unemployment or live in fear of it. Wages should be no lower than the sustenance minimum. Highly skilled specialists should get higher wages that correspond to the complexity, difficulty, and quality of their labor. At the initial stage, privatization should only extend to small enterprises and the service sphere. Enterprises that are being privatized cannot be sold to outsiders--they must be transferred to the ownership of the collective. Only at a later stage should it be permitted to sell them on the open market. Housing should be transferred free of charge to the ownership of the people living in it. Those on the waiting lists should be given an opportunity to purchase housing on credit with subsequent repayment of its cost to the state over 25-50 years, interest-free, beginning with the fourth year of occupancy. At the initial stage, land remains the property of the state. Those wishing to do so may have land on a long-term lease (25-50 years) without prepayment, with right to inherit, but with the mandatory condition that the land will lie fallow, and that the lessor with work it and produce agricultural output. Profitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes are equated in their land-use rights to private lessors. All unused land should be returned to the state. All kinds of speculative reselling must be stopped. Well-organized production and uninterrupted material supply of industrial enterprises in the state sector with the resources necessary for production will allow for uninterrupted and profitable work. At the same time, state enterprises' output will be sold at fixed prices. Key economic sectors in industry, agriculture, and science needed to raise the level of production and quality of goods in other production sectors will be provided targeted financing out of tax revenue. Providing agriculture with the needed equipment supplied by state enterprises, as well as fuel and power resources, state assistance in setting up local food-processing industry, and preferential rates for transportation of agricultural output will enable the products produced by the arduous effort of the rural population to be fully utilized. Export of surplus resources with state assistance and under state control will increase the inflow of hard currency into the country.
