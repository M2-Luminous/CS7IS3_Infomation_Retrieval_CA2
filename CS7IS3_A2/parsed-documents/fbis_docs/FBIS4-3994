Qian, who is also vice-premier, and Luo Gan, secretary-general of the State Council, observed a moment's silence in front of a picture of Nixon hanging in the dining room of the U.S. ambassador's residence. Qian, copying from a prepared text, then wrote a message of condolence in a special book. "Nixon, when he was president of the United States, opened the door to Sino-US relations and made a valuable historical contribution. I want to express my heartfelt sorrow," Qian wrote. Luo wrote a similar message, expressing his sympathy for Nixon's relatives. Wreaths "expressing deep condolences" from President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and vice premier in charge of the economy Zhu Rongji, surrounded the Nixon portrait. Nixon is best remembered in China for his historic 1972 visit here which ended decades of mutual hostility and paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later.
