FR940428-0-00037 FR940428-0-00014 40 CFR Part 52 [IN29&hyph;1&hyph;5822; FRL 4875&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is taking action to approve a requested revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act), which requires certain ozone nonattainment areas to require specified gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment. The subject areas established in the SIP revision are the Indiana portion of the Chicago ozone nonattainment area (Lake and Porter Counties) and the Indiana portion of the Louisville, Kentucky ozone nonattainment area (Clark and Floyd Counties). USEPA's action is being taken without prior proposal. DATES: This final rule will be effective June 27, 1994, unless notice is received by May 31, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Copies of the requested SIP revision, technical support documents and public comments received are available at the following address: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, Regulation Development Branch, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. This SIP revision is also available for inspection at the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) Docket and Administration Center (Air Docket 6102), room M1500, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7548.

Background/Summary of State Submittal On February 25, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted to USEPA Stage II Vapor Recovery Rules: Amendments to 326 IAC 8&hyph;1&hyph;0.5 and 326 IAC 8&hyph;4&hyph;6 as requested revisions to the Indiana SIP. The rules were adopted by the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board (IAPCB) on July 21, 1993, and were published in the Indiana Register on December 1, 1993. The State submitted these rules to satisfy the Stage II vapor recovery requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. The SIP revision submitted by the State of Indiana sets out procedures for the establishment of a Stage II Vapor Recovery Program in the ozone nonattainment counties of Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd. The information presented below summaries the requested SIP revision and USEPA's action on it. A more detailed analysis of the State's submittal is contained in USEPA's technical support documents dated March 23, 1993, and March 31, 1994, which are available from the Region 5 office listed above. Indiana's regulations specify that Stage II vapor recovery systems are required at gasoline dispensing facilities that dispense more than 10,000 gallons per month, and independent small business marketers of gasoline (ISBMG) that dispense an average monthly volume of more than 50,000 gallons per month. Private fueling facilities such as government and company fleet fueling facilities, as well as retailers, are subject to the Stage II requirements. The regulations specify the use of California Air Resource Board (CARB) certified Stage II systems, which have been demonstrated to achieve at least 95 percent control of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions during the refueling of motor vehicles. The rules also mandate that the proper installation and operation of such systems be achieved by requiring the installed systems to be tested for proper installation and requiring the State to perform all necessary enforcement of the rules. The rules mandate the Stage II vapor recovery systems for nonexempt facilities be implemented pursuant to the following phase-in schedule: (1) Facilities that commenced construction after November 15, 1990, must comply six months after promulgation of the rules by the State; (2) facilities that commenced construction before November 15, 1990, and dispense an average monthly volume of more than 100,000 gallons of motor fuel per month, must comply by one year after promulgation of the rules by the State; and (3) all other facilities must comply two years after promulgation of the rules by the State. II. Review Criteria The USEPA reviewed the submittal against the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act, as interpreted in the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 13498, 13513 (April 16, 1992)), and two USEPA documents entitled Technical Guidance-Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities (Technical Guidance) and the Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs (Enforcement Guidance). Specifically, the following seven general criteria need to be met for a Stage II vapor recovery regulation to be approvable by USEPA:
