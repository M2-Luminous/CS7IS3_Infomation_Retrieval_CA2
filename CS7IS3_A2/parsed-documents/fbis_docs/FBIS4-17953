According to unofficial reports, it was impossible to hold these conferences in any rayon around Mordovia owing to the absence of a quorum. For example, as few as 45 deputies gathered in the Saransk City Soviet whereas a quorum requires 93. Mr. Biryukov, speaker of the Mordovia parliament, decided to take personal part in the restoration of Soviet government in Temnikovskiy Rayon -- it is in this rayon that he has the greatest number of like-minded and relatives. The speaker still failed to secure a quorum. Biryukov's appeal to the rayon's internal affairs department chief to induce the deputies to get together with the help of militia did not help. This time around the militia decided against meddling in politics. In the meantime, people in Mordovia are awaiting a commission to arrive from Moscow which was created under Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's directive No. 193 RP of 18 April 1994. Composed of representatives of Russia's Justice Ministry, the president's Main Legal Administration, and the president's staff for the work with territories, this commission is to see if the laws and the other legal acts passed in the Republic of Mordovia of late correspond with the Constitution of Russia.
