A few days ago, Xi Yang, a reporter with Hong Kong's MING PAO, was pronounced guilty by China's judicial organ on the charge of "stealing state secrets" and will serve a 12-year prison sentence. At a regular news briefing held here on Thursday afternoon, Wu Jianmin answered Hong Kong reporters' questions on Xi Yang's sentence. He said that as China is opening up more deeply to the outside world, it is entirely justified for the overseas community to acquire more information about us. The Chinese side also publishes, in a timely fashion, statistical information through various means, such as granting interviews to reporters, and makes public all sorts of information related to China through other channels, and our purpose is to promote the development of economic relations and trade between China and the outside world. Wu Jianmin said that every country had its own commercial and economic secrets. In cases where someone has stolen such secrets, he should definitely be punished. Finally, Wu Jianmin said: If necessary, the Foreign Ministry Information Department will, as in the past, organize news briefings and invite relevant government officials responsible for economic affairs to brief overseas reporters on certain aspects of economic construction and development they want to know about.
