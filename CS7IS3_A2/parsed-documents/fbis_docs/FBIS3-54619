Pillai] [Text] The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front [EPRLF] has declared that it is not going to take part in the Eastern Province local elections, which are against the will of the people. At the same time, the party also has announced that it will not support any group contesting the elections. The EPRLF statement also calls for boycotting the elections, which are primarily aimed at dividing the North and East and prolonging the war. It has also been pointed out that the attempts to hold elections in the east in an atmosphere rife with human rights violations and military intervention are meant as distraction from the ethnic conflict, making the Eastern Province a Sinhalese-dominated one, hoodwinking the world with a suggestion of the existence of a democratic system there, and encouraging the Army. Moreover, we believe that this election is the outcome of a decision made with a militaristic view to obliterate a national ethnic group rather than a political decision of a democratic country.
