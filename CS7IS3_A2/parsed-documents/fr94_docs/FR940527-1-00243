PPO = preferred provider organization. Trends in responses may reflect, in part, hospitals increasing familiarity with HMO and PPO contracting over time; this may have increased the likelihood of positive survey responses.

Hospitals in the Future The health care reform debate now under way focuses on the need for and types of reforms necessary to stem runaway health spending and provide universal health insurance coverage. The uncertain outcome of this debate could have a dramatic effect on the hospital of the future. Already, hospitals have responded in a variety of ways to the pressures they face, diversifying the services they offer, pursuing different avenues to control costs, and adopting new strategies that govern their relationships with other providers and physicians. Existing pressures to reduce spending and adapt to changing medical practices will continue. Federal, state, and local governments will further their efforts to bring health care expenditures under control and extend services to vulnerable populations. Private payers will exert similar pressures. Medical practice will advance, adding new treatments and expanding the populations that could benefit from medical services. The anticipation of health care reform and its ultimate nature, though, will further affect hospitals and their role in health care delivery. Comprehensive reform that alters the structure of financing and delivery systems to control expenditure growth and expand coverage would bring the most dramatic changes. Incremental reforms that modify the existing relationships among payers and providers would likely continue the adaptations hospitals are making now. Regardless of the shape of reform, the critical features that will affect hospitals relate to the type, strength, and source of pressure to control spending. Health care expenditure control can be achieved through slowing the growth in costs per unit of service, reducing the number and intensity of services provided, managing the mix of services, or all three. Hospitals will be affected differently, depending on which strategy is followed and the strength of the pressure to respond. Likewise, the source of the pressure to control expenditures will affect hospital responses. The impact of the efforts of individual payers_either in the government or private sector_would be quite different from a government mandate for expenditure control applied to all payers. Similarly, whether hospitals are singled out or all health care facilities are subject to controls will affect the response.
