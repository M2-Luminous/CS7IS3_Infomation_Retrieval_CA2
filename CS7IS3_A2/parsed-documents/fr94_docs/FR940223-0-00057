FR940223-0-00057 FR940223-0-00022 Discussion of Comments to the Docket The FHWA received 28 comments to this docket: 14 from organizations and groups potentially affected by the rulemaking, 5 from national associations, 3 from for-hire bus companies, 2 from State enforcement agencies, 1 from a Federal advisory board, 1 from a union, and 2 from individuals. Only three commenters, two of which were churches, opposed the rule as an unnecessary regulatory burden. The American Bus Association (ABA) supported the NPRM, expressing the opinion that PMCPs are less safe than for-hire carriers because they operate older, inferior equipment, with less experienced drivers, and in its opinion, are involved in a disproportionate number of fatal accidents. The ABA also stated that these drivers should be subject to the same driver qualification and hours of service requirements, including recordkeeping, because they are usually less experienced and qualified. The ABA raised questions about the enforceability of the definition in the NPRM for limited PMCPs, specifically the 10 percent driving time factor. It felt these carriers would reduce driving time below 10 percent to avoid the paperwork requirements. The ABA also recommended that all PMCPs get a U.S. DOT number to facilitate enforcement. The United Bus Owners of America and the National School Transportation Association supported the rule, maintaining that anyone transporting passengers should comply fully with the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping, in the interest of safety for the passengers on board a vehicle and the motoring public at large. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters supported the rule and favored the division of PMCPs into groups for the purpose of paperwork burden relief. Those commenters opposed to the NPRM were concerned that the rule placed an unnecessary burden on churches, with little accident or safety data to support the rule. They contended that many churches will terminate interstate travel rather than attempt to comply with the requirements. Two States wrote to the docket_one supporting and one opposing the proposal. The Transportation Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky supported the rule. The Cabinet believed that school bus operations also should be subject to the FMCSRs, but did not provide data to support its position. The Department of Motor Vehicles in North Carolina opposed the rule as an unnecessary burden, claiming private buses are usually not used in commerce. The Department instead recommended that FHWA staff focus on truck safety problems. FHWA's Response In consideration of the comments to the NPRM, the FHWA concluded that the use of volunteer driver status, coupled with the 10 percent driving factor, would not be a workable criterion for separation of the two groups because of the uncertainty in defining ``volunteer status'' and measuring the 10 percent driving time factor. Instead, the FHWA will base its distinction on whether the motor carrier is providing the transportation of passengers in furtherance of a commercial purpose other than transportation. Those PMCPs involved in a business activity which provides transportation, in the furtherance of a commercial purpose other than for-hire transportation, will be subject to all of the FMCSRs, including recordkeeping. Those PMCPs engaged in nonbusiness activities, but providing transportation of some kind, must have safe drivers and vehicles and will be subject to many of the FMCSRs. These PMCPs will not be required to comply with the current recordkeeping requirements. The FHWA also agrees with, and has incorporated into the final rule, comments that all PMCPs should obtain a U.S. DOT number, which should facilitate the proper collection of accurate roadside inspection and enforcement information. The ``grandfather'' provision for fuel system requirements, as proposed in the NPRM, also has been retained. Although interstate commerce is historically defined to include trade, traffic, or transportation across State boundaries and is not limited to business entities in profit-making ventures, the FHWA believes most churches will fall within the definition of nonbusiness PMCPs. As such, these carriers will not be subject to the current recordkeeping requirements. Under this final rule, once a driver obtains a CDL, no additional files, such as driver qualification records including the medical examination certificate, or drivers' record of duty status, are required to be maintained. Requirements of the Final Rule The final rule is very similar to the NPRM except that (1) the definition of PMCP has been consolidated with the definition of private motor carrier of property, (2) the definitions of ``nonbusiness PMCPs'' and ``business PMCPs'' have been added, (3) nonbusiness PMCPs will be exempt from subpart H of part 391 and all current recordkeeping requirements, (4) PMCPs will not be subject to the road and written test requirements of part 391, and (5) all passenger carriers will be required to obtain a US DOT number to identify their buses for enforcement by Federal and State officials. Many operations which are classified as PMCPs are companies that transport their workers to and from job sites. PMCPs also include nonbusiness-type organizations, including scout, church and civic groups, that characteristically use volunteers to transport members by bus and charge no fee, or only a nominal fee to cover expenses of the transportation service provided.
