FR940826-1-00024 FR940826-1-00002 7 CFR Part 1036 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;20] Milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Marketing Area; Proposed Temporary Revision of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed temporary revision of rule. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal to revise the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposal would reduce shipping percentages for pool supply plants by 10 percentage points for each month during the requested period. The temporary revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc., a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant. The handler contends that the action is necessary to prevent inefficient and uneconomic movements of milk. DATES: Comments are due no later than September 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be sent to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Constance M. Brenner, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456 (202) 720&hyph;2357. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of ยง1036.7(f) of the order, the temporary revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area is being considered for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995. All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies of their views to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456 by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required procedures and include September 1994 in the temporary revision period. All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).
