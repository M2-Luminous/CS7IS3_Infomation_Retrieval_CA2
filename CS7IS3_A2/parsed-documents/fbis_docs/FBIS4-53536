Mass rallies took place in South Pyongan and North Hwanghae Provinces Thursday. The speakers at the rallies described the Kwangju uprising as an anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance in which the entire citizens of Kwangju rose up in a death-defying struggle for independence, democracy and reunification. Fourteen years have passed since the resistance fighters of Kwangju shed blood of patriotism, but their desire has not been realised, the speakers said, adding that this is because the U.S. imperialists have not given up their design to keep hold on South Korea as their colony and military base. Referring to the vicious campaign of the United States to stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue," the speakers said the United States unilaterally called off the third round of talks with the DPRK and is manipulating some dishonest quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency in an effort to put "international pressure" on the DPRK. If the desire of the Kwangju martyrs is to be realised, they said, it is essential to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime. The South Korean people and students must fight more courageously to bring about a new morning of democracy free from subjugation, they stressed.
