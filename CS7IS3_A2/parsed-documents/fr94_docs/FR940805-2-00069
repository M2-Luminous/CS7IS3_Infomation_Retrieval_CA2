The Superintendent of Documents list ID is HCLRM, and the stock number is 717&hyph;139&hyph;00000&hyph;3. The following material is contained on the CD-ROM disk: •Titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Act. •HCFA-related regulations. •HCFA manuals and monthly revisions. •HCFA program memoranda. The titles of the Compilation of the Social Security Laws are current as of the September 1, 1992. The remaining portions of CD&hyph;ROM are updated on a monthly basis. The CD&hyph;ROM disk does not contain Appendices M (Interpretative Guidelines for Hospices) and R (Resident Assessment for Long Term Care Facilities) of the State Operations Manual. Copies of these appendices may be reviewed at a Federal Depository Library (FDL). Any cost report forms incorporated in the manuals are included on the CD&hyph;ROM disk as LOTUS files. LOTUS software is needed to view the reports once the files have been copied to a personal computer disk. V. How To Review Listed Material Transmittals or Program Memoranda can be reviewed at a local FDL. Under the FDL program, government publications are sent to approximately 1400 designated libraries throughout the United States. Interested parties may examine the documents at any one of the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material to a local library not designated as an FDL. To locate the nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library. In addition, individuals may contact regional depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one copy of most Federal government publications, either in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. These libraries provide reference services and interlibrary loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may obtain information about the location of the nearest regional depository library from any library. Superintendent of Documents numbers for each HCFA publication are shown in Addendum III, along with the HCFA publication and transmittal numbers. To help FDLs locate the instruction, use the Superintendent of Documents number, plus the HCFA transmittal number. For example, to find the Carriers Manual, Part 3_Claims Process (HCFA&hyph;Pub. 14&hyph;3) transmittal entitled ``Claims Involving Patients Who Have Elected Hospice Care,'' use the Superintendent of Documents No. HE 22.8/7, and the HCFA transmittal number 1475. VI. General Information It is possible that an interested party may have a specific information need and not be able to determine from the listed information whether the issuance or regulation would fulfill that need.
