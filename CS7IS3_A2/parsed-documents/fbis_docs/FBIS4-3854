"If they do not comply," said Kofi Annan, U.N. undersecretary- general, "air strikes will be used to get them out." Subsequently, he said, the U.N. had the exclusions around the other "safe areas," which if they attempted to move heavy weapons in, they would also be attacked. The U.N. official made these remarks at a press briefing held here this morning. Annan also said that a three-km exclusion zone had been in effect since 0001 GMT Sunday, following a decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday [15 April]. NATO authorized the use of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs if they did not end their attacks against Gorazde, pull their forces back from the city center, and allow U.N. Forces freedom of movement there. Annan said that the Bosnian Serbs had not complied promptly with the first deadline, but that the U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor) commander had decided not to use air strikes immediately, as it felt that progress was being made and that the Serbs would soon comply with the NATO ultimatum. "It was important to get U.N. troops and medical units into the city as quickly as possible and air strikes might have jeopardized that operation," according to the U.N. official. There are 475 U.N. personnel in Gorazde at present. Answering questions on the deteriorating relations between the U.N. and NATO, Annan said that "the relationship is good, and we have excellent collaboration between the United Nations and the NATO."
