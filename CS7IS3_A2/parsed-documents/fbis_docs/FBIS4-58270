FBIS4-58270 "drnes085_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 SYRIA Official Rejects `Peace by Installments' Official Rejects `Peace by Installments' JN3004120994 Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic 1100 GMT 30 Apr 94 JN3004120994 Amman Radio Jordan Network Arabic BFN [Text] Syria today asked Israel to stop issuing mysterious statements and to declare its clear readiness to effect a comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan in order to realize a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Speaking before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's arrival in Damascus today, an official Syrian source said that Syria is serious about its call for realizing comprehensive withdrawal in exchange for comprehensive peace, but will not accept a peace by installments. The source said that Syria wants a just and comprehensive peace in the region and will support all efforts in that direction but will not accept any partial or separate solutions and will reject incomplete peace, a peace which comes by installments. The Syria official [as heard] said: Peace cannot be divided. Either there is a just and comprehensive peace, giving everybody their full rights and ending the roots of tension in the region, or there is not. This is because a settlement that lacks these elements cannot survive and the region will continue to be primed for an explosion at any time. The Syrian official ridiculed Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's statements in which he described making a decision to withdraw from the Golan as a painful decision, saying that the Golan's people are the ones who are pained because Israel occupied their land and homes. He said that occupation is an illegal act of aggression and it is the people of the Golan who should be feeling the pain because they were expelled from their land and homes. By withdrawing from the Golan, Israel is not offering concessions because it will be withdrawing from a territory which it does not own, he said, adding that the Golan has always been and will always be a Syrian Arab territory. The Syrian official urged Christopher to play the role of an impartial mediator and a full partner and pressure Israel in order to state its readiness to implement UN resolutions and apply the land-for-peace principle. The official said: All we want is the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, which are supported by international norms and conventions. We want to regain our rights and this is legitimate. The source reiterated Syria's rejection of secret talks and separate deals. The Syrian official asked: Why demand secret talks if the party calling for them is sincere in its intentions and desire to realize peace?
