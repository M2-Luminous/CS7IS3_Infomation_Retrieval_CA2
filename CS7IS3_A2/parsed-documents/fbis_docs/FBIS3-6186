IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is highly likely to convene a special Board of Governors meeting within the week to brief the members on the inspection results, the official said. The IAEA inspection team was to leave Pyongyang and head back to the Agency's headquarters in Vienna on Tuesday morning. The inspectors leave without having secured the promised access to one or two critical sites at the radiochemical laboratory, an installation the IAEA has said would be a nuclear reprocessing plant when completely built. "North Korea has not met either of the two preconditions for the Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. The talks are now suspended indefinitely," said the official. Seoul and Washington earlier made conditional promises to call off the annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" and to hold the high-level meeting on March 21 in Geneva. The pledges were made on the condition that North Korea allow unlimited IAEA inspections and exchange special envoys with South Korea. "North Korea is apparently trying to acquire more negotiating cards with its nuclear facilities," said the government official. "It remains up to the IAEA to determine whether the just-concluded inspection proved that North Korea did not divert nuclear material for non-peaceful uses." The IAEA inspectors need two to three weeks to produce a conclusive report on North Korea, but the official said Blix is unlikely to wait until the report comes out to convene a special board meeting. "It's very probable that the special board session will be convened within this week," he said. Blix is expected to make some sort of announcement by Wednesday or Thursday on the IAEA's evaluation of the North Korean inspection, he said.
