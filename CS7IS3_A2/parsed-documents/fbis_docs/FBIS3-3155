An investigation by the State Audit Administration reveals up to 90 per cent of bankers have refused to carry out the vice-premier's rectification policy to stop them setting up businesses. They were the major target of Mr Zhu's rectification policy introduced last June. The report said many state-run banks and their branches were unwilling to separate their linkage with businesses invested and owned by them due to huge interests and complicated legal, economic and practical problems. "Banking institutions and their affiliated businesses are closely tied together for interests," a banking official said. "Firms are dependent on banks to supply capital and banks rely on firms for huge profits which are much higher than returns by banking business activities." China's state-run banks have been widely involved in businesses, especially in speculation in the country's fledgling stock and property markets. Their activities have caused widespread corruption and overheating following Beijing's rush to embrace a capitalistic economy. Mr Zhu, also governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, launched the rectification campaign to wipe out the malpractices. The State Audit Administration says branches of the People's Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Agricultural Bank and Construction Bank in a central China province had not cut links with all of the 757 bank-affiliated businesses owned by them. Chinese sources said the result by the investigation would greatly embarrass Mr Zhu who vowed to get rid of the practice when being appointed central bank governor last June. Meanwhile, a senior banking official said Beijing would give more generous terms to Hong Kong and Taiwan banks than foreign banks in setting up business on the mainland. "Anyway, they (Hong Kong and Taiwan) are parts of our nation," said Dai Shanglong, referring to requirements for overseas banks to set their branches in China. Chinese regulations require a foreign bank to have assets of above US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) to set up a representative office. The office should have been established three years and the bank have assets over US$20 billion before it can apply to set up a branch. Mr Dai said Beijing would ease this term for banks from Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, he hinted that China was unlikely to open its yuan business to foreign banks. According to Mr Dai, China can completely open the Chinese yuan business to foreign bankers only when the following three basic requirements are met: -- Specialised state-run banks should be restructured into real commercial banks and policy-banking activities should be separated from business ones in these banks to enable them to compete with their foreign counterparts on an equal footing; -- As many banks are granting policy loans to help enterprises in the red to help maintain social stability, and so long as state-run firms are not restructured into self responsible businesses to enable banks to release the burden, it is improper for China to open its currency market to foreign bankers; -- China should unify its corporate tax rates for all banks to create an equal footing for competition as Beijing now provides various tax rates, with 15 per cent for foreign banks in Special Economic Zones, 30 per cent for foreign banks in opening cities while charging 55 per cent for staterun banks. Mr Dai said Beijing could approve some foreign banks to operate yuan business in some regions on a trial basis.
