FR940526-2-00060 FR940526-2-00038 Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Amendment to the Permit Allowing Incidental Take of the Threatened Desert Tortoise by Clark County and the Cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, and Boulder City, NV AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that Clark County and the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, and Boulder City, Nevada (Applicants) have applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an amendment to their existing permit (PRT 756260) authorizing incidental take of desert tortoises ( Gopherus agassizii ) pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The proposed amendment would extend the term of the existing permit one year, to July 31, 1995 and allow disturbance of 8,000 additional acres within the existing permit area. The number of desert tortoises taken would not increase above what is currently authorized under the existing permit, which is up to 3,710 tortoises. The permit application is accompanied by amendments to the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and Implementation Agreement (IA). The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed amendment to the permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the permit application and EA should be received on or before June 27, 1994. ADDRESS: Comments regarding the application or adequacy of the EA should be addressed to Mr. David Harlow, Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Reno Field Office, 4600 Kietzke Lane, Building C, room 125, Reno, Nevada 89502. Please refer to permit no. PRT&hyph;756260 when submitting comment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Sheryl Barrett, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Reno Field Office, 4600 Kietzke Lane, Building C, room 125, Reno, Nevada 89502 (702&hyph;784&hyph;5227). Individuals wishing copies of the application or EA for review should immediately contact the above individual. Documents will be available for public inspection, by appointment, and during normal business hours at the Reno Field Office (address given above). Documents will also be available for review at the reference desks of all public libraries in Clark County, Nevada. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations, ``taking'' of desert tortoises a threatened species, is prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take threatened wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for threatened species are in 50 CFR 17.32. The Applicants propose to amend their existing permit, and have proposed amendments to the HCP and IA for their permit, which authorizes incidental take of desert tortoises in the Las Vegas Valley and Boulder City. The existing permit was issued July 24, 1991, and authorizes the incidental take of up to 3,710 desert tortoises on 22,352 acres of desert tortoise habitat, within the specified permit area. As of December 1993, 701 desert tortoises have been taken pursuant to the existing permit and approximately 15,383 acres of tortoise habitat have been developed. By the time the existing permit expires, disturbance of all or nearly all of the 22,352 acres of habitat authorized by the existing permit is expected to occur, but the number of tortoises expected to be taken is well below 3,710. To minimize and monitor the incidental take authorized under the existing permit, the Applicants have implemented procedures to survey and remove tortoises located on development properties; placed these tortoises in research, education, and adoption programs; implemented audit procedures; and conducted a public information program. To mitigate for impacts to the desert tortoise authorized by the existing permit, the Applicants have implemented a tortoise habitat conservation program in Clark County. As of December 1993, the Applicants have preserved approximately 330,000 acres of habitat for the long-term management of desert tortoises in the Piute-Eldorado Desert Wildlife Management Area. The Applicants will conserve an additional 70,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat prior to the expiration date of the existing permit. The conserved habitat is located primarily on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. Management actions, including increased law enforcement, above and beyond what is legally required of the Federal land managers, are funded by the Applicants through a $550-per-acre mitigation fee on development projects covered by the existing permit. To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the additional 8,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat proposed to be developed under the permit amendment, the applicants propose to amend the existing HCP by: (1) Assessing a $550-per-acre mitigation fee on the additional 8,000 acres of habitat disturbance; (2) adding an additional $100,000 to the research monies established under the existing permit; (3) adding $100,000 to the public education fund established under the existing permit; (4) increasing the current $3,125,000 trust fund for income to manage and monitor conserved habitat by $1,000,000; and (5) adding approximately 140,000 acres of conserved habitat to the tortoise management area established under the existing permit. The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including amendment of the permit as proposed, extension of the permit with no additional habitat disturbance, and no action.
