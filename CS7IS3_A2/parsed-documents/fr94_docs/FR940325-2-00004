FR940325-2-00004 FR940325-2-00001 The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review in September of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the Federal Register . The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the Federal Register . It is very important that those interested in management of the Cedar Gulch area participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed by January 1, 1995. The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 30-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in developing issues and alternatives. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues on the proposed action, comments should be as specific as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Dated: March 17, 1994. James I. Mershon, District Ranger. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7136 Filed 3&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
