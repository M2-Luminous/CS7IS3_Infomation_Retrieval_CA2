FR940711-1-00050 FR940711-1-00013 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 89&hyph;26; Notice 5] RIN 2127&hyph;AF31 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard; Convex Cross View Mirrors on School Buses AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird), NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 111, Rearview Mirrors , with respect to the field-of-view around school buses. Specifically, the agency is proposing to rescind a provision in the Standard so that certain driving mirrors would no longer be required to provide a field-of-view of the ground forward of cylinders by the bus's rear wheels to areas directly beneath the mirror surface. The agency is concerned that the current requirement may compromise safety either by making it more difficult for the driver to use the driving mirror when the bus is in motion as the result of having a more distorted image from a more convex mirror or by reducing the driver's direct line of sight as the result of creating a larger blind spot near the bus. DATES: Comment Date: Comments must be received by August 10, 1994. Effective Date: If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. (Docket Room hours are 9:30 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m., Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Charles Hott, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202) 366&hyph;0247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Previous Agency Rulemakings On December 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 111, Rear-View Mirrors , to ensure that a school bus provides an adequate field-of-view around a stopped school bus, thus reducing the risk of school buses striking students as the students are approaching the buses in order to board them or as they are leaving the buses. (57 FR 57015) The final rule requires each school bus to be equipped with two mirror systems on each side of the bus: (1) ``System A,'' which consists of a flat driving mirror of unit magnification and typically a convex driving mirror; and (2) ``System B,'' which consists of convex cross view mirrors for spotting students during the loading and unloading of students. The System A mirror system must provide, among other things, a view of the area of the ground extending rearward from the area below the mirror surface. The System B convex cross view mirrors must provide, among other things, a view of the ground that overlaps with the view of the ground provided by System A. System A and System B mirrors in combination are required to provide the driver with a view of the ground in front of and along both sides of the bus and extending at least 200 feet rearward from the driving mirror. This final rule took effect on December 2, 1993. NHTSA again evaluated the field-of-view requirements for System A mirrors in response to a petition for reconsideration of the final rule submitted by Ford Motor Company (Ford). (58 FR 60399, November 16, 1993) Ford stated that requiring System A mirrors to provide a view of the ground immediately beneath them fails to meet the need for safety and may make impracticable the use of currently designed flat unit magnification mirrors. Ford requested that NHTSA amend the requirement in Standard No. 111 that System A mirrors provide an extended rearward view of the ground starting from the area beneath the mirror (S9.2(b)(1), (2)). NHTSA decided not to adopt Ford's requested revision, because the agency was concerned that Ford's suggested System A mirrors might have had blind spots in the area of the ground directly below the driver's mirrors and forward of the rear edge of the side windows. The agency explained that it is permissible to use a combination of convex and flat mirrors to meet the System A requirements, and that the convex portion of the mirror system can be used for the view beneath the System A mirror. 57 FR at 57005. II. Blue Bird Petition Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) petitioned the agency to amend Standard No. 111 with respect to the field-of-view requirements for System A mirrors. Blue Bird stated that to comply with the final rule's requirements, either a small radius of curvature convex mirror or a second convex mirror would have to be attached to the System A mirror. Blue Bird argued that either approach would be impracticable and inconsistent with motor vehicle safety. According to the petitioner, a small radius of curvature mirror would provide unreasonably small and distorted images that would be unsafe for driving, while a second convex mirror would create a larger blind spot for the driver. Blue Bird also stated that any convex mirror added to a system A mirror should have a radius of curvature of at least 35 inches, since convex mirrors with low radii of curvature would provide unreasonably small and distorted images thus causing problems for the school bus driver, while the vehicle is in motion. Blue Bird stated that the requirement, as adopted, is inconsistent with previous agency statements about problems associated with using highly convex mirrors for driving. Blue Bird further stated that none of the discussions in the NPRM explaining the requirements for System A mirrors implies the need for driving mirrors to see the area directly below them. Blue Bird requested the agency immediately amend the wording of S9.2(b)(1) and S9.2(b)(2) to require that System A mirrors provide views of the area of the ground that extend rearward from the test cylinders near the rear axles to not less than 200 feet measured from the rear surface of the mirrors. As the result of such an amendment, the System A mirrors would no longer be required to provide a view of the ground between those cylinders and the ground beneath the mirror. On January 13, 1994, agency personnel met with representatives of Blue Bird and Mirror Lite Company, a mirror manufacturer, to evaluate the field-of-view provided by various mirror configurations on school buses. At that meeting, Blue Bird stated that the installation and use of a driving mirror with a small radius of curvature may result in unsafe driving practices since it distorts images, thus making it difficult for a driver to judge the distance between his or her bus and following vehicles when the driver is attempting to change lanes. Similarly, Blue Bird alleged that, with a small radius of curvature mirror, other vehicles appear to approach suddenly ( i.e. , images of oncoming vehicles at the rear of the bus that are very small and difficult to recognize suddenly appear greatly distorted as the vehicles get closer to the mirror).
