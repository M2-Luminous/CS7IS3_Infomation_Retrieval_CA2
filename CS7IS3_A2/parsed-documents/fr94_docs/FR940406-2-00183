Public Meetings DOE will host a series of informal information sessions to provide the public with additional information on waste management at the Savannah River Site and the proposed actions and alternatives discussed in this Notice of Intent. These sessions are intended to promote conversation with DOE representatives available to answer questions. Oral and written comments will be received at public scoping meetings to be held at the locations and times indicated above. The meetings will be chaired by a presiding officer and attended by DOE officials. The public scoping meetings will not be conducted as evidentiary hearings; speakers will not be cross-examined, although the presiding officer and DOE representatives present may ask clarifying questions. The DOE panel members will respond to comments and questions from the public. In addition DOE representatives will be available to discuss the Savannah River Site waste management program in informal conversations. To facilitate scheduling of speakers, requests to speak at these meetings may be made in advance by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;242&hyph;8269 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, or by calling Mr. Stephen R. Wright at 803&hyph;725&hyph;3957 at least two days before the designated meeting. To ensure that everyone has an adequate opportunity to speak, five minutes will be allotted each speaker. Depending on the number of persons who request an opportunity to speak, the presiding officer may allow more time for speakers representing multiple parties or organizations. Persons wishing to speak on behalf of organizations should identify the organization in their request. Persons who have not submitted an advance request to speak may register at the meetings and will be called on to speak in the order of registration as time permits. Written comments also will be accepted at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record. DOE will prepare transcripts of the scoping meetings. Individuals may review the transcripts, other National Environmental Policy Act documents, and unclassified background information on waste management at the Savannah River Site at the following DOE public reading rooms during normal business hours: U.S. DOE Reading Room, University of South Carolina, Aiken Campus, University Library_2nd Floor, University Parkway, Aiken, SC 29801; (803) 648&hyph;6851.

Development of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS DOE will consider comments and suggestions received during the scoping period in its preparation of the draft EIS. Results of the scoping process (including a summary of comments received, DOE's response to public comments, and an outline of the intended scope and environmental issues to be discussed in the EIS) will be presented in a publicly available Implementation Plan. On completing the draft EIS, DOE will announce its availability in the Federal Register and local media, and will again solicit public comments. DOE will consider comments on the draft EIS in its preparation of the final EIS. The preliminary schedule for issuance of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS is shown below. Availability of Implementation Plan: June 1994. Availability of Draft EIS: October 1994. Draft EIS Public Comment Period: November 1994 through December 1994. Availability of Final EIS: April 1995.
