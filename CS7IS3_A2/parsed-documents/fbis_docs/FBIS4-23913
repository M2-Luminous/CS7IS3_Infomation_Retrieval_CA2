Mr Joseph Chiole, Freedom Front spokesman on state administration, said elements of the ANC's affirmative action proposals "spell serious danger that the greatest racial discrimination in South Africa's history -- against Whites -- is now being planned". This was indicated by the fact that the recommendations of the Public Service Commission on the filling of vacant posts, including recommendations made after merit determination, had been withdrawn. This had to be seen against the fact that the government proposed to institute race monitors to ensure that affirmative action took place, not only in the civil service but also in the private sector. "The fact that in some instances undertakings will have to keep records of the race of their employees as well as their clients will increase the level of racial tension in South Africa. It would also increase bureaucratic red tape, which could have serious financial repercussions for businesses." Referring to the statement last week by Public Service and Administration Minister Mr Zola Skweyiya that "monitoring mechanisms" would watch developments in every department of state, Mr Chiole said that, in simple terminology, this meant preferential treatment for blacks. The implication was that appointments would not necessarily be made on the basis of merit, and that qualified Whites faced blatant racial discrimination.
