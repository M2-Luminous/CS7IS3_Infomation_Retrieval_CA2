The local situation is gradually improving. Batono Givi, is this really the case? [Lominadze] That is correct. As someone who is involved in affairs here 24 hours a day and for whom such a change should apparently be less noticeable, I can indeed see that it has changed. Compared with the first few weeks, there is a big difference. The situation has clearly improved. [passage omitted] However, believe me when I say in all seriousness that we are a long way from achieving stability. I cannot say that everything has already been put right in western Georgia. More or less, only more or less. If, for example, we are not facing the problem of violent interference on the part of the opposing side and an exacerbation of the situation in both the Guria and Imereti zones and in Samtredia, Vani, and Khoni where this question is no longer on the agenda, we can expect complications at any moment in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, Chkhorotsqu, and Senaki. This we know from information and analytical materials in our possession and from having our finger on the pulse of the sociopolitical life in this region. I do not exclude that one fine day, a certain armed force will burst into Zugdidi or Senaki or Khobi or Tsalenjikha or Chkhorotsqu and declare that they have restored the jurisdiction of the legal authorities, as they call them. As I have said, there is no danger of this occurring in the rayons of Guria and Imereti. However, they are faced with all those economic and social problems that exist throughout Georgia; these are being felt more painfully as the local population has experienced the fear of weapons and insults on the part of the supporters of the ex-president. Compared with other areas of Samegrelo, the situation is different in Poti. There, economic and social problems have to be resolved, although I would say that the criminal situation is stable -- at least, it is under control. There is a difference regarding economic and political problems themselves: For example, there is one set of such problems in Senaki and Poti and another in Tsalenjikha and Chkhorotsqu. Sometimes the difference is sharp. Finally, I would say that the difference between what we encountered there first and the situation today is like that between day and night. Naturally, it would have been desirable to have gotten the factories and establishments working more quickly, but this would have been the best that we could have expected. What did we first encounter? The railway was destroyed; there were no buses; naturally, there was no gas or electricity; the medical establishments were ransacked; there was no bread or water. There was nothing. There were more than 200 destroyed houses in Senaki alone; the people were frightened. The situation was the same in Abasha and Khobi and the towns and villages were so empty that it seemed that no one was left alive. What are things like today? All the tea-processing plants are functioning as best they can given the reduced electric power supplies. We arrived just in time as the sanitary conditions were so bad that all kinds of infections could have broken out at any moment. Our most pressing problem during the first 10 days was cleaning up the towns. Stability will only come when justice reigns, law and order is established, and the factories and establishments are working. The realization of these factors will save the whole of Georgia and western Georgia, in particular. We probably need to conduct the merciless struggle against bandit formations for one to one and a half years. Do not think that all those people who have gone into the woods will give themselves up, lay down their weapons, stand at the side of the road or go back to the tea plantations or do what they were doing before. They will not do this; they have gotten used to doing no work. Armed with machine guns, they can appear on the highway and obtain in five minutes what they would have earned in 10 years. Try convincing those people now to lay down their weapons, as this will be good for them and necessary for Georgia and to go back to picking tea leaves. A difficult thing, don't you think? [Saneblidze]Of course. [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that, having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do but sit idly by and wait for the results. This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes, we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as well. There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality for their own purposes? No one. Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single moment. [passage omitted]
