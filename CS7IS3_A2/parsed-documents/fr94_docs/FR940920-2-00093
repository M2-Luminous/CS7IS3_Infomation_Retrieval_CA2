FR940920-2-00093 FR940920-2-00045 [Finance Docket No. 32566] Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company_Joint Relocation Project Exemption_In Kansas On August 19, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate a line of railroad in a joint project with the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company (SKOL). The joint project involves: (1) A haulage agreement under which SKOL will haul MP cars over its trackage, as MP's agent, between Winfield and Coffeyville, KS;ยง 1 (2) overhead trackage rights to MP over SKOL rail lines known as: (a) The Moline Subdivision from milepost 248.1 near Winfield to milepost 127.7 near Chanute; (b) the Tulsa Subdivision from milepost 127.7 near Chanute to milepost 155.8 near Cherryvale; and (c) the Coffeyville Subdivision from milepost 155.8 (also milepost 0.0) near Cherryvale to milepost 16.9 near Coffeyville, 2 a total distance of approximately 165.4 miles; and (3) an abandonment by MP of its Wichita Branch from milepost 387.00 near Yates Center to milepost 453.20 near El Dorado, in Woodson, Greenwood and Butler Counties, KS, a distance of approximately 66.20 miles. 3 The transaction was expected to be consummated on or after August 26, 1994. 1 Car haulage is a private arrangement between carriers. It does not require Commission approval. See Burlington N.R. Co._Exemption_Joint Project to Relocate a Line of Railroad Between Tulsa and Muskogee, OK, Finance Docket No. 31293 (ICC served July 19, 1988). 2 There is an equation in the trackage mileposts at Cherryvale, where milepost 155.8 equals 0.0 at the same point. 3 The non-agency stations at Toronto (milepost 399.5) and Eureka (milepost 420.7) are within the incidental abandonment. The joint relocation project will result in an alternate route with no disruption of rail service for MP's customers. 4 As indicated, SKOL will haul MP's cars over its lines between Winfield and Coffeyville, KS, pursuant to a haulage agreement. MP, in turn, will retain access to its customers via the trackage rights granted by SKOL. According to MP, the relocation of its operations will not generate new traffic, extend rail service into new territory, or impact or change the competitive situation of the rail carriers in the area. The project is expected to result in satisfactory and cost-effective rail operations in the area, as well as effective use of rail assets. 4 Ranch Aid, Inc., a shipper located at Eureka, KS, has informed MP that it has no present or future need for MP's rail service. The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment component of a relocation project, and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See D.T.& I.R._Trackage Rights, 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental trackage rights component requires no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions in Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Joseph D. Anthofer, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, Nebraska 68179. Decided: September 13, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
