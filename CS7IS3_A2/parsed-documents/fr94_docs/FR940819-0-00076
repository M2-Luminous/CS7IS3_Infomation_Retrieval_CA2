FR940819-0-00076 FR940819-0-00018 The underlying basis of the performance requirements is to: (1) Ensure sufficient power to perform a rescue tow of a tanker (or to substantially reduce its drift rate in severe winds); and (2) provide steering and stopping forces that are equivalent to what the tanker could do itself (with its own steering and propulsion system) at a speed of 6 knots. The Coast Guard believes that, in conjunction with an appropriate tanker speed during the transit, both conventional tugs and tractor tugs that meet the performance requirements can reasonably be expected to safely accomplish effective emergency control of disabled tankers. Discussion of the specific performance requirements is as follows: Towing: The regulations require an escort vessel to be capable of towing the tanker at 4 knots in calm conditions and hold it in a steady position against a 45-knot headwind. Stopping: The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to stop the tanker within the same distance that the tanker would have been able to crash-stop itself from a speed of 6 knots using its own propulsion system. Holding on steady course: The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to hold the tanker on a steady course against a 35-degree locked rudder at 6 knots. This means that the escort vessels must be able to apply a counteractive turning moment equal and opposite to the turning moment generated by the locked rudder, taking into consideration the geometry of the escort vessel's applied force on the tanker's hull (points of application, angle of assist, etc.). Turning: The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to turn the tanker 90 degrees, assuming a free-swinging rudder and an initial speed of 6 knots, in the same distance (advance and transfer) as it would have been able to turn itself using a hard-over rudder. The geometry of the escort vessels' applied forces on the tanker must similarly be taken into consideration.
