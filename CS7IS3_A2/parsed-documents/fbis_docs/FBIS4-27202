FBIS4-27202 "dreas104_a_94035" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Press Coverage on Coalition Issues Continues Press Coverage on Coalition Issues Continues SDPJ Executive Comments OW3105002394 Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese 2230 GMT 29 May 94 OW3105002394 Tokyo FNN Television Network Japanese BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2236 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a 25-minute interview with Masanori Goto, deputy secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by moderator Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and political commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN studio in Tokyo. At 2238 GMT, after citing FNN poll results that show a majority of SDPJ members want to return to the coalition, Kuroiwa asks for Goto's opinion on the results. Goto says: "In the current political situation, a political party cannot justify its existence if it does not participate in the administration. In this sense, it is natural that the SDPJ should want to participate in the coalition." But he adds: "This does not mean, though, the SDPJ will return to the second coalition government in its present form." Kobayashi says the SDPJ may need very persuasive reasons to justify its decision to return to the coalition. Goto replies that the SDPJ will make efforts to get the party's policy reflected in the coalition administration. Kuroiwa then cites criticism of the party leadership for its inconsistent political stance. Goto refutes the criticism, saying the SDPJ is only trying to be responsible. Goto is then asked why the SDPJ participated in the former Hosokawa administration when it experienced difficulties and was forced to make many painful compromises. He says the party played a significant role on various issues, including rice and tax reform. Asked about the SDPJ's position on returning to the coalition, Goto says: "It would be meaningless to call for the dissolution of the House of Representatives to hold a general election under the current multiseat electoral district system." He says the SDPJ will return to the coalition if the Hata cabinet resigns en masse to establish a new coalition government. He says: "It is necessary for the SDPJ to conclude a new policy agreement with the new coalition. If such an agreement is reached, it would be possible for the SDPJ to join." And if agreement is reached, he says, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata need not step down because the SDPJ would not rule out the possibility of him heading the new cabinet. Takemura joins the discussion, voicing support for the SDPJ's stand on returning to the coalition. Kuroiwa asks about the conditions on which the SDPJ would return to the coalition, and Kobayashi cites the results of an FNN poll conducted among SDPJ Diet members. Results of the poll show SDPJ members want the alliance between Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa dissolved; the "Kaishin" floor group disbanded; transparency in the policy-making process; and a cabinet resignation or reshuffle. Goto notes the need to ensure transparency in policy-making, saying: "There has been criticism of the closed nature of the meeting of ruling party representatives. Open discussions should be held not only by party chairmen and secretaries general, but also by several executives from each party." Goto is asked why the SDPJ is trying to return to the coalition. He says: "It is necessary for us to join the administration to uphold and implement our policy proposals in a concrete form." Kobayashi expresses concern that the SDPJ may not be able to maintain its policies in the coalition. Goto tries to dispel the concern, saying the SDPJ will make efforts to coordinate differences in opinion among the ruling parties.
