Among the issues discussed during the meeting were the situation in Europe; developments in the European Union [EU] in view of the fact that Germany will assume the presidency soon; ways of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the European Union [EU]; multilateral cooperation with Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO]. In addition, the head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the German parliament and the spokesman for the Social Democratic Party [SPD], the opposition, as well as the spokesman of the ruling Christian Democrat party met with Dr. Velayati. In the course of these talks, the stances of the two countries on regional and international issues, especially those pertaining to Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, and developments in the Middle East were elaborated on. Ever since the victory of the Islamic revolution--except for the first few years when the SPD under the leadership of Helmut Schmidt was in power--relations between the two countries have not been able to strengthen under the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] led by Helmut Kohl. [sentence as heard] In the period that this party has been at the helm, it has achieved some victories, such as German unification. In view of the recent successes of the CDU in the presidential elections and with its gaining the necessary votes in the European parliament, the continued rule of this party seems likely in the future. In this period, the relations between Tehran and Bonn have been one of the most stable with any European country. Every year has witnessed an increase in the number of economic and financial exchanges between the two countries. Germany is Iran's foremost trading partner and heads the list of importers of Iranian commodities. The largest volume of Iran's non-oil exports is sent to Germany, which collaborates with Iran in numerous infrastructural and industrial projects.
