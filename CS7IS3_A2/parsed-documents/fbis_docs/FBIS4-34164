FBIS4-34164 "drlat116_q_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-116 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 Paraguay Joint Staff Chief Denies President Pressured Joint Staff Chief Denies President Pressured PY1506232194 Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 14 Jun 94 p 2 PY1506232194 Asuncion ABC COLOR Spanish BFN [Text] Chief of the Joint Staff Division General Pedro Concepcion de la Cruz Ocampos on 13 June denied that on 9 June during an unexpected meeting that was held at Armed Forces Headquarters members of the military had pressured the President and Commander in Chief Juan Carlos Wasmosy or handed him an ultimatum asking that he persuade congressmen and politicians to stop the "offenses" that are being hurled at the Armed Forces. "It is absolutely not true," he stressed. He also indicated that there is absolutely nothing to Wasmosy allegedly granting military men permission to take legal action against the law that bans servicemen on active duty from joining a political party. Ocampos denied that influential generals are pressuring Wasmosy, demanding that he prevent the attacks that are being made against the institution by politicians and congressmen. "Those rumors are absolutely not true. They are totally false," he said firmly, when referring to the matter. Asked about the rumors that some generals want to dissolve Congress, Ocampos stated that they are hot air. "They are just rumors. No one is thinking of doing that at this point. The people who start these rumors want to frighten or create an atmosphere of psychosis. The intention just does not exist," he said. He added that he did not believe that Wasmosy could dissolve Congress because "all of us want to get the country off the ground. To do the contrary would be a step backward and it would have internal and external repercussions," he stressed. He also indicated that he knew nothing at all about allegations that Wasmosy has granted permission to officers who want to take legal action against the law that temporarily bans servicemen on active duty from joining a political party. "This has been put on hold and there is nothing, absolutely nothing on this matter," he said. Asked whether it was necessary for the officers to obtain permission from the commander in chief in order to take legal action, Ocampos answered: "I do not know. I do not have any grounds to answer that and I do not want to say something that is not true and thus compromise myself. I am not mixed up in this matter of politics and I do not want to discuss it because it is not something to my liking," he said. Ocampos also indicated that it is very dangerous for the Armed Forces if servicemen on active duty take part in the activities of political parties. "In order to stop this situation cold, the commander in chief could issue a special edict that no one can meddle in party politics. I believe that all of us understand this and therefore we do not exceed the boundaries," he said.
