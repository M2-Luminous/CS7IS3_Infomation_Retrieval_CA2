FR941230-0-00104 FR941230-0-00019 B. Changes to Item 601 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B Item 601 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, which govern the filing of exhibits, including the new Financial Data Schedule, are amended as described below. •The exhibit tables of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B have been amended as proposed to indicate that charter documents are to be filed with quarterly reports on Forms 10&hyph;Q 78 and 10&hyph;QSB 79 pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of Regulations S&hyph;K 80 and S&hyph;B 81 if such documents had been amended during the reporting period, thereby reflecting the requirements of Item 601(a)(4) of Regulations S&hyph;B and S&hyph;K. 82 78 17 CFR 249.308a. 79 17 CFR 249.308b. 80 17 CFR 229.601(b)(3). 81 17 CFR 228.601(b)(3). 82 17 CFR 228.601(a)(4) and 17 CFR 229.601(a)(4), respectively. Revised exhibit table of Item 601 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. •Item 601 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B has been amended to state that if an instrument defining the rights of security holders is in the form of a certificate, the text appearing on the certificate must be reproduced in an electronic filing, together with a description of any other graphic and image material appearing on the certificate. 83 83 Instruction to Item 601(b)(4) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B [17 CFR 229.601(b)(4) and 17 CFR 228.601(b)(4), respectively]. •Item 601(b)(10) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B has been amended to clarify that a material contract that becomes effective or that is executed during the reporting period reflected by an annual or quarterly report must be filed as an exhibit to the periodic report filed for the corresponding period. 84 The amended rules also make it clear that only new material contracts must be filed with quarterly reports; Forms 10&hyph;Q and 10&hyph;QSB, unlike Forms 10&hyph;K and 10&hyph;KSB, do not require a list of all material contracts. 84 Instruction 2 to Item 601(b)(10) to Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10) and 17 CFR 228.601(b)(10), respectively]. •Applications filed for the purpose of determining the eligibility of a person designated as trustee for debt securities registered under the Securities Act that are eligible to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis by or on behalf of the registrant, pursuant to Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act, 85 will now be required to be filed separately in the manner prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual. 86 Prior to this amendment, such filings were required to be filed as an exhibit to a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to which the application relates. This change is intended to provide expedited processing of such filings. Of course, the general procedure requiring all other trust indenture eligibility applications on Form T&hyph;1 and T&hyph;2 87 to be submitted as an exhibit to the registration statement remains intact. 88 85 15 U.S.C. 77eee(b)(2). 86 Revision of Item 601(b)(25)(ii) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B [17 CFR 229.601(b)(25)(ii) and 17 CFR 228.601(b)(25)(ii), respectively]. A new electronic form type 305B2 has been added to EDGAR programming to accommodate this type of filing. This new form type is provided in EDGAR release 4.0 and appears in the EDGAR Filer Manual, dated September 1994, which became effective October 31, 1994. 87 17 CFR 269.1 and 17 CFR 269.2, respectively. 88 See Item 601(b)(25)(ii) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B [17 CFR 229.601(b)(25)(ii) and 228.601(b)(25)(ii), respectively]. •Item 601 also has been amended to clarify that earnings statements ``made generally available'' pursuant to §11(a) of the Securities Act 89 should be filed as an exhibit to Exchange Act periodic reports only where the statement was made available using methods other than including the information in another filing with the Commission, as provided by Securities Act Rule 158. 90 89 15 U.S.C. 77k(a). 90 17 CFR 230.158. Revised Item 601(b)(99)(iii) of Regulation S&hyph;K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(99)(iii)] and Item 601(b)(99)(ii) of Regulation S&hyph;B [17 CFR 228.601(b)(99)(ii)]. •As proposed, Financial Data Schedules will not be required to be filed in connection with registration statements on Form S&hyph;8 91 (for registration of securities issued pursuant to employee benefit plans), since updated financial information is rarely included in such filings. 92 91 17 CFR 239.16b. 92 Revision of note to Item 601(c)(1) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. This is a revision to the note adopted in connection with the implementation of Financial Data Schedules, which indicates that no Financial Data Schedule is required for Form 11&hyph;K. See Release No. 33&hyph;7072. •A note has been added to Item 601(c) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, providing that the paper copy of an electronic filing sent to the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia pursuant to Rule 901(d) of Regulation S&hyph;T need not contain any Financial Data Schedule included in that filing. Similarly, registrants will not be required to furnish paper versions of their Financial Data Schedules with the paper copies sent to national securities exchanges and national securities associations pursuant to Commission rules. 93 Both provisions are consistent with the Commission's position, also codified in the note, that paper copies of the Schedule are not required with filings made in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption because the Schedule merely reflects information found elsewhere in the filing, and thus, it is only useful in electronic filings. 94 93 Note 2 to paragraph (c)(1) of Item 601 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. 94 When a paper filing made pursuant to a hardship exemption is followed up by a confirming electronic copy, the Financial Data Schedule should be included in the confirming copy. See n. 287 in Release No. 33&hyph;6977. C. Changes to Securities Act Rule 483 and Form S&hyph;6 The following amendments to rules and forms under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act in connection with Financial Data Schedule requirements have been adopted as proposed: •A note has been added to Securities Act Rule 483(e) indicating that paper copies of Financial Data Schedules are not required to be furnished to the Commission or to national securities exchanges or national securities associations. 95 95 Note 2 to paragraph (e)(1) of Securities Act Rule 483. See Note 2 to Item 601(c) of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, discussed above.
