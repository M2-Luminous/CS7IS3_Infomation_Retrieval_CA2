Here is the recording. [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we are talking about the Security Council here, I mean the document that was circulated by the secretary general in the Security Council. As for the Security Council, it has not convened and has not discussed the report. Now, about the document itself. I read it this evening [22 March], and to be absolutely honest, I did not want to comment in detail because the forecast is such that...[Shevardnadze pauses]...there are some clauses and regulations that do not quite inspire hope but there are some promising ones too. Therefore, I am for studying every possibility and weighing up every word and only then should we assess this document. Thus, we must not be guided by the first impression. This document is more profound than it seems to be, although, as I said, it is not hope inspiring. [Correspondent] Did parliament's recent decision on Abkhazia influence this document? Why do you think this document was drawn up at all? [Shevardnadze] I would say that there was no immediate influence but the fact remains that the Abkhaz side used this instance for wrecking negotiations. Adopting a decision according to clause 6 at the Security Council, there must be, first, consent from both sides, and second, some progress during negotiations. The delegations were about to reach this point, and if not in New York, then at the next round, some progress would probably be reached either in connection with the return of refugees or any other issue. But they [the Abkhaz side] used it [parliament's decision] and it had a considerable influence [on wrecking negotiations]. I said after my arrival from New York that a U.S. representative in the Security Council told me that this decision was wrong. According to the contents, everything is correct, but when the negotiations were being held and the issue was being discussed in the Security Council, it played a serious and negative role. [Correspondent] Lastly, do you think that after [words indistinct] time come to refuse a peaceful settlement of this conflict, to be more accurate, has it turned out that the course for a peaceful settlement of the conflict is fruitless? [Shevardnadze] It is a very difficult question. The answer will probably be the following: In order to come to the conclusion that the course -- with the interference of the United Nations, the United Nation's participation, and Russia's mediation to settle the conflict in a political manner -- turned out to be unsuccessful and failed, it is premature and hasty to draw such a conclusion. Neither does this report give grounds for drawing such a conclusion. All the more so, it is good that we recorded it [the UN Security Council session] and television viewers could see and listen to every speech by the members of the Security Council; there was total unanimity for the viewpoint that Georgia needs help and that the peacekeeping forces must be sent in. Therefore, we must wait for the Security Council session before we jump to serious conclusions. Maybe one session will not be enough. Those who know the principle of how the UN works, they will agree with me that it fails to adopt operational decisions -- that the United Nations finds it difficult. I think that Georgia did everything it could, that is, using ways for a peaceful settlement in every possible way and every channel. I said in my Monday interview that there are three ways of sending in peacekeeping troops; classical ways; [words indistinct] the second variant is the Russian contingent under the UN banner, which is a bit doubtful although Yeltsin and I agree on this variant in principle. Another variant is [word indistinct] and Russian contingent on the basis of a bilateral agreement. These are the variants and probably it will take some time. I stress that UN participation and Russian mediation -- this course has not yet been fully exhausted.
