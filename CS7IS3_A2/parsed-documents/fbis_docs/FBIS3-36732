Recordings are usually shown at 0600 [0300 GMT] and 0900 local time, but at those times this morning a testcard appeared accompanied by audio of Uzbek radio. Programs later were broadcast according to schedule. An RIA correspondent was told at the television and radio company of Uzbekistan that this was done by the Ostankino company, which has announced cuts in broadcasting from 19 to 8.5-9 hours per day, because of a shortage of funds and debts to communication workers.
