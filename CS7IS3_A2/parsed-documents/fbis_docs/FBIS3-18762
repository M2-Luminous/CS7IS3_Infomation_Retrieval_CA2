According to the minister, the Belgian Army has reached the limit of its possibilities. It may well be that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has great admiration for the work done by the Belgian UN troops in Somalia, Rwanda, Croatia, and Bosnia, but other countries also must be approached for once, said the minister. The minister was reacting to a report in the British SUNDAY TIMES claiming that, once again, Belgium will be asked to contribute together with Great Britain, France, and Sweden, another 5,000 UN troops for Bosnia. That is roughly half the figure requested by General Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He believes these extra troops are necessary to maintain the cease-fires in Sarajevo and central Bosnia in the long term. Following fierce debates within the British Government, London said it would be prepared to send an additional 1,200 troops to Bosnia to reinforce the 2,500 British troops already there. However, London wants British soldiers to be accompanied by UN troops sent by other Western countries. [passage omitted]
