In reaction to a recent helicopter crash on Futenma Marine Corps Air Station [MCAS], the mayor strongly urged the disclosure of the investigation reports and an early reversion of Futenma MCAS, stressing "accidents happen repeatedly because U.S. bases are there." In reply, Foreign Minister Hata said: "We really understand Okinawan people's feelings. To ease the people's uneasy feelings, we would like to continue our efforts to meet their demands." In addition to the mayor, the Ginowan delegation included municipal assembly Speaker Shunshin Nakamura, Chairman Seiei Chinen, and Vice Chairman Shinsho Chibana of the municipal assembly special committee on U.S. base problems. Delegation members strongly protested the accident, saying: "U.S. Forces are continuing military exercises as if they pay no regard to Okinawan people's anger at repeated accidents. The Japanese Government must bend constant efforts to reversion of U.S. bases." They then petitioned for the disclosure of investigation reports, an immediate halt to flight training in residential areas, and the early reversion of Futenma MCAS.
