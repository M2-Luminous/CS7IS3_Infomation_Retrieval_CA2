The date of the presidential summit could be announced on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow told BNS. The embassy official named April 30 as a potential date for the summit but he said that it was not for sure. Currently, Latvian and Russian negotiators are coordinating a supplementary protocol to the agreement on social rights of Russian military retirees, said the spokesman. "There is a hope that the protocol will be approved as an annex to the agreement," he said. The protocol, which Latvians submitted to the Russian delegation this week in Jurmala, Latvia, foresees an option for demobilized servicemen to repatriate and a chance for Russia to participate in the setup of a repatriation foundation. During the trip of Ulmanis to Moscow, he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin are expected to sign the package of agreements on Russian troop withdrawal, including sections on Aug. 31 as withdrawal deadline; on temporary operation of radar facility at Skrunda in Latvia; on protection of withdrawing troops; and on social rights of retired servicemen. Latvia wants to amend the section on war pensioners, while Russia insists on the signature of the whole package together.
