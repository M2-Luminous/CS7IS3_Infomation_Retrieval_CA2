The modification of financial policy on the part of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) was a logical measure to prevent an overheating of the economy and to correct the bubble phenomenon, but, as financial markets become globalized and increasingly affected by computerization, the aftereffects are of an unexpected magnitude. Since the world economy as a whole is just nearing signs of a recovery, the advanced nations face the need to seek policy coordination to prevent a chain of hikes in U.S. interest rates. In response to the combined 0.5-percent hike in the federal funds (FF)--which influence short-term market rates--in two stages by the FRB, 30-year government bonds, which serve as an index for long-term U.S. interest rates, temporarily rose to 7.4 percent. The hike in U.S. interest rates has caused New York Stock Exchange indices to drop 10 percent from their recent peaks. Turmoil in U.S. securities markets has adversely impacted not only markets of advanced nations such as Japan and Europe, but newly emerging markets found in Asia, Central and South America, the former East European nations and Africa to which large sums of U.S. capital were flowing. [passage omitted] The fact that changes in policy in the United States had a worldwide ripple effect attests to the fact that national barriers no longer exist in terms of the flow of capital. Moreover, the computer dependence of markets has had a tendency to amplify fluctuations. Such circumstances make it almost impossible for monetary authorities of the various nations to intervene and shield their markets from the effects of rising U.S. interest rates. The problem is that the effects of those policy changes have impacted on the Japanese and German economies which hold the key to future worldwide economic recovery. Now that there is the fear that foreign capital once flowing into Germany will flow out of that country, there is the possibility that the German Federal Bank will hesitate to continue with its policy of easing restrictions on the money markets. The situation in Germany could very well serve to shackle monetary easing policies of the other European continental nations. Rising long-term interest rates are a headache for Japan, too, where it appears that the economy is ready to bounce off from the bottom of the cycle. The seven advanced nations (G-7) have no choice but to reconstitute their efforts at policy coordination. Lurking under the surface relative to the current monetary turmoil is the huge recurring U.S. international balance of payments deficit. Reducing the international balance of payments deficit will require the Clinton administration to cut federal government deficit spending and encourage a reversal in the savings rates which has fallen to 4 percent of earnings. Japan must clearly enunciate tax reform primarily encompassing an income tax cut and a future hike in consumption tax. If government deficits should rise in an uncontrolled manner, the pressure on long-term interest rates will rise. We must also launch a market-opening plan of substance as a means to overcome Japan-U.S. economic friction which can become the cause for securities market turmoil. Unfavorable news impacting on securities markets such as President and Mrs. Clintons' Whitewater scandal, Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation and tension in the Korean peninsula are intensifying. Political factors coming into play just as world economic tides are about to change make securities markets more susceptible to chain reactions. This is the very reason why there is a need for renewed coordination by monetary authorities at the G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting scheduled for the end of June.
