In a recent screening of 600 applicants to the Kwazulu Police in Empangeni, A Durban laboratory tested 54 as HIV positive. A doctor involved in the testing estimated that the number of people infected with the virus would increase the closer one came to the Mozambique border. A doctor working at a clinic in Zululand said one in three of the soldiers he treated for sexually transmitted diseases was HIV positive. ``It is horrific what is really happening and the government is not prepared to discuss the problem,'' the doctor said. He estimated that 8 percent of the population in the Matubatuba area, mainly those in 18 to 28 age groups, was HIV positive and this was developing into ``a massive problem''. The SADF Medical Service has stepped up its Aids awareness campaign, which began in 1988. Medical staff director of the SADF Medical Service, Ken Ingham, was reluctant to give exact figures of HIV positive cases in affected units in Zululand, but said they were not as high as those in the surrounding population. Brigadier Ingham said soldiers had limited access to the public, usually only on weekend passes, and this was why the number of HIV soldiers was lower than in the surrounding population. ``That's because soldiers get AIDS from civilians, not from other soldiers,''Brigadier Ingham said. He said the campaign was working better in the army than in the community because ``no-one can force members of the public to listen'' Northern Zululand is recognised by Aids researchers as ``One of the worst areas in the country'' and the HIV virus is spreading rapidly. Doctors say there is a lot of cross-border movement between South Africa and Mozambique and the virus is being brought south.
