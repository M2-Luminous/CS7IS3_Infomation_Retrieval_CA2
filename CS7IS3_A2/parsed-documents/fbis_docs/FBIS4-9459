They said the main question of the elections will be whether the citizens will want to replace the coalition with the socialist, or with the liberal parties. Both chairmen have high hopes that the four-party liberal bloc (SZDSZ, FIDESZ, Entrepreneurs Party, and the Agrarian Federation) will score good results in the elections. However, while Orban would, in the interest of an election victory, be ready to state that the liberal parties would only govern together, Peto did not consider this justified. According to the SZDSZ chairman, a government should definitely be formed to replace the current one following the elections, as otherwise new elections would have to be announced, and this would mean that the Hungarian Democratic Forum-led government would continue to lead the country until January. Peto also denied that the SZDSZ is holding any kind of coalition coordination talks with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The evaluation of the Socialist Party was one of the main issues of the remarks made by the two politicians at the national meeting of liberal groups in Budapest. Orban again excluded cooperation between the FIDESZ and the MSZP, partly because, in is view, the change in generation has not taken place within the MSZP.
