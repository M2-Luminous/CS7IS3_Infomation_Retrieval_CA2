Dehaene had said Saturday that his centre-left coalition would remain in office despite the departure of his deputy Guy Coeme, who stepped down after being implicated in a scandal over a 1988 government helicopter contract. A statement from Belgium's King Albert II said Elio Di Rupo, culture minister of the country's French community, was named to replace Coeme as deputy prime minister, minister of communications and public enterprises. Magda De Galan, former minister of social integration, health and environment, was named minister of social affairs. Jacques Santkin, a member of parliament, was named minister of social integration, health and environment. Jean-Maurice Dehousse will be in charge of infrastructure while conserving his post as minister of science policy, the statement said.
