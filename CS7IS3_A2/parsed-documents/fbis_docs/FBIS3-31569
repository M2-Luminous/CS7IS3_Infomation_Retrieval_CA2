Reception is fair. Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "today, on the 17th day of the heaviest offensive by the Serb aggressor, the town is under attack from all sides. Some 5,000 chetniks have been brought from other fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina to capture this area. They have been bringing in new military equipment by road and by helicopter. The heavy artillery from the surrounding Bihac hills has been systematically destroying Bihac and Cazin. Heavy fighting has again been under way on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, and the chetnik artillery guns have been pounding the defense lines since this morning." In his report from Maglaj, Smajl Terzic says that "there is an abundance here of snow and Russian-made shells, though fortunately only one in 10 explodes, fired at the suffering people in Sije, Mrkotic, Kalosevic, Tesanj, Maglaj, and the free Teslic and Doboj territories. During the 37th day of the offensive, the [Serb] aggressor is bringing in new forces, and conducting mobilization of Muslims under the age of 16. They are being forced into the mine fields and if they resist, they are shot on the spot." Reporting from Gornji Vakuf, Akif Agic says that "Croatian artillery has been pounding the villages near the town. Tanks from (?Kupe) and (?Darovac) have been firing selectively at civilian targets. The center of Gornji Vakuf has also been shelled with howitzers, mortars, and tanks." He says that "the HVO has been destroyed, and now the Croatian Army is assuming the role of the attacker." An unidentified correspondent reports from Kalesija that "fierce artillery attacks on Donje Vukovije near Tuzla airport have continued today. The [Serb] aggressor's artillery attacks are under way as we report and the citizens of Vukovije are in their cellars, where they have been for days. The enemy is firing from Mt. Majevica with howitzers, and if these intense attacks continue, Vukovije will be razed to the ground." Mira Salihodzic reports from Olovo that "this afternoon the [Serb] enemy artillery has been targeting civilian areas in the Krivaja River valley in retaliation for the losses that the chetniks suffered in successful commando operations over the last few days." She says that "large convoys of enemy forces from the direction of Han Pijesak and Sokolac have been moving hurriedly. Enemy armored-mechanized and infantry forces have been concentrating around Olovo."
