Whom do you want to see in the Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? [Casini] The demands made of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the coalition, must be possible, not patently absurd. We CCD [Christian Democratic Center] members are asking him to follow in the footsteps of Antonio Segni [former president and 1950's agriculture minister], a rich landowner who pushed through the agriculture reform. Berlusconi must form the government and put the antitrust law issue on the agenda. Having said that, he may count on our full support. [Correspondent] But Bossi says that the League is the first party, so it is not a foregone conclusion that Berlusconi will necessarily be the next prime minister. You are in the same alliance, what is your answer to that? [Casini] It is news to me that Bossi has 51 percent of seats in parliament. When the head of state summons the parliamentary groups, each one will put forward its nominee. We will be putting forward Berlusconi's name. [Correspondent] What does the CCD want for itself in the next government? [Casini] First of all, we are going to aim for inclusion in the program a number of essential conditions which are close to the hearts of Catholics: concrete legislation in favor of the family, pluralism in education -- with equal treatment for the public and private sectors -- and a real boost to political commitment in favor of the south. Naturally, we will also aim to safeguard another principle: National unity cannot be questioned. I have also heard talk of purges in the civil service and the RAI [state broadcasting corporation]. While those who are clearly inept and dishonest must of course go, there should be no discrimination of any sort against those who are honest and professionally competent. [Correspondent] You say that national unity as a principle is not open to discussion. That will set you at loggerheads with the League, even though that party is one of your allies. [Casini] We refuse to question the nation's indissolubility. On the other hand, for example, fiscal federalism supplemented by a solidarity fund is part of our program. [Correspondent] Those are your demands as far as the program is concerned. Now, I agree the DC [Christian Democratic Party] is finished... but you cannot expect me to believe that the CCD does not want any ministries for itself. [Casini] Our demands will be in proportion to the expertise we can provide and our weight in terms of numbers... To give you an example, I notice a number of newspapers mention my name as a candidate for the health ministry, which is unquestionably a sector of primary importance. Apart from the fact that I am not at all willing to take on a government post, I would not dream of becoming a public health hazard. I know absolutely nothing about health. [Correspondent] So who will be joining the government from the CCD? Mastella, Fumagalli, D'Onofrio? [Casini] I have no specific names in mind, but there is no point in discussing them yet anyway. The best thing is for the prime minister designate to decide on the composition of his government. [Correspondent] You did not show all this sense of fair play when you were in the DC. You must have some preferences at least as to which ministries you would like. [Casini] Those which have some relevance to our values. I could mention institutional reform, education, or defense, where I am against the idea of placing any generals. Generals are just fine inside the officers' mess or helping parliamentary committees with their expertise. [Correspondent] [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini has repeated that "[former Fascist dictator] Mussolini is the greatest statesman of the century." What is your response to that? [Casini] I am in total disagreement with Fini over that, at least as much as I agree with many of the other opinions he has expressed in the past few days. In fact I will be even more explicit. I can see Fini and us working together over the next few years to finally build a popular, moderate, political grouping. But for my money, the greatest statesman this century was [postwar DC leader] De Gasperi... [Correspondent] Do you see Fini renouncing Fascism? [Casini] What I saw in Fini was a break with the past when the National Alliance was created. Besides, I notice there is no "Fascist Renewal" in Italy, while there is a Communist Renewal. [Correspondent] Mino Martinazzoli's Popular Party is in a crisis. Are they waiting for somebody to go knock on their door? [Casini] That is of no interest to us. What is of interest to us, on the other hand, is that the Popular Party [PPI] should change course. Indeed many PPI members tell us: You made a mistake, but you were right. I answer that we still disagree over the method, but I hope to see a rapprochement between them and the pole for freedom.
