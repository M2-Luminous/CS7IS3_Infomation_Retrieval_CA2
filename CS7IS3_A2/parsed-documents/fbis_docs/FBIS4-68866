After a three-year marathon a new Constitution of the Republic of Belarus was adopted. And on 15 March the constitution went into effect. The desperate attempt at opposition by the Belarusian People's Front (BNF) and others of this ilk, as was expected, was not crowned with success. Moreover, it clearly demonstrated the impotence of the Belarusian national-radicals, who in this way decreased their political rating to an extremely low point. The attempt of the BNF and the strike committees that they encouraged to bring out the workers of Minsk plants onto the square on cold February days remained just that--an attempt. At the same time the Supreme Soviet, which finally came to believe in its own legitimacy, found a way of overcoming the problem of a quorum--a vote was taken by name ballot in the course of three days. The vote was on whether or not to be a presidential republic. As a result, more than two-thirds of the deputy corps came out for a strong presidential authority. Members of the BNF opposition in the Supreme Soviet, as could be expected, did not take part in the voting by name ballot--they, who not very long ago worked for a presidential form of government, today, when their ratings are falling, are categorically against a strong president. In alliance with them in nonacceptance of the presidency, and their most powerful opponent, was Sergey Gaydukevich--the leader of the People's Movement of Belarus (NDB), which unites within its ranks members of 25 republic parties, movements, and organizations. He, claiming in perspective to the first role in the republic, also understands that today is not yet his time! Nevertheless, a faction of the NDB in parliament (and this, according to a data list, has more than 100 persons) almost entirely voted for the introduction of the post of president. This fact showed eloquently that the most powerful and influential in parliament, and probably in the republic as well, remains as before the unofficial "party of the Council of Ministers," whose first authority is Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. A month and a half remain before the election of the president of the republic. Named among the candidates are Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich, speaker of the Supreme Soviet Myacheslaw Hryb, the tireless fighter against Belarusian corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko, yesterday's speaker, Stanislav Shushkevich, leader of the Party of National Accord, Gennadiy Karpenko, mayor of the city, and the nationalist and leader of the People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak. It is difficult to say which of them will be able to get the support of the powerful. One thing is clear: It will be a person who, after ending up in the position of president, will be managed by those whose authority he will personify and defend. Perhaps most likely a person who gets along with Kebich's team. However, there is one "but." It is the support of the candidate for the president of Belarus on the part of Russia. Russia's game can significantly correct an election campaign that is predicted on the basis of internal factors: Moscow is interested in seeing in Minsk a rudder of authority that is "eastern" in orientation, so that Belarus will at no time become a real foreign state for Russia. At the beginning of the integration process of the two Slavic countries, Moscow was visited first by representatives of the government of the republic--to coordinate the positions of the agreement on the unification of monetary systems, then by a delegation of the opposition headed by Zyanon Paznyak, who in many ways seems to be supported by Yegor Gaydar, and later by an NDB delegation that was received hospitably in Russia's State Duma. All these visits to Moscow were followed by attempts by Belarusian politicians to go through a preliminary political "inspection of a prospective bride" for "an older brother." It is quite probable that Russia's sluggishness on the question of a real unification of monetary systems can be prolonged if not to the end then at least until the beginning of the presidential elections in Belarus. It is quite likely that by that time Russia will also clarify its position regarding its protege for the post of president of the neighboring country, which is extremely dependent on it economically and financially. But in order that Belarus not forget its dependence on its eastern neighbor, it was given a good reminder when Russia publicly announced that it was stopping deliveries of gas to the republic until debts are repaid. The debts were hurriedly paid in several days. At the same time, political activeness in the republic can be seen with the naked eye. And it is not only the capital that is active. In western Belarus, where the bulk of the citizens of the republic who are of Polish nationality live, the Polish Democratic Party was established and operates actively under the influence of the Union of Poles. In western Polesye, with the very active participation of activists of the sociocultural association Polisyse, a network of electoral associations has been established in the form of the regional sociopolitical organizations Brest Choice-94, Pinsk Choice-94, etc., whose staff has been joined by the most prestigious industrialists, bankers, entrepreneurs, and intelligentsia of the region. In Vitebsk Oblast the Russian-directed Slavic Council Party Belaya Rus is announcing itself more and more actively, and the main forces and structures of the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus--the native sister of the Russian party of Zhirinovskiy--are located in the Gomel region. As for the old parties--the Social-Democratic Gromada, the NDPB [National Democratic Party of Belarus], the Christian Party, the Party of National Accord--they are undergoing a crisis. A majority of them were unable to leave the asphalt of Minsk and go to the periphery. The former alliance with the BNF also left the imprint of nationalism on them, which today is extremely unpopular among the people and which was promoted by BNF announcements that promised, in the event the BNF came to power, to introduce a law concerning the ban on professions, and to build Belarus as a national Belarusian state, etc. Entirely possible is a variant in which the sociopolitical structures of the Belarus regions that carry unquestionable weight there unite in behalf of their common success and attempt to bring out their own candidate for president, especially if this candidate is not from the old clan and finds mutual understanding with the Russians. But the fact that the oblast principle of distribution of power in the republic still has force was also shown by the elections of two new deputy chairmen (until now only a first deputy has been elected) of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus. The candidates for the posts of deputies were not considered in political parliamentary factions but in oblast deputy groups. As a result: The speaker of the parliament, Hryb, is a representative of the Vitebsk region, his first deputy is from Minsk, and the other two are from the Gomel region and the Brest region respectively. However, such a balanced division of the republic's power, in the opinion of Belarusian political scientists, is a guarantee of preservation of the integrity of the republic.
