FBIS4-28197 "dreas111_h_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Singapore Kantor Statement on WTO Said `Incorrect' Kantor Statement on WTO Said `Incorrect' BK0806122494 Singapore Singapore Broadcasting Corporation in English 1100 GMT 8 Jun 94 BK0806122494 Singapore Singapore Broadcasting Corporation English BFN [Text] Singapore says U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's statement that the republic has not contacted the United States about hosting the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization [WTO] is incorrect. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Singapore's permanent representative to the UN [in Geneva], Mr. Kesavapany, had informed all GATT contracting parties, including the U.S. The Singapore Embassy in Washington had also taken up the matter with a senior American trade official. According to REUTERS news agency, Mr. Kantor has again objected to Singapore's hosting the WTO meeting. Mr. Kantor first raised his objection last month although U.S. officials said he was expressing his personal views. The Foreign Ministry spokesman also said REUTERS' assertion that Singapore [words indistinct] the entire bill which is a departure from conference protocols was also incorrect. It is a normal practice for the host country to meet all the organizational expenses plus additional costs incurred by the GATT Secretariat for meetings outside its premises in Geneva. The recent GATT ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, the Uruguay Round conference in Uruguay, and other GATT meetings in Brussels, Belgium and Canada have all followed this practice.
