Frederick Chiluba also visited the Santiago Hotel, Cuba's first five-star hotel, and Santiago de Cuba's modern hospital which has capacity for more than 1,000 beds, which since its opening has treated 500,000 patients in 28 different specialties. [Begin recording, in English with superimposed translations into Spanish] [Reporter] Mr. President, which have been the main topics of your conversations with the Cuban government? [Chiluba] That we share a lot in common as members of the Nonaligned Movement and, of course, of the Third World. We face similar economic difficulties and therein lies the need for us to cooperate. Because of the very heavy social investments made in the fields of health and education, we have benefited tremendously. There are Cuban people working in our country who are helping to improve the living standard of our comrades there. So I think our coming here is intended further to strengthen the relations between the two countries. We consider it a matter of life or death that small nations need to cooperate and move together to be able to face a bigger world. We are happy to be here. [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. [end recording] At this moment, Frederick Chiluba and his official delegation are on their way back to Havana after having met with Zambian students who reside here in Santiago de Cuba.
