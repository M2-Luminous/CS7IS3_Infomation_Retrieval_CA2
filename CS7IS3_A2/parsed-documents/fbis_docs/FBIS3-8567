He added that unilateral steps by one or the other side would not solve the situation. Slovak Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna told journalists on Tuesday that the Slovak Government disagreed with joining the settlement of Sidonia, in the village of Horne Srnie, to the Czech Republic as has been proposed by the joint Czech-Slovak commission dealing with the delimitation of the common border. According to initial recommendations by the two countries' interior ministers the settlement U Sabotu should be joined to Slovakia and Sidonia to the Czech Republic. Given the fact that the Slovak Government yesterday did not approve the commission's proposal in its full wording, it is now up to the Czech and Slovak governments to solve controversial questions, Tuchyna said yesterday. Slovak Government spokesman Ondrej Hanko told journalists Tuesday that the government had charged the commission with discussing other possibilities of compensation with the Czech side.
