A vociferous group of ANC [African National Congress] supporters blocked their entry to the college building. The DP leader in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, Mr. Tony Leon, held an impromptu meeting with the students representative council and the college administration. The DP then decided to withdraw from the campus. Mr. Leon said their being barred from both the Good Hope College and the Peninsula Technikon in Belville earlier today made a mockery of the Electoral Act.
