In a document submitted to the National Assembly, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry noted that the Republic of Korea's Constitution stipulates that the Republic shall consist of the Korean peninsula and its adjoining islands: That the basic inter- Korean agreement put into force in February 1992 provides for economic exchanges and cooperation between North and South Korea such as joint resources development, merchandise trade as internal transactions of the Korean people and joint ventures; and that the U.N. Charter expressly permits racial self-determination. When West Germany subscribed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the GATT recognized inter-German trade as an internal matter of the German people, the ministry said. The German case set a precedent for the two Koreas, and there is no need for GATT recognition of inter-Korean trade as internal business dealings of the Korean people, it added. Some foreign countries are moving toward regarding inter-Korean trade as international trade subject to tariffs.
