According to Klaus, the difference between his and Havel's statements merely lies in a sterner and a less stern formulation. The prime minister believes that, had one not started to "dissect" these formulations, the Czech Republic definitely would not suffer any damage. Klaus is "fully convinced that there will not be any [NATO] air strikes." He characterized his view that the core to the settlement of the conflict lay in an internal agreement as "the sole correct approach." During the weekend, President Havel supported NATO's threat of air strikes in the event of the Bosnian Serbs' failure to withdraw their heavy artillery deployed around Sarajevo by 21 February. Prime Minister Klaus, on the other hand, said last Thursday [10 February] that the Czech Government and the Civic Democratic Party were afraid of an external intervention in Bosnia. Klaus noted at his briefing on Monday that the situation in Bosnia remained a subject of discussion all over the world. "When we emphasize that the core of the solution lies in a domestic agreement and that any external involvement can only be a supplement, this is not, I think, in contradiction with anything [Havel says] and is the sole correct approach," he said literally. Deputy Prime Minister and Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] chairman Jan Kalvoda said on Monday, in reply to a question from RUDE PRAVO, that the [Czech Government's] position on the Bosnian conflict ought to be discussed by the coalition's Foreign Policy Coordination Council, which comprises, among others, the president, the chairmen of coalition parties, and the minister of foreign affairs. Prime Minister Klaus rejected this proposal the same day when talking to reporters. He said that a united stand on Bosnia was a problem only for those who were trying "to find at any price a contradiction where there is not any." According to Kalvoda, the body for foreign policy coordination was established to deal precisely with issues such as this one. "In matters such as this, no constitutional body can implement a policy different from the coalition," Kalvoda said. Replying to another question from RUDE PRAVO--whether the government should adopt a statement of principle on Bosnia--Kalvoda said that it was a supremely political issue which constitutional body delivers its opinion on the matter. "However, any constitutional body should always do so on the basis of the coalition's decision. I do not think right now that the government should adopt a statement [at its next meeting] on Wednesday [16 February]," he said. According to ODA Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa, such a statement of principle could be adopted by parliament. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Bosnia on Friday [11 February] is not a statement that would be changed from one day to the next, M. Skolil, chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Section, said on Monday when responding to RUDE PRAVO's question of whether differences existed in the interpretation of the government's talks on the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. "Our diplomats have been instructed in accordance with the ministry statement. It is not the task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on a discussion that may be taking place among our constitutional officials. We present the official stand of the Czech Republic per se. It is the binding standpoint of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Czech Republic," Skolil said. [passage omitted]
