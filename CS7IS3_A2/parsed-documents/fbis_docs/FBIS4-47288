Laboratory specimens were formed from 100% Ovruch quartzite on a laboratory hydraulic press under 50 N/sq mm of pressure and fired at 1360, 1380, and 1420�C for 6 h to effect different degrees of quartz degeneration. Two different compositions, No. 1 and No. 2, were formulated, depending on the additives used in the refractory mass. For both compositions, density decreased while apparent porosity and compressive strength increased as the firing temperature increased. The greatest proportion of residual quartz was found in the refractory compositions fired at 1360�C, and dinas No. 1 had more residual quartz than dinas No. 2. Therefore, dinas specimens fired at this temperature were used throughout the rest of the study. Thermal resistance was determined by measuring the thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, bending strength, and shear modulus of the dinas at temperatures ranging from 20 to 1300�C. These data showed that the thermal resistance of the specimens sharply increased as the average temperature increased, especially at temperatures above 600�C. Moreover, dinas No. 1 had greater thermal resistance than dinas No 2. The slag resistance of the dinas specimens was then tested by drilling a hole through the center of the cube-shaped test specimens, heating them in a Kryptol furnace to a temperature of 1670�C, and allowing melted slag of typical composition to drip through the hole. The same test was performed on specimens of DM industrial dinas and MKV-72 mullite-fused alumina. The specimens were then cross-sectioned and the area of slag impregnation measured. Dinas No. 1 specimens had the greatest slag resistance; 25% of their area was penetrated by the slag. Dinas No. 2 specimens had 30% of their area penetrated by slag, and the other refractory specimens were completely impregnated. Petrographic analysis of specimen cross- sections revealed the presence of a distinct three-zone structure consisting of a least-changed zone, a transitional zone, and a reaction zone. The experimental data were used by the Krasnogorov refractories plant to manufacture a test batch of standard-size dinas lining materials, which were tried out in the 0.3-t laboratory steelmaking vessel at the Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy. Blowing time was 10-12 min., and the average post- blowing melt temperature ranged from 1600 to 1720�C, averaging 1660�C. In comparison with the DM dinas and MKV-72 linings, dinas No. 1 proved to have the greatest overall resistance to the erosive effects of the blowing process in every respect and in nearly every section of the vessel, except for the cylindrical part and the throat, where the MKV-72 was better. The dinas lining also eroded more uniformly than the other linings. The lining wear pattern was typical for that of oxygen process steelmaking vessels. Depending on process temperatures and times, the maximum wear rate of dinas linings should be comparable to that of basic refractory linings. It is anticipated that considerable economies in raw materials and improvements in steel quality will be realized by converting to acid refractory linings such as dinas in oxygen- process steelmaking.
