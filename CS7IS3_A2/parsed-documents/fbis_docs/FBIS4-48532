This follows an unsuccessful application by the state on Friday morning to re-open its case. State prosecutor Mr Koos Pretorius wanted to recall the investigating officer in the case, Col Neels van Wyk, to lead further evidence on why the accused should be denied bail. Magistrate C J van Heerden dismissed the application because the provision in the Criminal Procedures Act relied on by the state was for criminal proceedings and not for bail applications. He said, in granting the accused bail, the state had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities the men's release would not be in the interests of justice. Mr van Heerden said the state had not proved that any of the accused were directly involved in the bombings. He said the state's submission that no further bombings had taken place since the men's arrest was not necessarily indicative of their guilt. Proceedings were adjourned for discussion of bail terms.
