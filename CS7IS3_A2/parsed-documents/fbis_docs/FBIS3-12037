This confirms that President Carlos Menem is resorting to the Armed Forces to control the people's mood. Intervention in Jujuy has been on the official agenda for more than a week: Intelligence evaluations confirm the existence of the basic factors for a social outbreak in that province. Jujuy was the main item on the agenda at the latest weekly meeting of the intelligence service chiefs at the Armed Forces Joint Command headquarters. The meeting was not held by coincidence: The main role is being played by the Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence services despite the presence of Secretariat for State Intelligence (SIDE) chief Hugo Anzorreguy and the National Border Police and the National Prefecture intelligence chiefs. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf chairs the meeting on behalf of the government. The evaluations show that Jujuy has all the symptoms of an impending social outbreak and the national government is not about to endure another situation like that in Santiago del Estero. Beside sending former Deputy Luis "Quito" Martinez as a political auditor, the government will reportedly send new emissaries: There is talk of sending an Interior Ministry official and several Economy Ministry officials, but it is not clear if their mission will be to help the administration of Peronist Governor Carlos Ficoseco or to study the need for a future intervention. Ficoseco is confronting the provincial legislature which approved a 50 percent salary increase for public employees. Ficoseco is in a difficult situation: If he vetoes the increase, the demonstration by the Front of State Workers Union scheduled for 29 March could become a repeat of the Santiago del Estero drama; if he approves it, the fiscal program will collapse. In addition to popular discontent and the political crisis, there is the suspicion of generalized corruption. Among the intelligence reports are allegations -- impossible to prove -- of bribes as high as 50,000 pesos per legislator to vote for the Fiscal Pact. These bribes were reportedly paid in 10 installments of 5,000 pesos. This situation reportedly resulted in conflict when on 10 December 1993 the legislative branch was renewed and the new legislators demanded similar treatment while the outgoing ones demanded payment of the outstanding payments. The report, whether true or not, would be laughable if it were not staged with an extremely serious social situation as its backdrop. Whatever the outcome of the Jujuy crisis, the case confirms that the executive branch has decided to charge the Armed Forces with the overseeing the mood of the civilian population. Government officials this week denied the possibility of changing the Defense and Interior Security Laws to legalize this situation: they seem to prefer the illegal method. This situation is so real that members of the Armed Forces disseminated on 25 March a false version to cover their activities: They told the media that the government had asked for information on criminal gangs that include former military members operating in the great Buenos Aires area. Perhaps this same story will be used by the intelligence services chiefs who will be summoned by Congress to explain the situation, but it is far from the truth. Military sources consulted by PAGINA/12 explained in simple terms the meaning of the new military role. One high military officer told this daily: "The president cannot permit a repetition of what happened in Santiago del Estero, when nobody informed him that the provincial government was stealing, that public employees were furious, and that the provincial police were unwilling to do anything about it. One should not make a myth of the word `intelligence.' The president wants information on the social situation, he wants to know what is happening among the people. He wants the 120th Battalion to tell him if public employees want to burn everything down." What governor would not like the concurrence of the military chiefs? Army and Navy sources told this daily that their intelligence services were basically dismantled years ago. One source said: "We dismantled the internal network in 1983 and 1984. It is easier than one thinks: Just cut off the money. This is how the network of information and civilian agents was dismantled. Many became criminals, for example, Maximo Nicoletti, the leader of the super gang." The same source said the intelligence services were dismantled because "they were a political weapon, always involved in skirmishes between Peronists and Radicals, that created more problems than results." Other sources have suggested that the Armed Forces never gave up their intelligence activities. The source added: "Colonel (Jorge) Mina, the chief of the Army Intelligence Service, was about to ask for his retirement last year because his unit was to have been cut from 2,200 to 900 men. With this new policy there will be no reduction and Mina will almost certainly be promoted to general." He is symbolic of the past: his career is enmeshed in the 601st Battalion of Army Intelligence, which was one of the most active units of the illegal repression during the military dictatorship. It is again holding the watch. The Armed Forces have found another way to become involved in watching over the provinces: The Interior Ministry has asked the Armed Forces Joint Command to form a rapid-deployment force to repress eventual social outbreaks. This unit comprises members of the National Border Police, the Naval Prefecture, and the Federal Police. The idea emerged from the Interior Ministry after President Carlos Menem called on the cabinet and all security organizations last January to implement greater intelligence activities to detect any sign of insurrection. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf asked Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, the Armed Forces Joint Command chief, for technical assistance in preparing a rapid-deployment force. The other security organizations view the request with suspicion. One member told a reporter: "They will first advise on the formation of the force, they will then intervene in the preparation of the plan, and this is how they will take over the operation." There are practical reasons to support this belief. Under the Interior Security Law, the Armed Forces can and must support the security organizations in their functions. The rapid-deployment forces will probably be transported in military planes and will be fed, housed, and receive medical assistance in military garrisons. It is not difficult to imagine that an officer of the Armed Forces Joint Command will be in charge of coordinating the operations. There is also a political reason: Ruckauf may use it to overcome Defense Ministry objections to the creation of the rapid-deployment force, which it sees just as a way to buy weapons and new equipment for the National Border Police and the Prefecture. In other words, the Interior Ministry is taking a swipe at the Defense Ministry. The meetings of the intelligence services have more political importance than practical results. An intelligence meeting is more like a poker game in which each participant eyes the other and measures how they are lying to him and how much he can hide. It also serves to communicate the official decision and to maintain the military attention. Each service then sends its report to the government through its own channels. A general evaluation can be made right there: The Santiago del Estero social outbreak -- which coincided with the armed insurrection in Chiapas, Mexico -- lead to the president's appeal to military intelligence. It has created an unofficial manual of pointers from which to determine where an outbreak could occur next. The manual states that outbreaks occur when a serious social situation -- like the case of public employees who did not get their already low salaries -- is followed by a political crisis which allows the population to go out of control. This is almost an example of Marxist analysis: the late Louis Althusser would have written the formula that the crisis came when an economic conflict was "intensified" by a political conflict. Perhaps the intelligence agents have not read it but the provincial governors should start doing it.
