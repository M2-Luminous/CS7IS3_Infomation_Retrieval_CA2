The same fate befell the proposal of Deputy Vadim Kolesnichenko, who proposed that Yuriy Meshkov be granted the appropriate powers to carry out his election promises (entry into the ruble zone, dual citizenship, payment of pensions in karbovantsi, and so on). A debate only developed during the examination of the resignation statement of Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council. His resignation was not accepted. It was decided to examine this issue only after Nikolay Bagrov returns from his vacation, which he took when he lost the struggle with Yuriy Meshkov for the presidential seat.
