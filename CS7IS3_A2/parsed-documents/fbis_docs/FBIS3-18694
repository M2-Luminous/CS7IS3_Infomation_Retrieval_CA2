Here is Audrius Braukyla with more details about it: [Braukyla] Efforts by the Baltic states to become members of the European Union were assessed positively by the Nordic countries, Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said. Together with the colleagues from Latvia and Estonia, the Lithuanian delegation headed by him held a discussion today with the prime ministers of the Nordic states. According to Linkevicius, [word indistinct] especially strong political support by the Nordic countries to the Baltic states in the spheres of security and economic cooperation. The problem of the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia, which was the main topic of discussion, has been reflected in the statement made today by the five Nordic states. It stresses, among other things, that it is important that the Russian troops were withdrawn by the date that had been fixed by Russia itself--that is by 31 August 1994. Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a news conference, stated categorically that the withdrawal of the troops was the norm of international law and that it should not be linked with any other issues. Answering a question regarding what the reaction of the Nordic countries, and especially Sweden, would be in case a danger to the independence of the Baltic states arose, the head of the Swedish Government said that the danger to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would also mean the same danger to the Nordic countries, as well as a danger to all of Europe. In this case, not only the Nordic states would have to react, but also the entire international community. However, according to Bildt, it is too early to think about direct military assistance by the Nordic states to the Baltic countries in the event of aggression. The observers think that cooperation between the Baltic states and Nordic countries based on the formula five plus three is gaining momentum. According to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, the Baltic states are absolutely satisfied at the moment with the assistance received from the Nordic states. He said that today's meeting was an important stage in the implementation of specific projects. This is Audrius Braukyla for Lithuanian Radio from Stockholm.
