His Excellency brother 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives, Republic of Yemen. Greetings; I received with appreciation and concern the Yemeni House of Representatives' message on 30 May 1994, conveyed to us by Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, permanent representative of the Republic of Yemen to the Arab League. I would like to stress to your excellency that the developments in the Republic of Yemen have always been the concern of the Arab League because the strength and stability of Yemen, as well as the safety of its people, are a support for the Arab nation and joint Arab action. Proceeding from this, I dispatched a mission to the Republic of Yemen on 4 March 1994. Furthermore, the 101st session of the Arab League Council issued a statement on 26 March 1994, affirming its deep concern over the developments in Yemen and urging the Yemeni political leaders to double their efforts to resolve differences in a way that strengthens unity and spreads stability in Yemen and security in the whole region. Also, the Arab League Council adopted in its extraordinary session Resolution No. 5,409 on 7 May 1994, a copy of which is attached to this letter. In this resolution, the Arab League Council called for an immediate cease-fire and ending the deterioration in Yemen to safeguard its unity. Within this framework, their majesties and excellencies the Arab kings and presidents, as well as Arab national organizations and personalities, continued their efforts to stop Arab bloodshed in sisterly Yemen and to preserve its resources and achievements. I also sent a high-level delegation to Sanaa where it met with His Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and a number of ranking Yemeni figures. I am still exerting efforts and holding contacts in accordance with the abovementioned Arab League Council resolution, using all the potentials of the Arab League Secretariat to achieve this noble objective. I appeal to you -- in light of what is dictated on you by your responsibility -- to exert efforts and do what is appropriate and effective to implement the resolution of Arab legitimacy. I ask God to grant us all success for the wellbeing and safety of the sisterly Yemeni Arab people. God knows our intention, and He leads us to the right path. God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. [Signed] Secretary General Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid
