Minister Peres did not specify the content of the proposals, although he noted that they focused on the need to conduct negotiations in three interlinked and interdependent spheres: peace, security, and border pullback. As for negotiating venues, Minister Peres does not think substantive negotiations can be held on what he termed the narrow path of the Washington talks. He further said the negotiations should be opened up to high-ranking levels to the extent possible, and that they should be conducted away from the public eye. Replying to our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon's question, the foreign minister said that Yasir 'Arafat has not submitted a request to visit Jerusalem so far, and for that reason, no date for his arrival has been set.
