FR940512-2-00100 FR940512-2-00055 (d) The Plan will have complete records of all transactions of the Account (see rep. 25, below) and will be able to discontinue the Synthetic GIC (see rep. 23, below) if it discovers that HIMCO has engaged in abusive conduct. 20. The applicants represent that no brokerage costs will be imposed with respect to the sale of the assets in an Account to Hartford Life or an affiliate pursuant to these provisions. With brokerage costs eliminated, the only transaction costs that will be incurred in selling the assets in question will be the costs of recording the change in ownership of these assets. The ability to minimize transaction costs will run to the benefit of the Plan by enabling Hartford Life to provide a higher Guaranteed Rate of Interest to the Plan. 21. The applicants represent that the assets in which the Account has invested (which are expected to be primarily fixed-income securities, and to a lesser extent common stocks and other assets) will be valued as follows: (a) In the case of a security traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Hartford Life will pay the closing price on the exchange on the date of the transaction; and (b) In the case of a security other than one traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, HIMCO will obtain quotations in U.S. dollars (regardless of whether the security in question is denominated in a foreign currency) from at least three unaffiliated financial institutions that serve as market makers for the security, and Hartford Life will pay a price equal to the highest of the three quotations. The three quotations will be obtained on the date of the transaction (i.e., a Scheduled Account Distribution Date or the Scheduled Account Termination Date). Each quotation will represent the bid price offered by the financial institution in question as of the time of the quotation, which will be simultaneous with the processing of the distribution to the Plan. In no event will Hartford Life or HIMCO make valuations themselves. The role of Hartford Life and HIMCO in the valuation process will be limited to ministerial functions and the selection of the independent financial institutions from which valuations will be obtained. 22. The Synthetic GICs will be designed to provide adequate liquidity to enable Plans to meet their benefit obligations. Thus, a Synthetic GIC will allow for unscheduled withdrawals from the Account (Benefit Sensitivity Advances) prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date under certain circumstances. A Plan will be able to make Benefit Sensitivity Advances on ten days' notice for the purpose of providing the necessary funds to meet the Plan's benefit obligations as they fall due. A Plan fiduciary may be required by Hartford Life to furnish documentation demonstrating that the benefit payment is in fact required under the terms of the Plan. There is no charge or fee for Benefit Sensitivity Advances. Benefit Sensitivity Advances will consist of cash distributions from the Account. When a Benefit Sensitivity Advance is requested, HIMCO will be required to liquidate securities in the Account on the open securities market with an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount necessary to meet the Plan's request. The proceeds will then be distributed to the Plan, and the amount distributed will be subtracted from the Adjusted Book Value of the Account.
