After being taken out of service a few years ago, this plant is now undergoing modifications that will allow it to burn solid fuels, mainly bagasse. Seven groups made up of people from 11 provincial organizations are working on the power plant, which began operating in the 1920's. These people are responsible for repairing the plant's boilers, cooling system, pipes, and water treatment system. The plant is expected to be operational in June, and to be capable of generating 10 megawatts, which is a third of the city of Camaguey's demand. This is a new responsibility that has been given to the productive scientific hub, and reactivating the plant will allow us to make it available during two periods, as well as incorporate it into the power grid.
