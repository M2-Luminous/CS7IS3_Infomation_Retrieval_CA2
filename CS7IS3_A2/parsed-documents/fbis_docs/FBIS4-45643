FBIS4-45643 "jpten015___94046" JPRS-TEN-94-015 JPRS Environmental Issues 25 May 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Environmental Ministry: No Threat From Sunken Nuclear Sub Environmental Ministry: No Threat From Sunken Nuclear Sub LD2505164194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1541 GMT 25 May 94 LD2505164194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources once again confirmed that there is no emergency situation around the Komsomolets nuclear submarine which drowned in the Norwegian Sea in 1989. At the same time, the ministry considers it possible to carry out works on encasing of the front section where two torpedoes with nuclear charges are located. Experts are particularly concerned about the possible escape of radioactive plutonium from these torpedoes. The torpedoes have been partially destroyed as a result of the ship going under and an explosion in the front section. The nuclear reactor was taken out of operation before the sinking and any negayive effects on the environment is ruled out. This was said at a press conference in Moscow on Wednesday, dedicated to Russian press reports about the allegedly critical situation around the submarine. First Deputy Minister Aleksey Poryadin, referring to the conclusion of the state ecological investigation, noted that at the depth of 1,700 meters, where the submarine is lying, fishing is not being carried out, therefore "a radioactive and ecological threat posed by the release of substances after plutonium decay of the nuclear explosives" does not exist. At the same time, experts of the ministry consider it necessary to constantly check the ecological situation in the region around Komsomolets before and after installment of localizing systems. Poryadin pointed out that localization of the front section will be carried out with the purpose of preventing the release of radioactive substances, the probability of which, in his opinion, is very low. He said that the cost of the works had been estimated approximately, but it is too early to speak about a concrete sum. Poryadin said, referring to the London Convention on prevention of water pollution from waste and other substances (1972), that "force-majeur circumstances to which the death of the submarine is related" exclude presenting claims to Russia from other countries. Poryadin said that in three weeks a Russia expedition on board the Mstislav Keldysh ship will head for the place of the Komsomolets accident in order to control the radiation and ecological situation in the area. According to the ministry, the expeditions in 1988, 1991-1993, did not find increased levels of plutonium in the water or on the sea's bottom.
