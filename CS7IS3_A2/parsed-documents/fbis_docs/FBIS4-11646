Shahin] [Text] Amman--A group of over 60 Palestinian and Jordanian businessmen have founded an investment company with an initial capital of over $100 million to jump-start the economy of the West Bank and Gaza even before Palestinain self-rule is implemented there. Today the founders of the company, officially registered as an off-shore firm in Liberia due to the still lucid political conditions in the occupied territories, will elect their board of trustees at the Amman Chamber of Industry. The Palestine Company for Development and Investment (PCDI) is to be a public share-holding company which is founded by mostly millionaire Palestinian businessmen based in and outside the Arab World. The founding members who spoke to the Jordan Times Tuesday asked to stay anonymous until after the board of trustee elections. "After the elections most of the founders and investors will be known to the public. There is no need to publicize names before-hand," said the company's Amman spokesman Rajaii al-Masri. The company plans to invigorate the Palestinian economy by building much of the housing and industrial infrastructure needed to upgrade the living and working conditions of the almost two million Palestinians living in the occupied territories in the next 10 years. Addressing many in the occupied territories who fear an "economic takeover" by Diaspora Palestinians once self-rule is implemented, company founders say the development projects will employ local expertise, labour and use locally-made building materials wherever available. PCDI has three main "priority projects." The first is to build reasonably priced modern middle class housing projects throughout the West Bank, Gaza and possibly East Jerusalem. The second most "urgent" objective is to build "heavy" industries. While investors who spoke to the JORDAN TIMES declined to be specific, a cement plant was given as one possible example. The third most important objective is to build smaller self- sustaining industries. Another "IMMEDIATE PROJECT" will include a chain of medium sized hotels in all the major cities and towns in the occupied territories, for the "throngs of Palestinian and Arab visitors" that are expected to converge on the occupied territories in the near future. PCDI has been years in the making. According to company sources, development projects founded and supported by the Geneva-based Welfare Association have been vigorously analysed to serve as a blue print for economic needs "large and small" in the occupied territories. But unlike the Welfare Association, which is a non-profit foundation for humanitarian and development assistance for Palestinians, PCDI is a large-scale business venture. The company was officially registered in Liberia in October 1993 and will remain listed as an off-shore company until the political climate surrounding self-rule "stabilises," Mr. al-Masri said. Company stocks will be listed in a Palestinian stock market once that is set up in the occupied territories. An initial suggestion for the location of a Palestinian stock market has been Ramallah, Bethlehem or Nablus. PCDI founders say the company will have several subsidiaries. One such firm, the Ruwad Filistine Company, a construction firm, is already being set up in the occupied territories. More than half of PCDI shares (or 51 per cent) will be owned by people who live inside the occupied territories, Mr. al-Masri says. The rest will be owned by Jordanian and Diaspora Palestinians. Before the company becomes fully operational the investors hope that the starting capital would have increased to $200 million. Before the shares go on sale to the general public, initial capital raising begins with those investing a minimum of $100,000 with a maximum capital ceiling of investment put at $2 million. While the majority of the investors thus far have been Diaspora Palestinians, followed by Jordanian Palestinians and others living in Arab countries, a few West Bank and Gaza investors have also invested. While many of the Diaspora and Jordan-based Palestinians have invested the maximum $2 million, none of the West Bank and Gaza based investors have been able to do so thus far," said one of the investors. The degree of autonomy the company will have from Palestinian government and Israeli interference is still to be worked out, founders say. "We expect a very large degree of economic autonomy," said one leading investor. Most company founders still prefer relative anonymity citing both political and personal reasons. "The political situation is still too fluid," said a leading founder, "most of the investors are nationals of countries other than Jordan and to play such a major role in the building of another economy needs indirect approval from certain quarters. So until everything is perfectly clear most prefer anonymity." But those investors who are Jordanians national, who form a "good third if not a half" of the founding investors, have an implicit approval from the Jordanian Government. "Jordan and Palestine are intricately linked and the only non-Palestinians to found the company are Jordanians. So it is a special relationship," said one of the founding members, Nidal Sukhtyan. But the Jordanian Government is not the only government to have been consulted about PCDI. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) too has been extensively briefed about the company's plans and intentions and has given its tacit approval. "The Palestinian entity will be one in which the open market rules and business community will bank roll the economy. Naturally the PLO approves," said one founder. Individuals, companies and banks are among the initial founders of the PCDI and the board of trustees to be elected today is likely to include the economically most powerful people in the lands to come under Palestinian control.
