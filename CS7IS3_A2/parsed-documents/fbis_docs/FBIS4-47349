The turbines were studied at the department of steam and gas turbines at the Moscow Energy Institute. A set of programs has been developed to determine the stress on turbine elements, in particular, shaft line vibration. The programs also formulate recommendations for design modification to increase vibration resistance. Examples are presented. The recommendations have eliminated the problem of self-exciting vibrations (at low frequencies) and in some cases have made the turbines more economical. The lifetime of turbines can be determined. Fatigue and corrosive fracturing can be evaluated. Figures 9.
