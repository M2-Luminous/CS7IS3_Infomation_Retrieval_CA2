FR940128-0-00009 FR940128-0-00002 (c) Borrower operations exempted from REA controls . Borrowers who are notified by REA in writing that their net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent are exempted from the operational controls of the REA mortgage and loan contract listed in this paragraph. These controls, which are implemented through REA regulations and other documents, are as follows: (1) Requirement that extensions or additions to the borrower's electric utility system financed by the borrower's own funds, as defined in 7 CFR 1717.652, be included in an REA-approved construction work plan. This exemption does not apply to extensions or additions financed by loans made or guaranteed by REA or by loans for which REA has granted a lien accommodation or subordination; (2) Requirements on contract bidding procedures, as set forth in ยง1710.120 and other REA regulations, except when the construction is funded directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA; (3) REA approval of construction contracts and engineering and architectural service contracts, and use of REA standard forms of contracts, as set forth in ยง1710.120 and other REA regulations, except when the construction is funded directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA. To be eligible for exemption of REA approval rights, here and elsewhere in this paragraph (c), the contracts must not contain any provisions that prohibit or restrict the assignment of the contracts to the government upon the exercise by REA of its remedies under security instruments securing loans made or guaranteed by REA. Throughout this section, REA approval of contracts also includes REA approval of contract amendments and renewals; (4) REA approval of the borrower's use of general funds, as defined as ``own funds'' in 7 CFR 1717.652, for plant extensions or additions or other investments in the borrower's electric utility system, provided that the funds will not be reimbursed with funds from a loan made or guaranteed by REA, and: (i) The plant addition will not provide direct service to any ultimate consumer having an anticipated or contract kilowatt-hour (kWh) or maximum kilowatt (kW) demand in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total kWh sales or maximum kW demand recorded during the previous calendar year; or (ii) If the investment is for the addition or substantial reconstruction of generation capacity, the borrower is a power supply borrower and the addition or substantial reconstruction of capacity will not exceed 25 megawatts. The exemption under this paragraph (ii) does not apply to distribution borrowers; (5) REA approval of contracts for the sale of electric power and energy to ultimate consumers except when the kWh sales or maximum kW demand covered by the contract is for an amount in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total kWh sales or maximum kW demand during the previous calendar year; (6) REA approval of power purchase contracts with suppliers that do not receive financial assistance from REA, provided that the contract is for a period of not more than 1 year and the kWh amount of energy or maximum kW capacity to be purchased under the contract does not exceed 25 percent of the total kWh amount of energy purchased and/or generated by the borrower, or maximum kW demand of the borrower, during the previous calendar year; (7) REA approval of transmission, interconnection, and power pooling contracts that cover a period of one year or less; (8) REA approval of contracts for the operation and management and/or maintenance of a borrower's system, provided that the contract does not cover all or substantially all of the borrower's system; (9) REA approval of the voluntary sale, lease or transfer by the borrower of any capital asset in exchange for fair market value if: (i) The borrower is not in default under its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA. (As used in this section, the term default includes defaults declared by the mortgagee as well as events that have occurred and are continuing, which, with notice or lapse of time and notice, would become events of default.);
