Open Economy."] [Text] Some sensational information was disclosed yesterday at the Ukrainian National Entrepreneurship Assembly session. Oleksandr Dudko, chairman of the Crimean Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, presented three decrees signed by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, all of which bore the date of signing, registration numbers, and, as it was put, still-wet ink. Practically, this means that the Crimea has entered a new economic era, something that industrialists and entrepreneurs have been trying to obtain from the government for several long months. The documents signed by Yuriy Meshkov implemented the 23 June decree of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, "On Open Economic Regime in the Territory of the Crimean Republic."
