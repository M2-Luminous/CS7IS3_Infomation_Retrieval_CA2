In his first speech since John Smith's death, Mr. Blair took an uncompromising and unashamedly moral tone to argue that strong employment and education policies were central to national renewal, and condemned modern Tory liberalism for producing "an atomised, uncaring rootless society" that was bound to breed crime and alienation. "Over the past few years, there has developed a keen belief that we have lost our sense of purpose and direction as a country," he said. "One reason surely is that we have lost our identity as a country. The growth of social division, inequality and the disintegration of the family And the community have torn us apart." Mr Blair said the task of the left was not to replace the Tories' crude individualism with old notions of an overbearing paternalistic state. "The task is rather one of national renewal, rebuilding a strong civic society and basing it on a modern notion of citizenship where rights and duties go hand in hand, where the purpose of social action is to develop individual potential, not subjugate it. We have to counter the belief ... that action by society to improve social conditions and notions of personal responsibility are incompatible." He argued that his vision did not represent a change in the left's traditional philosophy, but instead a rediscovery, pointing out that in the l9th and early 20th centuries, families were brutalised by the industrial revolution as they are today by crime, drugs, unemployment and social breakdown. "The history of workers' cooperatives, the friendly societies and the unions from which the Labour Party sprang is one of individuals coming together for self-improvement and to improve people's potential through collective action. We need to recreate for the 21st century the civil society to which these movements gave birth m the 20th century." The speech will inevitably be contrasted with that made at the weekend by the shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown. But the two were made in very different contexts, with Mr Brown delivering a wide- ranging platform speech and Mr Blair offering a philosophical approach in a seminar organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Family Civic Trust. He argued: "It requires not a PhD in philosophy, merely a degree of common sense, to understand that if children grow up in a culture of low opportunity, poor education and unstable family life, then notions of good conduct and mutual respect are likely to disappear." Mr Blair's supporters suggested the speech showed that he would not change his beliefs or style to win the election and that his concerns had a wide appeal in the public. Nevertheless, after the European elections, Mr Blair is going to have to move out of the social field and prove his mettle on the economic issues.
