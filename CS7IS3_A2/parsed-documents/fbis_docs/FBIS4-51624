High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday. "Bilateral cooperation may be sufficient for those who have clearly indicated they choose to come to Seoul on their own free will," Han said at a press conference after arriving from Moscow. His remarks signify a change in Seoul's earlier position that the government will seek intervention by the UNHCR to prevent possible claims by Pyongyang that South Korea is kidnapping the loggers. An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to be in flight throughout Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), seeking resettlement mostly in South Korea. "Not all of these estimated people are North Korean loggers, but people who have fled North Korea through other means," said Han. North Korean loggers have escaped their Siberian camps in droves, later testifying to rampant human rights violation inside the camps. Han had discussed this issue at length with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his Moscow visit. "Russia has promised full cooperation, saying it has not and will not send back the loggers to North Korea," said Han. UNHCR support and mediation would become necessary for protecting the escapees who have not yet being able to contact the South Korean embassy in Moscow and need protection. There are various ways to bring the loggers to South Korea, such as having Moscow issue them residential permit and later allowing them to emigrate to Seoul. The South Korean Embassy could issue them travel permits or passports and recognize them officially as South Korean citizens, Han said.
