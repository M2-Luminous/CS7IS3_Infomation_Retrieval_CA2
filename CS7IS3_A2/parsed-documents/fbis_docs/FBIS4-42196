If negotiations on a government comprised of the PvdA, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and the D66 [Democrats 66] fail, Kok has little inclination to return to the negotiating table with the same parties. "In light of the urgent matters requiring a solution in our country, it is irresponsible to play games. We must make every effort to reach agreement," Kok warned yesterday. He confirmed that "the distance between the PvdA and the VVD is traditionally, historically, and politically wide." Nevertheless, he finds it wrong to deliberately cause current negotiations on a possible "purple" coalition to fail, in the hope that there will be a firmer basis of support if talks with the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] also came to nothing. "We must not reproach ourselves for having stood by and let the chance of a compromise escape us at the decisive moment," Kok stated. He sees differences in the negotiations which are becoming smaller "in their component parts" rather than unbridgeable gulfs. "But there are indeed some notable differences." VVD leader Bolkestein believes that "results are certainly possible" although they are dealing with "very complex matters." He states that the process has not yet encountered any "rough weather" as D66 leader Van Mierlo had forecast. "The crucial phase the talks have now entered is still going to continue for a while yet," Kok believes. Discussions are at present concentrating exclusively on social and economic affairs, such as employment, spending cuts, social security, and tax cuts. The purchasing power of the lower income groups is a crucial point for the PvdA. "If we cannot arrive at a balanced distribution of incomes, the negotiations will soon be over," one PvdA member said. The PvdA is wondering whether any agreement is possible on this with Bolkestein. Van Mierlo says that "he has detected a VVD readiness to prevent too wide a difference in incomes." Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo report that the atmosphere at the talks is excellent. The politicians, who have been appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions, believe that it will take a few more days before stock can be taken of the situation. The impression after the first talks is that if agreement is reached on the social and economic questions, the other problems will be much easier to solve. While the negotiations concentrate on possible cutbacks over the next four years, the Lubbers-Kok government still has to make up for a financial shortfall of at least 1 million guilders. This was caused by the costs of taking in asylum-seekers proving higher than estimated while income from natural gas remained below forecasts. The spring statement sent by Finance Minister Kok to his colleagues contains no new spending cuts, but Kok is asking the other Ministries to adopt a "restrained spending policy." Money which they save in this way must be used to compensate for the deficits.
