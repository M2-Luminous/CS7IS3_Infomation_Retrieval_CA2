Livshits, leader of the group of experts under the Russian Federation president, these documents mark a switch of the reformers' main effort to the production sphere and the imposition of order in the matter of mutual payments. Many difficulties lie in store for us here, however. In the abolition of export quotas and licenses, for example. Such privileges really do not exist in the developed world, since everyone there has equal rights to foreign economic activity -- pay only the customs duties that are laid down for everyone. In Russia, however, many programs at federal level, and particularly at regional level, are funded exclusively out of the duty-free export of valuable raw materials. This is how local authorities and even giants at federal level secure currency for their projects. Now all their calculations have been canceled out. This means that we cannot avoid another struggle at the top, opposition, and lobbying to repeal this edict. All the more so because the president already tried to impose order in the granting of foreign economic privileges last year -- an attempt that failed then. Let us take the edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy." We can only welcome the termination of the practice of granting privileges which make holes in the budget, the lightening of the tax burden, and the transfer of sectoral nonbudget funds to the federal budget, under strict control. Here is the rub, however -- how can this be combined with the figures for big state expenditure, which requires big taxes? The authorities probably reckon on collecting more taxes, since entrepreneurs and industrialists will breathe a sigh of relief and will stop evading their payment. But our tax service is far from perfect, and so a new round of budget battles cannot be ruled out. Those who wrested privileges from the government and who hold nonbudget funds that are not under the control of the center -- sectoral and regional lobbies -- will not surrender their positions without a fight either. They have a great arsenal of weapons: Strike threats, moans about the deplorable state of industry, refusals to pay money into the federal treasury, surges of separatism. It seems that the implementation of this edict will be a serious test of the organization and strength of Russian central authority. A similar "trial of strength" will also be provided by the document "On Additional Measures To Normalize Transactions and To Strengthen Payment Discipline...." For, as the Central Bank admits, we have no laws today that demand rigid discipline in payment for goods and services. The system of control over enterprises' compliance with financial discipline has also been destroyed. It is possible to recall the sad fate that befell the edict on the introduction of promissory notes. The demand for currency accounts to be used to clear debts in the absence of working capital treads on the corns of those same powerful lobbies that have plastered industry with a mass of commercial-middleman structures. Strong resistance will also be elicited by the edicts on ranking "naughty" enterprises with the state's controlling packages as rigidly controlled state enterprises. For a significant stratum of managers who are accustomed to dealing with state property as though it were their own private property has been formed in the country in the space of a few years. They also learned a long time ago how to avoid paying taxes by spreading enterprises' funds out among several bank accounts, and the edict on restoring discipline of tax payments could put an end to those liberties. So we could be witnessing normal economic measures, delayed by two years, marking the start of a tricky political campaign.
