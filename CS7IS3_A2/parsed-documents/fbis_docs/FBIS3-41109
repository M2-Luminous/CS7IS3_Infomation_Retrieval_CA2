At the scene trafficking in amphetamines they caught red handed the international drug kingpin and general sleaze Shao Yuanlai, along with Tang Mingkuei and Chen Chialong, a foreign-born laborer who was helping manufacture the amphetamines. They seized 150 kilograms of amphetamines and partially finished products and expanded the continuing investigation into the international amphetamine distribution network. For the amphetamines seized by the Maritime Investigations Office in this raid, the raw materials had been smuggled in from Mainland China; the smuggling pipeline consisted of shipment by fishing boat to the coast of 400 kgs of raw material which could produce 200 kgs of amphetamines. In yesterday's raid only 150 kgs of amphetamines and partially manufactured drugs were seized, so some 30 kgs [sic] had already slipped the net. Some of the amphetamines are sold in Taiwan, but the majority are sold in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, and the suspect Shao Yuanlai is one of the "founding members" of the amphetamine manufacturing and selling ring in this country and could have been engaged in such activities for a long period of time. In June of this year Keelung District Investigations Office Deputy Prosecutor Wang Chintsung, while investigating an amphetamine ingestion case discovered that the amphetamine raw material was smuggled in by fishing boat and that the final amphetamine products were also smuggled abroad by fishing vessels, and so handed the case over to the Maritime Investigations Office for handling. In September the Investigations Office discovered that Shao Yuanlai (age 54) was involved in the smuggling of ephedrine hydrochloride from which amphetamines are produced for sale throughout the country and in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia and that he had close connections with international underworld organizations. Considering the situation critical, they mobilized a stakeout and search for evidence against the criminals. Two nights ago they received information that Shao Yuanlai and T'ang Mingkuei (age 42) who acts as a large scale drug dealer, were to carry out a transaction. In a lightning swift move very early yesterday morning, they seized an amphetamine factory set up in the basement at Yungfeng Road Lane 242 Number 20 in Tucheng City. When the investigators on the scene entered the amphetamine factory, Shao Yuanlai was in the process of handing a case of amphetamine products to Tang Mingkuei, and although they tried to hide, all were captured. It was later learned that because Shao Yuanlai owed Tang Mingkuei a large amount of money for the amphetamine raw material, the amphetamine products being exchanged yesterday were to pay part of his debt, and they had no inkling it would all be seized. The three men arrested by the Maritime Investigations Office yesterday included Shao Yuanlai, aka "Big Brother," a Korean born Chinese, formerly with the Hanyang Medical Academy in Korea, has a record of 12 violations of the narcotic drug control regulations and was arrested in 1991 by the Keelung District Courts for violating these ordinances; Tang Mingkuei, of Taipei, has also been in custody for violating the narcotic drug control regulations; Chen Chialong, (23), is from Malaysia, is a foreign born laborer. The Maritime Investigations Office has already turned the three men over to the Keelung District Prosecutors Office for investigation and trial for violating the drug control regulations.
