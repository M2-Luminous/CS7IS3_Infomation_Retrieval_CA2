Are there any signs attesting to the fact that society now really regards the Hungarian Army as its own Army? [Deak] We soldiers think that the relations between the Army and society are strengthened by numerous positive signs. This society did not like the Army. The foreign contacts and the foreign goals were well known. Many people questioned the need for military service. Today, the sensitivity of our society toward the problems facing our Army has become perceptible. The Army and the need for Army service are no longer issues debated in the civilian sphere. We must admit, however, that the extended Yugoslav conflict has greatly contributed to the strengthening of this view. The fact that only a fraction of the 65,000 young people conscripted annually ask for alternative military service shows the increased acceptance of military service. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Army has not been properly financed in recent years. Its yearly budget was mostly set on the basis of the "principle of leftover" [maradekelv]. Do you see any chance of the new parliament recognizing the need for adequate support of the Army? What can you do for this? [Deak] The inadequate financing of the Army started as early as the eighties. The budget did not make technological development possible; nor did it enable us to improve the living, working, and service circumstances, including soldiers' pay. In view of all this, it is understandable that we are happy to see that the Army received modern combat aircraft in exchange for the Soviet debts to Hungary, and we will be able to deploy a complete tactical air wing soon. We hope that the Russians will supply further technical equipment used by the Army and the border police in exchange for a part of the outstanding debt toward Hungary. Naturally, the soldiers are aware of Hungary's ability to carry burdens. However, I think that the budget should be drawn up in accordance with our tasks. The size of the Army, its composition, and its technical supply should be determined in accordance with its tasks. Our concepts regarding the future reorganization of the Army are ready. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people think that we are over the most difficult phase in the reorganization of the Army, and one should count on fewer conflicts than in the past years. Do you agree with this evaluation? [Deak] I do not think that we are over the most difficult phase. There have been negative measures, but the period ahead of us will not be easier, because we must continue to reorganize the Army. We will submit the relevant plans to the new government and the new parliament. We would like to see ahead until the year 2010. There are numerous new elements in our plan. For example, we will attribute great importance to the rapid deployment forces. We want to strengthen both the size and preparedness of our staff of warrant officers. I would divide the existing Army into three main parts: rapid deployment forces, defense, and reserves. In the future, we envisage the introduction of a differentiated standing Army service coordinated with the above. At least 50 percent of the rapid deployment force would be made up of professional soldiers. I cannot envisage a shorter Army service than 12 months in these units and in the active defense forces. It would be irresponsible to make untrained soldiers carry out combat tasks. However, in the case of the reserves, we can envisage a reduction of the service. At the same time, we must modify the reserves, even by modifying the defense law if necessary. People who had served less would be called up for reserves duty more frequently. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The replacement and modernization of some military technology and weapons systems will become inevitable in the coming years. In view of the medium-term military technology development plan, where do you see possibilities of development first? [Deak] Some 90 percent of our military technology is based on Soviet technology. At the moment, it seems that we have no other choice but to continue to purchase weapons from the East. We do not have the possibility of purchasing arms from the West. In addition, we would like to rely increasingly on the Hungarian industry. However, we must, anyway, purchase the most modern electronic systems from the West or the United States. Without this, we cannot fulfill the integration requirements. The priority is well known in this area: air defense, reconnaissance, radio-electronic combat, antiarmor systems. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Could the expected changes in the leadership of the Defense Ministry disturb the professional staff? Can you envisage a division in the Army similar to the one in our society along party lines? [Deak] Any change in the defense and military leadership system can only occur according to the stipulations of the defense law. This law stipulates the management and leadership systems in details. No matter what changes occur in this house, the Army leadership system must be continuous, stable, and firm. The Army is above parties. We do not intend to interfere in government activity. We are waiting for the politician who will lead this ministry respectfully and be ready to cooperate. I think that both the minister and the leading officials will respect the idea of keeping a distance from politics. In my view, a wonderful staff of officers is currently serving in the Hungarian Army. I can say this not only in view of their professional knowledge, but also in view of their honesty, diligence, and readiness to accept sacrifices. I think all this is a guarantee that no division whatsoever will take place within the Hungarian Army.
