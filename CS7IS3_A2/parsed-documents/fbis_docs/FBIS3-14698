Betzelem says that a probe conducted by its personnel reveals that the event was initiated by the IDF unit and that the soldiers deliberately opened fire without a warning and without firing in the air. According to Betzelem, the first round of fire was followed by another, which was apparently meant to ensure that the masked men were dead.
