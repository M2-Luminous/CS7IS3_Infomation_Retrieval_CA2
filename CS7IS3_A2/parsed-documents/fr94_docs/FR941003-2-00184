FR941003-2-00184 FR941003-2-00065 Applicants' Representations 1. Each of the Investment Companies is an open-end management investment company organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Manager serves as the investment adviser for the Investment Companies. 2. The Board of Directors of each Investment Company currently consists of seven persons, five of whom are not ``interested persons'' of that Investment Company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. Each director is entitled to receive an annual fee plus meeting attendance fees from each Investment Company, except that directors who are interested persons of the Manager receive no remuneration from the Investment Companies. Non-interested directors who serve on certain committees of the directors are entitled to additional fees for such service. The aggregate amount payable to the non-interested directors will be de minimis in comparison to the aggregate net assets of the existing Funds. 3. Applicants propose to implement a Deferred Compensation Plan for non-interested directors (the ``Plan''). The purpose of the Plan is to permit individual directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of the fees (the ``Deferred Fees'') to enable them to defer payment of income taxes on such fees or for other financial goals. Applicants believe that the availability of deferred fee arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain qualified directors. 4. Under the Plan, a director's Deferred Fees are credited as of the date such fees would have been paid to a separate book reserve account established with respect to each series of each participating Fund (each a ``Deferred Fee Account''). The value of the Deferred Fee Account as of any date will be equal to the value each account would have had of such date if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested as of the date credited in shares of certain designated series of the Funds. Shares of any series of any Fund, other than TCI or Premium Reserves, 1 as the Plan Committee and the participating director shall have agreed upon in writing from time to time, may be selected (the ``Designated Shares''). Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited or charged with book adjustments representing all interest, dividends, and other earnings, and all gains and losses that would have been realized had such account been invested in the Designated Shares. 1 TCI and Premium Reserves are excluded from those Funds the shares of which are eligible for selection because neither generally would be available to participating directors in their individual capacities. TCI is sold to insurance companies and Premium Reserves has a minimum investment requirement of $100,000 (an amount in excess of amounts anticipated to be deferred by any director). Because the directors believe it inappropriate to be able to invest in Funds they would not otherwise be able to invest in individually, it is anticipated that future Funds with restrictive provisions also will be excluded similarly from those eligible for selection under the Plan. 5. With respect to the obligations created under the Plan, each director will remain a general unsecured creditor. The Plan does not create an obligation of any Fund to any director to purchase, hold, or dispose of any investments, and if a Fund or series thereof should choose to purchase investments, including Designated Shares, all such investments will continue to be part of the general assets and property of such Fund or series. 6. As a matter of prudent risk management, each Fund intends, where it determines appropriate, and with respect to money management series that employ the amortized cost method of valuation, will undertake, to purchase and maintain Designated Shares in amounts equal to the amount of Deferred Fees so credited. 7. The Plan will allow a director to elect to defer payment of fees payable to him by a Fund with respect to any year (including all adjustments representing interest, dividends and other earnings, and all gains and losses, credited or charged with respect thereof) until (a) the director ceases to be a director of the Fund or (b) the Plan is terminated. Payments to directors may be made in a lump sum or in such number of annual installments (not to exceed 10) as shall be elected by the director. In the event of death, amounts payable to the director under the Plan will become payable to his designated beneficiary; in all other events, the director's right to receive payments will be non-transferable. 8. The Plan will not obligate any Fund to retain the services of a director, nor will it obligate any Fund or series to pay any (or any particular level of) fees to any director. Rather, it will merely permit a director to defer receipt of those fees that would otherwise be payable from each Fund.
