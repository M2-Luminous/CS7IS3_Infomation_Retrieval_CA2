One significant development is that the country has returned to a two-party system. The results of yesterday's elections were very similar to those of 1991. In the Senate, the Liberal Party retained 59 percent of the seats, and the Conservative Party won 28 percent. The supraparty system fared poorly, with the virtual disappearance of the AD-M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic Alliance] and the National Salvation Party. Christian movements received 5 percent of the seats, enhancing their importance in the Senate. The democratic left, in almost all its forms, is headed for extinction. As for the Chamber of Representatives, Liberals retained 55 percent of the seats, and Conservatives picked up the 7 percentage points lost by the AD/M-19. In effect, nothing is new, and we can expect the usual from Congress as the degree of changes seems to have been minimal.
