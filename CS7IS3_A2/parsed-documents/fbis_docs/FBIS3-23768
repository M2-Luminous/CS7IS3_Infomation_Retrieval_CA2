MN File: Yuri Meshkov was born in 1945, his mother is Ukrainian and his father Russian. Graduated from Moscow University's Department of Law. Worked as a senior investigator at the Procurator's Office in Crimea which he was forced to quit because of an attempt to call some members of the party-managerial nomenklatura to account. Spent three years in the merchant marines. Then worked as a lawyer. Is a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. Is married and has two children. His rival, Nikolai Bagrov, polled 23.5 percent. These figures may be interpreted as a result of the referendum on whom Crimea belongs to, the conduct of which was one of the key planks of Meshkov's election programme. In effect, this means that Ukraine has missed its chance to strengthen its hold on the gift presented by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 (cf. MN No. 3). The main reason behind such election returns is not the fear of growing Ukrainian influence in all aspects of life, the threat of which was used to scare the electorate (considering that one in five Crimean inhabitants is Ukrainian, only one in a thousand Crimean schoolchildren studies in Ukrainian). The main source of the Crimean electorate's sympathies and antipathies lies in whatever is known all over the world as the Ukrainization of the economy. Meshkov won, but his victory boiled down to a questionable right to make the first move in a position amounting to a stalemate for everyone. From his very first day in the post of President Yuri Meshkov will be severely limited in terms of time. Considering the character of his electors (it is easier to lose than win their sympathies), the President will have to work to secure a repeal of the moratorium on the referendum in Crimea so as to hold it on March 27, the day of elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine and Crimea. Otherwise Meshkov risks not only his position, but even the chances for a parliamentary victory by the forces supporting him. Thus, less than two months has been allotted for the creation of the legal basis he has promised to rely upon in relation with Ukraine. Moreover, Meshkov will have to predicate himself on the following real circumstances. Crimea depends economically to an even greater extent on Ukraine than the latter on energy imports. The question is not about something of secondary importance, but about fresh water and electricity. Crimea consumes one billion dollars' worth of electricity each year alone in terms of world prices. In the course of TV debates, replying to his opponent's blunt question about what he would do if Kiev cut off the supply of electricity to the Crimea, Meshkov confined himself to general words, claiming that Russia would not abandon Crimea. However, electricity cannot be delivered by tanker whereas the construction of power lines of corresponding capacity across the Kuban and the Kerch Strait will take at least three years. The fulfilment of even the most fantastic of Meshkov's election promises, like the entry into the rouble zone, will all the same not produce anything economically unless political stability has been guaranteed in Crimea. Without it the peninsula's economic infrastructure, geared mainly to tourism, will be doomed to final degradation. And besides, the newly-elected President's relations with the indigenous people -- Crimean Tatars -- have been hopelessly spoiled. The Tatars are today the only ethnopolitical force in Crimea which is organized in support of the status quo regarding relations with Ukraine. They supported Bagrov in the first and second rounds and their leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, has already stated that Tatars will not regard Yuri Meshkov as their President. The Tatars have repeatedly declared that they alone have the legitimate right to national statehood in Crimea and are prepared to resort to any means should the situation be aggravated. The results of Crimea's elections have already polarized Ukrainian public opinion. Any extreme moves by Meshkov to implement his programme are dangerous in this situation. In the past two weeks Yuri Meshkov has publicly said that he maintains excellent contacts with the Russian leadership at the highest level. Though he gave no names, he stressed each time that the question was not about President Yeltsin. In the corridors, however, even names were mentioned --two days before the elections Meshkov cited the following list of his "contractors": Zhirinovsky, Communist Leader Zyuganov, representatives from the Agrarian Party... Unless this is a bluff, the politicians traditionally opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his team have got at their disposal a button with the help of which they can at any moment explode both Russian-Ukrainian relations and the inner political situation in Russia.
