(9) For a clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7), that has less than 1,175 hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, replace the clutch assembly with an airworthy clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) or P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), prior to the clutch assembly accumulating 1,200 hours TIS. Note: The clutch service information published in The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) Service Note No. 0027, dated December 9, 1975; Enstrom Service Information Letter No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978; Enstrom Service Information Letter No. 0079A, dated February 14, 1980; Service Information Letter No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980, Enstrom Service Directive Bulletin No. 0068, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990; and Enstrom Service Directive Bulletin No. 0069, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990; pertains to this AD. (b) For Model F&hyph;28F, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, accomplish the following: (1) Within the next 25 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, determine the part number of the clutch assembly. (2) If a clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7), is found, before further flight, replace it with an airworthy clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) or P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10). The clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7), is not approved for use on Enstrom Model F&hyph;28F, 280F, or 280FX series helicopters. (c) Installation of a clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) or P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), on Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters constitutes a terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (d) This AD establishes a retirement life of 1,200 hours TIS for the clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7). However, for clutch assemblies with 1,175 or more hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, those clutch assemblies need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 25 hours TIS. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
