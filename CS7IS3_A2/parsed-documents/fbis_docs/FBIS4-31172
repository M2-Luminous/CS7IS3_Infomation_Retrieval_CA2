Karadzic stressed that the Serb side is in favor of a permanent, not limited, cessation of all forms of hostilities. Early this morning, at a meeting between Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and Muslim Vice President Ejup Ganic [title as received], the Muslim-Croat side insisted that it would accept only two months of a cessation of hostilities at the most. The Muslims and Croats believe that in that period an agreement on the basis of the contact group's proposal for the territorial division of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be reached. Ganic told Akashi that "the Muslim-Croat side does not, under any circumstances, want the Geneva conference to freeze the current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina."
