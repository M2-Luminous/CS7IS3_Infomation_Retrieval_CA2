FBIS4-65771 "drweu099_j_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-099 Daily Report 13 May 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Poll on European Election Reported Poll on European Election Reported 94P20760 Rome L'ESPRESSO in Italian 13 May 94 pp 54-56 94P20760 Rome L'ESPRESSO Italian CSO [Unattributed article: "Knight Up, Bossi Down"] [Text]The Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] is galloping while the Bandwagon [Northern League symbol] is slowing down. The Oak Tree [symbol of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] is growing on terrain where the bushes are getting ever thinner. These, along with the increase in the extreme wings of Communist Renewal and the National Alliance [AN] are the most significant predictions coming from a CIRM poll on voters' intentions for the 12 June European election. The poll was conducted among 4,155 individuals between 18-29 April, and compared voting intentions for the European election with votes cast under the proportional system for the Chamber of Deputies in the election of 28 March. Compared with the preceding election, today Forza Italia would gain 3.1 percent, going from 21.1 to 24.2 percent of the total vote; the PDS would grow by 1.4 percent, AN by 1.1 percent, Communist Renewal by 0.9 percent. The Greens would remain stable, while all the others would register serious losses. On the progressive front, the greatest loss would be registered by the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] (minus 0.9), followed by the Rete and AD [Democratic Alliance] (minus 0.4 and 0.3 respectively.) In the Center, the most penalized would be the Segni Pact, which would lose 0.8 percent, while the Italian Popular Party [PPI] would lose 0.5 percent. [Marco] Pannella's loss is considerable (minus 1.5), while among the government coalition the Northern League would be the only one to lose (minus 1.1). How many of the voters would today repeat the choice made on 28 March? The table below reports the "degree of loyalty" for each party, keeping in mind the high number of undecideds just a little over a month before the election. In this case the award for loyalty goes to the extreme factions (Communist Renewal with 78 percent and AN with 76). However, CIRM has also elaborated the poll data using the so-called "French method," that is, hypothesizing a certain distribution of the undecided votes. Using this method, the most loyalty is that shown by AN voters, 96 percent of whom would repeat the choice made on 28 March. A close percentage--above 90 percent--goes to the following, in numerical order: Forza Italia, PDS, Northern League, Communist Renewal, and PPI. The "traitors" would seem to be above all among the voters of Pannella (66.7 percent loyal), the Rete (74.6), AD (78.7) and the PSI (80.8). Where would these wandering votes go? According to CIRM data, the most significant number of votes would go from Communist Renewal to the PDS; from the Rete and AD to the PDS and (hear, hear!) to the AN; and from the Segni Pact and Pannella list to Forza Italia. The Northern League's "tough line" attracts male voters in particular: [Umberto] Bossi's party clearly receives more preferences from men than women. The same goes for the AN, and in a lesser sense, for the PSI, AD, and Communist Renewal. The Knight's indiscreet charm, instead, attracts women in particular, who vote for him more than men, a phenomenon that also occurs within the PPI and the Segni Pact. Young voters especially reward Communist Renewal, the Greens, Forza Italia, and the AN. The elderly --those over 65--instead show a marked preference for the PPI. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Index of Loyalty to Various Parties | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Party |Percentage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Communist Renwal |78 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AN |76 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PDS |73 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Forza Italia |69 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Greens |65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PPI |65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northern League |65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PSI |56 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Segni Pact |53 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AD |46 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rete |41 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pannella List |37 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poll on European Election of 12 June | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Party |27-28 March Election |12 June European Electio-| | | |n (Intentions as of 29 A-| | | |pril) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Forza Italia |21.1 |24.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PDS |20.5 |21.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AN |13.4 |14.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PPI |11.1 |10.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northern League |8.5 |7.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Communist Renewal |6.0 |6.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Segni Pact |4.5 |3.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pannella List |3.5 |2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Greens |2.6 |2.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PSI |2.2 |1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rete |1.9 |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AD |1.2 |0.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |3.5 |2.4 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
