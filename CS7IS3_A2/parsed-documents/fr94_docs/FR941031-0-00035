FR941031-0-00035 FR941031-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [I.D. 102594B] Atlantic Tuna Fisheries; Bluefin Tuna AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure of the General category fishery. SUMMARY: NMFS has determined that the 8 metric tons (mt) set-aside for the late-season General category fishery in the New York Bight beginning September 20, 1994, will have been taken by October 26, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 2330 hours (11:30 pm) on Wednesday, October 26, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: 2330 hours on October 26, 1994, through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Kelly, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347, or Raymond E. Baglin, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq .) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt of large medium and giant ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are to be set aside for a late-season fishery beginning September 15. Based on landings statistics, the fishery was closed on August 15, 1994, with only 23 mt remaining for the late-season set-aside. A reallocation of 18 mt from the reserve increased the set-aside to 41 mt, of which 33 mt were allocated to General category fishermen from all areas to be fished from September 15 through September 17, and 8 mt were allocated to the New York Bight fishery to be fished from September 20 until the 8 mt are taken. Based on landing reports, NMFS has determined that the late-season quota of ABT allocated for General category vessels fishing in the New York Bight must be closed. Fishing for, retention of, possession of, or landing large medium or giant ABT by vessels in the General category must cease by 2330 hours October 26, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota. This closure of the late-season General category fishery will not affect other categories fishing for ABT. As of this date, the Incidental and Angling categories remain open. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.20(b) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq . Dated: October 25, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
