On 11 February 1979, the Iranian people, who desired a new life, rose up in all out resistance against monarchism and overturned the dictatorial emperor regime. This was a momentous event in the history of the Iranian people. Iran is situated between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian sea on the Asian continent. The victory of the revolution in Iran ended the monarchical politics that had imposed feudal oppression upon the people, thus laying a foundation for constructing an independent new society. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has declared: Since the victory of the revolution, the Iranian people have bravely overcome various difficulties and tribulations, consolidated the achievements of the Islamic revolution, actively struggled to defend peace and security in the Persian Gulf area. The 15 years that the Iranian people have traversed since the victory of the revolution have been years of struggle to brave all difficulties and tribulations, defend the achievements of the revolution, and promote the independent development of the country. During this period, the Iranian people have effected a success in bravely smashing the moves of intervention and destruction by the imperialists and reactionaries, removing the old remnants of the monarchical era, and struggling for social progress and development. Today, the Iranian people have put great efforts into achieving national political stability and economic self-reliance. They have paid deep attention to developing industrial development. A large amount of underground resources, including crude oil, natural gas, ores, coal, and chrome, is buried in this country. Extraction of crude oil has been the base of the Iranian economy. Natural gas and crude oil account for approximately 80 percent of this country's income and approximately 90 percent of the acquisition of foreign currency. In addition, Iran has put efforts to develop light industry, including the textile and foodstuff industries. Wheat farming is a major agricultural crop in Iran. Iran grows barley, rice, millet, and cotton. The Iranian Government has externally participated in the nonaligned movement and has maintained the principle for nonintervention in internal affairs. The Iranian Government has developed relations with other countries based on the principle of mutual respect in international relations Our people have rejoiced over the Iranian people's success in the construction of a new society -- like our own success. Korea and Iran are Asian countries together and members of the nonaligned movement. The friendly relations between our people and the Iranian people have been favorably and have been developing daily. Visits by each country's delegations have been frequent and cooperation and exchanges have been developing in various fields. The Iranian people have highly appraised the success that our people, upholding the great leader, have effected in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The Iranian people have positively supported the peace-loving proposals and lines of our party and the Republic Government for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. Developing friendly relations between our two countries is beneficial to the interests of the two countries' people, a new Asian construction, and strengthening and developing the nonaligned movement. As in the past, our people will value the friendly and cooperative relations with the Iranian people for the sake of independence, peace, and friendship and will actively make efforts to strengthen and develop cooperative relations. Our people hope that the Iranian people will achieve greater success in the work to construct an independent and an advanced Iran.
