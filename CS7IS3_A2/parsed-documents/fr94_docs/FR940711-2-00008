FR940711-2-00008 FR940711-2-00005 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 21&hyph;4 [proposed] Announcing the Standard for COBOL Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. 1. Name of Standard . COBOL (FIPS PUBS 21&hyph;4) 2. Category of Standard . Software Standard, Programming Language. 3. Explanation . This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard COBOL, as specified in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985, X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23b&hyph;1993, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) This revision supersedes FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 and reflects corrections and clarifications to the COBOL specifications. The American National Standards define the elements of the COBOL programming language and the rules for their use. The purpose of the standards is to promote portability of COBOL programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standards are used by implementors as the reference authority in developing processors and by users who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard language. 4.

Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are: _To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training; _To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in the use of high level programming languages; _To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and _To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with the installed base. 9. Applicability. a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications and programs that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS COBOL is one of the high level programming language standards provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS COBOL is especially suited for applications that emphasize the manipulation of characters, records, files, and input/output (in contrast to those primarily concerned with scientific and numeric computations).
