Shalom to you, Rabbi Lau. [Lau] Shalom. [Nir] How did the meeting with the Cuban leader go? Are there any messages you would like to relay at this point? [Lau] First, I must digest it all. The meeting ended half an hour ago, and it lasted exactly three hours: from 2155 to 0055. It was filled with so many issues and emotions, and the hour is so late, that I am having a hard time digesting it all. All in all, he is a very wise, brave, levelheaded, and cautious man. As you know, I did not try to approach him from the political point of view but rather from the spiritual and humanitarian aspects. Two issues are very close to him: First, the Holocaust, because he is a big enemy of anti-Semitism; second, he is very interested in the peace talks between Israel and its neighbors, but he knows I am not a political man who relays political messages. The issue of relations between our two countries came up in one way or another on various occasions. The only news I can impart to you is that although he did not promise anything, he evinced keen interest -- as he was escorting me to the elevator, he wrote down the names of Ron Arad and our three MIA's from the Sultan al-Ya'qub battle. [Dan] Does the establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba seem likely in the wake of your meeting with Fidel Castro? [Lau] I am not acting on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, which retains full responsibility for such issues. He spoke with great admiration about the prime minister and the foreign minister. After having spoken to him for three hours on this and other related issues, I can say that he is waiting to see the progress made on the peace process. He wishes for -- and I am quoting him -- fair peace, final, and lasting [last five words in English]. I have more than a feeling that as progress is made on this issue, he will be more responsive and open on the question of relations. [Dan] Do you think it is a condition? [Lau] We did not use such words. He referred to it from the humanitarian point of view. He spoke about all the years he was isolated, especially by his neighbor, the strongest superpower in the world, which he has been facing empty-handed, and he noted that with the disintegration of the Soviet regime and the ensuing collapse, he has been left with very few friends around the world, some of whom are our neighbors. It is hard for him to take a step that will not be accepted by those who stood by him in times of distress. I believe I have made myself clear. I am speaking from the official guest house of the Cuban Government. [Dan] Did he acquire a new friend as a result of your meeting? [Lau, laughing] Did he acquire a new friend? I do not know what you call a friend. I do not see him visiting Israel tomorrow or the day after, but he is a great friend of the Jewish people. He deeply abhors anti-Semitism. He explained to me that during his childhood, people tried to instill in him notions about the Jews being guilty for the fate of Jesus. He is very non-Catholic on this issue. He was very glad when I mentioned that we hold fond memories of the Cuban Government and the Cuban people for opening their country to European refugees upon the rise of Nazism to power. He was very touched by this. [Nir] What sort of man did you find him to be? He may be the last vestige of an era. [Lau] He is not a dogmatic man. In my opinion, he is very educated. He is an interesting man, very knowledgeable about the Bible. There is no doubt that he is charismatic. God willing, when I return home tomorrow I will tell about the situation here and the admiration felt toward the man nevertheless. Then you will understand that the man is simply brimming with personal charm. [Dan] Thank you very much, Rabbi Lau. You say you are due back tomorrow. [Lau] God willing, tomorrow I will start on my way back. [passage omitted] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 8 February carries a report on Rabbi Lau's meeting with Castro, adding that "Castro emphasized that he has never denounced Israel and said he is sorry about reports in the Israeli media that Israel is not interested in establishing relations with Cuba. He asked Rabbi Lau to relay a message to Prime Minister Rabin and to Foreign Minister Peres expressing his admiration for the Israeli Government in view of the courage it has evinced in the peace process."]
