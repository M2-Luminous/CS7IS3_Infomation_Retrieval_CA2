The newspaper quoted Israeli military sources as saying an ANC delegation visited Israel 2 weeks ago to gather information on the army's special program for recruits who fail their studies. The delegation reportedly met the head of the education department in the Israeli army and visited several centers where army students are trained. The paper says the delegation said it was facing difficulty in enrolling young blacks with no education and they hoped to adopt methods being used in Israel.
