It then claims the DRY is the one breaking the cease-fire. Yesterday the (?collapsing) Sanaa regime said we had broken the cease-fire. For the fifth time they declared a cease-fire and then ordered their forces to attack on all fronts, while sending their aircraft and launching their shells and missiles against peaceful residents and vital installations. They made several such attacks this morning on the Aden refinery and its civilian airport and mounted attacks and shelling on all fronts. Our forces and people are heroically resisting and are exhibiting legendary steadfastness. [passage omitted]
