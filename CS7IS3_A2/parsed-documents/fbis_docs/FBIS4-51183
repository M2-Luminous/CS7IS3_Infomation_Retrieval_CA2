Fu Quanyou pointed out: Since the beginning of this year, the party committee of the General Logistics Department has paid attention to its central group's study programs. It has sponsored two rotating training classes for division-level leading cadres. Meanwhile, various units have sponsored more than 70 rotating training classes for regiment-level cadres. The overall result of these training classes is good. But we should have a sober understanding that such an effort is just a beginning. Only by studying continuously can we adapt to the new situation and meet the requirements of our tasks. We must persist in carrying out Chairman Jiang Zemin's important instruction: "Constantly and repeatedly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and put it on top of the agenda." Fu Quanyou said: The most outstanding feature of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the high degree of integration of its scientific nature with its practical nature. In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must achieve results in solving practical problems. First of all, in the light of the overall situation of the party's work, we must have a profound understanding of the relations between "reform, development, and stability"; strengthen our self-conscientiousness in carrying out the general goal; and resolutely follow the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core so as to better ensure the reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Secondly, in the light of realities in the market and on the battlefield, it is necessary to apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the ideology of Army-building in the new period to guide practical logistics work. It is imperative to emancipate the mind, blaze new trails, and work hard to meet the requirements of modern war and the market economy so as to achieve the goal of "being assured of adequate logistical support." Third, in the light of ideological realities, it is necessary to guide the broad masses of officers and soldiers to self-conscientiously improve their world outlook; resist the corrosion of various corruptive thoughts; firmly keep in mind the ideal of serving the people wholeheartedly; maintain the glorious tradition of the old revolutionary Army; carry forward the "five kinds of revolutionary spirits" [wu zhong ge ming jing shen 0063 4429 7245 0730 4737 4377] advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; the "64-character pioneering spirit" [emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare to innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of difficulties, learn from foreign countries, constantly improve ourselves, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, work together as one, have national interest in mind, be diligent and frugal, be upright and honest, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, and serve selflessly] advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin; and strive to carry out a socialist new moral and work style. Fu Quanyou urged leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and, through studying, to strengthen their dedication to the work and their sense of responsibility, maintain integrity, foster a good image, and strive to enhance their leading skills and ability to have the situation well in mind. Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics Department, also spoke at the meeting on how to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.
