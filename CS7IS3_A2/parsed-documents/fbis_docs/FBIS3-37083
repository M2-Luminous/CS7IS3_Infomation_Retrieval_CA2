"Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has systematically been justifying the continued presence of Russian troops on Estonian territory against the will of the Estonian people and in violation of norms of international law," the lawmakers said in the statement. The statement maintains that Russian government members' anti- Estonian statements are inconsistent with the U.N. Charter and the CSCE final acts, which Russia must observe in its foreign policy. The parliament draws the attention of all states' legislatures to the fact that Russia assumed at the CSCE Helsinki summit in 1992 the obligation to withdraw its troops from the Baltic states "in an orderly manner, speedily and completely" without additional conditions. Since the obligation vis-a-vis Estonia and Latvia hasn't been fulfilled, the development of Estonian-Russian relations has come to a stop, the statement notes.
