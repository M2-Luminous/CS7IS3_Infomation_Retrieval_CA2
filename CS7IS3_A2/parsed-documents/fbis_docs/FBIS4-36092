Several foreign ministers and delegation heads addressed the session on this subject. Head of the Lebanese delegation Hisham Dimashqiyah remarked that yesterday's Israeli aggression against the country constitutes a declaration of war. He warned that the peace process is endangered and that the UN Security Council and the United States and Russia, the two sponsors of the peace conference, must put pressure on Israel. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Israeli aggression against Lebanon is not directed against one particular country but against the entire world community and the cosponsors of the peace conference. He added that this is not the first such aggression and will not be the last and that Israel's repeated assaults on the Arab parties participating in the peace process illustrate the Israeli design to ruin the peace process and smother the opportunity to attain peace. Head of the Egyptian delegation Nabil al-'Arabi emphasized his country's backing for Lebanon and its support for a comprehensive and just Middle East peace. He said Israel must halt these acts, which threaten the peace operation and contravene international law. He pointed out that peacemaking needs a favorable climate and the attack on Lebanon posed a threat to the Lebanese nation. The head of the Saudi delegation said he adds his voice to that of the other delegation heads in expressing profound concern and strong condemnation of the Israeli aggression against Lebanon. He stressed that Saudi Arabia supports the Lebanese people and wants the peace process to continue. He urged that UN Security Council Resolution 425, which provides for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, be implemented. PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi accused Israel of deceiving the world. He said what is really happening between Israel and Palestine now is a new form of battle which, although it involves no violence, is a fresh stage of struggle. Qaddumi added that Israel's acts of piracy in Lebanon, such as its abduction of Lebanese citizens, prove that it does not seek peace but is persisting in its efforts to derail the peace process. He said regional peace is still far away. The head of the Libyan delegation reiterated support for Lebanon, condemned Israel, and urged the Security Council, the United States, and Russia to intervene to salvage the peace operation. The Yemeni and Moroccan foreign ministers also declared support for Lebanon.
