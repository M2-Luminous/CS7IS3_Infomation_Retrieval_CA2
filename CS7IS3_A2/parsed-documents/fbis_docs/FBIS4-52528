Beijing, on the other hand, asked Seoul to lift adjustment tariffs on agricultural products imported from China and for sufficient advance warning and negotiation before anti-dumping duties are slapped on Chinese farm goods. Seoul and Beijing sat down for a second day of working-level trade talks here led by Chong Ui-yong, director-general for international trade for the South Korean side, and Shi Weisan, director-general for Asian affairs at the Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Ministry. Seoul supported Beijing's bid to become a GATT member while noting that China should conform to GATT rules on trade. Officials here said Seoul placed special emphasis on China's lowering of customs duties. Seoul asked Beijing to provide information on construction projects and to strengthen inspection of foodstuff exports, to expedite completion of the Korea business center and to allow more Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) offices in China. Seoul made it a point of demanding that China open its distribution market, a preliminary step to individual market opening. Bilateral trade totaled 9.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, with Korea posting a 1.2-billion-dollar surplus in direct exchanges: The surplus is an even larger 3.3 billion dollars when indirect trade via third countries such as Hong Kong is included. Officials predicted that two-way trade will increase to 28 billion dollars by 1997 and to 50 billion dollars by the year 2000. Beijing showed keen interest in South Korea's agricultural market opening after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Seoul officials said. It specifically asked Seoul to leave room for ample negotiations if any possibility of anti-dumping charges arises. The next round of working-level talks is scheduled for the first half of next year in Beijing.
