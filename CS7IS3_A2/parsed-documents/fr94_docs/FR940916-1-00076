FR940916-1-00076 FR940916-1-00016 FRA Conclusions. FRA recognizes the benefits provided to the train crew by the additional features currently available on two-way EOT devices and highly recommends that railroads obtain as many of these optional features as they can when purchasing the devices. However, as long as the devices meet the minimum operating standards required to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear of the train, FRA believes that each individual railroad is in the best position to determine the type of optional features that are best suited for their operations. In addition, FRA does not want to prevent any technological advancements which might improve or modify many of the optional features currently available. Several parties commented on the loss of transmission between the front and rear units at various locations. Based on the comments and information provided by the manufacturers of the devices, FRA believes that railroads should be required to automatically check the communication status between the two units on a periodic basis in order to alert train crews of any transmission problem. FRA suggests that those railroads that experience transmission problems consider the installation of a repeater feature recommended by the manufacturers, which continuously repeats the transmitted message every few seconds. FRA also notes, as one manufacturer commented, that the transmission signal requesting an emergency brake application is sent at a higher wattage than normal transmissions and should be sufficient to overcome any site interference. Furthermore, in order to prevent vandalism and avoid the possibility of a train accidentally being placed in emergency by an outside transmission, FRA believes that the front and rear units should be linked together so that the rear unit will only respond to an emergency command from its associated front unit. FRA elects not to comment, at this time, on one railroad's suggestion that reflectorized material be allowed to be used in place of the flashing lights on EOT devices, since this issue would be more appropriately addressed under a revision of 49 CFR Part 221 regarding rear end markers. 2 FRA also finds that the use of the safety device, introduced by an individual conductor for Burlington Northern, designed to detect blocked trainlines is not feasible at this time based on current operating and train handling procedures; however, FRA encourages continued testing and development of the device. 2 Retroreflective panels do not satisfy performance criteria for rear end marking devices because of track curvature's effect on the projection of the light source. C. En route Failures The AAR and several of its member railroads commented that a train that experiences enroute failure of its two-way EOT device should be allowed to continue without delay and without imposition of a speed limit. These parties base this position on the fact that little data exists that shows the preventive effect of the devices and no railroads currently using the devices have reported an incident where the device was used. Some railroad commenters suggested that trains that experience en route failure should be allowed to continue to destination, whereas other railroads suggested that the trains be allowed to continue to the next forward point for repairs or replacement, just as any other enroute failure. Several railroads also contended that if a speed limit were imposed on trains with en route failures the cost to the industry would be devastating and would hurt the industry's competitiveness due to multiple train delays, missed deliveries, and loss of business. Several commenters also suggested that imposing speed limits for en route failures would actually increase safety risks due to undesirable speed differentials with trailing trains and because these slower trains would have to take to sidings to let faster trains pass and, thus, the likelihood of vandalism is increased. CP Rail Systems noted that Canada requires speed to be reduced to 30 mph when failure of the devices occurs en route. This commenter also noted that two-way devices have a low failure rate, only about 1 in every 400 crew starts. One railroad suggested that a 30 mph speed limit be applied only to trains departing from an initial terminal with inoperative device. FRA Conclusions. FRA believes that, if a train equipped with a two-way EOT device has an en route failure that causes the train to lose the ability to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear of the train, the speed of that train should be limited. FRA recognizes the railroads' concerns that a speed limitation may cause train delays, missed deliveries, and a possible increase in safety risks; however, FRA believes that the railroads are overstating these problems. The railroads themselves conceded that the EOT devices are very reliable and can operate for two to three years without a problem. In fact, two railroads commented on the low failure rate of the devices, indicating a failure rate of less than one percent. One railroad also mentioned that Canada requires speed to be reduced to 30 mph on trains which experience enroute failure of the two-way device; however, this commenter did not contend that Canada's requirement has produced the problems cited by the railroads. Thus, FRA feels the concerns raised by the railroads regarding a speed limitation for en route failures of the devices are not justified. Furthermore, allowing trains to continue with inoperative two-way EOT devices, at speeds that FRA feels require the added safety benefits provided by the devices, would expose both railroad employees and the public to potential harm that might be averted if this relatively new technology is available to the train crews. FRA also believes that attaching a material operational limitation to a failure of the device will materially increase the likelihood that such failures will be prevented through improved design and maintenance. D. Costs and Maintenance Both railroad and labor organizations agreed that the cost of new two-way EOT devices will be approximately $7,000 per unit, which includes both the front and rear units. The AAR and several railroads also stated that the cost of current one-way units is approximately $3,700 per unit. The AAR estimates that the total cost to the industry to replace currently used one-way devices with devices that have two-way capabilities will be approximately $150 million. Railroad representatives stated that existing rear units of one-way devices could not be upgraded to two-way capabilities, and although the front units of the one-way devices could be upgraded it was not cost effective. However, one railroad did state that it could retrofit its 1,500 existing front-end radio units at a cost of $740 each, for a total cost of $1.1 million, but stated that retrofitting the rear units was not feasible. Various railroad commenters provided approximate figures for equipping their fleets with two-way devices: Union Pacific estimated initial costs at $21 million and $2.4 million per year for replacement units; BN estimated the cost to replace its 1,400 one-way devices at $15 million; CSX Transportation estimated a cost of $17 million to acquire approximately 1,867 rear units and 2,687 front end receivers; Conrail estimated the cost to replace its 1,100 existing one-way devices at $10 million; Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe estimated the cost to upgrade front units and replace 650 rear one-way units at $5.6 million; and Norfolk Southern estimated its cost to convert to two-way devices at $2.7 million.
