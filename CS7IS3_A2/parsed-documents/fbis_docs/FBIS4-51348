This is a question worthy of serious exploration. I The 14th party congress decided a policy requiring that we encourage and develop individually run and private businesses and relax restrictions in terms of their operational scale, operational range, development proportion, and business targets so that the development of individually run and private businesses is further accelerated and they can play a positive role in terms of raising overall economic volumes, increasing fiscal revenue, and increasing employment channels. The problem at present is that many localities have not yet formed truly effective management methods, and this situation is not conducive to the healthy development of individually run and private businesses. 1. Seen from the angle of management targets, many localities implement the policy of "ruling through inaction." They generally do not include individually run and private businesses in regional development plans, and even if they are included, it is impossible to truly implement the plans. What is the reason for this? First, they dare not manage these enterprises. Many comrades are still afraid of "private" and "capitalist," and they consider "private" and "capitalist" to be the same thing. They think that creating conditions for the development of individually run and private operations and resolving their difficulties is intended to help private persons make money and become wealthy, which is the same as developing capitalism. Second, they consider that there is no need to manage them. Some comrades say that individually run private businesses come under the natural market economy, they are entirely free to decide on their own operations, and they must take responsibility for their own profits and losses. Thus, there is no need to manage them. Third, they are unwilling to manage them. Some localities believe that at present, individually run and private businesses are still quite weak, and, at present, the most important thing is to relax policies and reduce "intervention"; otherwise, "as soon as they are managed they will be strangled." Fourth, they are unable to manage them. Many comrades hold that at present new situations and new problems are emerging in an unbroken stream and it is difficult to manage even state-owned and collective enterprises, much less individually run and private businesses. 2. At present, the management structure is still in a quite confused situation. On the one hand, in their development, individually run and private businesses urgently need the guidance of information, need to attract skilled personnel, and need technological training, legal consultancy and other services. However, there is no one to supply them with these services. On the other hand, there are many departments which issue instructions and orders to individually run and private businesses and require them to pay levies. Thus, some individual operators and private entrepreneurs have closed down their businesses, some pay management fees to "foster" licenses and await opportunities, some attach themselves to organs and schools and don the "tag" of "township and small town enterprises", "school-run enterprises", "welfare enterprises" of "organic entities," and so on. Some simply operate without licenses. 3. Seen from management measures, it is still the case that mainly administrative management is used at present. A set of macroeconomic legal and economic management methods to oversee production and operation activities, exercise product quality supervision, and supervise the levying of taxation in respect of individually run and private enterprises has still not been formed. Thus, first, overall legal guarantees are absent. So far, there are only the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" and there is a lack of legal restraints on actions which violate the legitimate rights and interests of individually run and private enterprises or which interfere with their normal operational activities. Even if such activities are detected, there is no law with which to punish them. Individual merchants and operators of private businesses generally feel a lack of security, and they are unwilling to expand production. Second, a set of measures for the comprehensive economic management of individually run and private businesses has not yet been formed. While their development is now being encouraged, support and guidance is still far from sufficient, and even when the government does have some support measures, the phenomenon whereby policies are cut off and checked during implementation is very widespread. 4. Seen from the contents of management, three major problems exist: First, there is a tendency to stress "relaxation" and to "look lightly" on management. This is mainly seen in the relaxation of policies in many regions, and, in practical work, adopting a policy of "first relaxing and subsequently guiding and first developing and later improving." While this can, to a certain degree, mobilize the enthusiasm of individual and private businessmen, it can also bring chaos to economic order, spread improper and illegal practices, and increases the difficulty of standardized management. Second, "fines" are stressed and "education" is looked upon lightly. Some departments, in facing illegal phenomena, only engage in "stopping." They do not provide any "educational" measures in terms of how to operate legally, they do not provide any "guidance" measures in terms of which direction they should be developing in, and they do not provide any "assistance" measures in terms of helping them develop to higher levels. Third, stress is placed on building fair market structures, but little attention is paid to the coordinated fostering of market systems. The building of trade fair markets in various places indeed plays a role whereby "the building of a market in a place stimulates some industry, which invigorates the local economy and brings prosperity to the people." However, in comparison with trade fair markets, the various types of production factor markets clearly are insufficiently developed and, speaking in general, it is still difficult for individually run and private enterprises to obtain skilled personnel, technology, and raw materials through the market. 5. Seen from the management time sequence, in most cases management is "passive management." It is often the case that only when deviations and problems appear in individually run and private businesses, such as structural imbalances, the manufacture and sale of poor quality and fake goods, tax avoidance or evasion, scams and deceptions, and other types of illegal operational activities, and there is a need to investigate and punish, is any attention given to such businesses. Very rarely is there serious education and guidance given to them beforehand. 6. Seen from the results of management, there are a number of elements which need to be noted. First, the phenomenon of uneven development and particularly uneven development between regions is very serious. Some regions have even seen a downward trend. Second, the structure is not optimal. There is only a very small number of individually run and private enterprises which engage in deep-level processing of local agricultural and sideline products. Third, the scale is not large. Many individually run and private enterprises are mum-and-pop shops and factories or father-and-son operations, and very few of them are large, modern, mechanized producers. Fourth, illegal activities frequently occur and some individually run and private enterprises evade tax and avoid tax, manufacture fake and poor-quality products, engage in smuggling and dealing in smuggled goods and the manufacture and sale of pornographic books and videos, and so on. II The government's macroeconomic management of individually run and private businesses should be carried out through planning, coordination, service, guidance and education to help individually run and private businesses achieve an increase in scale, increase in grade, and increase in level. At the present stage, we should place stress on grasping the following aspects: 1. We must further change concepts to be able to properly deal with relationships in three respects. The first is the relationship between developing individually run and private businesses, and upholding the prime position of socialist public ownership. In our country, a situation has been formed where the public ownership economy occupies the prime position and diverse economic components see concurrent development. Major industries and businesses which affect the national economy and the people's livelihood are controlled by the state, and the appropriate development of individually run and private business will not shake the prime position of the public ownership economy. The second is the relationship between developing the public ownership economy and developing individually run and private businesses. Seen from the short term, after individually run and private businesses see development, it is inevitable that they will have a certain effect on the public ownership economy. However, seen from the long term, they will also force state-owned enterprises to change their operational modes and operational mechanisms and will result in them developing and achieving a higher level. Developing the public ownership economy cannot be realized through restricting the individually run and private economy. In the same way, developing individually run and private businesses cannot be realized by weakening the public-ownership economy. We must rely on both these components so that through competition, they will engage in mutual study and mutual borrowing, the strengths of one will make up for the weaknesses of the other, and they will see joint development. Third is the relationship between the contribution to society made by individually run and private businesses and the illegal activities which occur in their operations. Seen overall, the vast majority of the individual and private entrepreneurs are good, and they become wealthy through hard work and operating within the law. Those who engage in illegal activities constitute only a small minority. In order to promote the development of individually run and private businesses, governments at all levels should make overall plans and provide support in various respects. 2. Improving the external environment and creating fine conditions for production operations. 1. The public opinion environment. It is necessary through newspapers, radio and television broadcasts to make widely known the important role which individually run and private businesses play in social development. Wide publicity should be given to advanced model persons in such businesses so as to raise their social status and allow those operators who act in accordance with the law to engage in their production operations boldly and self-assuredly. 2. The legal environment. It is necessary to further perfect laws and regulations to clearly stipulate that the legitimate rights and interests of individually run and private businesses are protected and to specify responsibilities when the law is violated. Local ruffians and hoodlums who seize the assets of individually run and private businesses and interfere in normal production operations must be punished in accordance with the law. 3. The policy environment. At present, regions differ in the degree of relaxation of their policies in respect of individually run and private businesses. The coastal regions are more relaxed than the hinterland regions and the developed regions are more relaxed than the undeveloped regions. In future, we must continue to relax restrictions. First, we need to relax the operational range, and we should allow individually run and private businesses to operate in all industries and produce all products not restricted by state policies. Second, we should relax development proportions, and in accordance with the level of development of the productive forces in particular areas, such businesses should be allowed to develop as far as they can. There should not be any artificial development proportions imposed. Third, restraints on scale should be relaxed, and individually run and private businesses should be encouraged to develop trans-regional and trans-industry operations. They should also be allowed to contract, lease, merge with, or purchase state-owned enterprises and to run joint-fund cooperative enterprises. Fourth, restraints in terms of credit and tax reductions should be relaxed, and the tax burden of individually run and private enterprises should be brought closer to that of publicly owned enterprises. It might also be possible, in accordance with state industrial policies, to allow them to enjoy various tax reductions or tax remissions like state and collective enterprises. Banks should include individually run and private enterprises in their credit budgets and, if the operations of enterprises are in accord with state industrial policies and have good results, they should be given credit support. 4. The market environment. In accordance with the principle that the one who invests is the one who obtains the benefits, we should continue to encourage social investment in developing various types of markets, expand the range of these markets, and link them up with the national and international markets. It is particularly important to develop various types of production factor markets. 3. Strengthening management and education so that enterprises raise their own quality. First, it is necessary to strengthen the concept of law and strengthen the concept of business ethics so that these businesses operate in accordance with the law. Illegal activities by individually run and private enterprises not only harm society, but are also disadvantageous to the healthy development of such enterprises. In response, we should, on the one hand, rely on the government to strengthen education, and, on the other hand, rely on the law to seriously investigate and punish violations. In respect of the tax issue, in cases where tax exemption is appropriate, enterprise should be exempted from tax, while in cases where tax levying is appropriate, tax should be levied. We cannot blur the distinction between these two options. Second, we need to strengthen the market economy concept. Through mass organizations such as industrial and commercial federations, individual operators' associations, private business operators' associations, and so on, education and guidance can be strengthened, and these businesses can be assisted to speedily establish market economy concepts which are in accord with modern market competition. Third is raising the quality of management. It is necessary to strengthen training in management knowledge for individual operators and private entrepreneurs. They should be encouraged to join some business associations and societies to help them raise their management level. Fourth is raising the quality of science, technology, and culture. Relevant departments, while carrying out various types of cultural training, must draw in and encourage the participation of individual industrial and commercial operators and private entrepreneurs. 4. Strengthening coordinated services so that these enterprises develop in an orientation of productive, externally oriented enterprises which make full use of science and technology. First, it is necessary to sort out and reorganize individually run and private businesses. When individual industrial and commercial operators have achieved a certain scale and have the conditions for registration and issuance of a private enterprise license, they should be encouraged to change their registration. In respect of those who operate without a license, it is necessary to actively do good work to make it convenient for them to obtain a license. If they do not then seek a license, they should be firmly outlawed. In respect of those private enterprises which are still attached to collective economy units, it is necessary to clearly explain policies and separate them from the collective economy in accordance with the law so that they can travel a healthy road of development. Second, it is necessary to optimize structures. This will mainly involve information guidance and industrial policy guidance to help them effect changes in four respects: First, they should make the change to production enterprises, and, particularly, to enterprises engaged in deep-level processing of agricultural and sideline products and the manufacture of farming tools and equipment and other industries which serve agriculture so that they can travel a road where agriculture, industry, and trade are combined. Second, they must change towards becoming enterprises which make full use of science and technology. That is, they must adopt modern advanced science and technology, increase the scientific and technological content of products, raise the product grade, and realize prosperity through science and technology. Relevant government departments must actively develop technological consultancy and technological guidance. Third, they must change into enterprises which achieve economies of scale. On the one hand, they can be guided, on the basis of voluntary participation, to organize cooperative organizations, while on the other hand they can be guided to use their profits to expand reproduction and expand the scale of production. Relevant government departments must actively participate in feasibility studies and only if projects are in accord with state industrial policies should they be given support. Fourth, they should change into externally oriented enterprises. Relevant government departments must do well as "navigators" and support individually run and private enterprises to enter international markets. Departments should help enterprises to link up with foreign sales avenues, act as a bridge in drawing in foreign funds, and do well in consultancy work, such as investigating the funds situation of foreign businesses and providing information on the economic situation abroad. Those private enterprises with the conditions should be encouraged to set up companies abroad and they should be given autonomy in foreign trade.
