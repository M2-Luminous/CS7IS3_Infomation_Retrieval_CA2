Before his departure to Yugoslavia on Thursday [27 January] he wanted to gather information on their situation, to be able to forward their possible request to Belgrade. Kata Peli Nagy reports. [Peli Nagy] The Serbs of Hungary are also interested in the improvement of Serbian-Hungarian relations because they affect the situation of Serbs in Hungary in a favorable way. Therefore, Hungary's Serb minority of several thousand unanimously welcomes Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit, which is to take place the day after tomorrow. The chairman and deputy chairman of the Democratic Association of Serbs in Hungary told "Chronicle" a few minutes before the beginning of the ministerial meeting: The embargo against Serbia has made keeping contacts with the mother country much more difficult. The situation of teachers who came here to work is unresolved, cultural cooperation is difficult, and links which had been in place have partly been interrupted. If Jeszenszky intends to receive information on the situation of Hungary's Serbs--numbering about 5,000 to 10,000--the two representatives will raise, among other things, the question of constitutional cultural autonomy, since the Minority Law declares the right to cultural autonomy, but the rights of minorities in connection with this are unclear. To establish autonomy there is a need for a network of cultural institutions and, first and foremost, money. Peter Lasic, the deputy chairman of the association, said that, in their view, the return of Serb church properties would be delayed and the financial situation of the single Serb secondary school should be resolved as well, particularly since the split of the Serbo-Croat educational institution. The Serb minority representatives, as it is expected to happen in Belgrade too, will probably raise the unsettled matter of parliamentary representation [of minorities] as well.
