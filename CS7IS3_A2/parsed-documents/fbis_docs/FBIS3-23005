He said that the dogfight of the enemies and those lying in wait for us would only make us more determined to move forward to establish a good society, a society of values and decent morals. Lieutenant General al-Bashir made it clear in his speech before the masses during the holding of God's table [ma'idat al-rahman ayt -- breaking the fast for the poor] at Umm Baddah that the conspiracy of the West will not frighten us, because we know that power belongs to God alone. The shortage of funds, men and fruits [Koranic quote] to which we have been subjected is no more than a trial from God to test the extent of our adherence to his course and the extent of our turning towards him. He stated: We once again declare our rejection of all resolutions and charters of the security council and the United Nations which contradict God's law.
