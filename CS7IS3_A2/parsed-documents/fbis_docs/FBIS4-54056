Takemura, who heads the new party Sakigake [Harbinger], mentioned the Japanese political troubles during talks with U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, suggesting that Japan's political situation will evolve under one of three scenarios in the coming months. Under the first scenario, Takemura said, the cabinet would resign en masse after Diet passage of the budget, and under the second the House of Representatives would be dissolved for a snap election. Takemura also mentioned a third scenario, under which Hata may hold onto power after the passage of the budget by forming a majority cabinet with defectors from the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). "If June passes without enactment of the budget bills, the minority Hata cabinet will face a difficult situation," Takemura said. In Tokyo, Hata, in remarks to the lower house's Budget Committee, renewed a pledge Monday to seek passage of the budget by the end of the current Diet session on June 29. Takemura, whose party left the coalition government in April, also said "the next several months will be difficult to predict and (there will be) times when Japan's politics will change even further." Takemura served as chief cabinet secretary in the former coalition government headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, which captured power last August after 38 years of continuous LDP rule. Due to the sudden departure of the SDP and Sakigake, however, Hata was forced to start his premiership at the end of April leading the first minority government since 1955.
