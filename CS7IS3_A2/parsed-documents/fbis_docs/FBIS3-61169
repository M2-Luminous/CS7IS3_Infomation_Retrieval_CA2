If not daily, at least once a week another shipment of weapons from Europe or the United States arrives at the customs office. This is the official weapons trade, in addition to which there is also secret trading in weapons that is not visible to the state. Reliable sources indicate that there is at least one secret weapons route going through Estonia, which provides the Russian Mafia with weapons. This is how the system works. Some Estonian, on a business trip to the West, acquires a quantity of weapons from some weapons plant. These are usually purchased. Theft, especially in larger quantities, is not feasible. The crossing of the state border(s) can be accomplished in a number of ways. These include the use of expertly forged documents, hiding the weapons among those covered by permits, declaring them under a different product heading, or paying off the customs and the border guard. Once the weapons arrive in Estonia, they are turned over to a go-between, who knows only the person he is dealing with. Payment is made in advance and, most of the time, the buyer is also known, as orders for weapons are often placed in advance. Depending on the time of placing the order, delivery can take anywhere from one to three weeks. The go-between will not hold on to the weapons for long, he will also not take them home without a compelling reason. The buyer is chosen carefully, he must be recommended by someone. On the average, the dealer makes 500 kroons on the sale of one weapon, with individual variations, of course. Secret weapons are not cheaper than those sold in the stores. Instead, they are bound to be more expensive. Payment is in cash or U.S. dollars, Estonian buyers can also pay in kroons. To maintain secrecy, the transaction takes place in public. The seller calls the buyer, saying that he has something of interest to him, and arranges a meeting at a public place. The merchandise is wrapped up to look as shabby and as inconspicuous as possible. Russian Weapons Going Back To Russia Along with Western weapons coming into Estonia, comes the production of Russian weapon factories, mostly TT's and Makarov pistols. The weapons have clearly been stolen because, in Russia, this kind of merchandise is expensive and hard to come by. Strangely enough, the weapons brought in to Estonia are so cheap, that they reach a realistic sales price only after changing hands a few times. These are the weapons preferred by the Russian Mafia, in whose hands they travel back to the country of their origin. A smaller portion of weapons remains in Estonia. It is entirely possible to register them officially later, at a weapons store, for example, where they were 'left' on consignment. It is also possible to keep the unregistered weapon at home where, in case of getting caught, one can always say it belongs to some long-lost relative, dates back to wartime, or was found a long time ago. Forging a permit is not that difficult either. To this day, permits are printed on a conservative yellowish cardboard, with no security features. As it stands, no forgery complaints have reached the permit and license department of the Bureau of Field Police. The scope of underground weapons sales is suggested by one go-between who, during his year-and-a-half stay in the chain, said he handled the sale of some 500 weapons. He was selling mostly Russian weapons to the Russian Mafia, but he also bought and sold explosives, plastic bombs and chemical weapons. Among the weapons from the West, there were many Beretta and Smith & Wesson copies, coming from Brazil and Germany. No Point Engaging In Black Market Weapon dealers in Tallinn admit that there is no point engaging in illegal weapons sales, because weapons shipments crossing the border are checked out very carefully by customs and the police. Weapons shops are also checked frequently and without warning, according to inspector Sofia Trishkin of the Tallinn Field Police. "Both weapons and ammunition must be entered in the registry, where everything is kept by date, brand of weapon and quantity," Trishkin explained. "The book also has columns for sales, where the permit number of the buyer is entered, along with the expiration date, source document for identification, and address." Trishkin had not come across any deliberate shady dealings, all errors were made out of carelessness or ignorance. The illegal weapons route, however, offers a number of options to the dealers. One of them is to bring the weapons to Estonia as goods in transit, and leave them here. The other option is to pay off customs. Customs in Latvia, for one, have supposedly shown signs of their willingness to accept bribes. It has also been suggested that weapons are being brought in by police and defense forces, as they are checked less thoroughly in the customs than others. One version has it that Estonia's illegal weapons trade is emanates from the Russian army staying here. Protection Police Is Aware J�uri Pihl, director of Protection Police, thinks that the illegal trade in weapons is clearly traceable to the Russian army peronnel, trying to sell off weapons from the stockpile. "This year, we have recovered more than 50 pistols from them, 30 to 40 kilograms of explosives, and 20 cases of cartridges," Pihl said. He said it is quite realistic for the weapons trade to also muscle its way in across the border. Theoretically, it would also be possible for the weapons to be smuggled in by police and the defense forces. Even though searching for illegal weapons is not among the duties of Protection Police, they have confiscated weapons worth 11 million kroons this year. The biggest caché of secret weapons consisted of 2,500 TT's. Out of a total of 3,000, 500 had already been sold. "I think we are dealing with several groupings here, but since Estonia's own weapons market is not that big, the weapons are routed either to the East or to the South, where local fighting continues," Pihl speculated. The Protection Police has information on Russians buying weapons in Estonia, no violators have been caught. "There are also weapons shops in Russia that serve as a front, the whole weapons trade is quite well masked there," Pihl volunteered. "Besides, with the exception of Nagants [revolvers] and Makarovs, there is not much to be had. A high class criminal, however, prefers a better kind of a weapon, and these are the ones brought in from the Estonian side." Customs Not Bothered By Weapons The State Customs Office could not name a single shipment of secret weapons discovered this year. "I don't think that smuggling weapons is a serious problem for Estonia, certainly not judging by the information available to the Customs Office," said Vello Valm, head of the Customs Office monitoring section. Over the last six months, Valm has become suspicious, and turned to the police twice, but since the subsequent steps are outside of the jurisdiction of Customs, he has no feedback on whether or not a complaint was filed. Most misunderstandings have been on the level of insufficiently or improperly filled customs documents, which are usually resolved in favor of those bringing in the weapons. "When a shipment comes in, where all the documents are not in order, we naturally keep a close watch on it," said Valm and emphasized that weapons, including weapons in transit, are checked out with special thoroughness. "It is possible, of course, that weapons in transit are not shipped out, documents forged, or weapons hidden behind other merchandise," he admitted, but added that Customs cannot, and is not supposed to search every corner and every piece of merchandise, customs relies on the random checking method. Also, he does not know of any case of a customs official having been caught for taking bribes for weapons. Contemporary detection equipment makes it difficult to hide weapons when coming through custom checks at seaports and airports, it is much easier done for passengers traveling by train or car. Roughly a hundred illegal firearms, cold and chemical weapons have been confiscated this year, mostly from private individuals crossing the land border. Hence, it would also take a private individual who, as a buyer of weapons, could scuttle a well-planned transaction for weapons. But, so far, nothing of the kind has happened. The buyers prefer to keep quiet and get armed.
