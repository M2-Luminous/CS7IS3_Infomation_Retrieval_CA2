Ramos with domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live] [Excerpt] Ladies and gentlemen, let me first issue a statement on the situation in the Korean peninsula: The Philippines views with serious concern the categorical rejection by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Korea [as heard] of the appeal made by the United Nations Security Council in its non-binding call to Pyongyang, issued last week, to give the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, full access to its nuclear sites. We call on the Pyongyang government to favorably consider the request of the United Nations Security Council. We welcome reports that a Chinese delegation will visit North Korea next week to urge a negotiated settlement of the disputes over inspections of its nuclear sites. We have been calling for China to take a more meaningful role in this potential conflict in terms of impressing upon Pyongyang the need to comply with the nuclear inspection requirements of the IAEA. We also welcome reports that King Sihanouk of Cambodia is in Pyongyang for a visit and that it is possible that he will take up the matter of nuclear inspections. We see here the concerns and efforts of the entire region -- our Asia-Pacific region -- to ensure that the Korean nuclear issue be kept from escalating. We join the other countries in the region in calling for the Pyongyang government to take heed of our concerns and desires to maintain peace and stability in our region. We ask the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to be more forthright and to continue its dialogue with the Untied Nations as well as with South Korea and the United States. While the issues appear to be unresolved, we remain confident that there will be no outbreak of hostilities. [passage omitted)
