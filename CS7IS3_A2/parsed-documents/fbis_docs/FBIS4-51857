FBIS4-51857 "dreas086_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea Japanese Authorities' Treatment of Koreans Viewed Japanese Authorities' Treatment of Koreans Viewed `Grave Consequences' Discussed SK0305113994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1100 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305113994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries must ponder over the grave consequences arising from their unreasonable acts, stop the repression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and the Korean nationals in Japan and apologise for it, declares MINJU CHOSON today. The news analyst says: A sequence of savage repression by the Japanese reactionaries such as search of the hall of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branch offices and the houses of senior officials is a heinous hostile act to wantonly infringe on the democratic rights of Koreans in Japan and stifle Chongnyon and an intolerable provocation against the DPRK. Their repressive acts hitherto against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan are countless, but there had been no such wholesale search and rampage as the recent one. This clearly shows their anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign has reached a very grave stage. Chongnyon is a dignified and authoritative organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK which is engaged in righteous activities to defend the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan, achieve the reunification of the country and promote friendship with the Japanese people. Therefore, there is no ground for Chongnyon to be the target of repression. It is unpardonable for the Japanese authorities to join the United States and the South Korean puppets in the row over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and deliberately aggravate the situation, while resorting to vicious anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon acts. Their reckless acts are aimed at blocking the legitimate activities of Chongnyon, controlling and restricting the life of Koreans in Japan and impairing the just peace policy of the DPRK at any cost. However, it will bring into relief their inferiority and ferocity.
