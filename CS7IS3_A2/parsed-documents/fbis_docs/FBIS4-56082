The cargo is for UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units and reportedly it also contains humanitarian aid for the Muslim side, it was learned today in circles of the republic of Srpska army. It has been agreed with UNPROFOR's mediation that one representative of the republic of Srpska army will inspect every plane cargo. However, since the agreement was cancelled, cargo has continued to arrive by planes with no control. No one has said anything about what will happen to the agreement. This example shows how much the Muslims care to substantiate the assurances that no military equipment is being shipped to Tuzla airport, that is, how much goodwill there is to take part in peace processes, the republic of Srpska army circles say.
