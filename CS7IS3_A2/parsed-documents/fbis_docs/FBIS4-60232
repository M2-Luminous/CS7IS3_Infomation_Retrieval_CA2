Announcing the secession from the north after one of the bloodiest days of fighting since the conflict began, the south's leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid said in a televised address: "I proclaim the creation of the Yemeni Democratic Republic as an independent state with its capital in Aden." The declaration came just a day before the fourth anniversary of the unification of North and South Yemen and hours after the north called a three-day ceasefire. The two sides, locked in a political crisis since August 1993, have been at war since May 4. Al-Bid said the decision to break away resulted from attempts by his bitter northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to "destroy the south" by means of war, and his refusal to countenance dialogue on the basis of a bilateral reconciliation document signed February 20 in Amman. He said the new state, which he called on "friendly" countries to recognize in line with international norms, would be governed by the same constitution as that in force in the north. It would base its legislative system on Islamic Shari'ah law, he added. He also announced the formation of a Council of National Salvation comprising elected southern deputies, representatives of political parties and religious figures, which will choose a Presidential Council and an interim government, adding that multi-party elections would be held within a year. Al-Bid, Salih's sacked vice president and the leader of South Yemen prior to unification, said the new state was committed to respecting "political and public freedoms, human rights and freedom of expression and of the press," and would maintain a liberal economic system. The announcement prompted spontaneous celebratory gunfire throughout the southern port city, correspondents said. It was also backed early Saturday by 'Abd-al-Rahman Al-Jifri, leader of the opposition Sons of Yemen movement, who told AFP the union "could not continue under (the Sanaa) regime," which had sought to control it "by use of force". Salih's General People's Congress and Al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party had formed a fragile governing coalition after April 1993 elections. The declaration came after a day of bitter fighting amid increasing pressure from Arab leaders for an end to hostilities. Hours earlier the government in Sanaa called a three-day ceasefire as of Saturday 00:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT), the SABA' news agency said. Northern leaders presented the truce as offering "a last chance to the (southern) separatists ... to end their rebellion, adhere to the constitution and place their troops under the command of the head of state" in Sanaa. Earlier in the day Salih seemingly ignored appeals from Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat to lay down arms for the 'Id Al-Adha feast, which starts Saturday. But in Mukallah, 700 kilometers (450 miles) east of Aden, Al-Bid ruled out any form of surrender and vowed "not to give up a single inch of our territory in the south." In a radio speech he said Salih was "trying to get his hands on Aden and the oil-rich eastern provinces and we are not going to let him have either Aden or the oil." A spokesman for the southern forces here said 1,500 northern troops had been killed Friday in the Kharaz region west of Aden while trying to advance on the city. The death toll, which was not confirmed by the north, was the largest daily loss announced since the fighting broke out. Earlier Friday northern forces claimed to have made further progress in advancing on Aden. The southern army had also retaken control of the key Al-'Anad airbase 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden, the spokesman said, although earlier in the day Sanaa said its forces controlled the airbase. Despite unification in 1990, the north and south have persisted in retaining separate security forces, civil services and bureaucracies.
