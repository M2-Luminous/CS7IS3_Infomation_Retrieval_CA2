The actual aim of this delegation was to ensure Azerbaijan's participation in the international Partnership for Peace program and in the military and political consultations. Republic President Geydar Aliyev told the guests that the meeting will be useful, and added that this visit to Baku by a high-ranking delegation shows NATO's enormous interest in Azerbaijan, and that we will try to carefully listen to your views and proposals and discuss them in a spirit of cooperation. Tugay Ozseri said that NATO adopted the Partnership for Peace program at the beginning of the year and that any country could freely become a member of NATO's new structure within the framework of this program. So far Ukraine, Moldova, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have signed this agreement. It is expected that Russia and Georgia will also join NATO's new program. But, as a country waging a war, what will Azerbaijan expect or gain from the endorsement of this plan? The head of the delegation and its members gave an unequivocal reply to this question, which was of interest to all those present at the meeting. The military alliance that they represent favors the defense of the territorial integrity of any independent state, it only holds military and political consultations and acts as a mediator in providing humanitarian assistance. Geydar Aliyev reiterated that NATO's new structure is of enormous importance for Azerbaijan, and this is how he expressed his views on the subject: [Aliyev] We know about NATO's appeal to the independent states, which were members of the former Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union, and its decision to accept their response. We want to clarify certain matters and establish our Republic's final position regarding this decision. Undoubtedly, we welcome as very positive the declaration of the Partnership for Peace established within such a major organization as NATO. That is, we regard it as being very positive. This program is probably more important and urgent for our Republic than it is for the other countries that have joined it. This is because, as you know, Azerbaijan is in a war with Armenia. You yourselves indicated that 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands are under the occupation of the Armenian Armed Forces. The war is still continuing. Therefore, I reiterate that the enlistment in the program put forward by NATO, which is one of the most respected and prestigious international organizations, is very important in solving our problems. Therefore, in joining this program it must be clear what Azerbaijan will gain. You noted that the benefits primarily rest in the fact that we will be in this organization, that is, we will have our representatives in this organization, that it will be possible to hold political consultations with this organization, and that certain problems might be taken into consideration in the bilateral agreement that will follow the signing of this program. We are interested in seeing the emergence of such possibilities for Azerbaijan, and we will appraise them. However, our demands go beyond these possibilities. And such demands are only natural, because as I noted we are in a war and our lands are under occupation. It will be inappropriate not only for Azerbaijan but also for NATO if we fail to solve this problem despite being, if not fully, almost a member of this most powerful military and political organization in the world. It is obvious that since its establishment, there has been no military conflict or discord between NATO countries. This is only natural, and that is how it should be, because countries that are members of a major political and military alliance cannot fight amongst themselves. But unfortunately, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia started when they were still two republics within a single Soviet state, let alone a mere alliance. The state failed to prevent this conflict. Now, Azerbaijan is a member of the newly formed CIS, you know this. Armenia was a member of CIS from the day of its inception. Could you imagine that despite being members of this union and having signed a collective security treaty within this union, the two states are at war? I declared during the Ashgabat meeting of the CIS heads of state on 24 December 1993 that such a situation is abnormal, and I requested that the states signatory to the collective security treaty come together and look into this matter. However, no positive result has been achieved. It could be that the CIS is still young and has little experience. Whereas, such a major organization as NATO established in 1949 has accumulated enormous experience, and maybe it can find an opportunity to help us after we join this Partnership for Peace program. We invited you here to clarify these matters, and I would have wished that regarding these matters you [changes thought]. I know that it is not possible to deviate from certain long-established principles of this organization, but a new program has now been drawn up. You said that 12 states have already signed this program. But, they probably do not have such a problem, whereas we do. Armenia also has such a problem. However, Armenia might approach this problem from a different angle, because its aggressiveness is obvious; it is the aggressor, and is occupying another state's territory. Whereas, we are victims of an aggression. In drawing your attention to these matters, I want to reiterate that we consider the Partnership for Peace program as being very useful. We, too, want to sign and became partners in this program. However, in view of present conditions in our Republic, we consider it important to clarify certain matters. In this connection, you already noted that our foreign minister has spoken to you about military budget and other matters. I hope that our ties in this direction will continue, and I hope that we will arrive at a consensus. [Unidentified reporter] Republic Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, Turkish Ambassador to Azerbaijan Altan Karamanoglu, and State Adviser Vafa Gulizade also participated in the meeting. [end recording]
