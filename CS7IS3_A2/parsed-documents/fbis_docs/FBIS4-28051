The province has also used more than $4.5 million to carry out more than 100 projects to help stabilize their daily life. These include projects in vocational training, improving public health, building schools, roads, bridges, and power stations; and promoting fishery and handicraft production and so forth. During the past five years, Haiphong has launched programs to provide jobs for local workers, including 4,000 repatriated Vietnamese. The province's 25 vocational training centers have trained more than 7,800 repatriatees or 90 percent of those in the working age group. Many have been granted loans to set up their own businesses and they are doing well. Haiphong has also closely coordinated with international organizations abroad and echelons and sectors at home to prevent and finally stop illegal departures by Vietnamese. It has made preparations to receive more repatriated Vietnamese and mapped out plans to help them quickly stabilize their daily life and to settle in with the local community.
