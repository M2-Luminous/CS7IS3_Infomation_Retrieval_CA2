For example, 50 escort motorcycles arrived from Santa Fe de Bogota, and a month ago, for greater tranquility, the Colombian military met with the heads of security for each of the visiting presidents. The last preparations for the security plan resulted from these meetings. Even though the plan was for the city not to appear to be militarized, it is impossible to camouflage the work being done on the ground, in the air, and on the water by the 3,000 men who are responsible for ensuring the safety of the visiting heads of state.
