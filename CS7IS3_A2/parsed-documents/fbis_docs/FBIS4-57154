Uncertainly has prevailed for months among the Cuban people regarding the fate of medical supplies, and Public Health Minister Julio Teja today outlined goals for this sector by proposing ways to turn back the difficult situation concerning the availability of medicine. In addition to controls, the Cuban authorities intend to raise the national production of medical products and to give more support to herbal medicine, which, as is well-known, represents an international tendency to use medicinal plants and natural products. Until recently, "transient dealers" were frequently seen on the island demanding exorbitant prices for medical products that are in high demand and, in fact, do not exist in state-owned facilities. Although the country's situation is critical, the health minister explicitly referred to the allocation of convertible currency that will enhance imports in a much more efficient and independent way. The government faces a dilemma concerning the possibility of purchasing approximately 352 medical products that are considered "essential" for people's health, but the creation of a new budget for this purpose seems to clear any doubts. According to Teja, the pharmaceutical industry's production plan already has a sizable part of the raw materials, with an estimated value of 84 million pesos (on a par with the dollar at the official exchange rate), which represents an increase for this sector over last year. The goal is to match production levels reached in 1992, when the scarcity of medicine was not so critical. Since 1959, the situation in Cuba's medical-pharmaceutical industry has always been a state priority. Before then, the national market contained more than 40,000 registered pharmaceutical products. More than 80 percent of these were manufactured by foreign firms, mainly U.S. firms. The country's laboratories continued to purchase raw materials primarily from the United States, but, given that nation's dispute with the island, U.S. companies began to cut their supplies until they were completely suspended. Despite the restrictions, Cuba's pharmaceutical sector has managed to manufacture, from start to finish and by using genetic engineering, medical products such as recombinant streptoquinate [estreptoquinasa recombinante], which prevents heart attacks; the first vaccine against type-B meningitis; and the epidermic growth factor. The Patents and Licenses Office in the United States, the country which has obstructed Cuba's medical and biotechnological development for more than 35 years, registered three Cuban patents in 1993 alone. The office recognized the originality of these products, and Cuba is the only country in the world that has the methodology and technology to manufacture them. Regarding five future technologies, the Cubans are world leaders in the most important ones, biotechnology and genetic engineering, with an estimated market of $200 billion within six years. Although the Cuban state places no restrictions on the protection of health assets, it does intend to grant priority to the distribution and control of medicine.
