Financing Changes Advances in technology have raised the cost of medical care because they have permitted the treatment of more complex cases. As the cost of providing such care exceeded the ability of most individuals to pay, a third party joined the hospital-patient relationship. This third party initially was a private insurance plan that helped individuals share the risk of costly illness. In 1965, the government joined the payer mix with the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For many years, government and private payers collected funds and distributed payments to hospitals for the care of their beneficiaries, but did not become involved in decisions relating to the services that were provided, the site of care, or the type of provider. Payments to providers were made on the basis of costs or charges, which allowed revenues to increase directly as costs rose. But with health care expenditures accelerating much more rapidly than general inflation, insurance premiums grew markedly. This not only threatened the ability and willingness of employers to fund higher premiums, but also affected individuals by driving up out-of-pocket payments for many services. Third-party payers responded by seeking ways to slow the growth_particularly that in hospitals because they had high costs per case and accounted for a major share of total health care spending. Responding to skyrocketing government payments. Medicare in the early 1980s replaced cost-based hospital payment with the prospective payment system. This system allowed Medicare to reduce the growth of its hospital payments. While some private insurers were also able to control payment growth, most were not. Hospitals have attempted to generate revenue to cover losses from uncompensated care and below-cost payments for Medicaid and Medicare patients by raising charges to private insurers. This practice is called ``cost shifting.'' In addition, hospitals have actively sought other sources of revenue. In 1981 net revenue gains from private insurers equaled 5.0 percent of total hospital costs, while in 1991 this figure had risen to 11.6 percent (see Table 1&hyph;2). This largely offset losses from Medicare, which increased from 1.0 percent to 4.4 percent, and from Medicaid, which rose from 0.7 percent to 2.3 percent of total costs. Depending on their payer mix, however, hospitals differ in their ability to cost shift. Those with large uncompensated care patient populations and few generously paying privately insured patients, for example, have had limited ability to cost shift. By contrast, other types of hospitals_particularly those with a large proportion of privately insured patients_have found it easier to cost shift.
