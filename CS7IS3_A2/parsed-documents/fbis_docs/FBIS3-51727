FBIS3-51727 "drlat016__a94011" FBIS-LAT-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Belize Workers Party Candidate Lula Interviewed PY1901193294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 16 Jan 94 p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1901193294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Interview with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva by Celia Cahim and Gilberto Nascimento on 13 January; place not given] [Text] [JORNAL] How will the two events that recently occurred in the ABC [Santo Adre, Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Caetano do Sul, industrial area] -- namely the murder of trade unionist Oswaldo Cruz Junior and the attack on two trade unionists linked to Cruz which took place a week later -- affect your candidacy? [Lula] The sectors that seek to implicate the PT [Workers Party] do so precisely because they expect it will adversely affect my image and standing in public opinion polls. We wish to tell the public that moves like this against the PT have been attempted several times in the past, even to the abduction of Abilio Diniz in 1989. I do not expect any of my political enemies to sing my praises. I have no illusions about that. What concerns me is that there seems to be no hurry to capture the murderer so that he can explain why he did it. With regard to the alleged attack [on the trade unionists], there are also very contradictory reports. We will once again circumvent the problem and prove that this dirty trick on the PT, which began immediately prior to the elections in 1989, has now been restarted nine months before the next elections. [JORNAL] Do you think you took too long to react to allegations concerning the PT's involvement in these events? [Lula] No. Following my political strategy, and out of respect for his widow, Valeria [Cruz], I had no interest whatsoever in getting involved in an altercation when the deceased had not even been buried. Furthermore, I believe the truth will out. It is already coming into the open via some odd coincidences -- the same police superintendent of the Diniz case is involved, the same accusations are being leveled by the same enemies, and the same insinuations are being made by the press. Fortunately, these two cases will be settled in a speedy fashion. Once Zeze [Jose Benedito de Souza] is arrested, we will know who is who in this story. The same old vultures, who were thirsting for prey, are already leaving. [JORNAL] Following that line of thought, you can expect to come under intense fire until October. Are you ready to face, let us say, another issue similar to the one involving Miriam Cordeiro? [who named Lula on television as the father of her child] [Lula] If I were not prepared, I would not be a candidate. I base my actions on the following premise: When voters cast their votes in the ballot-box, they choose the candidate who can solve the problems that confront their country, city, or state. They are not interested in his private life. [JORNAL] But you are dealing with people who have not gone to the polls for 30 years and therefore lack that degree of political maturity. [Lula] I will lead my campaign at the highest possible level. This will entail a certain degree of politicization of our society. We will not play the game the same way as our adversaries. We will not exploit everything that pertains to political charges. I am not interested to know whether a person drank or not, or whether he smoked marijuana when he was young. That is his problem, not mine. [JORNAL] And yet, your adversaries are interested in learning about and publicizing your past indiscretions. [Lula] I have no problem with that. They can do as they please. I cannot campaign for the presidency with fear. If the people want a program that provides solutions for the problem of hunger, health care, agricultural policy, and income distribution, they have a candidate. If they want to vote for those who practice foul play, I will be deeply sorry because Brazil will fare worse at the end of the century than at the beginning. [JORNAL] Is the Brazil you envisage a socialist state? [Lula] No. We want to implement a government program which, regardless of its name, understands the need to resume a different type of growth from the one that characterized the 1970's and to implement an income distribution policy. We cannot just emulate European or U.S. development models. We need a national development program to help transform the 150 million Brazilians into citizens. [JORNAL] Are you a socialist? [Lula] I do not like labels. I am a lathe operator and a mechanic. The PT does not intend to govern the country following a socialist-style model. We are separating what is a strategic program, a dream of society, a utopia, from a five-year government program. If we manage to solve our basic problems, we will undoubtedly bring about a revolution -- regardless of its name. [JORNAL] What is the difference between the program of the PT and the others? [Lula] We are going to do the obvious. We guarantee that within five years all children of school age will be attending school. We guarantee that within five years there will be a health system under which people will not be treated like animals. We guarantee that this country will produce 150 million tonnes of grain, instead of making a lot of fuss about our present 70 million-tonne production. Each person will have the right to three meals a day. These are basic things which, if accomplished, would be tantamount to a revolution. People keep discussing privatization, nationalization, opening borders, etc. when reality shows that our people are famished, unemployed, and overcome by despair. [JORNAL] But important sectors want answers for those issues that you relegate to second place, seeking to assure governability. [Lula] Nobody will close our borders, but by the same token, nobody will open the sluices so that our country becomes a duty-free zone. This is why we want to devise a national project to provide a strong industry and import quotas. It is all very well to talk about opening our borders, but it would be even better to know who will solve the problem of unemployment in Brazil. The role of the state is to find a way to create more jobs. Brazil cannot be a modern country with only 30 million consumers. It will become a modern country when children have shoes, schooling, milk, and health care. This is the project we want to implement and that everybody promises to further during the election campaign. [Former President Fernando] Collor said that his modernization project would place our country on a same footing as France. The truth is that we resemble Ethiopia. One need only look under the bridges. [JORNAL] In your view, what is modernity? [Lula] It is not the modernity of Norwegian codfish or imported cars. Those who can afford to buy an imported car may do so. Nevertheless, our priority is that people may be able to eat, work, and live decently. This is the miracle we want to perform in Brazil and we are convinced that it may be accomplished. [JORNAL] Is it possible to accomplish that miracle in just five years? [Lula] Part of it can be accomplished in five years. We can set goals to be attained in two, three years. We will ensure that Macapa city dwellers, for example, do not have to eat tomatoes from Sao Paulo. Our agricultural policy should create green belts around each city so that people may obtain their staples at more reasonable prices. [JORNAL] What would you tell those who fear that your victory might be the victory of an old-style socialist? In past elections, your adversaries convinced some of the electorate that you were going to divide three-bedroom apartments. [Lula] The most reactionary sectors think like that, but society already knows the PT administrative experience. There was a time when a politician could distinguish himself by building a great viaduct, but that is over. The people want to know: Is my street paved? Does it have a sidewalk? Brazil needs an about-face. [JORNAL] How will this about-face affect the financial sector? [Lula] During a meeting with bankers, I told them that banks will continue to operate normally, but that the financial system cannot continue to fuel inflation as a way to make more money. In the industrialized world, banks have a 4-percent participation in the GDP, whereas in Brazil that percentage goes as high as 13 percent. Here, the Central Bank makes money through speculation, the Social Security makes money through speculation. Many people foster speculation to make money. [JORNAL] How can one check this? [Lula] The financial system must be convinced that it can make money by supporting the productive sector. I intend to discuss with the financial system an agreement to extend the profile of the government's domestically contracted debt. In Italy, the domestic debt represents 5 percent of the GDP while inflation runs at 6 percent. Here in Brazil, our domestic debt represents 24 percent of the GDP and the inflation stands at 40 percent a month. The basic difference is the time-frame of the rescheduling of the debt. Italian securities have a 20-year or 30-year maturity; here one has to pay every three months. [JORNAL] What have you discussed with representatives of foreign companies and businessmen? [Lula] I have told them of the great harm we can cause by obliging them to double their production. We do not want to continue to be a country with 30 million consumers. I have explained that we do not want to act like hustlers in the dead of the night acting without agreements. We want to establish clear rules of the games with businessmen and workers, and demand that these rules be obeyed. Sometimes I prefer a gentleman's agreement to a law. We will work to encourage foreign capital to invest in Brazil. Obviously, I cannot implement a program to only please Volkswagen. I must implement a program to please the 150 million Brazilians, a program in which the neediest will take priority over the rest. [JORNAL] How will you tackle the privatization issue? [Lula] Strategic industries will continue to be owned by the state. We want public companies, not state-owned enterprises. Why public? Because they will not have a huge payroll nor will they be obsolete. They will be modern companies that offer better services. I have time and again said that oil is strategic; so much so that the United States did not hesitate to spend $30 billion on the war against Iraq to preserve its international reserves. The current telecommunications system, in which the state retains control while freeing the production of equipment, is interesting. We will not engage in a drive that may render the state vulnerable. With regard to the privatization of highways, entrepreneurs are interested in the Dutra, Anchieta, Imigrantes, and Bandeirantes highways. Nobody wants the Rio de Janeiro-Bahia highway to be privatized. Why don't businessmen create a pool [previous word in English] to construct new highways and then manage them? They should repatriate the money that they have invested abroad. [JORNAL] You are criticized for your lack of administrative experience and for not having a regular job. What do you have to say about this? [Lula] Recalling Collor's experience, I may venture to say that I do not envy the administrative experience of the Brazilian elite. The purchasing power of the workers declined by 50 percent since 1985 and 32 million people live in squalor. What administrative experience are we talking about? The experience of hiring building contractors for great public works just to collect the bribes they offer is not and will not be the slogan of my government campaign. I am proud to say that I am an official working for my party. I work at least 10 times harder than when I was a metallurgist. [JORNAL] Who will fund your election campaign? [Lula] We hope to obtain contributions from people and firms. We will open a bank account to receive contributions. We will do everything above board and tell businessmen -- those who want to contribute to my campaign do not have to do so via a secret account. [JORNAL] Public opinion polls show that 30 percent of the people would vote for you. Do you believe you have already won the election? [Lula] No. The election campaign begins after the party conventions, when all the parties register their candidates. And yet to head the polls for such a long time, withstanding the vollies of taunts I have to endure, really shows that my candidacy is very strong. I am convinced that we will win in a runoff. If we work in an upright manner we may score an election victory in the first round. One should be aware that the game is just beginning, that everything remains to be done, and that one is not successful at the polls until after the vote count is over. [JORNAL] Against whom will you fight the runoff? [Lula] I am not concerned with choosing adversaries. Part of the elite, the most conservative one, is an orphan. For all its efforts, it has no candidate. I have no doubt that these elections will be hotly contested. There will be at least five or six candidates and I do not know who I would like to face in the runoff. I would rather defeat them all in the first round. [JORNAL] If you are elected president you will have to confront pressures from both the elite and the working class. [Lula] We are well aware that on one hand an elite force will pressure us in an attempt to hinder us from governing, while on the other hand millions of workers will pressure us to overcome in three months problems that have not been solved for centuries. We are not going to wait until the campaign is over to start holding talks. This is why we want to draft a very feasible program. Pressure is important and is a peculiar trait of democracy. [JORNAL] But, does the PT have cadres to govern? [Lula] Following the cabinets of Collor, Itamar Franco, and Jose Sarney, saying that the PT does not have cadres is a bit of a joke. For each of their cadres, we have 10. But I do not intend to form a government only from PT cadres. I will look for people outside the party who are honest, able, and politically aware of the social problems confronting the country. We want to form alliances not only to win the elections but also to rule the country. [JORNAL] Will you demand guarantees from the military? [Lula] I am going to talk with the military. I want to hold talks with the Army, Navy, and Aeronautics ministers because they represent consolidated and necessary institutions. I want to know their views about Brazil and about the problems of each branch of the Armed Forces. I am going to take that initiative and try to discuss things at the War College; but I am not going to demand guarantees, because the role of the Armed Forces is defined in the Constitution. [JORNAL] What can you say to dispel any misgivings about Lula's government. [Lula] Entrepreneurs could have misgivings if the PT were involved in corrupt practices, if it were involved the Budget Committee, or if public works were over invoiced. To be afraid of honesty is sui generis. There is no need for anybody to be afraid. [JORNAL] And yet, the left wing of the PT even scares the middle class. [Lula] The left wing of the PT is necessary. Any party with any self-respect has a left and a right wing. We do not want to be a government with a subservient party. We want society to nudge us all the time. The PT government does not wish to become the prisoner of that glass case called Planalto Palace.
