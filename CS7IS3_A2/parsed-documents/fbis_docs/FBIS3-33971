The Palestinian ambassador updated the prime minister on the negotiations on the Palestinian track, particularly with regard to the Davos meetings between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. In a statement to reporters after the meeting, Kamal said that the Palestinian leadership has made no concessions during the Davos talks. He added that the Davos talks resulted in a convergence of views on the arrangements pertaining to security and withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Sa'id Kamal said that the Palestinian and Israeli sides agreed on a two-month withdrawal period, during which negotiations will continue, and a four-month period for the implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted] The Palestinian ambassador indicated that the implementation of the arrangements pertaining to security and withdrawal is contingent upon the key decisionmaker in Israel; that is, the prime minister. Kamal added: Nonetheless, out of a high sense of responsibility, I would like to tell Rabin: Enough is enough. What we have offered in Cairo and Davos should prompt both sides to sign an agreement on the arrangements to be made. Once this is achieved, the drafting committee can start its work to finalize relevant issues before the start of troop withdrawal. Kamal went on to say: In the aftermath of the meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo, the Israeli rulers have been procrastinating a great deal over implementation. [passage omitted] In response to a question, Kamal said: We and Jordan are a single body, regardless of the summer clouds that may appear on the horizon. This will remain the case regardless of whether or not certain parties like it.
