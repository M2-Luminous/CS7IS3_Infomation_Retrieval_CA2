By responding in this way, Albania is showing that it respects the choice of dialogue and is committed to finding ways to normalize relations with Greece. While this meeting was held in Tirana, it has been learned that the Greek Foreign Ministry summoned Albanian Ambassador Hysen Cabej to an urgent meeting at the Greek Foreign Ministry and notified him that the diplomatic staff should be reduced from five diplomats to four. Such a fact, which runs counter to statements by Greek Government officials on finding a way to dialogue and cooperation, cannot but surprise anyone. After this, it is somewhat difficult to understand the messages coming from Athens.
