During their unsuccessful campaign, thousands of young Sikhs were killed by the Indian Army, the Border Security force, and the police. Most of those killed were young people who lived near the Indo-Pakistani border. These young men were killed because it was suspected that they had or could have some kind of relationship with Pakistan. During this campaign, the Indian Army had to raid the holy shrine of the Golden Temple because the terrorist Sikhs had made this place of worship the center of their activities. The decision to raid the Golden Temple was definitely a very difficult decision for the New Delhi government. It required a lot of courage, which they had. The Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi became a prey of the Sikhs' revenge. However, the Sikhs had to pay a very heavy price for this vindicative action. Thousands of Sikhs were killed by the Hindus in New Delhi and other large cities. The Sikh terrorists started a rampage of killing when the campaign for the Azad Khalistan appeared to be dying. This series of actions gave a very bad name to the Sikh movement. The negative reaction to the killing of innocent women and children further weakened this campaign. The number of Sikhs who became tired and began to oppose this campaign increased gradually. The terrorists were forced to leave their areas of operation and the state. The Azad Khalistan campaign died when they dispersed. The Indian Government has also accused Pakistan of helping these separatist elements. At one time, the United States had warned Pakistan that if it did not stop helping the fighters in East Pakistan and Kashmir then it would be included on the list of nations that sponsor terrorism. General Ziaul Haq doubtlessly sympathized with the Khalistan campaign. He felt that the establishment of Azad Khalistan would encourage separatist movements in other Indian states and would weaken India. This would then ensure Pakistan's safety and security. Additionally, the establishment of Azad Khalistan would also help resolve the Jammu-Kashmir problem according to Pakistan's wishes. General Ziaul Haq's plan was based on sincere desires; however, it was not very practical. Had India felt a need to start a war with Pakistan in order to crush the Azad Khalistan campaign, it would not have avoided it. Moscow, Washington, and New Delhi were equally relieved at General Ziaul Haq's death in the airplane accident in Bahawalpur. Moscow and Washington were relieved because General Ziaul Haq was thinking about establishing a government according to his own desires in Afghanistan, being called the conqueror of Afghanistan,' and becoming a Caliph in this region against their wishes. The former Soviet Union and the United States did not like Ziaul Haq's plans; they were afraid of his designs. President Zia's death also satisfied New Delhi because he was considered a zealous and sincere supporter of the Azad Khalistan movement. U.S. pressure increased after President Zia's death and the Azad Khalistan campaigners were gradually disappointed. This movement became totally weak in the end, and the accusation that Pakistan was helping the Sikhs was also taken back to an extent. U.S. government spokesmen have admitted that the help being given to the freedom fighters across the Control Line has also been curtailed considerably or is almost nominal. The fact is that Pakistan and India have made such arrangements on the Control Line that entry of armed persons into Kashmir is extremely difficult if not impossible. Caravans of refugees from occupied Kashmir are coming into Azad Kashmir. This has been made possible because India wants this course of exodus to continue. No movement for independence can survive long without the resources needed. The Afghans were able to fight the U.S. war in the name of their jihad against the former Soviet Union for eight years because large scale assistance from the United States and its allies via Pakistan was filtered in to them continuously. Modern American weapons were supplied to the Afghans in huge quantities. Money was spent like water and food was provided regularly. The former Soviet Union was forced to retreat from Afghanistan, not only because the Afghan war proved to be too expensive for Moscow, but because it was spending much beyond its means on its space war (Star War) program in order to keep up with the United States. The Soviet Union went bankrupt because of the combined demands of the space war technology and the Afghanistan war. The Kashmir freedom fighters have been confronting the Indian Armed Forces for more than three years. Their courage is commendable and their sacrifices should be venerated. However, when they do not receive any help from abroad and the number of Indian soldiers fighting them continues to increase, it would not be fair to expect these freedom fighters to continue their struggle for a long time. Fifty-five Kashmiri had gathered in the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar and Indian soldiers had surrounded them. They could not endure this siege for more than one month. There were 12 freedom fighters among these 55 persons, and they had all kinds of weapons. Had they broken the siege to face the Indian troops, all of them would have been killed, and the armed freedom fighters would also have been accused of killing innocent citizens. The besieged people in Hazratbal decided to surrender and the Indian government released the unarmed Kashmiris. Prudence dictated that the armed freedom fighters who had surrendered should not be treated inhumanly. The Indian record on human rights violations is very bad. Even the United States and Europe have started to criticize India about it. Pakistan is not mollified by the condemnation of India over human rights. It is worried about increased loss of life among the freedom fighters. It is clear from the news that the repeated strikes in trade centers in Srinagar and other places in the valley have caused scarcity of food and medicine. Even more distressing is the news about fighting between the pro-Pakistani group and those who want an independent Kashmir. The elements who want an independent Kashmir are trying to put pressure on those who want Kashmir to join Pakistan. No thoughtful Pakistani would criticize the Pakistani Government for not providing assistance to the freedom fighters. It would be difficult to provide reinforcement with weapons even when Pakistan is willing to do that. India has taken effective measures to close almost all routes. If Pakistan decides to cross the Control Line to help the freedom fighters, it would definitely lead to a war with India and Pakistan would be blamed for it. The United States will join the accusers and Pakistan will be severely punished for starting a war. Pakistan will not be able to bear the burden if the United States and India decide to punish Pakistan for helping the Kashmiris. In light of the imposing presence of the United States and its allies' air and naval forces in the Gulf after the war against Iraq, we can expect the United States to use its full force against Pakistan if it is necessary. Although Pakistan has frozen its nuclear program, and, according to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's claim, the present government has also rolled the program back, the United States and Japan are still not satisfied. The way Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had repudiated Nawaz Sharif's claim has also complicated the issue. A few days ago, when it was confirmed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen, there was also the good news that the countries helping Pakistan were going to provide it about $3.5 billion in aid. However, the United States officially announced on 19 November 1993 that all USAID offices in Pakistan will be closed by the end of 1995. Mr. Brian Edward, the chief of USAID has openly announced that the USAID offices in Pakistan are being closed as a punishment for Pakistan's nuclear program. Mr. S. Katajima, who heads the agency that decides Japanese government's policy on economic and technical aid, visited Islamabad last week. After talks with top level representative of Pakistani government, he said at a news conference that the Japanese government is concerned about Pakistan's nuclear program. He also mentioned that Japan will provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan only on condition that it stop plans to build weapons and missiles for mass destruction, reduce its defense budget, adopt policies to spread peace, increase plans to reduce environmental pollution, stabilize the democratic process, and continue to implement the economic policies started by Dr. Mayeen Qureshi. The U.S. and Japanese attitude shows that freezing our nuclear program is not considered enough for reinstating aid to Pakistan. Instead, we are being asked to do much more. I have written in this column that the United States has requested that Pakistan's roll back its nuclear program to a level where it is incapable of making nuclear weapons, and, in the third and the last phase, the program that represents our nuclear preparations should be totally disintegrated. The United States wants to do all this not only because it fears that Pakistani nuclear weapons can be used against India, but also because other Islamic countries might get this technology and these weapons could be used against Israel. In this context, Libya was mentioned in the beginning, and now they are mentioning Iran. Pakistan has repeatedly assured them that in spite of the availability of technical knowledge, it has no desire to make nuclear weapons. However, they do not believe Pakistan's assurance because the impression that Pakistan has a nuclear bomb was widely circulated during Ziaul Haq's time. In this context, it is important to mention that a senior Indian journalist visiting Pakistan met with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan. Dr. Khan stressed during this visit that Pakistan had made an atomic bomb. It is said that the visit of the Indian journalist with Dr. Qadeer Khan was arranged at President Ziaul Haq's instruction, and Dr. Khan had said things as advised by President Haq. After this alleged admission by Dr. Qadeer Khan, the CIA made a secret documentary film about the Kahuta laboratories using spy planes. The CIA director showed this film to President Ziaul Haq in the While House during his visit to the United States. The United States claimed that it has tangible proof of Pakistan's involvement in providing aid to Sikhs and freedom fighters in Kashmir. However, it had always ignored evidence presented by Pakistani governments proving the U.S. accusations to be false. Now the United States is demanding that Pakistan allow it to inspect its nuclear installations to satisfy the United States. Our opposition has demanded calling a special session of the National Assembly which will begin on 28 November. The opposition wants to discuss all issues related to the nuclear program. Mr. Yusuf Reza Gelani, the assembly speaker, has said that because of the sensitive nature of the issue, all discussion must be held in a closed session. Political observers who do not agree with the speaker say that a closed session will deprive the Pakistani people of the right to know the facts. The government should not have closed sessions because Madam Bhutto had openly said that Pakistan has no nuclear weapon and its whole program is geared to peaceful uses. In order to have the world believe this fact, it is important that not only there be open discussions in the National Assembly, but also that there should be no delay in giving permission to inspect the nuclear installations. These steps will help Pakistan get out of the clutches of the Pressler Amendment, and the U.S. economic and military aid will be restored. Japan and the European nations will also show their understanding and make good their promises to provide economic aid. In the context of permission to inspect the nuclear installation, Pakistan can expect the United States, European nations, and Japan to show more interest in resolving the Kashmir issue. If the Kashmir issue is resolved peacefully, the question of nuclear weapons will lose its importance. Pakistan can make an agreement with India in such a way that it does not have to worry about its security. India and Pakistan can increase economic cooperation and improve joint capital investments to strengthen their mutual trust. The U.S. policy also asks for cooperation between the two nations to the extent that the situation is stabilized in South Asia. If the United States and its allies continued to have concern about Pakistan's nuclear policy, Pakistan cannot be expected to receive favorable treatment from these powers. Pakistan's demand for equal treatment of India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue is reasonable; however, the United States forms its policies according to its own needs. Our problem is that the United States is in a position to follow its policies while our resources to oppose it are limited. We cannot ignore the fact that India is much larger than Pakistan both from population and geographic perspectives. It can become a major market for U.S. products. The United States wants to keep its eye on the Indian market because of its own economic interests, and wants to get various benefits from India during this decade. The U.S. economic experts have observed the emergence of the middle class in India, and its purchasing power is expect to rise. The U.S. statisticians estimate that the number of middle class members will increase to 150 million during the next 10 years, and the there will be a significant increase in the buyers of U.S. products and technology. The U.S. economic interests are the cornerstones of its foreign policy. These interests forced it to go to war against Iraq, and it benefitted a lot from it. It is giving India a preferential status because of the economic issues, and has made a policy to keep it happy. All these facts should be understood and remembered. If we ignore the facts, we will be making the biggest mistake in history. If Madam Bhutto is trying to find a safe place in the U.S. proposed new world order, we should cooperate with her in this effort. Madam Bhutto had announced before she came to power again that Pakistan had to establish a place in the new world order.
