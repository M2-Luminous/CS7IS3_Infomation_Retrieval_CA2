Wang Zhaoguo, director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, attended and spoke at the meeting. He said: The work on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan is very important in the great cause of reunifying the motherland. Major changes have occurred on Taiwan island and in cross-strait relations in recent years. Taiwan-related tasks are facing a new situation and new issues, which in turn pose new and higher requirements for the work that publicizes propaganda directed at Taiwan. Wang Zhaoguo said: At present, the mainland has been making very good progress in its reform and opening up. Its economy has been developing very rapidly. Taiwan compatriots are very interested in the situation. We should, in accordance with Taiwan compatriots' requirements, publicize the information in various formats to enable them to understand the mainland's situation better so as to increase the mainland's rallying and centripetal force. Wang Zhaoguo added: To properly handle the work on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan, we need to have a contingent of personnel who are politically and professionally competent with an upright work style. Leaders of Taiwan affairs offices and news and propaganda departments at various levels should pay attention to establishing the contingent. Comrades engaging in tasks on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan should earnestly and properly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories on "peaceful reunification and one country and two systems"; properly study the party's various general and special policies toward Taiwan, and strive to improve their own ideological and professional standards. The competition awarded first, second, and third prizes to 80 Taiwan-related propaganda essays, to 30 Taiwan-related propaganda books, and to 23 Taiwan-related propaganda video programs. The meeting also commended 46 outstanding comrades who have been industrious and who have cherished their work on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan. Leaders of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office and other relevant departments also attended today's award-presentation meeting.
