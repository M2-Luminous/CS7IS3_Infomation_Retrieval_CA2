The deputy criticized the international community for not having accepted the plan to solve the Haitian crisis approved by parliament this past 2 March. This plan recommended the appointment of a prime minister by constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide and General Raoul Cedras' resignation from the Armed Forces leadership. "Since the international community refused the plan and decided in favor of an invasion, we at a the local level must adopt measures to ensure the defense of the territory," Monde stressed in statements which were broadcast last night over the radio. Monde confirmed his willingness to support the Jonassaint de facto government if foreign military forces intervene in the country. "If an invasion takes place, this government will cease to be a government of exception and will become a legal government in order to defy the invasion," the deputy stated. In reference to reservations held by the majority of the deputies not to recognize the de facto government, Monde pointed out that he hopes the parliamentarians "will participate in the sessions in order to adopt this decision in case of an invasion." He added that "if the majority of the deputies decide to abstain from participating and expressing their opposition to an occupation, I believe the last measure to be adopted then should be to dissolve parliament." Monde, as president of the Chamber of Deputies has not yet adopted an official position in favor of installing the de facto government. Monde, however, has been closely linked to all the government decisions proposed by the military and has appeared in all official ceremonies beside Jonassaint. On the other hand, the "Crisis Group," created following the implementation of the state of emergency on Sunday and composed by the ministers of economy, foreign affairs, interior, defense, and information, met for the first time yesterday. In addition, during an irregular Senate session, a group of senators in favor of the de facto government revived the memory of the military removed by the United States in 1915 and 1916 during Haiti's occupation. In their resolution, these senators, most of whom were elected during the fraudulent 18 January 1993 elections, abolished the expulsion order decreed by the U.S. Navy against the Haitian military and reinstated them to the Army with their respective ranks. In explaining the resolution, described as bizarre and demagogic by political observers in the Haitian capital city, Senator Ehrane Cadet, member of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion that supported the Aristide overthrow, stated that its objective is to encourage Haitians to defend the nation.
