Sources with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights said Tuesday that the Chinese delegate had denounced Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the previous day. "Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have not changed their mentality since the Cold War," he declared. "How can they assess the human rights situation in China without prejudice?" He accused them of ignoring the progress made in China since 1949, notably its victory over famine. Amnesty, in a report submitted last week to UN human rights officials, charged that "hundreds of people (in China), including political dissidents and members of ethnic and religious groups, have been arbitrarily detained for peaceful exercise of their fundamental human rights." "Torture, which is prohibited by law, continues to be widespread, sometimes resulting in death. "In the past two years the death penalty has been increasingly used for non-violent offenses," according to Amnesty, which said it had received reports on the execution of 1,250 people from January to November 1993. Human Rights Watch issued findings similar to those of Amnesty. Western countries are currently holding private discussions on a draft resolution on the human rights situation in China, which will also make reference to Tibet.
