Constitutional Chamber Magistrate Hugo Ordonez has asserted that they will expedite the ruling but that this does not mean it will be decided with undue haste. [Begin Ordonez recording] I would not like to estimate the exact duration of this proceeding because it cannot be predetermined. We have to see if it takes the regular course. However, I surmise--and I do so only to answer the question you say currently concerns the country--that the matter could be resolved in approximately three weeks. [end recording] Ordonez stated that the verdict will not depend on the magistrates' political leanings but instead on whether the law adheres to the Constitution.
