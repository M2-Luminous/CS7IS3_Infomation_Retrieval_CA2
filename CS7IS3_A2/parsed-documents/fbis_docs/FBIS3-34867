He said that the powers and jurisdictions of the governors and ministers have been defined in a clearer and more comprehensive form. President al-Bashir said that the Bureau of Federal Governance must be regarded as responsible for following up the implementation of federal governance in the states as well as linking the states with one another, and linking them to the federal government to facilitate proceedings and to save the time of officials in the states. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir said that measures will be taken in the coming days to regulate the work of the legislative councils and to define their powers to complete the effective consultative framework. He confirmed the role of the Transitional National Assembly which will take part in legislation and the introduction of amendments and endorsements. His Excellency stressed that Sudan will continue its march toward the implementation of the revolutionary slogans despite the conspiracies of the enemies of the nation to torpedo the cultural scheme. His Excellency appealed to the citizens to support their new state governments by working continuously to arouse everybody's energies and to utilize their capabilities to strengthen the march toward stability and development. President al-Bashir recommended to the governments of the new states the need to take care of the weak, the elderly, the widowed, and orphaned in line with social assistance objectives because it is through them that God showers his mercy and removes the people's plight.
