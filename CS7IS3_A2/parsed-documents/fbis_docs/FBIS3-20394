To Opposition jeers in the Commons, Mr Major said in a statement after this morning's Cabinet meeting on the issue, that "progress on qualified majority voting was sufficient to be acceptable until 1996." But a grim signal of trouble ahead from Conservative Euro-rebels came in furious exchanges between Tory Tony Marlow and the Prime Minister who was clearly enraged as Mr Marlow told him: "As of now, My Right Honourable Friend has no authority, credibility or identifiable policy in this vital area!" MPs gasped as Mr Marlow added: "Why don't you stand aside and make way for somebody else who provides authority...and direction of leadership?" Mr Major told a packed chamber there would then be a "root and branch" review of the voting system -- which has been at the centre of the row between Britain and her EU [European Union] partners -- at the next inter-governmental conference. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the weekend talks between EU foreign ministers in Greece had met many but not all of the Government's concerns. He said assurances had now been received from the European Commission over the bringing forward of proposals under the guise of Health and Safety articles, which were not strictly relevant to the subject. Labour leader John Smith branded the compromise agreement a "humiliating climbdown" for Mr Major and added: "You seek to camouflage your retreat from your vainglorious assertions of no surrender." He said fear of warring factions in Tory Party had propelled the Prime Minister "into an unwise conflict which you could not -- and did not win." In his statement, Mr Major said the Government had opposed an unqualified extension in the blocking minority in votes to 27 because ministers were concerned that successive extensions had "weakened the democratic legitimacy of the Community." Assurances had now been received from the Commission that "it will not bring forwrd any further proposals under the Health and Safety articles under its term of office except for measures directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work." The Commission had also now agreed that proposals under the Social Chapter "will not embrace people or organisations in the UK. For the purposes of the Social Chapter, the UK will be entirely excluded from legislation." He said: "The proposal on qualified majority voting (QMV) negotiated by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at the weekend meets many -- though not all -- of the Government's concerns." Agreement had been secured that the review of QMV in 1996 would include voting thresholds as well as the number of votes attributed to each member state. "At the request of the UK and Spain, the transitional arrangements from accession until 1996 will no longer provide for unqualified extension of the blocking minority to 27. The Council is under a legal and binding obligation to seek agreement on the basis of a minority of at least 23 votes." The Government expected this obligation to be upheld scrupulously, he insisted. Mr Major said: "On this basis, the Cabinet has concluded that since we wish to see the enlargement proceed, progress on QMV was sufficient to be acceptable until 1996. We are informing the Presidency that, provided the concessions made to the UK and Spain are accepted without qualification by other member states, the UK can accept this interim proposal. ``Enlargement will bring into the Union countries which share Britain's open trading instincts.... It will be another large step towards the wider, less centralised, open trading Europe for which we are working.'' Mr Smith said: "However you seek to camouflage your retreat from your vainglorious assertions of no surrender last week, you have accepted a blocking minority of 27. Isn't your supposed triumph of obtaining a minor period of delay hopelessly undermined by the text of the declaration itself?" He asked if the so-called assurances from the Commission would extend beyond the end of the year and added: "You have had to make a humiliating climbdown. Isn't the explanation for the timing and whole sorry fiasco that you, fearful of the warring factions in your own party, propelled yourself into an unwise conflict, which you could not and did not win." It had resulted in "unnecessary and severe damage to friendly countries and no advantage to Britain." Mr Major said a number of the Labour leader's points were "factually inaccurate." He said: "What you appear to have overlooked is that we have achieved a series of concessions that would not have been available if we had adopted your position of accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all areas immediately. ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But neither have the other member states achieved what they would have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.'' To Labour jeers, he admitted that the agreement with the Commission lasted only until the end of the year but added: "We will certainly be seeking an extension under the new Commission next year and I see no reason to suppose we won't achieve it."
