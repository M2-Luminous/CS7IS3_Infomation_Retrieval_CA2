This has been stated by Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos in an article published by JOURNAL DO BRASIL, entitled "The Truth About Cuba." Bolanos denounces the fact that the CIA, just days ago, once again issued apocalyptic reports about Cuba. He stressed that it is not the first time that the CIA has done something like this against Cuba. He gives as an example the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the predictions about of the fall of the Revolution, which is today more solid than ever.
