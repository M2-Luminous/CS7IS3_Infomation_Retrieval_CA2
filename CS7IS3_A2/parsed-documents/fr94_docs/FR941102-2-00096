FR941102-2-00096 FR941102-2-00069 The Commission approved the Amex, Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE''), NYSE, Phlx and National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') 8 circuit breaker proposals on a pilot program basis. Circuit breaker proposals by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), 9 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'') 10 and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'') 11 were approved by the Commission on a permanent basis rather than as a pilot program. In 1989, the Exchanges and the NASD filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend their respective pilot programs. 12 Subsequently, in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend their respective pilot programs. 13 In 1993, the BSE and Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') (formerly MSE) filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend their respective pilot programs. 14 In 1990, 1992, and 1993, the NASD filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend its pilot program. 15 The proposals for the Exchanges are nearing their expiration dates and the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx have filed with the Commission proposals to extend further their respective pilot program until October 31, 1995. 8 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26198 (October 19, 1988), 53 FR 41673 (order granting temporary approval to Amex, NASD, and NYSE circuit breaker rules); 26357 (December 14, 1988), 53 FR 51182 (order granting temporary approval to BSE circuit breaker rule); 26218 (October 26, 1988), 53 FR 44137 (order granting temporary approval to MSE circuit breaker rule); and 26386 (December 22, 1988), 53 FR 52904 (order granting temporary approval to Phlx circuit breaker rule). 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26198, supra note 7. 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26368 (December 16, 1988), 53 FR 51942. 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26440 (January 10, 1989), 54 FR 1830. 12 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27370 (October 23, 1989), 54 FR 43881 (order approving extension of Amex, BSE, MSE, NASD, NYSE and Phlx circuit breaker rules). 13 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 25580 (October 25, 1990), 55 FR 45895; 29868 (October 28, 1991), 56 FR 56535; 31387 (October 30, 1992), 57 FR 53157; and 33120 (October 29, 1993), 58 FR 59503 (orders approving extensions of Amex, NYSE, and Phlx circuit breaker rules). 14 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33120 supra note 13 (extending the BSE's and CHX's respective circuit breaker pilot programs until October 31, 1995). 15 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28694 (December 12, 1990), 55 FR 52119; 30304 (January 29, 1992), 57 FR 4658; and 33292 (December 6, 1993), 58 FR 65214 (orders approving extension of NASD circuit breaker rules, the most recent order approving the pilot through December 31, 1994). The circuit breaker mechanisms were enacted in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break. Both the Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms (``Brady Report'') and the Working Group's Interim Report 16 recommended that coordinated trading halts and reopening procedures be developed that would be implemented in all U.S. markets for equity and equity related products during large, rapid market declines. 17 In response, the SROs submitted proposals to implement circuit breaker procedures that are designed to substitute planned trading halts for unplanned and destabilizing market closings. In addition, the stock index futures exchanges have implemented parallel circuit breakers that were approved by the CFTC on a permanent basis. 16 The Working Group in Financial Markets was established by the President in March 1988 to provide a coordinating framework for consideration, resolution, recommendation, and action on the complex issues raised by the market break in October 1987. The Working Group consists of the Chairmen of the Commission, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), and the Under Secretary for Finance of the Department of the Treasury. 17 In particular, the Working Group recommended a one-hour trading halt if the DJIA declined 250 points from its previous day's closing level, and a subsequent two-hour trading halt if the DJIA declined 400 points below its previous day's closing level. The Working Group also recommended that the NYSE use reopening procedures, similar to those used on Expiration Fridays, that are designed to enhance the information made public about market conditions.
