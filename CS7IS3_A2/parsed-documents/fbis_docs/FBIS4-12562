The idea of separate deals and secret talks still dominates Israeli thinking. Israel's talk about the comprehensiveness of negotiations is empty and meaningless. This being the situation, it takes us back to the same old question: What does resuming or not resuming the bilateral talks this month, or next month, or even after that, mean as long as nothing has changed in the Israeli way of thinking? Perhaps, counting on the U.S. stand to influence the Israeli position is not really in harmony with the current state of affairs. This is because Washington behaves toward the peace process from the position of someone influenced by the Israeli stand and not someone who influences that stand. For Israel, this is not new. However, what is new is that nothing has changed in the U.S. position, just as Israel and its strong lobbies in the United States have always wanted it. They want the United States to take Israel's side, not even allowing to play a neutral role. Neutrality, a balanced position, and the role of an honest broker are all unacceptable to Israel, because it cannot tolerate seeing Washington in a position that is not fully biased toward it, taking into consideration that it relies on the U.S. support for its aggressions against Arab land and rights. Throughout the Arab dealings with the U.S. peace initiative, it has become clear that every time there has been a difference between the U.S. position and the Israel position over the peace process, even though it may have been for considerable reasons in favor of Washington's position and in the interest of the peace process, the U.S. position did not take long to move back into line with the Tel Aviv rulers' position, even though it may have led to a setback in peace efforts. Israel's game has been exposed. It is obvious that what it wants is to impose an Israeli peace through separate deals with each Arab party. It wants a peace that would allow it to maintain its military, security, economic, and political supremacy in order to eventually have a free hand to control this region after the establishment of this so-called peace. However, the question is really whether or not Washington is still committed to the role of an honest and neutral partner in the peace process. This question should be posed in light of Washington's pressure on the various Arab parties, through various means, forms, methods, and names, which all serve the Israeli position. What is really required of the United States is that it prove its honesty by pressuring the party that is obstructing the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region; namely, Israel. The importance of an answer to this question lies in the possibilities of the Arab parties returning to the Washington bilateral talks and the negotiating table at the end of this month. Will U.S. efforts actually include the signs of honesty that have long been awaited by the Arabs, or will the U.S. position continue to swing back and forth within the circle of Israeli influence?
