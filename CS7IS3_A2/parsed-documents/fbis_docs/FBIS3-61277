The tumultuous events of the past few years could not bypass them. The Main Protection Directorate, the Federal Government Communications and Information Agency, and foreign intelligence became independent agencies... In December of last year an edict of the president of Russia disbanded the Ministry of Security and announced the creation of a new Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS). What do all these changes mean for the country? What will the new secret service be like? In what way will it be different from the old one? We posed all these questions to Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. "In many respects this organization will be different from the old Ministry of Security," said Sergey Vadimovich. "Here are our six main tasks. "First. Exposure, prevention, and suppression of intelligence and sabotage activities of foreign special services and organizations against Russia. "Second. Obtaining intelligence information on threats to the national security. "Third. Providing information to the president of the Russian Federation on threats to national security. "Fourth. Combating terrorism and illegal circulation of arms and drugs. This also includes uncovering and neutralizing illegal armed formations, as well as uncovering illegally created or banned public associations that encroach on the constitutional system of Russia. "Fifth. Ensuring within our jurisdiction the protection of state secrets. "Sixth. Counterintelligence support for operational protection of state borders. "As you can see, the FCS will not have many of the old functions. For instance, we will no longer be involved in investigations (and therefore the investigative department is being transferred to the Office of the Procurator General). Neither will we have the investigative detention facility in Lefortovo--it is being transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. The only function we retain is inquiry (urgent investigative actions within a short period of time). "Next, drugs inside the country are not our province, either. The FCS will investigate only those cases where the drug business is linked to foreign partners." [TRUD] What about corruption? [Stepashin] Only in the event that it involves the highest echelons of power. The rest will be handled by the procuracy and the MVD. The same goes for gangsterism and routine criminal offenses... Overall, the Federal Counterintelligence Service's staff will be half as large as that of the former Ministry of Security [MB]. The MB had a staff of 138,000; the FCS will have 75,000 (nationwide). [TRUD] How many people will you have in Moscow? [Stepashin] Approximately 1,500, not counting the scientific-research institute, military-medical units, maintenance personnel, and protection and maintenance of buildings and facilities. [TRUD] Is the structure of the federal service a secret? [Stepashin] What specifically do you want to know? [TRUD] For instance, what departments will the FCS have? Will there not be, for instance, an entity under a new name similar to the notorious former Fifth Main Directorate of the KGB, which investigated the differently minded, "dissidents"? [Stepashin] Even the Ministry of Security that was abolished in December no longer engaged in political investigations; this will be even more true for counterintelligence. The entire FCS structure, all its departments, will correspond precisely to the tasks defined for our service, which I have already enumerated. If readers are interested, the FCS structure is as follows. First, the counterintelligence operations administration. This, I think is self-explanatory: Exposing agents of foreign services, etc. Next, the counterintelligence support for strategic facilities administration. This involves the security of nuclear stations and other nuclear facilities, transportation, communications, and protection of state secrets. Next, the following administrations: military and economic counterintelligence; antiterrorism; information and analysis; search operations; and operational-technical measures. Other units are in a way auxiliary, providing support for FCS operations: contracting and legal; personnel; economic... A total of 20 administrations, including medical and the Public Relations Center. I repeat: Our main task is counterintelligence; the FCS does not have any other tasks. [TRUD] Who is the Federal Counterintelligence Service subordinated to? [Stepashin] Directly to the president of the Russian Federation. [TRUD] Can local authorities direct the work of FCS' local units? [Stepashin] No, they cannot, although, naturally, we will work in contact with local authorities. But the specificity of the FCS' work is such that all units must be rigidly subordinated vertically to the center. [TRUD] Corruption is so pervasive today among Russian bureaucrats that this is openly discussed both in our country and abroad. Will the FCS have sufficient resources to combat very influential corrupt officials in the highest echelons of power? [Stepashin] There should be no doubt in this respect. All such materials will be handed over to the procuracy and directly to the president of the country, who demands an unrelenting fight against corruption at any level. No matter what job a person holds, he will not escape responsibility if he is caught with his hand in a honey pot. It is another matter that the materials collected must be totally convincing. It was due to insufficient evidence that in the recent past officials who used their position for personal enrichment were able to escape punishment. We have learned from this experience. Simultaneously, we need to strengthen the legislative base, to make it absolutely clear what an official cannot do (for instance, be a part of commercial structures, including foreign), and what does not constitute a violation of law; what is the mechanism of penalty for violations; and so on. An edict on civil service is an important step in this direction. Other legal acts are in the works. [TRUD] Are there currently any specific cases "in the development stage" involving corruption in the highest echelons of power? [Stepashin] Yes. You realize I cannot yet mention any details, but these are very serious cases; our specialists are following a hot trail and are checking carefully and scrupulously. [TRUD] Lately the press has frequently published reports of serious violations of the law by MVD personnel. In the past such facts were investigated by organs of state security. Now that the MB has been abolished, does it mean that the MVD, customs, and tax services will be completely unsupervised? [Stepashin] Why unsupervised? First, there is the procuracy, whose task is to monitor observance of the law. Second, we are not going to stand on the sidelines either--the MVD, the customs, and the tax police will not be left "unsupervised." Honest people have nothing to fear. Those, however, who violate the law must bear responsibility in accordance with the law. [TRUD] How do top officials in the government feel about the activities of security services? [Stepashin] We encounter great understanding. Recently, for instance, we discussed with First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar issues related to the country's economic security. He was particularly interested in matters related to product exports (the potential for abuse, illegal deals, etc.). Another example: Anatoliy Chubays asked us not to recall our service's specialists who are on assignment at the Russian Federation Committee for the Administration of State Property and to assist in averting machinations in the course of privatization of state enterprises. [TRUD] A report was made public recently that many commercial banks are under tremendous pressure from the mafia. Those top bank officials who do not agree to cooperate with the mafia are simply being liquidated; evidence of this is the number of contract murders last year. It is easy to imagine what will happen if the financial system ends up in the hands of corrupt structures... [Stepashin] We have an agreement with the Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko that our services will take the national banking system under protection. In addition, banks have their own security services. [TRUD] The results of the recent parliamentary elections were completely unexpected for the powers that be. Does this mean that nobody in the country knows what the people's mood is? [Stepashin] Zhirinovskiy's success was not a surprise for our services. Sociological services use their own methods to study public opinion; our services get this kind of information through their channels. Even before 12 December the analytical department produced this forecast: Zhirinovskiy's party may get 24 percent of the vote in the elections (as you can see, the forecast was very precise). All these materials were sent "upstairs" in time... [TRUD] What about you personally: Do you get information about the popular mood only from analytical summaries? [Stepashin] First, we do not produce these kind of "summaries" on a regular basis. (The forecast of election results is not a typical occasion). It is not the FCS' task to identify and evaluate popular moods. I think a lot of people would be glad to immediately accuse us of reanimating political investigations... [TRUD] Why investigations? Is knowing the popular mood an investigation? How is it possible to run the country without knowing what people are happy or unhappy about? If the FCS is tasked with this, however, will you be able to carry it out? [Stepashin] Of course. But until we are charged with such a task, we do not do this on a regular basis. As to popular moods, they are generally known. There are, of course, those who are doing fine, who have adapted to the market environment, but there are also many who have found themselves beached. I recently visited my relatives in the town of Sobinka in Vladimir Oblast. My cousin works at a textile factory, which is now idle. He is paid 12,000 rubles a month. He does not have dinner every day. And there are others like him. What kind of mood can these people be in? I was told a lot of things in Sobinka... [TRUD] The stratification in society is growing; about 40 million people do not have the income to provide for even a most modest sustenance minimum. Some political scientists talk about growing social tensions in society, the potential for intense social conflicts. Until a way is found to attenuate hardship for tens of millions low-income people, the situation may intensify to the limit. In your opinion, could conflicts grow into civil war? [Stepashin] I do not think so. The government said clearly that social orientation of the reforms will be strengthened. And if stabilization processes begin at the end of the year; if the production decline is halted and structural restructuring in industry begins, positive changes will affect the social climate as well. [TRUD] It is being said that during the period of reorganization of the security services they have ended up being sort of paralyzed, incapable of functioning, and the country has been left unprotected. Is this true? [Stepashin] Nothing of the kind; the work has never stopped and is continuing right now. And it would be impossible to suspend it anyway: For one, there is the unceasing stream of contraband people try to smuggle out of the country. For instance, in Orenburg Oblast it was discovered that 667 kg of gold and 21,770 kg of silver had been exported abroad as part of black copper alloys from the Mednogorsk integrated copper smelter and sulfuric acid plant. Now the joint enterprise will reimburse the cost of exported precious metals in hard currency (about $10 million). In Pskov Oblast, two railcars (135 tonnes) with 8.45-caliber cartridges were intercepted on route to Estonia... I could give you numerous examples of this nature. Neither is there any decrease in active intelligence activities against Russia, and it is conducted not only by special services of "far abroad" countries but also by Baltic and CIS countries. Twenty people were arrested in 1993 on charges of espionage. Several dozen more cases involving espionage are under investigation. [TRUD] There are many rumors regarding the circumstances of Barkashov's arrest. How was he actually found? And why was he not arrested while he was in the White House? [Stepashin] I know Barkashov by sight, and I saw him on 4 October on television, when he was being escorted with others out of the White House. After that, the militia handled each person individually. Why Barkashov was not detained I do not know... Later, when the task was set to find him and bring him in for questioning, our services began the search. We followed his trail--we knew he was in Moscow. It was only a matter of time. At the end of December our officers found out that he had been admitted to hospital. The rest is history. By the way, a while back the Security Service sent the procuracy (the procurator general) materials on military training and other actions of extremists led by Barkashov. Nevertheless, later on the Ministry of Justice... officially registered the organization, and it acquired legal status... [TRUD] Last question. Regarding the upcoming visit of the U.S. President Clinton to Moscow. How will his security be handled? [Stepashin] As usual. The Main Protection Administration and our services are doing everything necessary in coordination with representatives of the U.S. special services. Several thousand operatives will be on duty during the visit. The U.S. President's security is completely guaranteed. I would like to say in conclusion that the Federal Counterintelligence Service will build its work on the principles of legality, respect for human rights and freedoms, and humanism. This is the alpha and omega of our entire work.
