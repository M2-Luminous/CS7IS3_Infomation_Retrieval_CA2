The former colonel described himself as "a soldier of our fatherland who did not want to shirk his responsibility." He championed the establishment of the Movement for National Identity and Ibero-American Integration (MINII) as "a possibility for an appropriate and genuine alternative." The leader of the 3 December 1990 uprising expressed these ideas in a self-made interview distributed by his supporters and signed by former Captain Gustavo Breid Obeid, who is also under arrest at the Magadalena Prison and is the MINII secretary general. Seineldin made it clear that MINII "is a patriotic movement, and not a partisan political movement." He rejected the claim that he is heading MINII, asking himself: "What kind of leadership may one exercise in prison?" Seineldin explained: "Given the current crisis situation experienced by nations, arising from the decadence, corruption, and inability of the partisan leaderships that constantly jeopardize republican life, the movement must act as a reassurance and guarantee for continuity." Seineldin also rejected any similarity with Modin [Movement for Dignity and Independence], headed by Aldo Rico. Describing Modin, Seineldin said: "By joining the `partisan game,' it will end up as a small party, engulfed by the `big ones' through negotiations, transactions, and deals." Asked whether MINII's relationship with the Army might not be incompatible, Seineldin made it clear that the Army's interests "go well beyond individuals and the circumstances in which they find themselves." He emphasized: "There is unity and there will always exist unity whenever our fatherland is in jeopardy." Moving on, Seineldin cautioned about the possibility of a repetition of the serious episodes that had occurred in Santiago del Estero Province "as long as the economic policy remains unchanged." He believes the government "is in a blind alley." Seineldin said: "If the government keeps the adjustment policy there will be social turmoil, and if the government keeps this program and does not implement an adjustment, the economy will sink. The only possibility is to definitely change the course, implementing a stability program, but with growth." Seineldin also rejected "the balancing of accounts at the expense of the hunger of millions of families" and the solution "of reinstating economic anarchy." He called attention on the existence of "impoverished provinces because their funds are administrated by a central administration that 'monitors' their economies." In conclusion, Seineldin opposed constitutional reform, describing it as the result of "an ill-fated maneuver right from the beginning, because it is based on a spurious and shameless pact" and because the Constitution is "something too serious to be changed by mere personal appetites."
