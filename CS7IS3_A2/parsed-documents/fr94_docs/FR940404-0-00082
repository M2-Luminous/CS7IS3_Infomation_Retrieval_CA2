FR940404-0-00082 FR940404-0-00022 50 CFR Part 651 [Docket No. 931076&hyph;4094; I.D. 032894H] Northeast Multispecies Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to delay for 30 days the effective date for implementation of the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh size requirement for the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank (GOM/GB) regulated mesh area and the Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area as established under Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery (FMP) and its implementing regulations. Participants fishing in these areas in this fishery may continue to fish with 51/2-inch (13.97-cm) mesh through April 30, 1994. The minimum mesh-size requirement for the GOM/GB and SB/JL areas will become 6 inches (15.24 cm) beginning May 1, 1994. The intent of this delay in effective date is to allow additional time for fishermen to obtain nets with the required mesh size which are presently in short supply in the fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan A. Murphy, Fishery Policy Analyst, NMFS, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9252. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Amendment 5 to the FMP was prepared by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ) (Magnuson Act) and approved by NMFS. Regulations implementing Amendment 5 were published March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872), and corrected on March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10588). In addition to other management measures, the regulations implemented a 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh size requirement in the GOM/GB regulated mesh area and the SB/JL juvenile protection area effective April 1, 1994. The fishing industry has reported that local New England mesh suppliers do not have adequate supplies of 6-inch (15.24-cm) mesh available. In order to allow time for adequate supply quantities to become available and for all in the fishery to procure conforming nets, this rule delays the effective date of the 6-inch (15.24-cm) mesh requirement for 30 days. Beginning May 1, 1994, all multispecies permit holders must comply with the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh-size requirement in the GOM/GB and SB/JL areas. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) has determined that this delay in effective date is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This rule makes a permanent change in the regulations at ยง651.20(a)(2) and (a)(5) to incorporate language specifying that the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh-size requirement is not effective until May 1, 1994, under the emergency authority of section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act. Although section 305(c)(3)(B) stipulates that emergency regulations may not remain in effect for more than two 90-day periods after publication in the Federal Register , the permanent change in the regulatory language which is needed for clarity and for the convenience of the public, will have regulatory effect on the public only from April 1 through April 30, 1994, which is well within the limitation on emergency rule effectiveness of the Magnuson Act.
