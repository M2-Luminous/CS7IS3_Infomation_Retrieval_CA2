ACTION: Notice of petition finding. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding on a petition to list the bull trout ( Salvelinus confluentus ) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service finds that listing bull trout throughout its range is not warranted at this time due to unavailable or insufficient data regarding the threats to and status and population trends of the species within Alaska and Canada. Sufficient information is available, however, to support a warranted finding to list bull trout within the conterminous United States. The Service, therefore, finds that listing a distinct vertebrate population segment of bull trout residing in the conterminous United States is warranted, but precluded due to other higher priority listing actions. The Service continues to seek data and comments from the public on the status and threats to this species.
