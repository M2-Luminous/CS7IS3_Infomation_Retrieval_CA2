In a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali dated 24 June, the representative stressed that the Iranian authorities recently observed the "illegal movement of some vessels in Arvandrood which were wrongfully and without authorization using the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran". Furthermore, the letter added, during recent months, the Iranian authorities seized a number of non-Iranian ships carrying goods to Iraq through Arvandrood who were either carrying Iranian flag without the consent of Iranian authorities or were declaring Iranian ports as their final destination. The letter which was issued as a Security Council document, continued that "Iran has resorted to limited measures in Arvandrood in order to curb these activities which not only violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial intergrity but also the international sanctions against Iraq." Iran held the Iraqi regime responsible for the consequences of its actions which are in violation of international law and regulations as well as the principle of good neighbourliness, it stressed. The Islamic Republic of Iran, the letter concluded, "reaffirming its full compliance with the cease-fire established under Security Council Resolution 598 as well as its total commitment to the provisions of the treaty concerning the state frontier and neighbourly relations of 13 June 1975 and its protocols, reiterates its desire for improvement of relations with Iraq on the basis of principles of good neighbourliness and international law."
