Trade unions, human rights defense groups, and other people's organizations staged a demonstration to voice their opposition to the referendum, claiming that the changes to the Constitution do not meet their expectations. The government employees unions which demonstrated this morning demanded a 40-percent salary increase, claiming that the price increases for consumer basket articles are extremely high compared to current salaries. Leaders of the government employees unions that participated in the demonstration announced that they are calling on all government employees unions to participate in a strike on 28 January. The demonstration, which was slated to begin at 0900, did not start until 1030 because the demonstrators did not arrive on time. The leaders were forced to make emergency calls to begin the march that left from the El Trebol area and went down Bolivar Avenue to the downtown area. The demonstration ended at the main plaza. The national police carefully watched the demonstration to prevent any infiltrations by other individuals. There were no problems during the demonstration.
