This requirement was set forth by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, to county and township cadres when he inspected the work of Wuqiang County on 8 May. Accompanied by Bai Runzhang, secretary of the Hengshui Prefectural party committee, and Commissioner Yang Xinnong, Cheng Weigao listened to briefings given by Wuqiang County party committee and government leaders on the whole county's economic development and family planning work, and held a forum on relevant issues. He also travelled to Hebei Kewei Electronics Company, Ltd., Wuqiang County New Year pictures museum, and other units to inspect their work. [passage omitted] Cheng Weigao demanded: To successfully carry out the whole county's work, it is necessary to persist in making an overall plan to become better-off with a moderate level of prosperity. We must persist in simultaneously grasping both economic and family planning work. We must not direct attention only to economic construction at the expense of population work or blindly persist in improving backwardness in family planning at the expense of economic development. To grasp these two tasks, we must urge leading cadres to further emancipate their minds, cultivate the concept of market economy and a strong pioneering spirit, act in line with the objectives and demands, make all levels implement the plan aimed at becoming well-off, implement the plan in townships and villages, and mobilize cadres to undertake this formidable task. Meanwhile, it is necessary to formulate plans for developing primary, secondary, and tertiary industries for the whole county. Cheng Weigao pointed out: We should exert efforts to grasp reform of the organizational and cadre systems and do a good job in resolving the issue on building the mechanisms of restraint and incentive for the selection and appointment of cadres. It is necessary to streamline administrative organs, mobilize cadres of party and government organs with education and economic knowledge to run economic entities on the forefront of economic construction, to assume posts in village-level organizations, and to lead peasants to attain the goal of becoming fairly well-off. If no pressure is imposed on a cadre, he will not have motivation and creativity. Through the establishment of the mechanisms of restraints and incentives, we should realistically judge cadres in accordance to the party spirit, use cadres in accordance to their achievements in official career, select outstanding cadres to leading posts, and eliminate incompetent cadres. Cheng Weigao stressed: The key to realizing the goal of becoming well-off, accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development, and doing a good job in family planning and building two civilizations is to see whether we are able to pass the stiffest test in building grass-roots organizations. This is a very important work which we must pay attention to and grasp firmly. In the near future, we should pay particular attention to checking "three trends," namely the trends of extravagance, withholding and extorting things from the people, and boastfulness, and maintain close relations between county and township cadres and the masses. Strenuous efforts should be made to promote the ideological work style of working hard, doing administrative work honestly and diligently, and seeking truth from facts. Our living expenses must not be divorced from local economic development and the actual living standards of the people. We must be good at doing hard work, using our brains, and solving difficult problems. In treating the common people, we must be fair in enforcing law and distributing interests and burdens to them. In handling problems, we must give the common people a just and rational explanation, tell them the results, and lay bare the problems, and must not practice fraud or try to whitewash ourselves.
