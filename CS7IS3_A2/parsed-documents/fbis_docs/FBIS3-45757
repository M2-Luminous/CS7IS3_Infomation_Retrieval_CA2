And 80 percent were turned in by the public. Fifty-four percent of the cases involved bribery and 24 percent involved embezzlement, said Yang Shen of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC). Nationwide, procuratorial organs handled 525,570 cases during the first 11 months of last year involving 60,163 offenders, said Yang, who is director of the CDIC's Letters-and-Visits Reception Office. Phone calls, letters and visits from the public helped the government uncover more than 80 percent of the corruption cases. So far, more than 10,000 offenders have been brought to trial or face trials, Yang said. Last August, the country tightened its rein on corrupt activities, which run from taking bribes and gifts to embezzling public funds for private purposes. During the past year, the crime-reporting centre under the Supreme People's Procuratorate received more than 270,000 reports about illegal activities, 58 of which involved bribery and embezzlement. The CDIC and the Ministry of Supervision, the country's two main supervisory organs, received 100,678 tips from people nationwide through calls, letters and visits. Only 2 percent of the reports were fabricated. To date, 194 big cases have been filed, with all offenders either having been tried or waiting for trial. The complaint centre at the Ministry of Public Security also received 2,595 tips from the public. According to Yang, among the reported cases at his CDIC office last year, more than 20 per cent were concerned with embezzlement and financial infractions. Most offenders held bureau-director level positions and were from developing regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. Yang said this was because policies and administrative mechanisms in these areas still have loopholes as the country becomes a socialist market economy. He said the Party and the State have strongly encouraged people to report graft during the nation's anti-corruption drive. Nationwide supervisory organs have set up "letters-and-visits" offices, hotlines and complaint boxes to make it easier for people to report corruption. And to encourage people to do so, Yang said, special campaigns have also been conducted to make it easier to report crime. Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has run campaigns to stop corruption against farmers, end government-financed trips abroad and ban extravagant marriage and burial ceremonies.
