The National Police Press Office told ACAN-EFE the explosive devices, filled with leaflets from the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), one of four organizations that make up the URNG, detonated in two Guatemala City zones. The source said the leaflets from the FAR, an armed group operating in the northern region under the leadership of Commander Pablo Monsanto, marked its "32 years of revolutionary struggle." Several unidentified people dynamited the foundations of the San Juan bridge, which is located at km 20 of the Atlantic-bound highway, early this morning. The incident, besides causing property damage, created serious traffic jams. The Army dispatched a delegation to the site to investigate if the guerrillas perpetrated the attack, which destroyed the bridge, and to estimate property damage. The terrorist attack and the bomb explosions are occurring as the government and guerrillas are meeting in Mexico to end the oldest internal armed conflict in the region.
