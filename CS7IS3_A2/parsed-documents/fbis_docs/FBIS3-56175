But They Are Already Intending To Revise It"] [Text] The president's edict "on the state program for the privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian Federation" has been adopted. It would seem the end of the odyssey of a long-suffering document, which took 18 months to squeeze through the departmental turnpikes and parliamentary antagonism. Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo], told IZVESTIYA how it differs from the 1992 program and what fundamental changes have been made to it by the government, time, and the economic situation in the country. The present program, like the previous one, sets as its main aim the formation of a broad stratum of private owners as the economic basis of market relations. All the main means of privatization have been preserved as have the previous three types of benefit (incentives for the third type have been drastically enhanced), and the principles for voucher privatization that does not involve money [besplatnaya], the existing mechanism for voucher auctions, and so forth have been enshrined. If you compare the "democratism" of the two programs then in D. Vasilyev's opinion one can sense in the new one a "certain deterioration -- there are more departmental bans and additional tough bureaucratic measures have been introduced." At the same time all procedures of importance for voucher privatization have been successfully defended in the government and enshrined in documents and the list of property open to privatization has been expanded. D. Vasilyev believes that the sections on the privatization of nonresidential premises and the sale of land plots attached to enterprises are particularly important. Land and real estate are the foundation of small business, the basis of the next wave of market reforms. It is important that in the privatization process permission has been given to "divide up" and sell uncompleted construction projects. A new section on foreign investments, in fact, lifts all restrictions for the participation of foreign businessmen in auctions and when buying shares for money and for vouchers. Actually one -- substantial -- restriction is envisaged for foreign businessmen: The federal counterintelligence service can submit to the government within a month a substantiated conclusion to the effect that shares should not be sold to a particular investor. Counterintelligence intends thus to prevent the "laundering" of money by the narco-mafia, the criminal world, and so forth. The program substantially strengthens the role of investment funds. They have finally been allowed to increase the proportion of shares of a single enterprise in their portfolio to 25 percent instead of 10 percent, which will enable funds to take a real part in the management of joint-stock companies. Some funds have collected only 1,000 vouchers and, realizing that they simply cannot function, have been obliged to surrender their shares to larger and more powerful colleagues. This practice of some funds being "swallowed up" by others has now been legalized by the program. On the other hand, commercial banks' opportunities for purchasing the shares of privatized enterprises have been palpably limited. The new program in general devotes substantial space to the defense of shareholders' rights. Henceforth all fundamental decisions -- on liquidating the company, on changing the incorporation capital, on joining a holding company or financial and industrial group, on selling a large proportion of its property -- will be made only at a meeting and with the agreement of three fourths of shareholders. The actual procedure for holding and preparing meetings has been "prescribed," ruling out the possibility of disregarding the opinion of ordinary shareholders, and so forth. Dmitriy Vasilyevich believes that the biggest flaw in the new program is what he called "fantastically large section on the sectorial features of privatization, which includes goodness knows what -- from timber procurement establishments to medicine and cultural institutions." There were endless disputes in the government over the "specific features" of privatization in literally every sector, which in actual fact do not and should not exist. Vasilyev is convinced that this is only the first "pass" by the ministries and that this trend will strengthen and develop. And as proof he cited a striking fact: On 24 December the edict was signed, on 30 December it left the president's office, and today several ministries have already prepared the draft of one more edict...on repealing the privatization program in connection with the new political situation. The thrust of the changes is to approve departmental monopoly in a different incarnation -- through holding companies and giant financial and industrial groups. To my question as to whether the new political situation is linked with the possible response of the State Duma Dmitriy Vasilyev replied that privatization will hardly be subjected to serious attacks from parliament in the near future -- it has enough concerns of its own. The "situation" in the government is more complex. According to some reports the government intends to use Anatoliy Chubays' deputy's duties and status as faction deputy chairman as a pretext for removing him from the post of Goskomimushchestvo chairman. In that case even without "attacks" from the Duma, the implementation of the privatization program will simply be left hanging. God grant, as they say, that it all turns out to be rumor. I am well acquainted with the situation and the relations that have taken shape in the Goskomimushchestvo and I am sure that following Chubays, his team -- the brain center of the committee with which all present privatization ideas are linked -- will unfailingly go too. Privatization is still a long way from completion and in contrast to Chubays I am, alas, far from convinced that "this process is irreversible." Although it is a case of the foundation of market relations and all reforms in the Russian economy.
