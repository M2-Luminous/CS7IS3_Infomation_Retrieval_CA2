This facility "was discovered and uncovered, and all the necessary steps" were initiated in international cooperation to warn all "relevant companies." "Interministerial work groups" have "watched this project for many months." It has been "possible to identify the project before the project was completed, before any machine was in this project, and up to now, these machines have not been housed in this project." "For the first time," it has been "possible to inform the companies beforehand, to follow up on all information, and to approach relevant companies that produce such equipment." There is "not a single clue pointing to a German company that is furnishing this facility"; however, there are indications that in building the tunnel, multipurpose equipment, which is used all over the world, has been used, which "could also come from Germany." These clues have been under investigation ever since they turned up. Schmidbauer: "This new chemical factory cannot be built as planned because there were certain precautionary measures that did not permit it; however, such a company is still being built."
