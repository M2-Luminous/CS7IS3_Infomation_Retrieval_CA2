UNITED DAILY NEWS reported that after attending the National Association of Attornies General 1994 summer meeting in San Antonio, Texas Wednesday through Saturday, Ma will fly to Washington, where he will hold talks with US officials about the two recent incidents where Taiwan was forced to pay to have mainland immigrants repatriated from Guatemala. A Taiwan fishing boat carrying more than 100 mainland illegal immigrants last August had sailed straight for Guatemala, and one carrying more than 130 mainland immigrants in April was intercepted by the US Coast Guard off the US coast and towed to Guatemala, where it had been headed anyway. Guatemala repatriated all the immigrants and crew. Ma will argue that because the illegal immigrants had come from Mainland China and that their final destination was the United States, the issue of repatriation should have been solely between the United States and Mainland China, and that the cost of repatriation should have been borne by the owners of the Taiwan ships. The skippers of the two boats had promised the mainland immigrants that they could gain easier access to the United States through Guatemala, which maintains diplomatic ties with Taiwan. An official with Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Ministry said that Taiwan has cooperated with the US by allowing its Coast Guards to inspect the ships in international waters. He said that though Taiwan has no obligation to pay for the cost of repatriating the mainlanders, Taiwan agreed to do so in the end after pressure from the United States. He said that the ministry agreed to pay for political and humanitarian reasons, and also to protect the image of the nation. The official noted that both ships had their operating licenses revoked a long time ago. The boat caught in April had had its operating license revoked in March, but had continued to operate as a driftnet fishing boat, he said. Ma is also expected to discuss with the US side a US request for assistance in cracking down on international drug rings and the possible signing of extradition agreements.
