Migdal and Roald Khoffmann: ``Russian Scientists Departing for the United States in Response to the Smell of Hamburgers''; the first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] The article by Sergey Leskov, entitled ``Soviet Scientists in America,'' published in the NEW YORK TIMES, is long and wordy. It gave rise to lively discussion in the United States. We did not deem it reasonable to reproduce this article here even in part: from the objections expressed by newspaper readers in the Letters to the Editor section in the NEW YORK TIMES it is entirely clear what it is all about. We express appreciation to those PRAVDA subscribers in the United States who brought our attention to this discussion. (The letter from Professor R. Khoffmann is published with insignificant abridgements). Letter to the Editor: ``Like many of my colleagues, I am disturbed by the irresponsible and presumptuous statements made by Aleksey Abrikosov, who Sergey Leskov quotes in the article ``Soviet Scientists in America.'' I am one of those who luckily survived the collapse of Soviet science. I received my post at Princeton University in 1989, at the very same time when Doctor Abrikosov became director of the High Pressures Institute at Troitsk. Like him, I am the son of an academician. Although I detested the privilege which I had, I left the Soviet Union in search for freedom and independence, and not the ``good food,'' which Abrikosov puts so high on the scale. I worked with Doctor Abrikosov at the Theoretical Physics Institute imeni Landau at Moscow for about 20 years. I know well the ``food lines'' which he discusses. The specialized elite distributor (exclusively for academicians) was located on Leninskiy Prospekt, several blocks from our apartment. There Abrikosov could have met with Doctor Roald Sagdeyev, although such a type of meeting occurred extremely rarely. The people reaching the corresponding level in the bureaucratic hierarchy had the habit of sending their personal drivers and secretaries for food products and not wasting their own time on this. The phrase ``he went hungry while working for science'' is a bad translation from the Russian (I read the original of this interview in one Russian newspaper). In actuality, he said ``he hungered for science,'' in the sense that he wanted to work in science more than he was able to do in Russia. In actuality, I understand this beautifully. After his early success in the 1950's, when Abrikosov made several surprising discoveries, he later produced nothing significant -- neither in Russia nor in this country. Such things happen with creatively thinking scientists, especially with those who began early, like he. In my case I had a similar sort of experience and in actuality, over the course of the last years of my stay in the Soviet Union I encountered problems similar to those which he describes. However, we cannot blame this on the system or on our former colleagues. When I arrived here (in the United States -- S. S.) my productivity increased. But I know that most of the ideas which I am developing here were formed there in the ``food lines.'' Everything which we theoreticians need is a fountain pen and a little paper, plus the possibility of discussing our ideas with colleagues. All this we had at the Landau Institute: truly I never encountered a better place for work than our institute in the early 1970's. I want to say: Russia is sick, but by no means dead. It survived a far worse crisis after the Revolution when the best brains fled from the country and Stalin dealt with whoever remained. It's like there's something in the air which generates new scientific talents and despite all obstacles induces them to develop. All these ``elite'' scientists about whom Doctor Abrikosov speaks are products of Russian culture, including he himself. Doctor Abrikosov proposes that the West ``assist all talented scientists to leave Russia and to ignore the others.'' This smacks a little of Stalinism! That amused Stalin, moving entire nations through the expanses of the empire. But what about those who love Russia, those who prefer to share the alarm of their country than to leave it, those who feel responsibility for the laboratories and institutes which they head, and those who simply are still too young to have an international reputation? He, of course, knows all this, so why does he say such cynical things? I have an answer for that. I already earlier had heard something similar to this from emigrants, to be sure, primarily from uneducated people. This is subconscious. It bothers us that ``we are eating good food,'' at the same time that our colleagues are suffering there in Russia. There are two ways to overcome this subconscious split personality: either assist them (our colleagues in Russia -- S. S.) or convince ourselves that they do not require our assistance. Aleksandr A. Migdal, Professor of Physics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey Letter to the Editor: ``The article entitled ``Soviet Scientists in America,'' by Sergey Leskov, presents the contrasting points of view of Aleksey Abrikosov and Roald Sagdeyev on ways to rescue Russian science, obviously giving preference to the opinion of Doctor Abrikosov, namely that ``it is useless to assist science in Russia'' and that the only path to take is to help talented scientists to leave. This is a strange and defeatist logic. I respect the right to emigration (I myself immigrated to these shores). But the superpessimistic, egoistic reasonings about emigration make me protest. Russian science in the long run will flourish because for this it has the talent and inclination and prehistory.''
