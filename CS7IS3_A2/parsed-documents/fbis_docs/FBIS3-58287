It has never really been controversial among the 16 Western member states that are starting a summit in Brussels today. Not one of them presently knows how the security needs of the East Europeans can be met in a satisfactory manner. Thus, all rely on the old saying: Time will tell. However, some European allies believe (or are afraid) that the problem concerning the alliance's expansion will worsen in the United States because Congress is likely to reject additional assistance guarantees. At this point, however, one country -- France -- views itself as the winner of the current discussion about the eastward expansion of the alliance. It advocates the establishment of security links with the East European states in a roundabout way: Once they are members of the European Union, it would be possible for them to join the Western European Union [WEU], a purely Western assistance pact. German Defense Minister Ruehe hinted at the meeting of the NATO planning committee four weeks ago -- was it furtively or roguishly? -- that the West Europeans, the members of the European Union at least, are not really free to decide whether they want the East Europeans to be their allies or not. Moreover, the West is not really seeking this option. Those East Europeans to whom the European Union has opened up the possibility of membership will be invited to actively participate in the WEU. Once they are accepted by the European Union, they are also entitled to become full members of the WEU, an alliance that -- even if not formally -- is part of European-American NATO. From this perspective, the current discussion about NATO's eastward expansion is a great deal of fuss about little. In fact, British and French NATO officials occasionally voice their unease. After all, their countries were dragged into World War II through alliances with East Europe. At present, however, these reminiscences are no longer very important. The large states of the European Union, England, France, Italy, and naturally Germany welcome the membership of the East European states. Yet the United States is maneuvering itself into a homemade dilemma, as some at the Brussels headquarters claim with malicious joy and others with concern. In the long run, Congress will not be able to reject additional assistance guarantees for Europe. NATO and the position of the United States as a world power would be undermined if the Europeans should only belong to the WEU in the future. Thus, the initiative would silently pass from the Atlantic parent company to the European branch. This would even be too much for the French, who have always criticized the fact that the United States naturally plays the major role within NATO. French security policy is also aimed at keeping the United States in Europe. Yet the French are not really sorry that Washington's seeming distance vis-a-vis the old continent forces them once more to become active. They will use this opportunity and raise their voices more often on security issues than in the past, and they will passionately advocate WEU membership for the East European states. Paris welcomed the proposal by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner to grant the WEU access to NATO infrastructure through a task force that is independent of the U.S. commander in chief. This would make it possible for the Europeans to shine on the security stage without the main U.S. actor, even though hoping for Washington's blessing. While respecting France's ambition, Ruehe and Foreign Minister Kinkel would prefer both official and personal commitment on the part of the United States. They know what they are talking about: It was James Baker who integrated the reunited Germany into NATO.
