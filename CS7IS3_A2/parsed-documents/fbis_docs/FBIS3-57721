This information was reported to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS by a member of one of the secret services, who also said that the conference had been of an antipresidential nature. The officers and generals had questioned why no one had thought of summoning them to the defense of the White House during the October mutiny. Here are some short commentaries by the persons and organizations named in the newspaper article: Tatyana Samolis, press secretary to the director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. I quote her statement: We have never rented nor are we renting anything to anyone. Boris Nefedov, leader of Arkadiy Volskiy's group of consultants: The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs does not rent any premises of this kind from the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and Zhirinovskiy has never been in our buildings and did not hold any conferences with anyone. As for the views of the military, here is my colleague Anton Grishin: [Begin Grishin recording] The military authorities of the Tamanskaya Division categorically denied the information supplied in the MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The reaction of representatives of the military authorities of the Dzerzhinskiy Division only slightly differed from the position of their Tamanskaya colleagues. It was pointed out to a correspondent that it was impermissible that rumors of this kind, which bring Russian officers into disrepute, should be spread. There does exist, however, an unofficial viewpoint on the meeting which is reported to have taken place between the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and the division's commander. Thus a number of officers of the Tamanskaya Division, for instance, did not rule out possibilities of the kind, saying that if there had been a meeting, then it would explain a great deal -- among other things, the result of the 12 December elections. I remind you that an overwhelming majority of the personnel of the Tamanskaya Division voted for Mr. Zhirinovskiy at the elections. [end recording] I can add one more detail to what has already been said. There is a suspicion that Mr. Zhirinovskiy arrived at the meeting of military commanders to thank the military in person, so to speak, for the elections. By all accounts, the leadership of the Defense Ministry was not informed that the meeting would take place. However, the representative of the ministry declined to comment on the occurence in question, since he did not possess, as he put it, any information at all. Moreover, the representative of the press service expressed doubt as to the reliability of the source used by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS.
