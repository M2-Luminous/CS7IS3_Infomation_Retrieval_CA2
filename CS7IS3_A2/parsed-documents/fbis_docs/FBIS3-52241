In an exclusive statement to MENA today, Kamal said that President Husni Mubarak had exerted special efforts to maintain consultations and coordination among all the Arab parties concerned with peace in the Middle East. He stressed that the PLO and President Yasir 'Arafat are interested in cooperating and consulting with Syria. He pointed out that despite the Palestinian side's preoccupation with the negotiations with Israel during the past two months, contacts between Damascus and the PLO continued through diplomatic channels. Kamal expressed his belief that nothing prevents a meeting between 'Arafat and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before the Geneva summit between al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton on 17 January.
