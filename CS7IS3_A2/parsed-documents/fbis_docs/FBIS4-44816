The Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center has developed a micropump whose central element is a thin diaphragm made of polyimide. The approximately one-micrometer-thick film is stabile up to 400ï¿½C. In the various chambers of the pump housing made by means of injection molding from the chemically unreactive material polysulfone, the plastic film is the diaphragm for the pump as well as the diaphragm for the passive inlet and outlet valves. A 0.25-micrometer copper heating spiral positioned on the diaphragm by means of thin film technology and photolithography heats up a gas or liquid in the pump chamber. The medium which is to be delivered [by the pump] is transported along by means of the heat expansion, according to the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center GmbH (Coordination and Technology Transfer, P.O. Box 3640, 76021 Karlsruhe: Telephone 07 247-82 55 80). The pump allegedly produces a pressure of 130 mbar. It can transport up to 0.2 milliliter per minute at a pump frequency of 30 hertz. The 7 x 10 millimeter pump can be operated by battery.
