FR940728-1-00026 FR940728-1-00010 The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 4 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing. 4 Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action. See section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565. EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V (1993). EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission. The State of Arizona originally submitted the implementation plan revision to EPA on November 15, 1991. Upon reviewing the plan for completeness, EPA deemed the plan incomplete because the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG), the lead air quality planning agency for the PPA, did not hold a proper public hearing on the plan. The submittal also did not provide enough evidence to show that the State had the necessary authority to implement the locally adopted measures in the event that local governments did not implement those measures. By letter dated March 4, 1992, EPA informed the State that the submittal was incomplete. On July 22, 1993, MAG held another hearing to entertain public comment on a revised PM 10 moderate area SIP revision. Following this public hearing the SIP revision was adopted by the State and submitted to EPA on August 11, 1993. Subsequently, the State revised a portion of the SIP revision based on the adoption of a Maricopa County fugitive dust rule, two Maricopa County reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules, and the subsequent revision of the SIP's demonstration that attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by the moderate area attainment date is not practicable. The State held an additional public hearing on February 28, 1994, adopted the revision, and submitted it to EPA on March 3, 1994. The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V (1993). EPA concluded that the State had addressed and corrected the two deficiencies which were the bases for the incompleteness finding of March 4, 1992. MAG had held a public hearing on the entire SIP revision, and the State had passed new legislation, Arizona State Senate Bill 1430, which gave the State the authority to take legal action against a local government if the State determines that the local government is not carrying out its responsibility to implement and enforce the control measures contained in the SIP revision. See Appendix B, exhibit 13 of the SIP revision. By letter dated September 7, 1993, EPA informed the Governor that the submittal was complete. In today's action EPA proposes to approve Arizona's PM 10 SIP submittal for the PPA and invites public comment on the action. As explained more fully below, EPA is also taking comment on the appropriate method of reclassifying the PPA as a serious PM 10 nonattainment area. 2. Accurate Emissions Inventory Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. Because such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the submission. See 57 FR 13539. Arizona submitted an emissions inventory for base year 1989. The base year inventory identifies re-entrained dust from paved roads and exhaust from gasoline and diesel powered vehicles as the primary causes of nonattainment, contributing over 80 percent of the total emissions during the time that the violations were recorded. Additional contributing sources include emissions from unpaved roads (1.5 percent), fireplaces and wood stoves (5 percent), non-road mobile sources (2.5 percent), construction, demolition and farming activities (1.5 percent) and numerous other combustion and geologic sources (9.5 percent). 5 5 This category includes: (1) combustion of fuels for industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural purposes and power plants; (2) waste burning; and (3) geological emissions from metallurgical, mineral and mining industries. EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the plan revision's air quality analysis consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act. 6 For further details see the Technical Support Document (TSD) that is contained in the docket for today's proposed action. 6 EPA issued guidance on PM 10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline . Pursuant to section 193 of the Amendments, the guidance provided in this document, as well as all other pre-Amendment guidance cited in this notice, remains in effect. 3. RACM (Including RACT) As noted, the initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993. See sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C). EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement. See 57 FR 13540&hyph;45 and 13560&hyph;61. As stated in EPA's General Preamble the suggested starting point for determining RACM for a particular area is to list all of the RACM measures for which EPA has issued guidance under section 190 of the Act. If a state receives substantive public comment demonstrating that additional measures may be reasonably available, those measures should then be added to the original list. Chapter 5 of the SIP revision lists the 21 EPA RACM provided in a supplement to the General Preamble, 57 FR 18070, Appendices C1&hyph;C3 (April 28, 1992). 7 In addition to the EPA RACM, the SIP revision includes 58 measures developed by MAG for the 1988 MAG particulate plan (MAG measures). These MAG measures include those designed specifically to reduce particulate matter emissions, as well as those developed for MAG's 1987 carbon monoxide SIP revision that could also reduce particulate matter emissions. Finally, as a result of the public hearing, 82 additional measures were added to the initial list of possible RACM, for a total of 161 measures. 7 EPA's list of RACM for PM&hyph;10 was initially included in the memorandum from John Calcagni, Director, Air Quality Management Division, to Regional Air Division Directors, ``PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product'', April 2, 1991. This memorandum was provided to the State and local air quality planners as guidance in developing the moderate area SIP revisions.
