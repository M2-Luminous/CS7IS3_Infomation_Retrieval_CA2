Incomplete statistics for a large northern city show it currently having over 300 gold shops, with 100-plus more awaiting approval, presenting a phenomenon of more stores selling gold than rice. Moreover, most gold shops are located in "golden areas" on busy streets. Gold, symbolizing wealth, luck, and well-being, is dazzling, fascinating, and intoxicating. We working people have a traditional and extreme fondness for it. Whenever we acquire a litle money, we want to buy gold. Gold is actually a very common metal with quite widespread uses, being edible, spendable, and life-saving. It has long been seen as a special commodity that can be either worn as jewelry or invested as a hedge against inflation. During turbulent times of war and chaos, gold not only is a commodity that can be invested as a hedge against inflation, but even becomes at times a life-saving "amulet." And when this precious metal that sells for 120-150 yuan a gram was manufactured into exquisite and tiny pieces to appear on the banquet menu in our southern cities that were opened up first (according to "scientific research," eating gold helps to prolong life), its characteristic charm in China made it a great consumer marvel of the late 20th century. In short, gold in China has a huge consumption volume which, according to statistics, was 250 tons in 1992, up 47 percent from 1991. While this volume was estimated to be dowm somewhat for 1993, at about 220 tons, there are still generally very optimistic prospects. The most recent information is that gold jewelry consumption for the first three quarters of 1993 was 920 million yuan, with all of the growth focused in gold jewelry. Other data show China's gold demand at 350 tons, ranking first in the world. But we must note that the sharp increase in gold shops and brisk sales of gold jewelry certainly do not mean that China has a sound and developed gold market. The facts are exactly the opposite, that China still does not have a gold market in the strict sense, and that it can only be rated as: A Lopsided Market A gold market in the narrow sense means a trading arena with concentrated gold transactions and gold-coin exchanges. In a modern market-economy system, it is a key component part of the money market. Since the 1970s, the West has also seen the appearance of a gold futures market, with gold markets having become the key area in which Western countries apply economic means of macroeconomic regulation and control to economic operations, turning them to a certain extent along with stock markets into Western economic "barometers." But in China, gold production, operations, and management have long been subject to our traditional planned-economy means, characterized by a high degree of planning, monopoly, and exclusion. Just like a beautiful lady, gold has been raised in seclusion and covered with a thick veil, leaving it with enigmatic mystery. As to output, the state issues orders of the highest secrecy that absolutely must be kept from the outside world. As to products, the PBC monopolizes buying and selling on behalf of the state, with noone allowed to encroach. And as to management, gold production, refining, and flow are managed by the three sectors of metallurgy, light industry, and banking, with the structural separation making coordination difficult. As our domestic gold market is divorced from the international one, our gold purchasing price is far lower than the international market price, while our gold jewlery sales prices are higher than international market prices, damaging the interests of both producers and consumers. And as our gold prices are so off-track, this creates severe gold smuggling, with the state already concerned about runaway gold purchasing. In 1990, smuggled goods actually made up as high as 80 percent of our national sales of gold jewelry. He Naihua [0149 0035 5478], president of the China Jewelry Import-Export Corp, told the reporter that our 1992 domestic gold jewelry sales were about 300 tons, of which less than 40 tons went through the official supply and marketing channel of state-designated banking institutions. The implications of this are obvious. By 1993, the sharp devaluation of the RMB touched off a storm of gold panic-buying in all areas, with gold prices rising again and again, and gold smuggling growing more rampant, causing the state huge losses. The "gold-mining fever in western China" described in some works confirms the gold smuggling. So some people of insight are raising a cry of warning that gold must no longer be dissociated from markets, that our gold industry must be commercialized, and that the establishment and opening of China's gold market is so imperative that it brooks no delay! The sooner our gold market is opened up, the sooner the state will profit, without which financial reform will be incomplete, and we will be unable to shoulder the heavy responsibility of "GATT reentry." Some even ask, as the most precious commodity of grain has been deregulated, how long must gold wait?! By now, our gold industry leadership, the public, and economists involved with gold have essentially reached a consensus on establishing and opening China's own gold market and that, as to terms, such as society, technical services, resources, and laws, the time has come and the conditions are ripe for an open gold market. So our gold market could be said to be: Already "In Labor," About To Be Born An official at the State Administration of Gold Control has disclosed that while gold production in China has always been a special line, where opening to the outside world started later that in others, the policy of bringing China's gold market onto track with the international market is set. In fact, the state has already taken definite steps to put China's gold market on track with the international one. First, in September 1993, the state abolished its former style of fixed gold prices by administrative decision, changing to a new gold pricing system of floating pricing through market decision, or setting the domestic purchasing price 10 percent below the London market gold price, with selling prices the same as London gold prices, and domestic gold prices floating regularly. The state has also eliminated its preferential policies for the gold industry, such as policy subsidies, low-interest loans, and tax exemptions, as well as requiring gold-mining units to pay for the use of geological prospecting data. Our consolidation of RMB exchange and enterprise tax rates has also created a key condition for the opening to the outside world of our gold production. Foreign firms have always coveted China's huge gold consumer market. Starting in 1994, China will selectively introduce foreign capital and technology to our goldmining. It is understood that dozens of companies in countries such as the United States, Canada, and South Africa, have made contacts with China's responsible gold sector, expressing interest in investing in Chinese goldmining. The most secretive proposal is the news of the publication of our gold output, being a further signal about the opening of our gold market. But while this will lift the veil of mystery shrouding our gold industry, it will still be a case of "just as the frown leaves, other worries come to mind." The experts have new concerns, advising that: We Must Not Turn Our Gold Market Into a "Petty Commodity Market" Gold in China is about to be withdrawn from the monetary field, to be "reduced to" a market commodity. The experts are concerned that due to the inevitable drive of profits, just as in the previous opening of certain other industries, the opening of our gold market might induce all areas to act out of their own local, narrow interests, with precipitate action, each going their own way, and the setting up of petty markets "with each king occupying his own territory," to disrupt our overall national market order. The experts' concerns are certainly not overdone. In fact, private mining and smuggling have long since brought "stealth gold markets" to certain places. The most notorious of these was in the town of Ganwangzhen in Haicheng City, Liaoning Province, where peasant-mined and privately-bought gold was made into jewelry and sold, turning the "stealth market" into an open "secret." So the local government planned to establish a gold market there to "standardize private gold transactions, to bring them under government control." On 1 September 1992, the first private gold jewelry shop in Ganwangzhen opened to the sound of firecrackers. In a very short five months thereafter, 106 goldshops applied for business licenses, with 76 going into business, of which 73 were private and the other three collective. The PBC head office reacted to this very quickly, issuing a circular to the Liaoning branch off the PBC on 28 December 1992, declaring Ganwangzhen's actions to be illegal, and emphasizing that until state plans involving the opening of the gold market went into effect, no locality or unit could operate gold markets without authorization. After which, Ganwangzhen's gold shops not only did not decrease in number, but even increased somewhat. This also touched off a controversy within financial circles. But in any case, gold is still not an ordinary commodity. As gold is also an international hard currency, with links to the foreign exchange market, China's gold-market model must be able to play a positive role in protecting our domestic economy, while also being subject to state macroeconomic regulation and control. As our gold-market transaction method is mainly futures contracts, certainly not barter of cash for goods, our establishment of gold markets must by all means not allow them to spring up all over, for one after another of "petty commodity markets." The experts recommend that, based on current conditions, we should select one or two large cities in which to set up nationally standardized gold markets, with Shanghai undoubtedly being the first choice. Shanghai is China's largest gold-jewelry sales center, as well as striving to become an international financial-center city. As it is understood that Shanghai is establishing a trading center for gold and silver jewelry, gradually making the transition to a standardized gold market, it seems that there would not be too great doubts about choosing Shanghai for China's first established gold market. As to the other cities suited to the establishment of a gold market, the experts hold that an ideal site would be Guangzhou. It is understood that Guangzhou also has such plans, now studying the possibility of setting up a gold market. Other news is that in the plans for a financial street on Beijing's West Second Loop Road, a gold market has been included as one of its projects. Other experts recommend the organization of a gold-transaction organ to train talent in and publicize knowledge about gold futures trading. We could set up independent gold exchanges in cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Gold exchanges should use a membership system, with members coming upon examination from banks, concerned entities, and individuals. Pre-Birth Pangs While China's pertinent sector decided in September 1993 to reform our gold pricing system to put it on track with international gold prices, other news is that the gold-management sector has recently reemphasized the monopoly-control system for gold to rectify and improve gold markets in all places, stipulating that all gold produced by goldmines must be sold to the PBC. Concerned figures point out that this step is the result mainly of the lag in the establishment and development of a state gold market. As there is not a state gold market, the state cannot regulate and contol gold markets, leaving gold trading in disorder, and creating a large gold drain and rampant improper trading behavior. In addition, as the relations among all parties have not yet been rationalized, an immediate transition to free trading would involve many unsuitable parts. All such issues are keeping the policymaking sector's policy orientation slanted toward retention of the monopoly-control system. I hold that both the reemphasis on the monopoly-control system and the controversy over Ganwangzhen's gold markets are actually merely gold market "pre-birth pangs," and that gold will eventually have to be given access to standardized market trading. Insiders predict that by 1995, China's gold-monopoly management system will have been broken with somewhat. Time will not wait, and the opportunity will not come again! From the 1990s into the early 21st century, the world economy will enter another period of sustained growth, setting off a fifth worldwide modernization tide. So whether we can establish a large international gold market will depend on the choices we make now.
