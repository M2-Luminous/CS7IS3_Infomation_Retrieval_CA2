Only `Genuine Patriots' Will Be Admitted to The Newest Political Organization"] [Text] Today's Russia, "robbed and divided by multinational companies," will become revived "as a Great Power... on the road of socialism" only through the efforts of patriots whose unity is supposed to lend them strength. The founders of a "People's Patriotic Union" (PPU) see no other road for their country, as they stated at the debut of the new (three-week-old) political organization of patriotic orientation. That the patriotic spectrum of the Russian political reality is saturated does not deter members of the PPU coordination council, who include Boris Isayev, Yuriy Voronin, and Boris Tarasov among others. According to PPU Coordination Council Chairman Aleksandr Sarychev, "The more parties, the better; natural selection will take over and the unnecessary ones will die out." Besides, Mr. Sarychev explained, the new "Union" called upon to unite "only genuine patriots of Russia," without engaging in a standoff with the patriotic camp, will at the same time become an alternative to it owing to the fact that the PPU "is not going to thrust any philosophical dogmas on anyone." The "Union" is open for individual and collective membership, and for the sake of the revival of Russia it is prepared to cooperate with everybody save "extremists, nationalists, and fascists." Mr. Sarychev declined to specify whom precisely the PPU regards as fascists and nationalists, voicing the hope that "these organizations may change their mind yet and give up their current ideas." An economic program that the PPU has already managed to start formulating was described by one of its developers, Yuriy Voronin, doctor of economic sciences. Recognizing that "Gaydar's course of reforms" has "the right to exist," and denying this right to "today's resultant changes made by pseudo-democrats," Mr. Voronin maintained that bringing the country out of "the structural crisis is possible only through increasing in every way the state's influence on the economy." As for prosperity, the chief economist of the PPU is convinced, Russia can achieve it "only if it embarks on the road of a socially just system -- socialism." The compilers of the program allow for free market and private ownership elements, however, but only "in proportions acceptable for Russia." In their day-to-day activities members of the PPU will be, "without endless meetings,... constructively criticizing the government" and preparing in their own midst competent politicians for all the power branches. "People's Patriots," according to the assurances of their leaders, do not share the calls by some opposition parties for early presidential elections since they are confident that a disunited opposition will be defeated. In this connection, the "People's Patriotic Union," which so far has 562 members, is planning, without hastening events or limiting their activities to Moscow, to create their structures all over Russia. In a single, organized bloc, Borisov is confident, the "patriots will come to power beyond any doubt."
