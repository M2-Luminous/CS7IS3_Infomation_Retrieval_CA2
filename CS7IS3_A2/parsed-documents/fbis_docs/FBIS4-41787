This agreement was signed in Tiraspol ten days ago and stipulates the creation of joint-ventures, raw-materials supplies, creation of corresponding accounts between the State Bank of Dniester and the Regional Bank of Novocherkask, free movement of transport on the territories of both parties. Buruian stressed that, despite the fact that the document's text is based on the notion of a "Moldovan Dniester Republic," the Moldovan Department of Foreign Relations will not protest to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because it does not consider that the economic relations between regions are managed by the Moscow Diplomatic Department. Despite all, Buruian doubted the legality of the relations between the official Russian banks and the Tiraspol bank, unauthorized by Chisinau. Commenting on the agreement's article on joint criminal persecution, Buruian stressed that this point also violates Moldovan and Russian laws. "Besides, taking into consideration recent sad events, this point of the agreement could stimulate Russian military formations to enter Dniester," declared Alexandru Buruian. Sources from the Moldovan Department of Foreign Economic Relations stated to BASA that Tiraspol representatives did not consult experts from Chisinau before signing the agreement with Novocherkask.
