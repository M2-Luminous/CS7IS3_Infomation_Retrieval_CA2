The program aims to double the total number of tourists to each country every year to about eight million people by the year 2000. Officials said the ministry has agreed with the U.S. Commerce Department to set up the joint forum for the program and to hold the first meeting in the U.S. sometime in fall. Some 3.5 million Japanese visit the U.S. every year at present, while 500,000 Americans come to Japan annually. Japanese tourists pump about 10 billion dollars more into the U.S. economy per year than is generated in tourism-related spending in Japan by Americans. If the number of tourists on each side was doubled and thus Japanese tourism spending in the U.S. double-folded, it would help put a dent in the huge trade imbalance which is currently in Japan's favor, the officials said. The program is also expected to deepen people's understanding of one another's nation, they said.
