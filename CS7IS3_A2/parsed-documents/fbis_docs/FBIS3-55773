Except We Ourselves.'"] [Text] In an exclusive interview with a BELINFORM correspondent, Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich has confirmed the agency's report on his upcoming meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to the legislature speaker, the meeting will be held in the very near future. The sides are to outline their positions for the upcoming visit to Moscow by U.S. President Bill Clinton, and to discuss the main issues of Belarusian-Russian relations. Stanislav Shushkevich emphasized that the meeting is not accidental, but conscientiously prepared. He also said that he will present not his own viewpoint, but the opinion of the Supreme Soviet Presidium at the meeting with Boris Yeltsin. The legislature leader refused to detail the agenda of negotiations, and added that the following tendency can be seen currently in the republic: "Before an issue is thoroughly examined, discussed, and analyzed, we consider it concluded." Stanislav Shushkevich also stated that he will honestly report to the Russian president the difficult economic situation in our republic. He noted that, unfortunately, there are widespread beliefs that even the best attitude of Russia toward us cannot change the situation. "I have requested a report on Minsk enterprises that are standing idle. I am afraid to reveal the numbers. They are so disastrous that I have asked that they be further specified. Unfortunately, many people at our finest enterprises remain jobless through no fault of their own. This testifies to the fact that our economy is in a critical state. Therefore, I do not agree with the statements that we will solve all our problems by introducing the monetary union. This is concealing the disease. It should be cured, not concealed from the doctor. We ourselves should find a way of adapting our economy to market relations. Other economic relations are out of the question, given our joining the union with Russia. Should this not occur, the republic will be in danger of a calamitous collapse. I will repeat it again: The ruble zone will not save us from everyday hard work," underlined the Supreme Soviet chairman. According to Stanislav Shushkevich, the statement issued by the prime ministers of Russia and Belarus, which has not yet been ratified by signing appropriate documents that would specify the mechanism for implementing it, resembles rather a declaration of intentions. Speaking about the upcoming visit to Minsk by Bill Clinton, the leader of the Belarusian legislature noted that the Belarusian-U.S. negotiations "will be of a consultative nature." When we conceptually solve such issues as disarmament, conversion, and the monetary union, the signing of appropriate documents will be a technical matter, stated the Supreme Soviet chairman. Stanislav Shushkevich said that he had been very surprised by an INTERFAX report citing [Prime Minister] Vyacheslav Kebich as saying that "after Russia joins NATO, also Belarus could become a member of this bloc." The point is, explained the speaker, that all basic documents of Belarus, including the Constitution, set the course for neutrality, not for favoring any blocs. We have a completely different foreign policy focused on neutrality, stressed Stanislav Shushkevich. He admitted that he had not yet discussed this issue with Vyacheslav Kebich, but apparently, it must have been a mistake. Probably, journalists misunderstood the prime minister, he added. Additionally, Belarus has never and nowhere stated its intentions to join NATO at the official level, concluded the speaker. This statement contradicts the agreement on collective CIS security, and Vyacheslav Kebich has always supported it.
