How can one Yemeni attack his Yemeni brother before the whole world in this way? How can the Yemeni generations accept the justifications made by both parties, with each party standing in its own bastion and trench, in defense of everything except the Yemeni unity? How can Yemeni history be written in this black period of a unified state? The Yemeni people throughout the unified homeland vehemently refuse to follow what is taking place. They also strongly condemn these battles, which are being falsely waged in the name of unity. Unity has nothing to do with either the style or the results of these battles, even if they lead to comprehensive Arab unity. What heinous crime is being committed on the land of the "miserable Yemen" in the name of unity? How can one Yemeni soldier stand to see body of another Yemeni soldier on the side of the road while expressing the "victory" smile and waving the "victory" sign with two fingers in the same way that led the Palestine question to the "Jericho farm" or the Jericho enclave, as some prefer to call it. Anyone who hears and follows the hysterical statements and counter statements, and who counts the victories achieved by this party against that, will realize the extent of enmity harbored deep inside these souls and the extent of self-hatred and rancor held against the homeland. Had there been no remnants of pan-Arab commitment, these people would have been denied their Arabism, Islamic affiliation, and even their affiliation with this dear homeland and this good land. We testify that the man on this good land is pure and chaste. Moreover, harm is done to this land's history and civilization whenever a wound bleeds or whenever its calm nature is disturbed by a gunshot, whether it is stray or fatal. Yemen is dying in the name of unity. The Yemeni leaders are vying with one another to fire the "bullet of mercy" at an exhausted body [Yemen] whose history is angry with those who led it to this disastrous fate. I do not believe that anyone can say that I support one renegade against another. This is because both renegades are bitter. Both renegades are leading to a dark tunnel for the miserable Yemen in which chaos is prevailing. Everything in the two Yemens, or rather in the several "Yemens" will be black until further notice or until another generation comes. Brothers, unity between two countries is an intellectual dialogue and a spiritual convergence, not to mention unity among the sons of one country, the one Yemen, and the one heart. Is it really for the sake of unity that the Yemenis are fighting each other, storming others' homes, and attacking others' families? Or is it rather through this fighting that the Yemenis are actually driving an eternal nail in the coffin of the comprehensive Arab unity? This unity rejects such storming operations and victories. Unity requires a dialogue that will establish the kind of future for which the generations aspire. Let this farce stop before the world, and let its pioneers bring themselves to trial before the tribunal of history. Long live the unity of Yemen.
