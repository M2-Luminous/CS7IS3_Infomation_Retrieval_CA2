DATES: The closing date for comments on the petition is November 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket number and notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. [Docket hours are from 9:30 am to 4 pm.] FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Bayler, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5606). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under 49 U.S.C. §30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)((3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. §30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, 49 U.S.C. §30141(a)(1)(B) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)) permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being altered to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA decides to be adequate. Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 40 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the Federal Register. Europa International, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;91&hyph;002) has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs are eligible for importation into the United States. Europa contends that this vehicle is eligible for importation under 49 U.S.C. §30141(a)(1)(B) because it has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being altered to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPV has safety features that comply with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence *␣*␣* (based on visual inspection and operation), 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems (based on inspection), 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems (based on operation), 106 Brake Hoses (based on visual inspection of certification markings), 107 Reflecting Surfaces (based on visual inspection), 113 Hood Latch Systems (based on information in owner's manual describing operation of secondary latch mechanism), 116 Brake Fluids (based on visual inspection of certification markings and information in owner's manual describing fluids installed at factory), 119 New Pneumatic Tires for Vehicles other than Passenger Cars (based on visual inspection of certification markings), 124 Accelerator Control Systems (based on operation and comparison to U.S.-certified vehicles), 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact (based on test data and certification of vehicle to European standard), 202 Head Restraints (based on test data and certification of vehicle to European standard), 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement (based on test film), 205 Glazing Materials (based on visual inspection of certification markings), 207 Seating Systems, (based on test results and certification of vehicle to European standard), 209 Seat belt Assemblies (based on certification markings), 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps (based on visual inspection), 214 Side Impact Protection (based on test results), 219 Windshield Zone Intrusion (based on engineering evaluation of Standard No. 208 compliance test film and test data), and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials (based on composition on upholstery). The petitioner also contends that the 1995 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPV is capable of being altered to comply with the following standards, in the manner indicated: Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: (a) substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation of a speedometer/odometer calibrated in miles per hour.
