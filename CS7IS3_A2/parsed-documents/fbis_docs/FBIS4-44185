[Fischer] There is no reason to be resigned. Kohl must go. If we analyze the situation soberly, we must say: Kohl does not have a majority any more.... [DIE WOCHE] He is just in the process of getting it back. [Fischer] I do not see this at all. His Achilles heel is Kinkel. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will need every vote, and the risk is high that it will lose the votes that it lends to Kinkel in a grand coalition in the end. The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is in a fine state, now that a professional civil servant has finally taken over this party of free thinkers and independent people. The party is being guided out of the chancellor's back pocket. [DIE WOCHE] Should the SPD have taken Johannes Rau out of the presidential elections after the second ballot for the benefit of Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher to give a signal for a change in power? [Fischer] The presidential election was the strategic point, because the question of power was at issue. If the SPD had done that, it would not be Mr. Scharping who has a problem now, but Mr. Kohl or Mr. Kinkel, and probably the two gentlemen together. [DIE WOCHE] Why is the SPD now giving in so much? [Fischer] The policy of the undeclared grand coalition, of the maximum approach to Kohl, the policy of keeping the question of a change in power open, meaning the question of "How do I want to oust Kohl," is basically wrong. The statement that we want to become the strongest party has a charm that is similar to an announcement of the opening of a restaurant: Here you can get something to eat. They have neglected to tell the people most emphatically that it will be a misfortune if this coalition remains in power. I believe Gerhard Schroeder is right in this respect: Red-green would have a mobilizing and exacerbating effect. [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping would probably lose credibility if he were to be changed into a red-green candidate. [Fischer] I do not think so. I am sure: If red-green gets a majority in the elections, Scharping will do that. [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping has announced that he wants to fight the election campaign against the Greens. [Fischer] Oh, I am looking forward to that. I would be very happy if he finally were to fight the election campaign against someone. If he does not dare to do it against Kohl, then at least against us! [DIE WOCHE] How would you react to that? With an election campaign against the SPD? [Fischer] We are fighting the election campaign against Kohl. After 11 years of Helmut Kohl we have the highest number of unemployed, the highest state debts, the highest number of bankruptcies, the highest number of social welfare recipients, the greatest lack of housing, and the highest crime rate since the founding of the republic. In addition, there is the completely botched unification -- do you want to hear any more reasons why we are conducting the election campaign against Kohl and not against Scharping? Kohl must go, because he will ruin the country's future! [DIE WOCHE] But you must help the SPD to get onto its horse. [Fischer] Only those who are not afraid of being quartered can drag the emperor off the horse, the late Chairman Mao said. I am not interested in how someone gets onto the horse but only that the other one is taken off it. Our constitution then pulls up the next one automatically. [DIE WOCHE] Your friend Tom Koenigs said that he does not understand at all what the SPD wants. Do you understand? [Fischer] I see what it wants. But it cannot get into the chancellor's office through the back door. If one wants to get in, one must get in through the front door with the election campaign crowbar and with the toughest possible opposition. The challenger has not been able to make it clear that Kohl is a man of the 1980's and that he cannot lead this republic in the 1990's any more. After the climax of his career, German unification, he has failed disastrously. Kohl's team is completely exhausted. Compared with this coalition, the Gobi desert is a green, flourishing landscape. Around Kohl you only find a couple of parched camels. [DIE WOCHE] What is your model for Germany going to be like? [Fischer] I do not want a model for Germany. I hated model building as a child. The battle will not be fought for models, it will be decided by the mood. Models bore people. The decisive thing is the desire for change. The challenger must create this mood for a new start; otherwise Kohl will stay until the principle of collapse has an effect, and this is very dangerous. Even if Kohl still rules from the Kyffhaeuser [a mountain where it is said sleeps Emperor Barbarossa, who will wake up one day and restore the German empire], he will never be Barbarossa for me, or Bismarck, or Adenauer, but he will always remain Kohl. If he is reelected, this republic will be very angry with itself four weeks after the Bundestag elections. Just as the British were after Major's reelection. [DIE WOCHE] Would Gerhard Schroeder have been a better challenger? [Fischer] I do not interfere with the SPD's personnel issues. [DIE WOCHE] We would not have thought that you are so discreet. [Fischer] I permit myself to note one thing: I find what the almost-candidate is publicly doing to the candidate in bad taste. [DIE WOCHE] If the SPD is not able to pull itself up by its boot straps and grand coalitions are concluded all over the country, the Greens would have to think seriously about black-green [CDU-Greens] alliances. [Fischer] Let me first say something about the traffic-light [SPD-FDP-Greens] coalition: May God spare us that! [DIE WOCHE] That would be a completely unstable alliance. [Fischer] Certainly, this would be a great problem with the current FDP. But perhaps Count Lambsdorff is still going to turn from Saul into Paul in terms of ecology. [DIE WOCHE] You are quoted as saying that a red-green alliance would need a majority of 30 seats. [Fischer] Oh, yes, yes.... [DIE WOCHE] How many more mandates would a stable traffic-light coalition have to have? [Fischer] The problem would not be so much the number of mandates but whether there would be more than just formulaic compromises. [DIE WOCHE] And what about black-green? [Fischer] There is no point in evading the subject: The CDU and we are simply too far apart in terms of contents. However, if the CDU were to undergo a development, leading to more agreement on basic issues, this debate would certainly gain momentum one day. As long as this is not the case, it would be suicidal for both sides. Any kind of adventurism would be punished by our voters. [DIE WOCHE] Is it not time to test black-green in a city for a change? [Fischer] Take Frankfurt. You could say: With a CDU in a large city -- why not? But when I look for this city CDU, I find the group chairman, who is accurately an old Franconian, and a CDU of the past. What should I do with that? Subject to the punishment of our party's extinction, we must stick to one basic rule: We are conducting an ecological and social reform policy, either in the government or in the opposition. However, reform policy must always be the priority for us, and not participation in government. We must certainly not do the same as the FDP -- doing everything just to stay in government. [DIE WOCHE] In eastern Germany the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] has grown very strong. What should one do with it? [Fischer] The PDS is eastern Germany's answer to Helmut Kohl. I am the last one to be filled with sympathetic feelings for the PDS. I still think it was a historical mistake that the party did not break with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]. Therefore, the toughest possible conflict exists in this respect. However, I have never understood why the achievements of the SED reformers are not recognized just like those of the other reformers in the former East Bloc. I do not want to know how many elections Mr. Gorbachev rigged. Nor do I want to know how many elections Mr. Yeltsin rigged -- I suppose, as CPSU district secretary he rigged quite a few. I have never understood why Gyula Horn gets the Charlemagne Prize while Mr. Modrow is put on trial, why Mr. Gorbachev was virtually declared an honorary citizen of the FRG while Mr. Modrow has been declared a pariah. The Gysis, the Modrows, and also the Wolfs in the security apparatus were part of the peaceful change in 1989, which was brought about by the citizens' movements with great courage. [DIE WOCHE] What does this mean for the PDS's ability to be part of a coalition? [Fischer] Compared with the chutzpah of the CDU and the FDP to take in the former bloc parties and, at the same time, beat the successors of the SED, the SPD and we, too, are restrained. Kohl would not have any false fears of getting into contact. In the long run, one will not be able to ignore the fact that the PDS will have to prove its worth in holding responsibility in eastern Germany. [DIE WOCHE] Reportedly, you want to become some kind of superminister for industry, transportation, and science after the elections. [Fischer] Nonsense. I only say that you will not find me in Mr. Toepfer's doll house. [DIE WOCHE] It is surprising that your liking for red-green has survived in Hesse. [Fischer] It has! Just look at our joint political achievements: nuclear policy, groundwater protection, drugs policy, housing construction, foreigners, etc. I am often angry about the SPD, its secret ways, its fear of the conservatives, its shying away from the question of power. But there is a hell of a lot that we can do together. If you ask me about my experiences in Hesse, I am emphatically in favor of red-green.
