O ye who believe, if a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done. [Koranic verse] O patient and struggling Iraqi people. O valiant sons of our armed forces. The dictator is daily persisting with his tyranny and the [words indistinct] with the genocide, robbery, and disregard for all values. A few days ago, Staff General Iyad Fulayyih, the Army chief of staff, and some of his field commanders came out for three days to boast of the greatest victory achieved by the Iraqi Army in its modern history, in the Mother of Battles war as Saddam called it during an explanation of [word indistinct]. What drew attention was the state of discomfiture and anxiety of the chief of staff, whom we know to be resolute and accurate when discussing any of his forces' activities in any of the pages of fighting [word indistinct] the battles of his master's endless battles. This clearly reflected his fear of digressing from what his commander in chief has taught him to say. We do not want to be unfair to the man, for what can a person do when his neck is under the butcher's knife? For the sake of truth and history, we are letting the people and Army hear the voice of fairness. We are confident that they know more than we the consequences of this war, consequences that were brought about by this military thinker who is behind these so-called victories which, according to the chief of staff, resulted from the accurate planning and follow-up of the implementation by the Iraqi Armed Forces' commander in chief. We ask him: What were these victories? What lethal pocket had the enemy forces been trapped in where he [Saddam] inflicted heavy losses on them and forced them to halt the war unilaterally? In which huge tank battle did his armored forces win? Was it the capture of the commanders of five divisions and hundreds of commanders or brigades and divisions? Were they the tank regiments that were taken to the prisoner-of-war camps in Tabuk and Hafr al-Batin? Or were they the tens of thousands of officers and other ranks who were taken prisoner? Or were they the thousands more innocent soldiers who were burned to death by the missiles and air attacks? Or were they the thousands who are still missing and whose fate remains unknown? Or were they the long columns of destroyed and burned-out tanks, equipment, and artillery all along the battle lines? Or was it the strategic reserves that were destroyed all along the communications lines which cost billions of dollars? O great Iraqi people. O honorable sons of our stricken Army. A thousand and one questions we ask with pain and bitterness we feel as a result of the catastrophe that has befallen the Iraqi people, Army, and [word indistinct] and which was planned and implemented by Saddam Husayn and his family which is deeply involved in crime and which harbors latent hatred for this peaceful and safe country. We tell the tyrant that the hour of reckoning has come. We appeal to all the honorable [word indistinct], commanders, officers, and other ranks and ask them: Until when will the tyrant continue to butcher your brothers and sons, violate honor, and trample on values and norms with his [word indistinct] feet? O zealous sons of al-Rafidayn, since when have you been the tool of a tyrannic ruler's oppression? O honorable brothers. The situation has come to a head. The eyes of widows, mothers who have lost their sons, and [words indistinct] are looking to you. Your brothers in the Unified National Iraqi Congress [UNIC] place all their resources at your disposal and you will see them with you in the trench of steadfastness. Let us proceed together on the road of liberation. Do what you have to do and leave the rest to God. There is no help except from God. [Koranic verse] God's peace, mercy, and blessings be with you. [Signed] Staff Major General Hasan Mustafa al-Naqib, member of the UNIC's presidential council.
