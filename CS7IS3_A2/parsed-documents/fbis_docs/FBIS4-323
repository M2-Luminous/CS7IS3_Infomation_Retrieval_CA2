There were also indications last night that special provisions could be made for the boycotting Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) to still take part in provincial elections. However, Government and ANC sources were adamant that this month's poll would not be delayed, either nationally or in any province. Sources in all camps were yesterday also warning against overdue optimism, predicting that a day of "very tough talking" lay ahead. The ANC issued a blunt statement insisting that the kwaZulu government be stripped of its powers. Yesterday President de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela met for brief discussions on the meeting. Government and ANC negotiators also held talks. The king, De Klerk Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi will gather at a secret bush venue early today for the critical talks, which could hold the key to a peaceful election and an easing of the crackling tensions in kwaZulu/Natal. The king and Mandela will meet from 9AM for about an hour before joining the other leaders for day-long discussions. It is evident that the king's position would be critical to the outcome of the talks. He is likely to be offered some form of constitutional entrenchment of the Zulu monarchy. Although he has rejected similar overtures in the past, sources were last night confident the king's demands could be accommodated in new proposals. "But progress effectively depends on whether the King is prepared to soften his demand for independence for kwaZulu and Natal," a source said. It was reported yesterday that Zulu royals believed the king would be prepared to drop his independence demands, but that these would again be linked to IFP demands, for changes to the Interim Constitution. Should King Goodwill accept a deal, he will be expected to drop his opposition to this month's election. In recent weeks the king has said that he could not encourage his subjects to vote, but stopped short of calling for a boycott. Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said yesterday his organisation was investigating the possibility of reprinting the provincial ballot papers for the kwaZulu/Natal and PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] provinces should today's summit result in the IFP's participation in the election. It would not be possible to amend the national assembly ballot paper at this late stage, he said. However, IFP spokesman Ziba Jiyane indicated yesterday that if the IFP did decide to participate, it would only do so on a national level. The ANC said in a statement last night that it would "not accept any attempt to frustrate the holding of elections either in Natal or the country as a whole".
