Beginning as an air squadron with 15 pilots, 13 mechanics, and 14 navigators, the 919th Flight Group has grown and made substantial contributions to the cause of national defense and construction. You, friends, are invited to listen to the following essay by Minh Duc, a correspondent of Radio Voice of Vietnam, entitled: 35 Years of Operations and Growth of the 919th Air Group: On 15 February 1965, the 919th Air Force Regiment shot down a U.S.-owned C-123 aircraft in Yen Bai airspace, annihilating an enemy commando team aboard the aircraft. This was its first aerial victory over the enemy that opened up the air-to-air battlefront for the Vietnamese People's Army. On the night of 8 March 1966, an AN2 plane from the regiment sank a boat carrying U.S. and Puppet commandos in the sea of Thanh Hoa, thus starting an air-to-sea battlefront for the Vietnamese People's Air Force. We had the opportunity to meet the old pilots of the former 919th Air Force Regiment now known as the 919th Flight Group. All of them, whether they had already retired or continue to serve as pilots, share the same military habit, that is, speaking less and working hard. Mr. Nguyen Ai Dong, one of the first team leaders of the 919th regiment is a man of such qualities. He was very excited when recounting his memories of how he flew Uncle Ho to go on TDY.
