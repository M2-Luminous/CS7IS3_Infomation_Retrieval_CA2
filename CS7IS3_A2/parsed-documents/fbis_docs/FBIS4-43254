FBIS4-43254 "drweu115_j_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-115 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Elaborates on Political Ideas Elaborates on Political Ideas BR1406123294 Milan L'INDIPENDENTE in Italian 11 Jun 94 pp 2-3 BR1406123294 Milan L'INDIPENDENTE Italian BFN [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by Roberto Gervaso; place and date not given: "Silvio Has the Television Channels, I Have the Streets" -- first four paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] [Text] Milan -- He feels more of a leader than ever, and if anyone questions his charisma, he adopts a crusading attitude. A Godfrey of Bouillon, as well as an Albert of Guissano [medieval crusaders], to whom God has entrusted the mission of destroying Fortress Italia and of subjugating the Saladin Berlusconi without placing him in chains. The two allies spy on one another, neither trusting the other sufficiently. The two allies are strong as long as they remain united (between themselves and with [National Alliance leader] Fini), but are less united than they should be and than the voters would like. If Berlusconi goads him, [League Secretary] Bossi replies by calling him the "Kaiser," the "Fuehrer," the would-be tyrant, the cynical "foundry boss": It is a difficult marriage but one that is destined to last. Otherwise, it means an early election and political upheavals, with imponderable consequences or, worse, a swing toward authoritarianism. May God help us. And may God help Umberto [Bossi] and Silvio [Berlusconi], the founder of the League and of Forza Italia respectively. [Gervaso] What will happen to the League in the European elections? [Bossi] It will hold its ground. In fact, it will gain a few points. [Gervaso] And what will happen to the government, after that? [Bossi] Nothing. [Gervaso] What do you mean, nothing? [Bossi] The European elections have nothing to do with the Italian Government or with Italian domestic politics. [Gervaso] Do you mean that there are no strong feelings about the elections? [Bossi] Certainly not on the part of the nationalist and leftist parties. [Gervaso] Does Berlusconi not feel strongly about them either? [Bossi] As far as Berlusconi is concerned, Europe is a huge market with no regulations and with no legislative parliament. All that concerns him is financial strength. [Gervaso] Why do you take issue so strongly with the prime minister? [Bossi] Who said I do? [Gervaso] You mean you do not know? [Bossi] I am simply asserting my identity and that of the League within the Freedom Alliance, which, as you know, was launched by my movement. [Gervaso] Why do you say that Berlusconi represents "the old, the oldest of the old"? [Bossi] That is not exactly what I am saying. I am saying that Berlusconi is the last link in a transformation which was set in motion when we, we of the League, prevented the election of members of the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] group to the presidency. [Gervaso] Which members? [Bossi] Forlani and Andreotti. Their fall marked the fall of Craxi as well. [Gervaso] What do you envy about the prime minister? [Bossi] Nothing. I know no envy, just as I know no rancor or hatred. Berlusconi is certainly a man of great tactical skills. [Gervaso] But does he know anything about politics? [Bossi] Enough. He is not unprepared. [Gervaso] What about him do you not envy? [Bossi] His desire to be first. [Gervaso] Why: Do you not have that desire? [Bossi] It is not so important. You see, there are moments in history when destiny, through its often inscrutable designs, places you at the center of historic changes. [Gervaso] That is determinism. [Bossi] Not necessarily. I wanted to be a doctor, and instead, here I am, leading the League. [Gervaso] Are you more afraid of Berlusconi or is Berlusconi more afraid of you? [Bossi] I am not afraid of Berlusconi or of anyone else. I merely note that he has so many television channels and so many newspapers with which he attacks me and deals me devastating blows. [Gervaso] I would not say so. [Bossi] He does, he does. With a great deal of skill. [Gervaso] In that case you should be afraid of Berlusconi. [Bossi] I have the League and its formidable organization: They are enough for me. He has the television channels; I have the streets. [Gervaso] Are you happier to shake hands with Berlusconi or with Fini? [Bossi] I do shake hands with Fini. [Gervaso] And what about Berlusconi? [Bossi] He prefers to embrace you. [Gervaso] What kind of an embrace? A deadly one? [Bossi] I am a prey with talons, that will not allow himself to be torn apart. [Gervaso] If Berlusconi is a Kaiser, what is Fini? [Bossi] I do not know what he is. What I do know is that at the moment he is ambiguous. [Gervaso] Why, ambiguous? [Bossi] Because he needs to be legitimized by Berlusconi. [Gervaso] Does that need influence him? [Bossi] Yes, but I do not know how much. [Gervaso] Do you get along better with Forza Italia's leader or with Fini? [Bossi] Better with Fini. Perhaps because he knows that sooner or later he will merge with Berlusconi. [Gervaso] What is the best thing about Forza Italia? [Bossi] There was a vacuum in politics, and Berlusconi filled it. It is thanks to him that we joined the government. [Gervaso] The worst thing? [Bossi] His materialism. I repeat: He is the last link in a chain of transformation which is functioning as an inhibitor. [Gervaso] Why? [Bossi] Because there is no politics without ideals. [Gervaso] How can you forget that Berlusconi prevented a victory by the Left by entering the arena? [Bossi] But he also tried to recycle the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the Socialists. [Gervaso] What is the best aspect of the National Alliance? [Bossi] Its rational tendency, which coincides more or less with Fini, who nevertheless has to be legitimized by Berlusconi and who thus risks becoming ensnared. [Gervaso] What is the worst thing about the National Alliance? [Bossi] Its banners, its backward-looking tendencies, and its past, which oblige Fini to make certain concessions and to grant some institutional influence to the old and hard-line wing of the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. [Gervaso] In which party are there the most dilettantes? [Bossi] Definitely in Forza Italia -- the party of the toupees and the great vested interests, which has opted for the politics of so-called ordinary society: a disguise for a philosophical plan of transformation. Do you know what the trouble is? [Gervaso] What is it? [Bossi] That those who vote for Berlusconi do not realize it. [Gervaso] I do not understand. [Bossi] The idea of a chaste and pure society set against always corrupt politics is a false one. [Gervaso] Which party has the most professionals? [Bossi] The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], because it is an old party with an apparatus, a bureaucracy, a school, and internal homogeneity. The opposite of Forza Italia -- a very flexible movement, a factory-party which raises the issue of democracy. [Gervaso] Why? [Bossi] Because it is an autocratic movement in which there are no elections, but appointments -- from the top. [Gervaso] In which party do you have most friends? [Bossi] When I come to think about it, in none. Perhaps because the political scene now is in a constant state of turmoil and evolution. [Gervaso] And in which party do you have most enemies? [Bossi] At the personal level, in Forza Italia. [Gervaso] And at the political level? [Bossi] In none, because everyone acknowledges that the League caused the walls and roofs of the old edifice of power to totter and fall. [Gervaso] In which party do you have most accomplices, most Trojan horses? [Bossi] In Forza Italia, I think. Let us hope that the opposite is not true. [Gervaso] Is there fascism only on the Right? [Bossi] Fascism in what sense? [Gervaso] In terms of intolerance. [Bossi] It exists on the far Right and it exists on the far Left. The fascists and Communist Renewal are angry people, active only in word, but subordinate in deed. The former to the National Alliance, and the latter to the PDS. [Gervaso] Is there antifascism only on the Left? [Bossi] No. Look at the League: It is the most antifascist party. It is no coincidence that both right-wing and the left-wing extremists take issue with us. If I appear in public they both give me the bird. [Gervaso] What if Berlusconi appears in public? [Bossi] Only the die-hard communists give him the bird. [Gervaso] Who are the League's supporters? [Bossi] Those who believe that through active commitment it is possible to change Italy; to resolve its political, economic, and social problems; and to impart a new boost to its great social and individual principles. [Gervaso] How many tendencies are there within the League now? [Bossi] Two. The tendency of those who want change, the regeneration of the state; and the tendency of those who want to bring it down or replace it. But the latter are in a minority. [Gervaso] Who is more loyal to the League: You or [former League ideologue] Miglio? [Bossi] Miglio, the advocate of a strong and presidentialist state, has no background as a federalist. [Gervaso] Is the League's former ideologue a separatist, a traitor, or a suicidal? [Bossi] Those words are too strong. In 1992 I included him on our lists to attract the moderate voters, who could thus vote for a university teacher. [Gervaso] But is he or is he not a politician? [Bossi] He is a political scientist, that is, someone who interprets politics after the event. If you give him the steering wheel he will skid at the first bend and go off the road. [Gervaso] But you could have granted him a ministry. [Bossi] Neither Berlusconi nor Fini would do so. [Gervaso] How did he react? [Bossi] He blamed me. He insulted me over the telephone -- this very telephone -- for a quarter of an hour. [Gervaso] What did you do? [Bossi] I let him speak, then eventually I blurted out: "I'm sorry that at the age of 80 you need a ministry in order to prove yourself." [Gervaso] Who within the League would like to stab you in the back? [Bossi] Let us hope that it happens soon so that I can occupy myself with the things I would like. [Gervaso] What, for instance? [Bossi] To preside over the Foreign Affairs Committee. [Gervaso] Who are the complainers within the League? [Bossi] Some people complain about the various regional secretaries. The League's two tendencies -- federalist and separatist -- can also give rise to ill feelings and polemics. But all this does not affect our essential compactness. [Gervaso] Is it easier for an elephant's trunk to pass through the eye of a needle or for a southerner to become a League supporter? [Bossi] Look, a large number of southerners have joined the League. The federalist wing has made a breakthrough everywhere -- from Lambrate to Capo Passero. [Gervaso] Does federalism remain your obsession? [Bossi] It is the cornerstone of the League, the single target, on which the great change depends. [Gervaso] Is the League now more of a bulldozer or a cement mixer? [Bossi] A cement mixer, but if necessary, a bulldozer too. [Gervaso] Could the League ever do without you? [Bossi] The League has battled, is still battling, and will continue to battle. I am a fighter, capable of shooting in all directions. [Gervaso] Could you ever do without the League? [Bossi] I could. At congresses I do not concern myself with factions, large or small. I will continue along the path I have chosen, always prepared to relinquish my post and always willing to continue. [Gervaso] In what circumstances would you leave the League? [Bossi] You cannot join or leave the League just as you please. You join because other people want you there, and you leave for the same reason. I am the instrument of the cause to restore constitutional state. [Gervaso] On the subject of comings and goings, will Scalfaro leave the presidency? [Bossi] Definitely. [Gervaso] When? [Bossi] Berlusconi would say, "Once the new Constitution has been drawn up and once presidentialism has been introduced." [Gervaso] When will that be? [Bossi] Let us say, in a couple of years' time. [Gervaso] How can [former Senate Speaker] Spadolini be compensated? [Bossi] Time moves on, and he has had his time. I realize that the state and the Republic were his life, his family, but now he must understand. Politics is merciless to everyone. [Gervaso] Is [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio a good choice, or would Speroni have been better? [Bossi] Speroni is a formula one racer; Scognamiglio is a luxury car. [Gervaso] Is [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene Pivetti the guardian of the institutions or guardian of the Church? [Bossi] She considers herself to be invested of an authority that comes directly from God, to whom she has devoted her term of office. [Gervaso] Do you have any advice to give to [Pact for Italy leader] Segni? [Bossi] If he opts for values, let him approach the League. If he prefers conservation, then let him approach Forza Italia. [Gervaso] Any advice for Formigoni [Italian Popular Party, PPI]? [Bossi] He has already taken advice from Berlusconi, and he has become his fifth column. [Gervaso] Any for Buttiglione [PPI]? [Bossi] To develop some autonomy. [Gervaso] Are you disturbed more by Rosa Russo Jervolino or by Rosy Bindi [PPI]? [Bossi] I am not disturbed; they may be disturbing. [Gervaso] What if you had to choose? [Bossi] I would not choose. I can only say that Rosa is a well-rounded and fulfilled lady; Rosy is more combative and therefore politically more interesting. [Gervaso] Do you trust Occhetto or D'Alema [PDS] more? [Bossi] Occhetto. He is better balanced, more intelligent and human. D'Alema is a rather serrated knife edge. He is sharper than Occhetto, and the voters and grassroots would be unlikely to forgive him any mistakes. [Gervaso] Are you not flirting rather too much with the PDS? [Bossi] I never flirt with the PDS, which wants a League, within the Freedom Alliance, subordinate to Berlusconism, which has nothing to say to us and nothing to give us. [Gervaso] But as you yourself have said, you would not have joined the government without Berlusconi. [Bossi] But we would have had the same number of parliamentarians elected. [Gervaso] Why have the chairmanships of so many Senate committees been granted to members of the progressive forces? [Bossi] Because of lack of expertise, or perhaps because of the excessive power of the Forza Italia and National Alliance leadership group. Those two parties' conservatives have failed to realize that permanent committees are needed in order to govern. [Gervaso] What about the watchdog committees? [Bossi] In a democracy they belong to the opposition. In other words, there should have been negotiations. [Bossi] Is there any ministry that you would have liked but did not secure? [Bossi] Perhaps the Education Ministry. Be that as it may, we wanted ministries in order to plan the country's future, and we got them. [Gervaso] Are you hungry for the prime ministership? [Bossi] Berlusconi is fine, for the present. [Gervaso] Will this government live long? [Bossi] Probably. [Gervaso] Months or years? [Bossi] Years. [Gervaso] Who could shorten its life? [Bossi] Any ally that considered that the time had come for a show of strength and another election. [Gervaso] Which grouping would gain most votes from another election? [Bossi] None. It would be chaos. [Gervaso] Are you sure that the corruption investigations were a sham? [Bossi] Not merely a sham. At the beginning they were a mechanism of restoration. After the League brought down the old regime, the judiciary attacked their former "masters," by then reduced to zombies. [Gervaso] Why do you insinuate that [Judge] Di Pietro conducted a political trial of the League? [Bossi] Because he did so. When he questioned me he asked me if we wanted to split the country. In any case, what does the League have to do with Bribe City? [Gervaso] Does the RAI [Italian Public Broadcasting Corporation] need to be cleansed or purged? [Bossi] I was the first, a year ago, to talk about purges, albeit in a provocative manner. The fact is that there must be a review of the entire radio and television system, both public and private. Both the RAI and Fininvest must be deprived of some channels. [Gervaso] Which is your dominant trait -- the eye of a hawk, the dogged determination of a bulldog, or the cunning of a fox? [Bossi] I am a hawk who keeps his aggression under control. [Gervaso] Do you feel more like a native of Brianza or a providential leader? [Bossi] I would never have aspired to become leader of the League. It was events that obliged me to do it. [Gervaso] Is yours still hard? [Bossi] Tougher than ever. But my inner core is still intact. [Gervaso] What does your core have to do with it? [Bossi] I do not suffer from priapism. [Gervaso] Whose is hardest: yours, Berlusconi's, or Fini's? [Bossi] Are you kidding? Mine is by far the hardest.
