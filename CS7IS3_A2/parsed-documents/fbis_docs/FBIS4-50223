Since last October, the authorities in the province have adopted firm measures to rectify the salt market. So far, they have outlawed 187 contraband salt markets and effectively halted the once-rampant selling of inferior and iodineless salt. The general public can now enjoy regular salt, which sets their mind at ease. Iodine deficiency is known to cause congenital problems, such as imbecility, dumbness, and sterility. Hebei is a major producer of sea salt, yet iodine deficiency is quite common there, and it is one of the most seriously affected regions in China. The population in the province's affected areas is a high 26.55 million. In recent years, owing to such factors as loss of control over the production of edible salt and loose management, large quantities of inferior and iodineless salt have reached the consumers via contraband salt markets, expanding the use of iodineless salt and causing the incidence of deficiency cases in the affected areas to show a renewed upward trend. To safeguard public health, Hebei Province set about organizing a specialized campaign against contraband salt trafficking last October. The supply and marketing cooperatives, industrial and commercial administration bureaus, public security authorities, and salt management departments cooperated closely with each other, plugged the source of such salt and intercepted its flow, imposed stern sanctions on saltworks engaged in illegal transactions, and firmly outlawed contraband salt markets. So far, the authorities in the province have handled more than 10,400 cases of contraband salt trafficking and have confiscated 39,157 metric tons of contraband salt.
