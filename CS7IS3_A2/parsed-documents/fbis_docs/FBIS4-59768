[Beilin] Good morning. [Rosenfeld] 'Arafat says in a recording that there is a secret document containing an Israeli pledge to discuss the status of Jerusalem within three years of the interim arrangement. And yet, despite the commotion which followed the report, his remarks do not disclose anything. [Beilin] It is a joke. There is a non-secret document, which says something in this spirit. [Rosenfeld] The Declaration of Principles, I believe. [Beilin] Yes. I heard the tape, and it is quite silly. It may be okay for a mosque speech, but I would not advise you to take it seriously in terms of the truth, particularly since the letter story is a joke. The Oslo agreement states that within two years at most -- not three, he confused his dates there -- we should start negotiations, with Jerusalem as one of the issues on the agenda. [Rosenfeld] Let us now address another aspect of the tape -- the call for jihad. The prime minister said: If 'Arafat has indeed called for jihad, the future of the peace process is in doubt. What does he mean, if 'Arafat indeed called for jihad? You heard the tape, as we all have, and he did call for jihad. [Beilin] Yes, he said: We have to continue the jihad, it is a matter for you more than us, and to prove my point, I even asked for a letter to support it. What can I tell you? Those who always attached great significance to 'Arafat's pronouncements, will take a very grave view of this. It is not that I am taking it lightly, but I have never attached great significance to his utterances. I think his remarks about jihad will discredit him in public opinion throughout the world. These remarks will not be able to stop the negotiations, but they are definitely not something we can shrug off, and they will cost 'Arafat more than anyone else. [Rosenfeld] The question is whether we will not pay with victims. [Beilin] No, I do not think an actual call for jihad against Israel was made in South Africa. I think his entire speech there was ridiculous, and this part of the speech looks ridiculous to me, too. I do not perceive any change in 'Arafat's policy. I will see it as a violation of the agreement if, God forbid, actual orders to attack Israel or to disregard some clauses of the agreement are given, or if elements connected with 'Arafat carry out terrorist operations. That would definitely be a grave violation of the agreement, and if it happens, the agreement will have no future. [passage omitted] [Rosenfeld] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Minister Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent this morning that perhaps we should look for new partners. [Beilin] I am all for it. If she manages to find new partners, I am certain she will inform me, too, and then we will launch negotiations with the new partners. [Rosenfeld] In other words, you are saying that past experience shows there are no other partners. [Beilin] There are none, but if someone can find a partner better than 'Arafat, I will not fight for 'Arafat's right to continue negotiating with us at any cost. I think we would all be happy if we could conduct negotiations with someone who could both represent the Palestinian people and present stands that are more compatible with ours. I regret to say I do not know of any such person. We waited for 26 years, and thank God, we are now leaving Gaza, we are beginning the peace process, and we are to have an entirely different Middle East in spite of the foolish things 'Arafat occasionally says. It is no use: Those who would like to use his utterances to stop the negotiations, are bound to fail. [passage omitted]
