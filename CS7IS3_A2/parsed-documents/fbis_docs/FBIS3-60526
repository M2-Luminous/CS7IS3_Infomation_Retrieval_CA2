Channa Reddy, has said. Addressing representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations and the core group on AIDS control formed by the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University at Raj Bhavan today, he said awareness programmes alone were not enough. They had to be supported by concerted action from the people. All sections of society had to be mobilized in a systematic manner to tackle the spread of the disease. Universities had a pivotal role to play in the awareness programmes. The blueprint prepared by the medical University could serve to coordinate the work of NGOs and other organizations involved in the field and could cut down expenditure. The time limit fixed for awareness programmes should be long enough for organizations working in the field to bring about the desired behavioural changes in the individual, Dr Reddi said. Awareness activities in a particular locality could be for a period of three years as NGOs then would have time to draw up their plans and execute them in a better manner. The Additional Project Director (Technical), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Dr Shiv Lal, said the blueprint prepared by the Medical University was well within the national strategy for AIDS control. The University could supplement the efforts of State-level organisations. 459 full blown AIDS cases Of the 19 lakh blood samples screened throughout the country by NACO till September, about 13,200 were found to be HIV positive. In about 70 per cent of cases, the transmission was through the sexual mode, according to studies. There were 459 full blown AIDS cases in the country; of this 152 were reported from Tamil Nadu. The figures were based on screening blood samples from among the urban population. The estimated HIV prevalence in the country, including the rural population, would be nearly one million. According to the Planning Commission, migrant labour constituted about 30 per cent of the urban labour force. This group was vulnerable to the disease and efforts had to be made on a large scale to educate them. The Union Government would spend Rs. 222 crores over a five-year period on AIDS awareness and related projects. 35 per cent of the outlay was earmarked for the Information-Education-Communication (IEC) programmes, 30 per cent for blood safety projects and 10 per cent for Sexually Transmitted Diseases control and surveillance programmes.
