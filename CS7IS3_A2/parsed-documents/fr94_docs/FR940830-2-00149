FR940830-2-00149 FR940830-2-00065 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34-34588] EDGAR Phase-In to Continue Later This Year August 24, 1994. The Office of Information Technology (``OIT'') today announced that the phase-in date for mandated filing on the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system for registrants in phase-in Groups CF&hyph;05 and IM&hyph;03 will be after November 1, 1994. This will afford OIT staff adequate time to complete its analysis of the data respecting EDGAR's performance that was collected during the Congressionally-mandated six-month test period and to report to the Commission. It is anticipated that prior to November 1, 1994, the Commission will announce, approximately 30 days before effectiveness, a schedule setting out the precise phase-in dates for Groups CF&hyph;05 and IM&hyph;03 and all subsequent phase-in groups. Filers in Groups CF&hyph;05 and IM&hyph;03 who are prepared to file electronically prior to mandated phase-in may volunteer to do so by requesting that their phase-in group be changed to CF&hyph;04 or IM&hyph;02, as appropriate. At the time a phase-in group change is granted, filers will become subject to mandated electronic filing rules and all subsequent filings will be required to be filed in electronic format. Once a registrant is phased in, third parties filing documents such as Schedules 13D or proxy materials with respect to that registrant also are required to submit such filings electronically. Corporation Finance registrants requesting phase-in changes should contact Sylvia Reis or Serena Swegle ((202) 942-2940), Mail Stop 3&hyph;8, Division of Corporation Finance, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Investment Management registrants should contact Anthony A. Vertuno ((202) 942&hyph;0591) or Ruth Armfield Sanders ((202) 942&hyph;0633), Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Division of Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549.
