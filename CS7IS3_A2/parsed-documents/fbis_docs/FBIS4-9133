This information has been confirmed by Chief of the General Staff Major General Jiri Nekvasil. Representatives from the Pardubice-based enterprise, however, do not want to divulge anything about this new system, which should be called Borap. "We will not discuss the things under research; they are taboo," declared Rudolf Barak, president of the HTT Group company. Nevertheless, he indicated that special enhancements to the current Tamara system are involved. Tamara can reveal aircraft against which current radar systems are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS early warning system. However, as opposed to active radar systems, which emit radio waves and assess their reflection, Tamara only receives radio impulses from the atmosphere. So far, the Army has refused to purchase more Tamara systems for its arsenal because it is waiting for the completion of the more advanced system. The Defense Ministry currently has at its disposal one Tamara radar and two of its antecedents, the Ramona system.
