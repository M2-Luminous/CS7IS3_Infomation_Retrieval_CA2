'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis, Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"] [Excerpts] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment. [passage omitted] In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons, motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of the Palestinian police in containing them. What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami, member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union (DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad 'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure, from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus; and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip. Salih: How widespread are weapons in the occupied territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say? Abu Mahir (Fatah): There are an estimated 10-15,000 weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] Al-Khatib (People's Party): There is a widespread, large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and individuals that get them if they can afford them. [passage omitted] Al-Shu'aybi (DPU): The spread of arms is relative to how it was in the past. What is remarkable is the transformation in this phenomenon now, to a virtually public one, especially in the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type of phenomenon existing in the West Bank. But there is a noticeable increase in the buying and selling of arms, and a boldness in carrying them. Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad): The spread of arms is aimed at the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of Nablus in the West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale alleged by newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with which people are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This comes after the Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer hold Fatah people responsible specifically for bearing arms. Some families historically known for owning arms, for trading in them, or other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them. Most of them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not exceed the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions and families, by more than a few hundred weapons. Dr. 'Awwad (Independent): There are several reasons why arms are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in the West Bank, but there are no precise estimates about this. Regarding the spread of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now said jokingly that arms are sold by the bushel, like fruits and vegetables in Gaza. But the truth is that there is a noticeable rise in armament, with hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis, and pistols reaching Gaza. [passage omitted] Salih: The causes and motives behind the spread of arms--do the factions have a hand in this? Abu Mahir: There are many and varied reasons for this phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows: First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms. Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins. [passage omitted] Al-Khatib: There are a number of reasons for the spread of arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources, through the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel. Second, citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times, among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or possessing them, especially in Gaza. Al-Tilhami: Naturally, a large number of intifadah fighters had arms, especially in the last three years. This was a distinct increase, to confront the occupation. In recent months, especially after the Oslo accord, there have been more guns in Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai or bought from arms dealing networks in the occupied territories. Of course, in light of the mounting chaos in Gaza, it was natural for organized Palestinian forces to provide the arms necessary for self-defense against occupation attacks, settler operations, or occupation agents. We do not rule out that the Israelis, using their access to arms-dealing networks, might be trying to turn political disputes among the factions into armed clashes. This is something we seriously and firmly warn against. Al-Shu'aybi: Historically, the national movement has sought to obtain arms to use them in militant operations. They used to smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with the difficulty of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining arms from Israeli dealers in the underworld. They get arms stolen from Israeli camps. [passage omitted] Al-Hamdulillah: We in the occupied territories accuse the occupation authorities and their intelligence service of playing a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this phenomenon. These authorities have recently begun to arm their collaborators more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend themselves, instead of moving them behind the so-called Green Line [pre-1967 border]. [passage omitted] Al-Rayyis: The diverse factions have their own reasons and motives that [passage incomplete] Salih: What are the sources of these arms? Abu Mahir: Recently, most arms have come from southern Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with occupation officers. Al-Nazal: There are numerous sources for obtaining arms. It varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal source of arms is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam heroes, who take their guns. Al-Khatib: Israel is encouraging this phenomenon. Al-Tilhami: As I mentioned previously, most of these arms come from arms dealers and even the occupation soldiers, some of whom sell arms for material gain. There is a certain quantity of arms smuggled in from Sinai. [passage omitted Al-Shaqaqi: We believe that the phenomenon is a limited one. It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The supply is meager, and the high prices are staggering. The cost of a gun, since the signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone down one cent. The price of a revolver is the equivalent of $3,000. A Kalashnikov is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at least $10,000. The sources of the guns are as follows: 1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns inside. 2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border. 3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in exchange for their guns, which are then sold. 4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza and bring arms to their relatives. 5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements. 6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from high prices before it is too late and they lose their value. Dr. 'Awwad: There are a number of sources. There are Israeli arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities. There are arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use at the proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there are arms smuggled over the Egyptian border. Frayj: If the reports are true, the people fueling this phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people. Al-Hamdulillah: In my view, the sources are restricted to the following: the remainder of the arms left behind by the Arab armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over the borders of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli sources, including the arming of collaborators. [passage omitted] Abu Mahir: Apart from the motives of those who promote guns, or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms are patriotic and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They will eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation and the settlers. [passage omitted] Al-Tilhami: We are afraid, after reading the provisions of the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called Palestinian police will be entrusted with the mission of repressing the intifadah and the people. [passage omitted] So we will work with all opposition patriotic and Islamic forces, groups, and persons, including members of Fatah and the Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in order to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called Palestinian police. We reject the transformation of this body into an instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a plan to repress the intifadah and provide security for the occupation, instad of eradicating it.
