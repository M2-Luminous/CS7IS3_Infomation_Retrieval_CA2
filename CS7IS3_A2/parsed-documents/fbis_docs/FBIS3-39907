In Russia and the other successor states to the Soviet Union, however, there is no hope for an early stabilization. This is the content of the most recent economic report by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Comparison (WIIW). Concerning the East European reform countries, the institute revised its forecast slightly upward for this year. Whereas Poland was the only country with a positive growth rate last year, the WIIW experts expect the decline of economic activities to continue only in Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Particularly since the second half of 1993, there has been a noticeable production increase in the reform countries, Gabor Hunya, the author of the study, stated. Growth is primarily sustained by domestic demand. The export situation is very difficult at the moment. "Whereas imports into the reform countries rose by 18 percent in the first three quarters of 1993, exports dropped by 1 percent," Hunya pointed out. "This is in line with Western interests." Only the Czech Republic was able to increase its exports because, as a result of the devaluation of the koruna at the beginning of the reforms, is still enjoys big cost advantages. However, the production increase has not yet had an impact on the employment situation. Unemployment rates are still rising in these countries. The WIIW expects rates between 7 percent for the Czech Republic and 18 percent in Slovenia and Slovakia. In Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, the development was characterized by a major production decline and hyperinflation -- which stands at 1,000 percent per year in Russia -- in 1993. A reversal of the trend is not yet in sight, the Russia expert Peter Havlik pointed out. The political and social chaos prevents a stabilization. These economies are particularly affected by the collapse of trade among the CIS states after the dissolution of the ruble zone last autumn. Despite the unfavorable election results for the camp of reformers, Havlik does not see a danger for Moscow's reform course. Even in the past it was not possible to implement radical reforms. Since the middle of 1992, a reorientation aimed at financial stabilization to support production has been observed. The current government in Moscow may even turn out to be more efficient because it is homogeneous, he stated.
