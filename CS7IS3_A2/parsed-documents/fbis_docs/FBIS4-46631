The youth from various corners of Ukraine, who after the corresponding training will be protecting the constitutional order and territorial integrity of independent Ukraine along with their senior comrades, will be protecting people against criminal infringements and protecting their rights and freedom. The main concern today is to provide the young soldiers with suitable conditions for training and service. The discussion was about that at the meetings of deputy commanders of the formations and units, which discussed ways of increasing the effectiveness of indoctrination and humanitarian training for the young Guardsmen and expanding closer ties with the parents of the soldiers as well as resolved a number of urgent issues. The meetings were conducted by NHU Commander Guard Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Kukharets.
