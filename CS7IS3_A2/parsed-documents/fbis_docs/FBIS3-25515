The area has been at the center of a territorial dispute since late last year when reinforcements were sent to the area after complaints that local fishermen were being harassed by Cameroonian troops. President Biya is even threatening to take the case to the International Court of Justice. Today's confirmation of the clashes in Bekassi which happened last Friday [18 February] came from Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe. On the line to Abuja, Valerin Sucker asked him what the latest situation was: [Begin recording] [Kingibe] The situation is rather quiescent now and the unfortunate clashes which occurred on Friday have been brought under control, thanks to the efforts of the two heads of state. [Sucker] So, you don't foresee any more clashes happening in the area? [Kingibe] Well, we are doing our maximum best to restrain our troops from reacting precipitately to any provocation that might again come from the Cameroonian side. What I do now is that we have very disciplined regular forces at that frontier. They are not these ragtag gendarmes or other paramilitary organizations which operate along all sorts of instructions which do not conform to what I suppose a well-disciplined regular army would recognize and I am sure that on our side, we will do our level best to ensure that the incidents such as that which occurred on Friday do not recur. [Sucker] Were there any casualties? [Kingibe] The communication and navigation through the creeks and canals is so difficult that even under the best of circumstances, it will be very tough to start talking about casualties. I am sure that if any, they will be minimal and let us hope that they are. What is important really is that we have gotten beyond the skirmishes. We are now talking dialogue. We are now talking peaceful resolution of the dispute that has given rise to all this unfortunate situation. [Sucker] You said the two countries are already involved in dialogue, but already Cameroon has said it would refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. So what.... [Kingibe, interrupting] Well, this is what surprises us. And well, not only a surprise, but somewhat, I might say disappointed that given the nature of the intense dialogue that is going on at the very highest level, including regular telephone contacts, we are surprised and disappointed that there is this introduction of the possibility of a recourse to third parties. Of course, the Cameroonian authorities perfectly know that neither the United Nations nor the OAU, nor indeed the International Court of Justice will compel Nigeria to submit to their jurisdiction and quite frankly, the best solution to our mutual problem is really the bilateral dialogue. Bringing in third parties only complicates issues further, prolongs the crisis, and unnecessarily opens some new frontiers, new areas of opportunity for all sorts of vested interests and parties which may not wish either of us any good any way. So, I am sure that the Cameroonian authorities, who might have, in their perhaps frustration, just thought any recourse to any forum for the resolution of the problem will be considered.
