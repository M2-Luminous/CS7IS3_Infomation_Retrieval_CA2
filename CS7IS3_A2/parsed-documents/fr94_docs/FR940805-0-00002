FR940805-0-00002 FR940805-0-00001 MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD 5 CFR Part 1200 Board Organization AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending its organization and functional statements by adding a new section to clarify the procedure to be followed when a majority of the members of the Board cannot agree on the disposition of a case or a matter involved in a case due to a vacancy, recusal, or other reasons. None of these matters is currently addressed in the Board's regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert E. Taylor, (202) 653&hyph;7200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The procedures established by this regulation are based on established law which the Board applies when one vacancy exists and the two sitting members are unable to agree on the disposition of a case. Kopp v. Office of Personnel Management, 38 M.S.P.R. 430, 433 (1988); Glass v. Office of Personnel Management, 31 M.S.P.R. 162 (1986); Wade v. Department of Justice, 31 M.S.P.R. 35 (1986); Ingram v. Department of the Navy, 30 M.S.P.R. 699 (1986) aff'd 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Consistent with these cases, the regulation rejects suggestions in earlier cases that the Board members may not under any circumstances delegate final decisional authority. Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan, 4 M.S.P.R. 485, 490 (1981); Kling v. Department of Justice, 2 M.S.P.R. 464, 468 (1981). The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(h). List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1200 Organization and functions (Government agencies). Accordingly, the Board amends 5 CFR part 1200 as follows: PART 1200_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 1200, subpart B_General, continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1204 (h) and (j). 2. Subpart A is amended by adding a new ยง1200.3 to read as follows: * * * * * ยง1200.3 How the Board members make decisions.

The Chairman of the Board may direct the issuance of an order consistent with this paragraph. (c) When due to a vacancy, recusal or other reasons, the Board members are unable to decide a matter in a case which does not involve a decision, recommendation or order, the Chairman may direct referral of the matter to an administrative judge or other official for final disposition. (d) Decisions and orders issued pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not be precedential. (e) This section applies only when at least two Board members are in office. Dated: August 2, 1994. Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19143 Filed 8&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7400&hyph;01&hyph;M
