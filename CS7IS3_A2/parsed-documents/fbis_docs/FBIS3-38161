At the end of the operation, it was determined that no mistake was made in this region. A Foreign Ministry announcement says that Iranian authorities claim certain Iranian citizens were killed or wounded during the operation in the border region inside Iran. The statement points out that the operation was not aimed against Iranian territory, and that the Iranian authorities had sufficient advance information about the intentions, reasons, and targets of the operation. The statement says: Every measure was taken during the operation in northern Iraq to ensure that no civilians were hurt. The technical capability of our planes and the training level of our pilots are very well known. Furthermore, a study of the photographs taken after the operation and a study of the places where the bombs were dropped lead us to determine that such a mistake was not made. Nevertheless, we proposed that Turkish and Iranian border authorities meet immediately to study this issue and that a joint delegation investigate the issue. We informed the Iranian authorities that military officials will also be included in the Turkish delegation.
