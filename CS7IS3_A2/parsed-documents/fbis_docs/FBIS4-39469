Preparations for such talks must be conducted "without political intrigues on the part of some aides to President Boris Yeltsin," he pointed out. In comments on the statement by the head of the Russian president's office, Sergey Filatov, to the effect that after Dudayev's sharp anti-Russian pronouncements a further dialogue with Groznyy is impossible, the high-ranking member of the Chechen president's office said that Sergey Filatov "laid the blame for the disruption of negotiations on the wrong side." "It's no longer a secret that Russia had no intention of starting talks in earnest. It only wanted an excuse for launching another propagandistic ploy," he pointed out. "In what other way, in Filatov's view, could President Dudayev react a few hours after an attempt on his life?" the official asked. A statement released by Dudayev's press service on Tuesday says that "Filatov's explanations as to the reasons why the talks were delayed are so flimsy that comments on them are unnecessary." "They are designed to conceal Russia's unwillingness to enter into truly civilized talks" with Chechnya, the press service declared.
