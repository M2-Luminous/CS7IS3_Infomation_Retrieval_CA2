For the armed forces and the Ministry, which initially requested an increase of 3 to 5 percent on the basis of the 100.4-billion-franc spending obligated in the 1994 budget, this certainly is no great prize. However, with this pledged increase over the next few years, the defense budget actually constitutes an exception to the multiyear Law on Public Expenditure Control, which stipulates a 0.5-percent decrease in all state budgets. Initially, the Budget Ministry had requested that equipment spending in the miliatary program law be reduced by 1 percent instead of 0.5 percent. [passage omitted]
