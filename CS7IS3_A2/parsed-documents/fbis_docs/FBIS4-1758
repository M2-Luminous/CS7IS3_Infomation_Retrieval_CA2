At the same time, it is an issue to the common concern of the broad masses of the people. Since last September, Hebei Province has launched an extensive campaign to oppose corruption. The scale and the achievements of this campaign have been never seen in recent years. Yang Yuzhong, deputy secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission and head of the anticorruption office under the provincial party committee, said to reporters a few days ago: From October to November last year, more than 21,000 leading cadres at or above the county or section level of party and government organs throughout the province took an active part in the activities of being honest, clean, and self-disciplined and examined themselves and corrected mistakes in line with the 10 prohibitions set forth by the provincial party committee. From the self-examination, a total of 11,000 cadres were found violating the five stipulations of the central authorities and the 10 prohibitions of the provincial party committee. Of these cadres, 786 were of the prefectural and department levels, involving 4.82 million yuan in illicit money. At the same time, discipline inspection and supervisory departments also concentrated on investigating and dealing with a number of cases of violating laws and disciplines. From September to December last year, a total of 3,857 discipline violation cases committed by party members and cadres were put on file for investigation and prosecution. Of these cases, 392 involved more than 10,000 yuan in illicit money each and involved leading cadres of the level of deputy county or section head, including the case committed by (Liu Qingfang), secretary of the Lingshou County Party Committee, and some other major typical cases that have produced certain influence throughout the province. Yang Yuzhong pointed out: Through the anticorruption campaign, the wanton collections of fees, fines, and apportionments, on which the masses expressed strong comments, have been effectively checked. The province as a whole has stopped collecting a total of 5,050 unreasonable items of charges, and ferreted out 110 million yuan of money collected in violation of discipline, of which, 8.44 million yuan has already been returned. The evil trend that party and government organizations abuse powers to do business and earn profits has been checked basically. A total of 1,547 cadres were found using public funds to go abroad for tourism, more than 1.36 million yuan of illegal money have been confiscated according to stipulations, and 88,000 yuan have been taken over from 10 units that organized overseas tours. With regard to this year's anticorruption work, Yang Yuzhong pointed out: Although Hebei Province has achieved marked results in the recent anticorruption work, it still lags far behind the goal set by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council for the present stage and behind the expectations of the masses. When viewed from the efficiency of work, the anticorruption work has been uneven in different localities and different departments; some problems concerning leading cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline, that have aroused much comments among the masses, such as party and government organizations vying with one another in purchasing luxurious cars, indulging in extravagant wining and dining with public funds, and holding extravagant weddings and funerals, need to be resolved conscientiously; some anticorruption measures have not been carried out truly and practically; and some achievements are not remarkable. This year, in line with the three tasks set forth by the party Central Committee and the State Council and with the guiding ideology of achieving results at the present stage, we should continue to grasp the anticorruption campaign, further resolve various kinds of negative and corrupt phenomena, ensure the political and social stability, and promote the province's reform, opening up, and economic development.
