South Pacific correspondent, Erina Reddan, reports that the ballot which requires the two-thirds majority is a crucial test for the government. [Begin Reddan recording] Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourts rescheduled the vote to Wednesday. Justice d'Imecourts said he would hold the absent electorate in contempt of court if they did not explain. However, the two opposition members, who were present, said the opposition had received no writs. Although the chief justice accepted this as an explanation, he said they would have known about the vote through the media, and that there was no political advantage from their action. Meanwhile, the government's chance of having the two third majority it needs to elect the president is uncertain. The various opposition groups say they are about to sign a memorandum of understanding, bringing opposition numbers in the parliament up to 22, and they have hope of attracting defectors from the government ranks. The government currently has 24 members. The opposition says it will renew its notice of no confidence vote in the prime minister. [end recording]
