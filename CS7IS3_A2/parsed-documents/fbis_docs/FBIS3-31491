He said that the government had accepted by no means all of the World Bank offerings, and added that regardless of whether the Czech Republic should or should not accept loans offered by the World Bank, or whether or not they complied with the aims of the country, scores of meetings would have to be conducted. Klaus stated that the government was aware that the possibility to cover loans with state guarantees had been at its limit for a few years, but that this limit had never been breached. The government carefully followed the provision of guarantees, he said. Nevertheless, during consideration of the provision of a guarantee for construction of the Decin-Praha-Breclav railway link, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik had been requested to put forward data on the provision of state guarantees for previous years.
