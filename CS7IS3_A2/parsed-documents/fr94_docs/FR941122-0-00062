FR941122-0-00062 FR941122-0-00012 Issue 14: The reintroduction of wolves will negatively affect the recovery of other species listed under the Act. This issue was not addressed in the rule. Service Response: The Service prepared and published an intra-Service evaluation of its proposed action in the draft and final EIS (Service 1994a, Appendix 7). The evaluation concluded that wolf reintroduction and implementation of the experimental rules would not adversely impact other endangered or threatened species. In November 1994, Service field offices in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming reviewed the proposed rules and came to the same conclusion. The Service finds that the impact of the final rules, like the predicated impact reviewed of the proposed rules, will not adversely affect other protected species. Issue 15: The proposed rules did not discuss how potential wolf/dog hybrids or wolf/coyote hybrids will be addressed. Service Response: The hybridization of wolves with other canids may occur; however, it is not a significant problem anywhere in North America where ranges of wolves, domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes overlap (Service 1994a, Chapter 1). Thus, it is not anticipated to be a problem in the northern Rocky Mountains. The rules state the Service or other authorized agencies may remove reintroduced wolves that breed with domestic dogs, coyotes, or foxes, or their hybrid-offspring. Individual animals that agency biologists suspect to be domesticated wolves or wild wolf/other canid species hybrids would be removed from the wild after examination of the canid's physical or behavioral characteristics. Issue 16: The experimental population rule improperly removes full endangered species protection and bestows experimental status on any naturally occurring wolves found inside the experimental population boundaries. Service Response: It is documented that individual wolves may disperse over 500 miles. However, for the past 10 years, there has been no evidence of naturally occurring wolves dispersing to and producing a viable wolf population in the central Idaho or Yellowstone areas. After the effective date of the experimental population rules, any such wolves and their offspring would be treated as experimental population animals. From a practical wildlife management perspective, the Service cannot be expected to determine if an individual wolf had naturally dispersed into the area or been reintroduced. The initial reintroduced animals will be radio collared and differentiated. Once they have reproduced it would be impossible to determine if the wolf was a wild dispersing animal or progeny of experimental wolves. The rule as written helps avoid the possible conflict. Such a distinction, therefore, cannot be treated separately by regulation. Undoubtedly, the establishment of a viable wolf population and recovery of the species will be enhanced by the reintroduction of 30 wolves annually for the next 3&hyph;5 years. The presence of reintroduced wolves may increase the probability of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada to move into, stay, and reproduce in an experimental area. While this event would contribute to population recovery, it would not greatly impact the overall population growth rate since the majority of breeding wolves would be reintroduced animals. Issue 17: Denning and rendezvous sites must be protected, even after 6 packs are established. There needs to be more types of land use restrictions (road closures) to protect wolves.
