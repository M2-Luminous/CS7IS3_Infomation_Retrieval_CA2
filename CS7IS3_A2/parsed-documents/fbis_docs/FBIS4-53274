The resistance was triggered off by the hysteric suppressive offensive launched by the U.S. imperialists and the "Yusin" remnants, their stooges, after expanding the scope of the "emergency martial law" to the whole area of South Korea in May 1980. In Seoul, the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification held a people's rally in the Chongmyo Park and strongly demanded the clarification of the truth behind the Kwangju incident which is still kept behind a curtain and the punishment of those responsible for the suppression of the resistance. The rally was attended by over 2,000 people. Many students of universities gathered in Yonsei University and held a rally before staging a demonstration, marching toward the houses of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the principal criminals in the Kwangju massacre. Upwards of 10,000 students of 44 universities and colleges turned out in the struggle in Seoul and other parts of South Korea. Kwangju was wrapped in a memorial atmosphere. An evening memorial service for those who fell in the Kwangju resistance was held in Kwangju on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the May 18 resistance. An estimated 10,000 citizens and students of Kwangju gathered in the plaza in front of the South Cholla "provincial government" and recalled the days of the resistance, singing the song of May. A citizens' rally was held in Pusan for the clarification of the truth behind the repression of the Kwangju resistance with 200 or more students and citizens in attendance.
