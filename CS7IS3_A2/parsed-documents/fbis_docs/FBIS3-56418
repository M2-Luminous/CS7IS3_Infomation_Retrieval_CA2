Yushenkov announced that on Sunday morning the bureau of the Russia's Choice faction had held a meeting with Gaydar's participation and unanimously supported Gaydar's decision, aware that he could not bear the responsibility for the policy he does not support. Yushenkov said that Gaydar would concentrate on his parliamentary activity and on the creation of a new party on the basis of Russia's Choice. To quote Yushenkov, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is also planning to quit the government. Like Gaydar, "he cannot bear the responsibility for a policy which will inevitable spur inflation". Anatoliy Chubays will stay in the government, said Yushenkov. In the new situation, the parliamentary committee for the budget, planning and taxes should be led by Russia's Choice representative Aleksandr Pochinok, although earlier Russia's Choice had not objected to this committee being led by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's nearest associate Mikhail Zadornov.
