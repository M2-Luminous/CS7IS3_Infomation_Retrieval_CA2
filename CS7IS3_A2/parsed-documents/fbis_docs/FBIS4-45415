Justice ministers and judicial authorities meeting in Cartagena de Indias announced that they will reinforce surveillance operations at port, aerial, and ground terminals and will register all producers of basic chemicals to prevent their use by drug trafficking rings. The "final document," which was signed in this city in the Colombian-Caribbean region, contains the main recommendations made to the governments. Its authors think that it is necessary to keep track of the chemicals and for its importers to confirm their final destination. Products such as caustic soda and ether, among others, are indispensable for the production of drugs such as cocaine and heroin. As for money "laundering," the ministers reaffirmed the advisability of introducing in the legislation of Ibero-American countries provisions to facilitate investigations regarding the origin of capital when there are signs that they are the product of illegal drug trafficking. It also recommends cooperation systems to allow measures to follow up on such capital and the adoption of measures to intervene and, should it be necessary, to seize them. Among the "document's" recommendations is one forcing financial institutions to identify their clients when establishing business relations and to file documents on all transactions for five years. They would have to advise the authorities should there be signs of possible "laundering." The meeting participants also recommended the drafting of a fiscal and banking cooperation agreement against capital "laundering" networks and the establishment of adequate procedures for internal controls and communications. The "final document" of the 10th Conference of Justice Ministers of Ibero-America also recommended increased judicial cooperation among the countries. They agreed to establish a technical commission of experts to conduct a study on judicial cooperation and to propose ways to update and modify existing regulations. Finally, the ministers called for the adoption of effective measures to protect human rights and suggested appointing in each country a "people's lawyer" or "ombudsman," who is independent of political authorities.
