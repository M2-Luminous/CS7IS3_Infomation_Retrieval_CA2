The move opens the way for the PAC to take part in the April 27 election and for the inclusion of APLA members in a national peacekeeping force. Mr Makwetu said the decision had been taken by the PAC's National Working Committee in the light of the promulgation of the Electoral Act and decisions reached at its annual conference in December last year. "The leadership of APLA has started the process of informing its cadres throughout the country of this decision," Mr Makwetu said in a statement. He said the PAC would pursue negotiations with the government to reach a mutual cessation of hostilities and to secure amnesty for APLA cadres in jail and exile. "We will also continue to negotiate with the regime and other parties to get all the armed formations in this country, including the South African Defence Force and the South African Police, under joint control. APLA will not disband until these goals have been reached." He said the PAC expected other armed formations to respond in kind. A unilateral decision had been taken because the government was dragging out negotiations with the PAC and finding excuses to continue killing PAC members and raiding its offices, he said. "Because of our commitment to peace and free and fair elections, we are taking the regime's excuse and taking the initiative to create a climate to allow for further negotiations." Mr Makwetu said the PAC would register as a political party and unveil its list of candidates and election manifesto within weeks. He said he remained confident of substantial support for the PAC in the elections in spite of opinion polls which give it little hope in the poll. Negotiations, in particular on joint control of all armed formations, would determine whether the PAC would join the Transitional Executive Council (TEC). However, the TEC Act stipulates that only TEC members are eligible to have their soldiers included in a joint peacekeeping force. The PAC move follows pressure from Tanzania and Zimbabwe on the PAC to rejoin the constitutional process and a threat by those countries to act against the PAC if APLA continued to operate from those territories, formerly supporters of its war on the South African Government. Mr Makwetu said he could not rule out any further APLA attacks as it would take some time before all APLA cadres were informed of the decision.
