ACTION: Notice of final fair market rents; amendment. SUMMARY: Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs) periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year. FMRs are used for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subparts A and B), including space rentals by owners of manufactured homes under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subpart F); the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program (part 882, subparts D and E); Section 8 housing assisted under part 886, subparts A and C (Section 8 Loan Management and Property Disposition programs); and are used to determine payment standard schedules in the Rental Voucher program (part 887). HUD published proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 27062) and solicited public comments for a 60-day period. The FY 1994 FMRs were the first to be developed with revisions based on use of the 1990 Census data; they also included post-Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) and Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys. Because of the large number of requests in response to changes in the FMRs caused by the Census data rebenchmarking, the public comment period was extended to August 31, 1993 by notice on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36175). On October 1, 1993, HUD published final FMRs for all areas, including over 600 areas that still had comments under review. The FMRs for those areas were retained at the levels of the previous year (FY 1993) pending completion of the review of the comments. This review has now been completed and today's notice announces final FY 1994 FMR schedules for the areas under review. The FMR schedules for all areas are included in this notice to avoid the confusion of having more than one publication of FY 1994 FMRs. EFFECTIVE DATE: The FMRs published in this notice are effective on April 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shirley C. Stone, Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing, telephone (202) 708&hyph;0477. For technical information on the development of schedules for specific areas or the method used for the rent calculations, contact Michael R. Allard, Economic and Market Analysis Division, Office of Economic Affairs, telephone (202) 708&hyph;0577. The TDD number for the hearing impaired is (202) 708&hyph;0770. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f) authorizes a housing assistance program to aid lower income families in renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Assistance payments are limited by Fair Market Rents (FMRs), or payment standards in the Rental Voucher Program, established by HUD for different areas. In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to rent privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities. Section 8(c) of the Act requires the Secretary of HUD to publish FMRs periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year. The FMRs must reflect changes based on the most recent available data so FMRs will be current for the year in which they apply. Metropolitan Area Definitions In the May 6, 1993 publication of the proposed FMRs, HUD announced that the FMR area definitions, with several exceptions, incorporated the changes made in the definitions of metropolitan areas by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Bulletin No. 93&hyph;05). The HUD exceptions were for nine large metropolitan areas whose revised OMB definitions encompassed areas larger than what HUD considers appropriate for FMR area definitions.
