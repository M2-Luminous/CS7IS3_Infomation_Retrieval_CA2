At a time when Algerians aspired to "return to a state of calm" in a period of devotion favorable to meditation and solidarity, terrorism showed its claws. With rare ferocity. We even had the impression that the armed groups, cornered and losing ground among the population, threw all their forces into the battle this month. Result: an unbelievable increase in attacks and assassinations, especially in the Algiers area, and therefore an ever longer victims list, in spite of the vigilance and fighting spirit of the police, who remain mobilized to prevent the worst from happening. Therefore, there were deaths, many deaths during these first two weeks of Ramadan, but also many acts of economic and cultural sabotage. In fact, simultaneously with the assassinations that they commit with a violence and an atrocity that are beyond all understanding, the fundamentalists were out to destroy public enterprises and schools by setting them on fire. The security departments indicated that, during the last 48 hours only, several companies and schools were destroyed by terrorists. In the Blida area, four schools, the seat of an APC [People's Communal Assembly], and that of a state-owned asphalting company were set on fire. In the Tipaza governorate, the rolling enclosure of a state-owned company, a school, and a telephone distributing frame were also destroyed through arson. At Relizane and throughout Algeria, we can see the same devastation, the "scorched earth" which, by force of circumstances, has become the terrorists' macabre signature. From another source, we learned that about 20 schools were destroyed since the beginning of the year, while 100 or so teachers were killed by terrorists, often under particularly atrocious conditions. The toll is already heavy. Citizens no longer know where to turn, as they are subjected daily to a veritable terror psychosis. What can they do in such an atmosphere? This question is on everyone's mind as we face a very dangerous upsurge in fundamentalist activism, which obviously intends to gain ground in order to prevent democratic society from expressing itself. It is through fear and systematic destruction that the fundamentalists challenge the new government. That is also the proof that their arguments do not carry much weight compared with the social and economic realities of Algeria, which essentially rejects criminals.
