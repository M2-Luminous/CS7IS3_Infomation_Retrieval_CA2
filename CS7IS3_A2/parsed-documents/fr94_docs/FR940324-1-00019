FR940324-1-00019 FR940324-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs 22 CFR Part 89 [Public Notice 1969] Foreign Prohibitions on Longshore Work by U.S. Nationals AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, the Department of State is compiling information to update the list, by particular activity, of countries that prohibit by law, regulation or in practice crewmembers aboard U.S. vessels from performing longshore work. DATES: Interested parties are invited to submit comments in triplicate by April 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: For mailing public comments: Office of Maritime and Land Transport (EB/TRA/MA), room 5828, Department of State, Washington, DC. 20520&hyph;5816. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen M. Miller, Office of Maritime and Land Transport, Department of State, (202) 647&hyph;6961. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 258(d)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as added by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649, 8 U.S.C. ยง1288 (hereinafter: the Act) directs the Secretary of State (hereinafter: the Secretary) to compile and annually maintain a list, of longshore work by particular activity, of countries where performance of such activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels is prohibited by law, regulation or in practice by the country. The Attorney General will use the list to determine whether to permit an alien crewmember to perform an activity constituting longshore work in the United States or its coastal waters, in accordance with the conditions set in the Act. The Department issued a list in Final Rule (56 FR 66970) on December 17, 1991, with correction at 57 FR 1384 on January 14, 1992. On December 13, 1993, an updated list was issued at 58 FR 65118. The Department formulated the lists on the basis of reports from United States diplomatic posts aboard about relevant laws, regulations and practices of their host countries and submissions from interested parties in response to the notice-and-comment process. To update the list, the Department proposes to ask U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad to contact host government officials and other appropriate sources for information on (a) any host government laws or regulations restricting or having the effect of restricting any type of longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels, including general immigration laws and regulations, (b) host country practices restricting the crews of U.S. vessels from performing any type of longshore activity normally performed in the country in the past year, and (c) changes in host country laws, regulations or practices which have reduced or increased restrictions on longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels. Through this notice, the Department is seeking comments from interested parties. Taking into account the language of section 258 and its legislative history, the Department adopted in prior rulemakings an interpretation that confined its reach to situations in which crewmenbers of U.S. vessels were precluded from performing longshore work in a foreign port by virtue of specific laws, regulations or governmental imposition or approval of collective bargaining agreements. As part of the proposed rulemaking, the Department is considering whether the above interpretation of section 258 should be maintained. Interested parties are therefore invited to submit comments on this question, including its policy implications, as well. Copies of public comments submitted in response to this Notice and reports from the U.S. diplomatic posts abroad will be available for public inspection in Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C St., NW., Washington, DC. For access, interested persons should call Olga Luck at (202) 647&hyph;8484. Dated: March 18, 1994. James R. Tarrant, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Affairs, Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, Department of State.
