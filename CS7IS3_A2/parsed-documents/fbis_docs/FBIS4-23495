One such movement is the Movement for Democracy and Development [MDD], and Moussa Medella, one of its officials, talked to our correspondent Malam Yaro in Niamey about the progress made in the negotiations with the government. [Begin recording] [Medella] Yes, we have been contacted several times by Ndjamena through the official channels but Ndjamena wants to hold separate negotiations whereas the MDD wants general negotiations involving all the sons of this country. Since Chad experienced a civil war some time ago, we really want a general solution for all Chadians. [Yaro] Another question, Sir: Does the MDD plan to participate in the upcoming elections in Chad? [Medella] Well, we are far from resolving the election problem because none of the conditions have been met. The negotiations have not been completed, there is no national Army in the country, and about 60 to 70 percent of Chadians live outside because of the insecurity in the country. The conditions have therefore not been met. [end recording]
