The initiative is expected to put the ROC [Republic of China] in a better position to negotiate and avoid having -several layers of skin peeled off," said Economics Minister Chiang Pinkung. Chiang made the remarks before a 17-member Taipei delegation left for Washington to discuss temporary tariff cuts on 699 agricultural and industrial products with U.S. officials. Washington has rejected Taipei's proposal to incorporate the talks concerning tariff cuts on 699 items into trade and tariff negotiations related to Taipei's bid to rejoin GATT. Accordingly, the tariff cuts on 699 items will be a series of "unilateral" trade demands by the United States. "It will be like having several layers of our skin peeled off," Chiang said. To avoid the unfavorable situation, Chiang said the government would time tariff cuts to minimize their impact on local industries. During the upcoming tariff talks with Washington, slated for Jan. 19-21, the Taipei delegation will relay the government's hopes of conducting the annual "bilateral tariff concessions talks" as soon as possible, Chiang said. Chiang noted that the government here is unable to fully comply with the U.S. request to reduce tariff rates on 514 industrial products and 185 agricultural items by 50 percent. He said less than 50 industrial items, including cars and electrical appliances, will see their tariffs reduced, while tariffs on 185 agricultural items would remain unchanged. The Taipei delegation will detail the reasons behind the ROC's position to the U.S. negotiators. Heading the delegation is Huang Yenchao, director general of the Board of Foreign Trade. His U.S. counterpart is Robert Cassidy, an assistant U.S. trade representative. While in Washington, the Taipei delegation is expected to face strong U.S. pressure to reduce tariffs on 699 items, as relevant U.S. manufacturers and congressmen are urging that the U.S. government use its Super 301 provision to force Taipei to cut the tariffs. Should Taipei reject the U.S. request, its bid to rejoin GATT could be affected. Washington officials earlier said the progress of Taipei's bid to rejoin the world trade body would hinge on Taiwans efforts to reduce tariffs. The government here applies to enter the GATT on Jan. 1, 1990 under the title of "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." The application will have to be endorsed by at least two thirds of the GATT members, now totaling around 110, to be officially accepted. As part of the government's efforts to enter GATT, it has decided to cut its weighted average tariff to around 3.5 percent from the current level of 4.2 percent.
