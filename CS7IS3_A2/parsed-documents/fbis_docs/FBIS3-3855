Mr Huang, who was attending the National People's Congress meeting, said there was "nothing to discuss" with Britain which was adopting an "unco-operative" attitude with China over political development in Hong Kong. His comment, different in tone to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, cast doubt on projects to ease traffic congestion between China and Hong Kong. Mr Qian had pledged that China was willing to cooperate with Britain on issues outside politics. The Shenzhen government has been discussing with Hong Kong the 24-hour opening of the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint. But Mr Huang said that although there were a few projects in the pipeline, discussions would not be started at present, apparently referring to the construction of a Shenzhen-Hong Kong highway.
