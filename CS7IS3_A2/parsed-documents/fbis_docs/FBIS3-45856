To fulfill these objectives, there is a need to implement nine measures. The first and foremost is to further emancipate our minds, change our concepts, and deepen reform. Meng Qingping particularly stressed the importance of stepping up the reform of state-owned enterprises. He said: In accordance with the plan of the State Economic and Trade Commission, this year Hubei will carry out a five-four-four-one program. Specifically, we will transform the operational mechanism of 500 large and medium enterprises; we will select 40 large and medium state enterprises for the implementation of the regulations on supervision over state assets and will form a new system under which the state exercises uniform ownership, the government exercises graded management, and the enterprise carries out independent operations; we will select 40 large and medium state enterprises for the trial establishment of a modern enterprise system under which government administration is separated from enterprise management and scientific management is exercised, to gain experience for the overall implementation of a modern enterprises system; and, in coordination with the relevant state department, we will select one city for a reform experiment which will reduce the enterprises' burdens and improve their circulating fund rate. On enterprise reform, Meng Qingping pointed out the need to make major efforts to adjust the enterprises' organizational structure. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in forming enterprise groups; on the other, it is necessary to promote the merger, reorganization, and combination of enterprises. In the meantime, a small number of enterprises that incur losses should be encouraged to announce their bankruptcy. Attention should also be paid to reforming the enterprises' operational methods. In the course of ensuring the taxation contract system's stable transformation into a new taxation system, it is necessary to increase the momentum of introducing the enterprise shareholding system, to popularize the practice of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by civilians, and to encourage enterprises with the necessary conditions to carry out wage system reform and form limited liability companies or limited shareholding companies.
