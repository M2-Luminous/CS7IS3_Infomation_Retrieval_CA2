The need to increase coffee production, a source of hard currency for Cuba, as well as a way of repopulating the mountain region of Guisa, which has a shortage of workers, was stressed in a meeting with 18 of these applicants. Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Alfredo Enriquez Pina announced that these workers and their relatives add up to 472 people; they can tend an area of 387 caballerias for coffee production. Jordan added that this situation is under study to set up contracts and to grant the land to them, since in the mountain regions of the country, there are approximately 2,000 caballerias that the state cannot make productive because of labor force shortages. Alfredo Enriquez Pina stated that everyone moving to the mountains, people with demonstrated revolutionary aptitudes, people able to make the land produce, people able to repopulate the mountains, and zealous guardians of the Revolution must be given incentives.
