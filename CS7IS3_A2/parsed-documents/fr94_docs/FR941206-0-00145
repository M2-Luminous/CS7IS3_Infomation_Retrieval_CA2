FR941206-0-00145 FR941206-0-00019 On August 11, 1992, the EPA proposed its interpretation of the term ``no migration'', the procedures and substantive requirements for submitting to the EPA a petition to demonstrate ``no migration'' from a land disposal unit, and the EPA's criteria for evaluating the petitions (57 FR 35940). This proposal includes amending 40 CFR 268.6 to add as a condition for receiving a no migration variance that the applicant demonstrate that the subject land disposal unit complies with the applicable air emission standards the EPA has developed under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. c. Corrective action requirements. The EPA is temporarily deferring applicability of the subpart CC standards to any tank, surface impoundment, or container which is used solely for on-site treatment or storage of hazardous waste that is generated as the result of implementing remedial activities required under the RCRA corrective action authorities of 3004(u), 3004(v) or 3008(h). The EPA's rationale for this temporary deferral is explained in section VII.A.1 of this preamble. 2. RCRA Rules for Hazardous Waste Generators Hazardous waste generators who accumulate waste on-site in containers or tanks for short periods of time can elect to be exempted from RCRA subtitle C permitting requirements provided that a generator complies with provisions specified in 40 CFR 262.34. The EPA allows a generator who generates 1,000 kilograms or more of hazardous waste per month to accumulate the hazardous waste on-site for up to 90 days in tanks and containers without a permit provided the generator complies with certain conditions specified in 40 CFR 262.34(a). These conditions include compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart I when the waste is accumulated in a container and 40 CFR part 265, subpart J when the waste is accumulate in a tank. Tanks and containers used to accumulate hazardous waste on-site for 90 days or less pursuant to the conditions of 40 CFR 262.34(a) are hereafter referred to in this preamble as ``90-day tanks and containers.'' The rule promulgated today only amends the RCRA permit exemption requirements for generators operating 90-day tanks and containers. This action does not affect the existing RCRA permit exemption requirements for generators operating tanks and containers for on-site accumulation of hazardous waste in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 262.34 (d) or (e). Applicability of today's rule to 90-day tanks and containers is discussed further in Section VI.D of this preamble. 3. RCRA Rules for Hazardous Waste Transporters Regulations in 40 CFR part 263 establish standards that apply to persons transporting hazardous waste within the United States if the transportation requires a manifest under 40 CFR part 262. Today's action does not change the RCRA rules under 40 CFR part 263. However, the air standards promulgated today may indirectly affect transporters accepting certain organic-containing hazardous wastes from TSDF owners and operators. The final subpart CC standards require that TSDF owners and operators only load these hazardous wastes into containers (including tank truck, railcars, and roll-off boxes) that use air emission controls as specified in the rule. Consequently, to continue accepting hazardous waste from a TSDF owner or operator, in some cases, transporters may need to ensure that their containers meet the subpart CC standards. D. Relationship to CERCLA Standards The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to undertake removal and remedial actions to clean up hazardous substance releases. Under CERCLA, on-site remedial actions are required to comply with the requirement of Federal and more stringent State environmental laws that are applicable or relevant and appropriate (ARAR) to the remedial action unless certain statutory waivers apply. In addition, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP) provides that removal actions shall attain ARAR to the extent practicable considering the exigencies of the situation. [40 CFR 300.415(i)]. As explained in section VII.A.1 of this preamble, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, containers and surface impoundments which are being used to treat or store hazardous wastes containing organics generated on-site from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities, or similar State remediation authorities, provided that the wastes are managed in units that do not also manage other hazardous waste containing organics. However, after the temporary deferral has been lifted, today's rules may be considered an ARAR for certain types of remedial and removal actions. A requirement under a Federal or State environmental law may be either ``applicable'' or ``relevant and appropriate,'' but not both, to a remedial or removal action conducted at a CERCLA site. An ARAR is identified on a site-specific basis in a two-part analysis that considers first, whether a given requirement is applicable; then, if it is not applicable, whether it is nevertheless both relevant and appropriate. ``Applicable'' requirements as defined in the NCP are those that specifically address a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstances found at a CERCLA site. [40 CFR 300.415(i)]. ``Relevant and appropriate'' requirements are those that, while not ``applicable'' at a CERCLA site, address problems or situations sufficiently similar to those encountered at the CERCLA site that their use is well suited to the particular site. [40 CFR 300.415(i)].
