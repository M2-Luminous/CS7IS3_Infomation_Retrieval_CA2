The first group of 60 technical and professional training schools (also called professional education centers) have been set up, equipped with advanced educational appliances and equipment such as computer systems. Each of the schools has an average of 17,000 sq m of floor space and 1,620 students. Such schools used to be run by individual counties and they were small and short of teachers and teaching facilities. Statistics from 1990 show that each county with a population of about 300,000 had nine such schools on average, with only 100 to 200 students. With progress made in the rural economy, more and more peasants are eager to learn new knowledge and skills. In 1991 the provincial government urged various counties to concentrate their efforts on building one or two comprehensive education centers. The second group of such schools is now under construction and they are expected to be operational in July this year. The province plans to build one such high-grade comprehensive technical school in every county by 1995.
