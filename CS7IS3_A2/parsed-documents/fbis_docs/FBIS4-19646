This was emphasized by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the Institute for World Economy (IfW), Kiel, in their 10th report on adjustment progress in eastern Germany. The recent report, which was again elaborated with the cooperation of the Halle Economic Research Institute, focuses on the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany, for which 5,400 industrial and trade enterprises were questioned in the winter of 1993/94. The institutes note that in 1993 the situation of the industry has for the first time improved again. Investments were having an increasing effect on production. There is hardly any industry with a decreasing production. The current order books suggest a sustained growth in production. Yet, the developments were still lacking in width. Few industrial enterprises were managing to develop supraregional markets independently. Mainly as a result of the high wage costs, the enterprises were exposed to stiff competition, increasingly also from contenders in Central and East Europe. The recession in western Germany has made sales in the old laender more difficult, outstanding debts were increasing, and the pressure of competition from Western companies, whose offers do in many cases not even cover the costs, has increased. Yet, some sales problems were also the result of oversupply in the new laender (bakeries, butcher's shops, industrial enterprises related to the construction sector, car repair shops). Now as then, almost 70 percent of all industrial enterprises complain about the high pace of wage increases. The institutes have therefore not been surprised at the results of the survey, where wages in 35 percent of industrial enterprises and 32 percent of trade enterprises were below the agreed minimum pay. Altogether, the unit labor costs were still some 40 percent above the western level, and enterprises were still making losses because the total amount of money paid to wage or salary earners was higher than the national income. Considering the expected wage increase of almost 10 percent in 1994 -- after almost 15 percent in 1993, the situation will hardly change for the time being. Thus, the pressure on enterprises to streamline their firms remains high, and no easing of the tense labor market can be expected. In this situation it is not easy for enterprises to mobilize capital for investments, particularly since, in many cases, they still had to pay back old debts and are often unable to offer any security. In the case of newly founded enterprises and small businesses this was considerably slowing down expansion. At the same time, the institutes expressed their understanding for the careful position of the banks. Possibilities for improvements are obviously seen regarding public investment subsidies, which are not sufficiently tailored to the needs of enterprises and can often be obtained only with great difficulty or arrive too late. Investments in the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany were up more than 10 percent in 1993, while for 1993 the growth rate is expected to slow down slightly. In 1993, investment per employee in industrial enterprises was DM28,700, or almost DM4,000 more than in 1992. In the sphere of trade it was DM18,100, after DM20,500 in the previous year. Investment per employee was lowest in Trust Agency enterprises (DM16,500), while it was highest in companies belonging to west German or foreign enterprises (DM47,000). One in 10 enterprises were not planning any investment at all in 1994, while just under one-third of industrial enterprises and two-fifths of trade enterprises had not yet made a final decision. As far as jobs are concerned, the number is expected to increase by some 6 percent in the sphere of trade. Yet, this is not sufficient to offset the planned job cuts in the industry of 5 percent. On the other hand, it was mainly trade enterprises that complained most about the shortage of skilled labor. The report takes a critical view of the issue of industrial cores. The institutes complain that the definition was not clear. In their view, the old industrial centers in eastern Germany should not be considered as cores but as shells. Their revitalization could be successful only where a new, fertile seed was implanted. DIW and IfW are worried that the means badly needed to develop productive areas might be directed toward unproductive areas. They conclude their report by warning that without belittling the success of putting enterprises on a sound footing again, high subsidies cannot be a guarantor of success.
