Ministry officials said Wednesday that Korea and Russia have decided to open three to four pilot research complexes in Moscow this year to accelerate transfers of advanced Russian technology. The project is expected to enhance current Korean-Russian research cooperation, exchanges of researchers and training of engineers, the officials said. Through the program, Korea will be able to utilize Russia's vast and sophisticated research facilities and brainpower to acquire intensive scientific and technological information from the ex-superpower, they said. The complexes will be locally incorporated through joint investments, with Korea paying cash for maintenance and research in the beginning stage and Russia providing the facilities and manpower. Research will be focused on technologies concerning machinery, materials, and electric/electronics that are lacking among Korean manufacturers as well as physics, chemistry and other basic sciences. For its part, the government will offer advice, help in choosing, commissioning and registering Russian partners, and subsidies for research projects and other expenses, the officials said.
