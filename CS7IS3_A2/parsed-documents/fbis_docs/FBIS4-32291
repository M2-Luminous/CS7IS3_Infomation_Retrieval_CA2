The failure of the Credit and Industrial Bank of Prague and the subsequent closing of the Bohemia Bank brought about defensive reflexes within society; the confidence of the populace in the entire system is melting away like ice in the summer sun. The nervousness is currently concentrated upon the so-called small banks, which are those that have recently come into being and whose basic worth is about 1 billion korunas [Kc] or beneath that level. On the other hand, large institutions are perceived as being safe and secure. Except that this is also a matter for discussion. Not even the giant posthumous children of the monopolistic financial system that existed under the socialist economy are in "as cozy a situation" as it may seem. Recently, reports reached the public regarding some of their heavy mistakes--for example, the payment of a forged check for Kc60 million by the Bank of Commerce and a mistake involving precious gemstones that, provided it is confirmed, could cost the Investment and Postal Bank Kc500 million. Experience indicates that only a fraction of what goes on in the banks ever reaches the public eye. Accordingly, one cannot only figure that even the large institutions engage in failed ventures, but also that there will very likely be more such ventures than have currently become known. The current lack of confidence in small banks is, moreover, nurtured by uncertain reports regarding their uncertain financial situation. And so a single exemplary case is sufficient. And two failures within the short period of six months--that is simply too much. And what today's published report regarding the difficulties being experienced by the AB Bank will be cannot even be estimated. For purposes of confidence in the system, it is immaterial that both cases--the Bohemia and the Credit and Industrial Bank--are special cases and do not have a whole lot in common with pure banking. In the case of the Credit and Industrial Bank, this is obviously a matter of fraudulent activity to benefit selected clients of the institution; in the case of the Bohemia Bank, the culprit was illegal foreign operations by part of the management of the firm. The Czech National Bank has hardened conditions for doing business in the industry in recent months. It increased its oversight over individual institutions, imposed higher standards that banking houses must meet. Thanks to this move, six institutions are now under heightened control--the Czech National Bank assigns them tasks and makes recommendations to their management teams and compels them to strengthen the financial position of their bank. When the business boom began in 1990 and in the subsequent years, it turned out that the large institutions were far too cumbersome, do not know how to expand their services with sufficient speed, and are proving ineffective in terms of distributing their resources--in other words, lending money where there is an interest in such loans. And small and medium business entrepreneurs were interested. There was more demand for loans, which exceeded the supply of available money. In other words, the large corporations were not striving in any way to attract this clientele. The market reacted in a natural way--small and medium-size banks began to come into being. However, since that time, the situation has changed. The supply of money has increased and is probably even greater than the demand for new credits today. The large banks were also faced with tough competition--a number of enterprises that had a reputation and good plans turned their backs on them and their high interest rates. They either borrowed money abroad or issued bonds. The large banks began to find that the world is not only colored a rosy pink and had to begin paying attention even to those clients whom the black-garbed sheriffs never even allowed in the building before. Of course, this is contributing to the worries of the small banks--in order to succeed, they must lower their loan rates. And this is precisely a problem for them. When the small banks needed money for credits, they were compelled to acquire primary resources, the best of which were time deposits from the populace and from enterprises. And persuading a customer to deposit money precisely with their institution meant paying higher interest rates than were being paid by the large institutions. In other words, the small banks were offering better conditions for depositing money, and, consequently, on the other hand, they also made more costly loans. As the interest of the large institutions is expanding, so the operating room of the smaller ones is shrinking--and the fact that they apparently have more pleasant personnel, are more flexible, etc. does not alter much in this situation. The fundamental economic rule of price will have its way. Thus, the small banks have no choice but to rapidly become larger. Many are working arduously at this task--never before have there been so many reports regarding increases in basic worth that have followed each other so rapidly as has been the case in recent months. But that will not be enough. The Czech National Bank, which is guarding the health of the banking sector, knows very well that the structure of the financial institutions is unsuitable and is planning to bring about a change in the structure through new regulations. And so there will clearly soon be a wave of mergers and fusions involving the smaller banking houses. Overall, perhaps the number of banks will shrink, but this is not a pity. For this price, the financial institutions will buy back the confidence of the population, which they had lost in part.
