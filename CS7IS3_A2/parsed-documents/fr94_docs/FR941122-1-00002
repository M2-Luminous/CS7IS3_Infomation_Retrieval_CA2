FR941122-1-00002 FR941122-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Consumer Service 7 CFR Parts 272, 274, and 277 [Amdt. No. 361] RIN 0584&hyph;AB66 Food Stamp Program; Payment of Certain Administrative Costs of State Agencies AGENCY: Food and Consumer Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule reduces the Federal reimbursement rate for certain costs of State agencies in administering the Food Stamp Program. These changes are mandated by the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act of 1993 (Leland Act). The Leland Act reduces the Federal rate of reimbursement for fraud control, automated data processing development, and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements costs. This rule proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations to comply with Leland Act mandates on these funding provisions. In addition, this rule proposes to limit the period that a State agency may retroactively claim Federal funding of administrative costs for Food Stamp Program activities and allows the costs of certifying Aid to Families with Dependent Children households for food stamps to be charged to the Food Stamp Program for Federal reimbursement purposes. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 23, 1995, in order to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Cecilia Fitzgerald, Section Chief, State Management Section, Program Accountability Division, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22302. All written comments will be open to public inspection during regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) at 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia, room 905.
