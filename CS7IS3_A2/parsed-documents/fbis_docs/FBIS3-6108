Recalling that U.S. State Secretary Christopher finally confirmed that the demand for the abrogation of the "NSL" in South Korea was an official position of the United States, the spokesman said: As the whole world admits, the "NSL" is an anti-democratic, anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law unprecedented in the world history of legislation. It is due to this cursed, murderous law that many champions of democracy and reunification and patriotic people of various social strata have suffered behind bars and the dialogue, cooperation and exchange between the North and the South have been blocked. The "NSL" is, indeed, a means for maintaining the fascist system and prolonging their days in power, which is worse by far than the Japanese imperialists' "Public Peace Law" and is an obstacle to great national unity and the country's reunification. The Kim Yong-sam group is now scheming to keep the "NSL" intact, discontented with the demand for its abolition. This clearly shows that "democratization," "improvement of North-South relations" and "resumption of dialogue" which the Kim Yong-sam group is crying for are all lies and it, in actuality, wants neither the democratization of the South Korean society nor reconciliation and dialogue between the North and the South.
