FR940127-2-00112 FR940127-2-00072 [Release No. 34&hyph;33493; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;46] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating To Increase in Continuing Listing Fees January 19, 1994. On December 8, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to increase continuing listing fees. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 A complete list of the NYSE's fees applicable to the listing process is contained in the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33317 (December 10, 1993), 58 FR 66045 (December 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. Currently, the Exchange's listing fees include an original listing fee, an initial fee, and continuing annual listing fees. The NYSE is instituting a rate increase with respect to continuing listing fees as follows: Schedule of Continuing Listing Fees Continuing Fees for Domestic and Foreign Securities1 1‚ê£ 1Current 1Proposed Per share/ADR Fee:2 0&hyph;2,000,000 $1,600 $1,650 Over 2,000,000 805 830 Minimum fees: 1&hyph;10,000,000 15,700 16,170 10,000,001&hyph;20,000,000 23,550 24,260 20,000,001&hyph;50,000,000 31,400 32,340 50,000,001&hyph;100,000,000 47,000 48,410 100,000,001&hyph;200,000,000 62,700 64,580 Over 200,000,000 78,100 80,440 Maximum 500,000 5 s 2 Continuing Fees for Short-Term Securities3 0 s Securities issued:4 1&hyph;10,000,000 7,850 8,085 10,000,001&hyph;20,000,000 11,775 12,130 20,000,001&hyph;50,000,000 15,700 16,170 50,000,001&hyph;100,000,000 23,500 24,205 100,000,001&hyph;200,000,000 31,350 32,290 Over 200,000,000 39,050 40,220 1The Continuing Annual Fee is payable each year on each security listed on the Exchange. The applicable fee is the greater of the Per Share/ADR Fee or the minimum fee. 2Rate is per million shares or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs''). 3Short term Securities are defined by the Exchange as those securities having a term of less than five years ( e.g. , index warrants, foreign currency warrants, contingent value rights). 4Based on securities issued, not on securities outstanding. 5No change. The NYSE states that the purpose of the increase to continuing listing fees is to offset in part the increased costs of supplying services provided by the Exchange. These costs include manpower, automation, utilities and other costs associated with providing marketplace facilities and services. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b). 4 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(4) requirements that the rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members, issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities. 5 The Commission believes that the increases in continuing listing fees are equitable because the increases should not result in an excessive allocation of NYSE fees on its issuers as opposed to members and other persons using its facilities. The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset rising costs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. 4 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). 5 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;42) is approved. 6 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
