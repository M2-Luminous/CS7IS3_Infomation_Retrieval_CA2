We buried those who were among the first victims of the radiation freed by the accident and we reconciled ourselves to their death, but we fail to see that people continue to perish near us and that children are born handicapped. We just attribute this to fate. We even seem to begin to get used to the phrase that our nation is dying out. For three years already the death-rate has prevailed over the birth-rate--the population of whole towns is disappearing, and we do not want to see this and even reproach those who are telling the truth--do not add salt to the wound, do not let it fester or it will never heal. However, I am sure that people must get information and know the truth, no matter how bitter it might be. In this, Ukraine's minister of environmental protection Yuriy Spizhenko [as published] agrees with me: Minister: Once, when the USSR was still alive, these secrets were faithfully guarded by the State Committee for Atomic Supervision. People did not know anything about the terrible accident in Chelyabinsk-40 [in Russia], about the explosions and discharges of huge amounts of radioactive elements into the environment at other atomic plants, which, on our territory, have no protective shells. However, we in Ukraine built a similar structure and allowed those who are only interested in the thoughtless exploitation of natural resources, to exercise control over nuclear safety. As soon as our ministry declared its right to tackle this problem and created a special administration, director of the Chernobyl AES Mr. Soroka started writing letters to all power structures openly demanding that the administration be abolished. Do you think that he will not get support? The powerful nuclear lobby is capable of anything in maintaining its positions. It may remove the Ministry of Environmental Protection from control over the nuclear monster, although our ministry is the only objective body in Ukraine that is free from known limitations and stands up for the interests of the majority of the people. Nesterenko: Incidentally, rumors have spread in Kiev about barges and ships that took part in the clearup after the Chernobyl accident and that are now in navigation and about containers in which radioactive sand was transported. Minister: I do not know where they are now, in whose yards they stand, or who is using them. Do you know why? This is due to this legal chaos, organizational confusion, and because we have too many controlling organizations that remove this right from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Nesterenko: What other Ukrainian regions have also been ecologically contaminated? Minister: According to the results of objective studies, the greater part of our country has been contaminated to one degree or another. These are chemical pollutants due to the incompetent use of means of protection of green plants and, of course, radioactive contamination. The territories of the Donets-Dniester [as published; possibly Donets-Dnieper] Region, where heavy industry prevails and areas affected by the Chernobyl accident are in a particularly bad situation. Of course, a gradual decrease in the levels of radioactivity is taking place, but, at the same time, increasingly larger territories are subjected to contamination. These are physical processes and there is no escaping them. Nesterenko: I heard that you are advocating the idea of closing down atomic electric power plants? Minister: This is not quite so, I am in favor of closing down the Chernobyl AES, or, more specifically, of closing down reactors of the Chernobyl type not only in Ukraine, but throughout the world. Nesterenko: Where else do they operate? Minister: Eleven in Russia, incidentally, not far from the border with Ukraine, and one in Lithuania.... Nesterenko: Those without protective shells? Minister: Yes, but the point is that, in civilized countries, such reactors have many different protection systems, and the last of these is the hermetic shell. In our country, you see for yourself. In view of this situation, it is necessary to raise the question at an international level and resolve it by joint efforts. A single state will not be able to do this. It is an entirely different problem--whether Ukraine can do without nuclear power engineering. I answer--it can't! First, natural resources are being exhausted at a fast rate, primarily such energy sources as coal, oil, and gas. They are becoming more expensive, and the price of electricity grows. In the future, thermal plants will gradually become less numerous, and nuclear energy must go through its second birth. However, it will be based upon safe types of reactors after the problem of utilizing radioactive waste is resolved. Besides, there must be uranium. If all of this does not prove to be economically profitable, society will look for other sources of energy provision. Nesterenko: How would you use our nuclear weapons for peaceful purposes? Minister: Nuclear warheads contain highly enriched uranium and plutonium, and it might be good to use them for the needs of our power engineering. For this, according to the State Committee for Atomic Energy, it is necessary to proceed to a different type of reactor, and then the raw materials will be sufficient for us for the next 150-200 years. This is better than to receive heat-generating cassettes from Russia over two or three years and then again to be confronted with today's problem: Either to develop our own production or to depend upon our northern neighbor. That is why I am saying that it is better to use the nuclear warheads for our own purposes: To repair them and stockpile. We have facilities for storing them for a long time. Another variant is to sell these materials at their true price, rather than to barter--warheads in exchange for fuel for atomic plants. If we had formulated the issue in such a way, the United States might have supported us, but now.... ... Now we present our losses as an achievement by saying: It is good that Russia will provide us with fuel for our AES's. Nesterenko: Excuse me, but this is a game of hide-and-seek with our own people. Minister: That is why we should not be afraid of hurting people by telling them the truth. We must speak more frequently on these matters, at least in order to make our people ecologically conscious. When one looks at the people, the impression is as though there are only ignoramuses, both at the top and at the bottom. From this situation there is just one step to crime.
