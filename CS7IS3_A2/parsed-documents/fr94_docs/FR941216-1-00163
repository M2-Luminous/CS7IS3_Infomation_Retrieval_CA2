FR941216-1-00163 FR941216-1-00013 Within the geographic area of applicability of these proposed special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements have been proposed for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue. Speed limits and operating requirements are also proposed for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times, vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. On each specified race date, these regulations will be in effect in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay during two periods: Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon; and again in the afternoon for a two-hour period which will fall between 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Selection of the afternoon regulatory period will depend on the time of termination of race activities for that date. Notice for commencement and termination of the afternoon regulatory period will be made by Broadcast Notice to Mariners; a 15-minute advance notice of commencement of the afternoon regulatory period will also be broadcast. The nature of the winner selection process and other circumstances may dictate that races will not actually be conducted on dates specified as race dates. In the event of cancellation or postponement of races scheduled for a particular date, the Patrol Commander's election not to implement these regulations on that date will be announced via Broadcast Notice to Mariners. The proposed regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these additional regulations will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are proposed for the period of these regulations to promote smooth traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers. These proposed Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the navigable waters of the United States. All vessels which fail to comply with these proposed regulations while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposed regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The environmental impact of this proposal has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit. A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District Office at the address listed under ADDRESSES. The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public docket, and is available for review at the address listed under ADDRESSES.
