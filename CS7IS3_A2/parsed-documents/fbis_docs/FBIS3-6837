The long-slumping economy is still expected to start recovering in the fiscal year starting next month, but the timing remains uncertain, said Tsutomu Tanaka, the agency's vice minister. Real gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.6 percent in the October-December period from the previous quarter, or an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the agency said in a quarterly report. That performance beat an average 4.2 percent contraction predicted by economists at 25 institutions in a recent KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey that found forecasts of shrinkage ranging from 1.0 to 5.9 percent. Japan's real GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the country, grew 0.1 percent in calendar 1993, the agency said. Gross national product, which also includes net income from abroad, expanded 0.1 percent in 1993. To meet the government's estimate of 0.2 percent real GDP growth for fiscal 1993 ending this month, Tanaka said real GDP must grow 1.26 percent in the current quarter, or at an annual rate of 5.1 percent. He said such growth was "not impossible." But despite such growing bright spots as personal consumption, which was up 0.7 percent for the quarter, he said it is too early to confirm whether the economy has hit bottom. Data for the current quarter could confirm a low point, he added. "The economy remains broadly sluggish," Tanaka said of the report, which adjusts the GDP figures for inflation. But he noted "partial brightness," especially within the personal consumption category. "As for judging if that was the bottom, we cannot make that determination yet," Tanaka said. For the economy to break even for fiscal 1993, GDP must grow a real 0.65 percent this quarter, he said. Such a pickup in the January-March quarter could be helped by typical fiscal year-end factors as companies prepare to close their books. Housing investment rose 1.8 percent after the previous quarter's impressive 9.0 percent growth. Personal consumption added 0.4 point to GDP, with strength in such housing-related areas as large appliances and other durable goods, as well as spending on travel, Tanaka said. But overall, domestic demand was flat, he said, with the report showing no boosting or retarding effect by domestic demand on the economy. Corporate capital spending continued to slump in the quarter, and the net export of goods and services -- hurt by the strong yen -- was a 0.6 percentage point drag on GDP, the report said. With capital spending expected to remain on the decline, Japan will be able to muster only the gentlest of recoveries late in fiscal 1994, said Nobuyuki Saji, chief economist at Nikko Research Center. Fiscal year-end factors may boost the economy this quarter, but their absence will probably pull GDP back into minus territory in the following three months, he said. "It's one step forward and one step back," Saji said. The fiscal second half, which starts in October, will probably witness 1.5 percent growth from the same period a year earlier, he said. But Tuesday's reported healthy gain in personal spending, which comprises the bulk of domestic demand, indicates that the "risk of another decline has largely subsided," Saji said. The personal consumption gain, boosted by home appliance sales, was a bit more than expected, said chief economist Masaru Takagi at Fuji Research Institute. But the continued slump in spending on plants and equipment was a prime drag that kept the economy from expanding in the quarter, he said. A shrinkage of exports due to the high yen will probably continue to weigh on the economy, he said.
