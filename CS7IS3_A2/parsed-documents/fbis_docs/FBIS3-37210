But this is a dual task, he said. The blockade of Sarajevo absolutely must be lifted. This issue was given absolute priority at the Russian diplomat's meeting yesterday with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special representative to the former Yugoslavia, as well as at consultations planned for today in Sarajevo with General Michael Rose, the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with the commanders of the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims. Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about the actions that Russia will take if strikes were not successfully averted, Vitaliy Churkin stressed that "everything will depend on the specific situation." "If strikes are made under conditions that we do not consider justifiable, then the consequences for our relations with the world around us are inevitable," the high-ranking Russian diplomat said, stressing that this was his personal view.
