Students decided to maintain their protest Thursday even though Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Wednesday scrapped a controversial plan to pay young people less than the minimum wage. Pasqua, interviewed on the RTL radio, said the 3,000 security forces who will be on duty had been given strict instructions to prevent trouble. He called on students to ensure they are distinguishable from trouble-makers and to eject anyone caught stealing, looting or attacking the police. Demonstrators "must be aware of the risks they are taking," he said. In the past month of demonstrations against the job plan, more than 400 policemen have been injured when violence has erupted. Pasqua admitted that there had been no point in persisting with the plan, which had been rejected by "students, employers and the trade unions." [passage omitted]
