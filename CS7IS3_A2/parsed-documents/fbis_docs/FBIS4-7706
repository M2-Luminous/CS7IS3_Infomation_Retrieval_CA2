Chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic told the Bosnian Serb agency SRNA he had ordered his troops to launch a "counter-attack" towards Cajnica, southeast of Gorazde, close to the Serbian border, late Monday since "Moslem formations were trying to join up with forces from Sarajevo and the other enclaves." SRNA said that Moslem units had fallen back to the villages of Vitkovici and Mrvavici.
