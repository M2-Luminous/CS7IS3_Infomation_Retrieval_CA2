The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' quoted Ayatollah Sane'i as saying that five years after the death verdict was issued against the Indian-born British author, the world Muslims now fully realised the matter. The desperate attempts of Rushdie and his western backers too have only failed to lift the verdict and have only added to Muslims' wrath. 'Today the situation is appropriate more than any other time for the execution of Salman Rushdie,' the ayatollah stressed. Ayatollah Sane'i underlined that the Islamic countries solidarity as well as the Organization of Islamic Conference's (OIC) renewed support for the verdict against Rushdie as factors paving the way to carry out the death decree. According to western media, the ayatollah said, Rushdie was gradually dying and even the police protection failed to improve his morale. 'It is the fate of anyone who insults Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and over one billion Muslims' sanctities.' Referring to formation of some European committees to support the apostate writer, the ayatollah said their act too was an insult to the sanctities of Muslims.
