The president-in-exile accused the United States of lacking political willingness to see the return of democracy to Haiti, and called their policy racist and a cynical joke. Washington's policy of returning the Haitian refugees is a way of saying they could care less about them; they can die. So far, President Bill Clinton has shown no proof that he cares about them, asserted Father Aristide during a news conference on Thursday. Aristide came to support the hunger strike of the director of the association, Transafrica, Rindall Robinson. Mr. Robinson has decided to pursue his hunger strike, begun on 12 April to protest the summary repatriations of Haitian refugees and the American policy in Haiti that he calls cruel, discriminatory, and deeply racist. The United States, said Aristide, set up a sort of artificial embargo, but that is not what we are asking for. He reiterated the need for a total embargo. It should be recalled that President Clinton asserted on 20 April the willingness of the United States to pursue the trade embargo against Haiti in order to achieve the return of democracy to Haiti.
