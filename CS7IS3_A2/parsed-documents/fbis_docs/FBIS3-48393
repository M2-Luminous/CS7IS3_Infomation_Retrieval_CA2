The contents of their agreement is relatively simple. That is: North Korea will accept ad hoc and ordinary inspections of seven declared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon demanded by International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The Status of Agreement on Disagreement. [subhead] However, North Korea interprets acceptance of inspections to mean the acceptance of "limited inspection for maintaining the continuity of nuclear safeguards measures, not the 'regular inspection' which member nations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] are obliged to undergo," while the Western camp, including the ROK and the United States, interpret it to actually mean "the acceptance of full-scale ad hoc and ordinary inspections." Both the ROK and the United States chose the position that "North Korea's complete return to NPT is the main agenda for the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks that are to be resumed after inspections are conducted. Therefore, whether the number of inspection is one time or not is not a serious question." In other words, the negotiations were for North Korea to find justification [myongbun] and for the practical interest of the ROK and the United States. Negotiations between North Korea and IAEA have dragged on for much longer than expected. In a recent negotiation, North Korea raised the issue pertaining to interpretation of the "agreement to disagree." Concerning "the inspection plan and list" where all seven facilities are targets of inspection, North Korea questioned: What relationship does this plan and list have with continuing nuclear inspections? Relationship With "Continuity of Inspection." [subhead] From North Korea's point of view, the question of North Korea's full return to NPT membership is an important card in forthcoming negotiations with the United States. Therefore, North Korea may be planning to clearly delineate this issue in negotiation with the IAEA. The abrupt 21 January statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman might have been prompted by such a strategy. It was learned that a similar situation occurred in consecutive contacts held between North Korea and IAEA on 17 and 18 January. Meanwhile, it is the IAEA's position that the continuity of nuclear safeguards measures cannot be guaranteed if North Korea refuses to accept the whole lists put forward by the IAEA, and if North Korea fails to send a reply on this issue by the end of this month, the IAEA must declare a "breakup" in continuity during its regular Board of Governors meeting slated for 22 February. Variable Factors, Including the Two Kims' Birthdays. [subhead] Since the IAEA agrees that forthcoming inspections are not "regular inspections" conducted on NPT member states and North Korea is not opposed to the inspection of seven facilities itself, the road to an agreement is unlikely to be difficult. At least, this speculation was dominant until the end of U.S.-North Korea contact in New York. Nevertheless, North Korea is dragging the talks along without presenting a clear explanation. The reason for this can be interpreted in several ways. First, North Korea may need to buy time to adjust internal opinion on the results of the New York negotiation, or they may have decided that if they are to accept IAEA's inspections, to make the most of it. However, there are a number of hurdles lying before these delaying tactics of North Korea. For instance, the IAEA's Board of Governors' meeting is scheduled to be held in a little over a month and the North Koreans need to keep an eye out for Kim Chong-il's 52nd birthday on February 16. Since North Korea celebrates birthdays of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il as an extraordinary national holiday, it usually refrains from taking any external action during this period. Therefore, North Korea must settle the issue of IAEA's inspection before this day. Thus, the North Korean nuclear issue faces another time limit.
