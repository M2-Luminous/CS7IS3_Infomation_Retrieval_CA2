The supplies have "melted away" considerably more rapidly and in larger volumes than was anticipated, according to calculations of specialists. And it was not possible to restore them fully by January. Nonetheless, as they think in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Russia, through the combined efforts of miners and operations workers the situation is stabilizing to a certain degree. Active work is being done to conclude agreements for the delivery of fuel during the first quarter and throughout the year as a whole. At the same time the administrations of many regions are trying to solve these problems by old administrative-economic methods, particularly by prohibiting the shipment of petroleum products outside their territories and also by exporting fuel that was intended, according to paid agreements, for other regions of the country. And this is being done under the guise of concern for "their own" residents and enterprises. The roots of this practice lie, apparently, in the recent past when the state granted all regions special-purpose credit for purchasing fuel and preparing for winter. But at that time, obviously, they counted on spending it more advantageously for other purposes, above all for things that produce a rapid return on capital and considerable profit. Or they simply left the matter to its own accord, hoping that the government would not allow the cities and large industrial enterprises to freeze. According to figures of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, a total of more than 200 billion rubles [R] was not used to pay for fuel--about 40 percent of the credit allotted. Thus according to information from the Komineft Joint-Stock Company, of the R8 billion in loans allotted in November of last year to the government of the Republic of Komi to settle accounts with suppliers of petroleum products and coal and for additional purchases of energy resources, the republic petroleum industry has not yet received a single ruble. Nobody knows where and to whom this money went. And petroleum workers of the region are now on the verge of financial ruin: they have no money either for wages or for settling accounts with the suppliers or for payments into the budget. In the final analysis, all this threatens to shut down wells, suspend deliveries of oil for processing, and orient the enterprises toward selling it to commercial structures. And what is especially alarming is that such a situation is not an exception, the ITAR-TASS correspondent emphasizes, but rather the rule. The consumers prefer not to pay for energy resources and, taking advantage of the fact that the enterprises cannot stop the continuous process of extraction, they are forced to turn over their products practically free of charge. In the opinion of the leaders of the fuel and energy complex, in such a situation it is necessary to use not so much economic methods but methods of state pressure on the structures that are impeding the arrangement of normal market relations.
