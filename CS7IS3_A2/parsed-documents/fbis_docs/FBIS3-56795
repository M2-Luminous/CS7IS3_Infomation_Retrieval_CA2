He is Anatoliy Lysenko, a 40-year-old Ukrainian special services major. He was given away by a Polish agent he himself recruited three years ago. The agent will not escape the dock either. He is Janus B., a 22-year-old technical construction worker. Dozens of times he illegally carried copper into Ukraine and spirits on the return journey. Ukrainian border guards caught the smuggler, and eventually he agreed to work for Ukrainian security service organs. Janus delivered to Lysenko information about political and other events in Poland's eastern provinces and church life. Lysenko was arrested in August 1992 when crossing the border.
