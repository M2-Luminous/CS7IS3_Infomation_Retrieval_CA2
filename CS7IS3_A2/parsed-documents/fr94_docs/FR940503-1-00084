This action will implement regulations to provide for 1) Implementation of the PVPLP in at least 15 states, 2) Limiting the amount of wheat or feed grains that can be disposed of in excess of the production limitation quantity for the marketing year, 3) A production limitation quantity calculation, 4) Terms and conditions for producers who elect to participate, 5) Provisions for excess production, 6) Subsequent year marketing of excess production, and 7) Measures to prevent circumvention of the program, including refunds or forfeitures of commodities.

AMENDMENTS TO CCC DEBT SETTLEMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING WAIVER OF RESTRICTION ON PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AND COLLECTION OF JUDGMENTS BY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFSET Significance: Subject to OMB review: Yes Legal Authority: 28 USC 3201; 15 USC 714b; 15 USC 714c CFR Citation: None Legal Deadline: None Abstract: This action is needed to allow for the waiver of restrictions on program eligibility, as authorized by the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (the Act), and to facilitate the collection of judgements by administrative offset. The Act provides that debtors who have judgement liens against their property for a debt owed to the United States are not eligible to receive grants or loans made by the United States until the debt is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. However, the Act also permits agencies to waive this restriction. In addition, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to collect debts for other Federal agencies by administrative offset upon receipt of (1) a qualified offset request, (2) a Notice of Levy, or (3) a request or approval by the Department of Justice. This action would authorize ASCS to collect judgements in favor of the United States by administrative offset. This action will result in increased collection of debts owed to the Government.

AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. WAREHOUSE ACT REGULATIONS_LICENSE AND INSPECTION FEES Legal Authority: 7 USC 268 CFR Citation: 07 CFR 736 Legal Deadline: None Abstract: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 required that U.S. Warehouse Act licensing and examination programs be operated on a fee basis. New regulations are required when an increase and/or decrease is warranted. Fixed fees were implemented in 1981 and were last increased in 1985. The interest accumulating in the Warehouse User Fee Account has been the major reason for not having to adjust the fee schedule before now. In more recent years, low interest rates and increased expenses (primarily salaries, travel, and administrative costs), coupled with collections which have not changed significantly over the past 10 years, will result in a deficit in the ``fee collection account'' by FY 1994 if the fee schedule is not revised, and would thus require a reduction in service. The cost of Government of this action has not yet been determined.

The purpose of the Program is to encourage the continued domestic production of wool at prices fair to both producers and consumers in a manner that will assure a viable domestic wool industry in the future, by supporting the prices of wool and mohair by means of loans, purchases, payments, or other operations. The support level for wool is set by statutory formula. Payments are to be 75 percent of the amount otherwise determined. The other determinations are to: (1) support mohair at a level not more than 15 percent above or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported, and (2) support pulled wool through payments based on the liveweight of unshorn lambs marketed for slaughter. The expected cost is $130&hyph;150 million.

Current regulations implement the Food Security Act of 1985 provisions but not the FY 1993 Appropriations Act provisions. This action will thus amend the regulations to implement the statutory provisions regarding controlled substance violations. The primary effect of this action will be to make most conservation programs subject to the controlled substance violation provisions and result in some people being declared ineligible for benefits.

Such haying and grazing can have beneficial impacts on wildlife habitat and cover quality while still achieving the goals of the CRP. Issues to be considered include conditions for allowing haying and grazing, acreage to be allowed, monitoring and enforcement, compensation offset, effects on wildlife habitat and ground cover, and impacts on local markets. A savings to Government would likely result from the compensation offset, while monitoring and enforcement costs would likely increase slightly.

Marketing Quotas Abstract: The flue-cured tobacco marketing quota and price support are required by statute. The purpose of quotas and price support is to balance supply with demand at levels assuring stable supplies for domestic and export use at prices that are considered sufficient for producers. The national quota is based on cigarette manufacturers' intentions, 3-year average exports, a loan stocks adjustment, and discretionary adjustment of plus or minus 3 percent. The quota may not be less than 90 percent of the previous year's quota except this limit may be waived if producer association inventories likely will exceed 150 percent of the reserve stock level. The price support level is based on a formula that averages market prices (2/3 weight) and a cost index (1/3 weight), with discretion to limit any increase to 65 percent of the formula increase. Marketing quotas are implemented if approved by producer in a referendum scheduled for January 1995. Gross loan outlays of $30 million are expected in FY's 1995 and 1996. They will be offset by redemptions and no-net-cost assessments in FY 1996 and later years, for a net cost of 0.

Marketing Quotas. Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute for these kinds of tobacco: Fire-cured (type 21), Fire-cured (types 22-23), Dark Air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), Cigar Filler (type 46) and Cigar Filler and Binder (types 42-44 and 53-55). Quotas and allotments are determined by statutory formula to balance supply with demand to assure stable supplies for domestic and export use. Marketing quotas are implemented if approved by producers in referenda. Producers approved quotas for the 1995 crops of cigar filler (type 46) and cigar filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) in March, 1993. Referenda for the other kinds are scheduled for March, 1994 and 1995. Producers of these types have historically voted in favor of quotas. Price support levels are set by statutory formula. The Secretary may reduce the level at the request of producer associations, and may limit increases to 65 percent of the formula increase. Gross loan outlays of $2 million are expected in FY 1996. They will be offset by loan redemptions and no-net-cost assessments in FY 1996 and subsequent years, for a net cost of 0.

Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute to be announced for these three kinds of tobacco: Maryland (type 32), cigar filler (type 41) and cigar binder (type 51-52). Marketing quotas are implemented, if approved by producers in referenda, to achieve a supply equal to the ``reserve supply level'' as defined by legislation. No quotas are in effect because producers disapproved quotas for 1992-94 crops, and that status will continue if producers again disapprove quotas for the 1995-97 crops in referenda scheduled for March 1995. Negligible cost to Government is expected.

Abstract: This action is needed to implement the national peanut poundage quota, as required by statute. The purpose of the quota is to balance supply with demand at a level that will assure stable supplies for domestic use and assure producers a stable income. The export-edible sales price for additional peanuts provides price stability for additional peanuts sold under contract and assures handlers that CCC will not undercut export efforts. The primary determinations are: 1) National Poundage Quota--set by statutory formula, based on the Secretary's estimate of the amount of peanuts required for domestic food, seed, and related uses for the 1995 marketing year. The 1995 marketing year is from August 1, 1995, through July 31, 1996. 2) Minimum CCC export-edible sales price for additional peanuts--established at the Secretary's discretion (the level has been set at $400 per ton each of the last 7 years). The peanut program as a whole will result in a net realized loss of about $46.5 million, which will be attributable to loan forfeitures.
