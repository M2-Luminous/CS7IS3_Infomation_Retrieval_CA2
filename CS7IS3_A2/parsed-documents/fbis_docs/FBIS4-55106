He said he hoped no one would doubt that the Hungarian elections were free and democratic. "The Hungarian Socialist Party has made a push forward. The vote expressed the will of the people and should be accepted with a bow," Boross said. "In the spirit of its ideals, the MDF will continue to take part in the country's political life," the prime minister said. Boross expressed the hope that his party would fare much better in the second round of the elections.
