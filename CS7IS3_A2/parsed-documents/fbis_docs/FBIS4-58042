To stay on the world's summit requires much more than brute force and technical, military, and media superiority. This requires a humanitarian message that convinces the world's peoples. This is something Washington does not have, as U.S. circles admit. Some confused people do not see the U.S. slide, but continue to see the old upward trend. These people do not see the opportunities in the region and the international arena. Even more serious is the fact that these people have seen the U.S. progress, but they did not note -- due to their horror and blindness -- that this climb to the summit of global positions was due to notable collapses. This means the United States moved forward because there was no resistance, or, let us say, it moved ahead as a result of multiple absences. The collapse of the Soviet Union was basically due to self-motivated reasons, and the same was the case with countries of former Socialist bloc. The collapse of Somalia was due to famine and fighting. The official Arab journey to Madrid was the result of the collapse of rulers and officials. Therefore, the U.S. rise cannot be viewed as a victory over heroic and persistent resistance. The only exception during the short years of the U.S. rise was Iraq. Iraq has been and still is the one voicing the pan-Arab and humanitarian 'no', with faith in God, people, and objectives. That was the reason for the 30-state aggression and all its destruction and siege. Despite everything it did, the United States stood helpless and defeated under the walls of the Iraqi fortress while in the zenith of its rise. Now, the image is different. The U.S. downfall is becoming clearer. Iraq remained and its leadership and determination continued without change. The Russian awakening is clear. Somalia is witnessing the triumph of its resistance. The people of Palestine were not deceived by the false peace and its agreements and negotiators. Palestinians continue to throw stones and to fire bullets, rejecting the results of the collapse of officials and rulers. None of us denies Washington owns huge quantities of sophisticated weapons and possesses advanced media. We all suffered from the air, missile, and media shelling, but this did not undermine the Iraqis and the Arabs, and did not deceive the Somalis and Russians for long. Army occupation does not mean occupation of the will. Monopolizing the media does not necessarily mean occupying the mind. At the peak of the hostile media campaign that took part in the destructive aggression and siege, the faith of the Arab nation in Iraq -- leader and people -- increased, even though Iraqi media did not reach all Arab lands. At the peak of the military and media invasion of Somalia, the Somali people rejected the invasion and its pretexts, even though the Somali people did not have enough bread and lack even modest mass media. When all the hostile media that targeted Iraq mobilized against the Palestinian people, and inundated them with the promises of peace, prosperity, and stability, the Palestinian people -- who lack their own media that believe in national and pan-Arab constant -- were not deceived. They continued to fight the enemy as an alternative to negotiating with the enemy. The changes demonstrated much of what Iraq had said and predicted during the peak of the collapses that shocked the world, but did not move Iraq. The United States is in the downfall stage, and Iraq -- leader and people -- and Palestine -- people and resistance -- are in the rising stage amid a clear awakening that is demonstrated in the division in the Security Council.
