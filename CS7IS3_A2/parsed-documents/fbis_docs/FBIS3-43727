A number of windows were broken. He also expressed his concern that the demonstrators later moved on to the Rwandan Embassy and that stones were thrown at other buildings situated on Uprona Avenue and at stationary cars. The ambassador sent a strong protest against the actions. He expressed to the competent Burundi authorities the wish that steps be taken in the future to avoid a recurrence. In a communique, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Rwanda has expressed its feelings to the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation of the Republic Of burundi and informed the latter that it was dismayed to learn of the violation, resulting in great damage, of the premises of the Embassy of the Republic of Rwanda in Bujumbura yesterday by Burundian citizens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation also protested most vigorously against this lapse by the Government of the Republic of Burundi, given the provisions of the 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, especially Article 22, Paragraph Two. [passage omitted] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Rwanda insisted that the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation of the Republic of Burundi assume its responsibilities by ensuring the security of the personnel, property, and premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura and by quickly proceeding to repair all the damage caused to the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura. It is also worth noting that today Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, Burundian minister of external relations, Rwandan Ambassador to Burundi Sylvestre Uwibajije, and other diplomats accredited to Bujumbura visited the buildings of the Rwandan and French Embassies damaged during demonstrations yesterday by youths from opposition parties. They took the opportunity to assess the extent of the damage. At the end of the visit, the Rwandan ambassador to Burundi said that yesterday's attack on the premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura was an act of provocation, but since Rwanda supported peaceful and good-neighborly ties, it refuses to be led into hostilities provoked by groups of antidemocratic people. Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo regretted the violence which occurred yesterday. He called on Burundian political parties to instill in their members the ideals of democracy. He regretted that the violence took place at a time when those in charge of the main Burundian political forces are discussing at the office of the president an accord on the principle of a truce aimed at allowing the return of peace in the country.
