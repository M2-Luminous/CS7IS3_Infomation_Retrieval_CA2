Lacayo appears on the legal document as the only plaintiff in the case opened on 19 February, when Matagalpa police arrested a "mechanic" identified as German Saenz Perez, a native of Matiguas. Saenz appeared before the judge of the Matagalpa District First Court, but when police realized the magnitude of his statement, they took Saenz to the Managua Fifth Criminal District Court, presided over by Martha Quezada. Matagalpa authorities have not established if Saenz is connected to any other crime. They added Saenz told them he was one of the individuals who held a "meeting" with "certain prominent figures." The "prominent figures" to whom Saenz referred included no less than Deputy Humberto Castilla, a man named Aristides, and a mayor of an undisclosed location in northern Nicaragua. According to Saenz, also known as "Tuti," the meeting was held in San Jose de los Remates. He added many more meetings, which were attended by recontra leader "Charrito," followed. The main objective of these meetings was to devise the perfect plan to assassinate Lacayo. In addition to Saenz, Doris Isabel Lopez Morraz, Manuel Salvador Lopez Morraz, Francisco Javier Rivera Picado, and Luis Izaguirre Guevara are being tried. The trial still lacks a writ of inquiry by the plaintiff, in this case, but it has an exhaustive chronology by Saenz, the main defendant, regarding his first "casual" encounter with the mentioned prominent individuals. According to Saenz, he met his presumed "employers" for the first time when he was walking down a road in Matiguas and was approached by several men in a luxury vehicle. The men, including those already mentioned, then asked him for directions to get to San Jose de los Remates. Preliminary investigations indicate Saenz has links with members of the former resistance movement and that he is living with a woman whose relatives died during the war. Reliable sources have disclosed Castilla mentioned the subject in private at the National Assembly, referring to Saenz as his "former driver," whom he had fired because Saenz allegedly offered drugs to his son. Castilla has also downplayed Saenz' version and denied all accusations the defendants might make against him during the process.
