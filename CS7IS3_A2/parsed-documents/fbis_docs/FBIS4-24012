It was a fly-past to mark the dawn of a new political era in South Africa. This was 10 May this year, during the inauguration of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela. Not far from the podium where a few minutes ago Mandela had taken the oath of office stood the new National Defense Force in its new uniform. Next to President Mandela stood the chief of the National Defense Force [NDF], General Georg Meiring, the man entrusted with the task of molding the new army. In spite of his past as the chief of the SADF, which fought viciously to defend apartheid, Meiring has earned the respect of some, if not all, of his former enemies. His major task of integrating the SADF, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK], the Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA], as well as the armies of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states, is a daunting one, indeed. The process got off to a shaky start a few months ago, when MK recruits at Wallmannsthal stoned and torched the car of their chief of staff, Siphiwe Nyanda. Their complaints varied from poor catering services and facilities to allegations of racism by former SADF officers. These, however, have been denied by MK commanders at Wallmannsthal. [Former MK Commander Stephen Kobe] The company which is supplying the food now is a new company. That was from the first company which was catering, which was supplying food here. [Zote] Did that have anything to do with racism? [Kobe] No, no. It was just the spoiled kind of food. [Zote] Wallmannsthal is situated north of Pretoria, and it is here that former MK cadres are assembled in preparation for integration into the National Defense Force. On arrival at this assembly area, young men and women have their names checked against a list submitted by their regional commanders. It is this process of registration that has become a source of conflict between former cadres and their commanders at Wallmannsthal. [First unidentified MK cadre, in English and Xhosa] The only thing that can fix this problem is the MK and the state president. The commander in chief of the army must intervene because we could not have stayed in Angola for so many years. The next thing, when we go back to the army, awaiting integration, then we find there are people who do not appear in the MK list. [Second unidentified MK cadre, in Xhosa] Those that have been chased away, what have they come back to do? This is not right, these Boers are fooling with us. [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] My problem is that these guerrillas who were sent back home must be taken in, and these other recruits should be sent away so that everything can run smoothly. Otherwise there is going to be corruption around here. [Zote, in Zulu] Which recruits are you talking about, sister? [Third unidentified MK cadre, in Zulu] These SDUs [self-defense units] all over this place and those trained at KwaMashu, wherever, Johannesburg, they should be sent away and then all the authentic guerrillas should replace them. [Zote] The task of winning the hearts and minds of the soldiers in the new NDF is giving military planners sleepless nights. They now admit they knew from the start that integration will not be an easy process. Recently about 2,000 new recruits were dismissed from Wallmannsthal, because their names did not appear on the submitted list, and some of them were not members of MK. Not willing to accept their fate, the recruits, still carrying their personal belongings, marched on Shell House, the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, to register their protest. In a bid to appease its members, the ANC accused the commanders at Wallmannsthal of high-handedness. This is surprising, considering that former MK commanders who are now based at Wallmannsthal actually endorsed the dismissals. In fact, those commanders have criticized the ANC for politicizing what they perceive as a military matter. [Former MK Commander Edward Mabiletsa] The communication lines between ourselves as former full-time members of the ANC are gradually being eroded, because there is a requirement that for us to proceed with the integration of the armed forces, and to continue a career as professional soldiers, we have to be apolitical. We do not represent the ANC in Wallmannsthal, or any other party. So there is a deliberate move on our part to erode that kind of link. [Zote] Colonel Terence Murphy is from the old SADF, and Mr. Gilbert Ramano is an MK veteran, and they are both at the helm of the integration process at Wallmannsthal. They are both confident about the success of the process, and they say no problem at Wallmannsthal is insurmountable. To underline his commitment to the new South Africa, Mr. Ramano says he wants to see an end to the singing of freedom songs at the army base. He says the songs are no longer desirable in the new army, which seeks to be nonpolitical. Meanwhile, political mudslinging between Gen. Meiring and commanders of the former liberation armies about how integration should be handled have added another dimension to the problem. Media reports quote Gen. Meiring as having said a minimum of 30 years in the army would be required before anyone could qualify to become a general in the new army. Both APLA and MK have described Meiring's utterances in this regard as irresponsible. One may as well ask who should determine the standards for the new NDF. [Meiring] There are a number of people in the nonstatutory forces that served for a long time. The present minister served for more than 30 years in this capacity, so if he were to be in the NDF as such, he could be aspiring for such a rank. [Nyanda] Statements which are made about qualifications into the general staff, or into the higher echelons of the military establishment, may be irritating, but in some instances, in many instances, they actually are correct. I think if, for instance, there are appointments from our ranks into that general staff -- if I am appointed, for instance, into the general staff -- it will indeed be a political appointment, but it does not mean that we are not equal to the tasks, and of course, it is an exaggeration to say 30 years. [APLA Chief Commander General Daniel Mofokeng] Our view will be that the issue must be discussed thoroughly with all the forces involved, and as you are saying correctly, that is a criterion, or the former SADF criterion. But inasfar as the age is concerned, that will have to be discussed thoroughly. In any case, when coming to the appointment of generals, it is a question of the cabinet and the Parliament. [Zote] There is also disagreement about the racial composition of the new army, and whether affirmative action can be applied without sacrificing the high standards required of a modern army. Georg Meiring believes it is not necessary for the army to reflect the nature of the South African society in its composition. However, Siphiwe Nyanda disagrees, and he feels affirmative action is necessary to address the imbalances of the past, where the number of blacks in the old SADF was kept down. [Meiring] The NDF will not, of necessity, reflect a specific stature of the country as a whole. It will contain the best people for the job in a colorless society. [Nyanda] The South African National Defense Force would reflect to a large degree South African society. However, the echelons, the hierarchy, the top echelons of the South African National Defense Force would not in the short term -- we hope that in the immediate and long term it will. [Zote] While the integration of all other armies is taking place, APLA's position in the new national defense force remains unclear. Gen. Meiring says APLA cadres who wish to join the army can only do so as individuals. This, he says, is because the PAC was not represented in the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] subcouncil on defense which drew up the guidelines for the integration process. [Meiring] No APLA member was on a list. In fact, APLA didn't form part of the process, the TEC process until that time more or less, and there was not a list presented by APLA to include their cadres to be included into the SANDF. Therefore, the APLA members are not automatically members of the SANDF. [Mofokeng] We are still here engaged in the process of integrating APLA as an organ, and APLA as a structure, and the issue of APLA being integrated is at the level of the presidency. I think you will remember that Comrade Makwetu, the president of the Pan-Africanist Congress, met the head of state, Comrade Nelson Mandela, to discuss about the issue. [Zote] Inspite of all the problems that have occurred during these early stages of the integration process, all sides are optimistic about its success. The big test, however, will come during the second stage of integration when former MK and APLA cadres meet their former enemies from the SADF at the barracks. In military circles hopes for reconciliation between former enemies are in danger of turning into distrust. Since the birth of a new South Africa there have been reports of ugly incidents at barracks. Whether a solution will be found in time before the situation slides further into anarchy remains to be seen.
