FR940324-0-00012 FR940324-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;92; Final Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;81] Special Conditions: Learjet, Inc., Model 45 Airplane, High Altitude Operation AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special conditions. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued to Learjet Inc. of Wichita, KS, for the Learjet Inc., Model 45 airplane. This new airplane has an unusual design feature associated with an unusually high operating altitude (51,000 feet), for which the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, FAA, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc., (Learjet), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209&hyph;2942, or P.O. Box 7707, Wichita, KS 67277&hyph;7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane. The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731&hyph;20 turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 3,500 pounds thrust, with auto performance reserve 3,650 pounds thrust. The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers). The type design of the Learjet Model 45 series airplanes contains a number of novel and unusual design features for an airplane type certificated under the applicable provisions of part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Those features include the relatively small passenger cabin volume and a high operating altitude. The applicable airworthiness requirements do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet 45 series airplanes; therefore, special conditions are necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in §25.2, that the Model 45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions will form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.17(a)(2). Novel or Unusual Design Feature The Learjet Model 45 will incorporate an unusual design feature in that it will be certified to operate up to an altitude of 51,000 feet. The FAA considers certification of transport category airplanes for operation at altitudes greater than 41,000 feet to be a novel or unusual feature because current part 25 does not contain standards to ensure the same level of safety as that provided during operation at lower altitudes. Special conditions have therefore been adopted to provide adequate standards for transport category airplanes previously approved for operation at these high altitudes, including certain Learjet models, the Boeing Model 747, Dassault-Breguet Falcon 900, Canadair Model 600, Cessna Model 650, Israel Aircraft Industries Model 1125, and Cessna Model 560. The special conditions for the Cessna Model 650 or previously certified Learjet models are considered the most applicable to the Model 45 and its proposed operation and are therefore used as the basis for the special conditions described below. Damage tolerance methods are proposed to be used to assure pressure vessel integrity while operating at the higher altitudes, in lieu of the 1/2-bay crack criterion used in some previous special conditions. Crack growth data are used to prescribe an inspection program that should detect cracks before an opening in the pressure vessel would allow rapid depressurization. Initial crack sizes for detection are determined under §25.571, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;72. The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening determined from the above analysis must be demonstrated to comply with the pressurization section of the proposed special conditions, which state that the cabin altitude after failure must not exceed the cabin altitude/time curve limits shown in Figures 3 and 4. In order to ensure that there is adequate fresh air for crewmembers to perform their duties, to provide reasonable passenger comfort, and to enable occupants to better withstand the effects of decompression at high altitudes, the ventilation system must be designed to provide 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person during normal operations. Therefore, these special conditions require that crewmembers and passengers be provided with 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person. In addition, during the development of the supersonic transport special conditions, it was noted that certain pressurization failures resulted in hot ram or bleed air being used to maintain pressurization. Such a measure can lead to cabin temperatures that exceed human tolerance. Therefore, these special conditions require airplane interior temperature limits following probable and improbable failures.
