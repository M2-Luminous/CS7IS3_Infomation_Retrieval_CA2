This ECU 4.5 million project will cover the regions of St. Petersburg and Samara (Russia), Kharkov (Ukraine), and Minsk (Belarus). The objective of the conversion programme is to transform industrial capabilities from the production of weapons to civilian goods and, in so doing, maintain employment and technical capability levels. The project will last 30 months and will be implemented by a consortium composed of British aerospace and the French consulting company softrade Intergroupe. The military industrial complex of the former Soviet Union is a huge conglomerate of industries. It employs some 12 million people, 5 million of whom work on the production of weapons. It is administered by 9 ministers. These industries are concentrated in Russia, where they contribute to approximately half of the country's total industrial output. Other areas of concentration are Belarus and Ukraine where, in general, unrelated weapon components are produced for their final assembly in Russia. Together, these three republics employ a workforce of 7.3 million. Russia alone has 1,100 military enterprises employing 5.5 million staff, and 700 military research institutes (excluding nuclear) which employ a further 1.3 million. The scale of Russia's defence-related industry, contributing to up to 50% of its total industrial output, indicates that the success of economic reform though less important than for Russia, the size of the industry in Ukraine and Belarus is also significant [sentence as received]. Following the sharp drop in military orders in the last 4 years (estimated at 70%), military companies started immediately to produce civilian goods. However, the lack of a coherent conversion plan resulted in a number of former military companies producing the same goods. Further obstacles to a successful conversion result from the vertically integrated structure and the lack of market culture within the management of the firms. Companies are structured to handle production from raw materials to product components through to the final products themselves. In most cases, they also produce the housing, clothing, food and other basic needs of employees. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the management has a poor awareness of cost control methods, quality assurance, accounting, marketing services, distribution networks and after sale service. What the EC Project Involves TACIS aims to prepare a conversion plan for the four regions following an assessment of the existing industrial assets, the identification of the potential and the scale of the corresponding investment. Conversion potential will be evaluated by selecting three categories of company: those that can be rapidly adapted to civilian production without substantial restructuring, those that require fundamental restructuring over a 5 to 10 year period and finally, those that do not lend themselves to conversion or where the cost would be prohibitive and their future viability doubtful. A limited number of companies from the first and second category will be selected for a full-scale feasibility study. In a number of companies, it is expected that the results from such studies will be so promising that external investment will quickly follow. In other instances, the business case will need to be further investigated through a detailed financial analysis of the prospect of conversion and the corresponding costs, from organisational restructuring to the introduction of new processes, management methods and technology. As a result, the selected company will be provided with marketing plans and strategies, leading then to financing plans and/or joint venture prospectus. Finally, the managers of the selected companies will undergo training by working closely with European experts who will be providing advice on the day-to-day functioning of these companies. The main objective of such training programmes is to have re-trained managers running restructured enterprises. Conversion of Aviation Industries in Moscow [subhead] In addition, the European Commission is making an important contribution to the development of a coherent military conversion strategy in Moscow itself. Its assistance to the aeronautical design bureau MIG [Mikoyan and Gurevich] and the aviation manufacturer Lukhovitsky will be carried out by a consortium led by Dassault aviation and composed of Arthur D. Little and the Ares group. The 2 million ECU project will last for two years. From its establishment in Moscow in 1939 up to 1989, MIG, which currently employs some 5000 people, concentrated solely on the design of military aeroplanes. However, it now has to convert its activities to the design of civilian aircraft as orders from the military sector have been reduced by two thirds over the last four years. This process of conversion is slowed down by limited access to Western markets as a result of the lack of certification from Western authorities of the MIG quality assurance system. Lukhovitsky, a manufacturing company established in 1962 and currently employing some 7500 people, specialises in the construction of military aircraft, including MIG fighters. It has recently had to face a similar decline in military orders to the Mig aeronautical design bureau and, despite its efforts to convert to the production of civilian goods, a coherent overall strategy is still lacking. TACIS assistance is urgently needed to enable MIG and Lukhovitsky to develop domestic markets and gain greater access to foreign markets. Major tasks to be undertaken by TACIS include upgrading the MIG quality assurance system to Western standards and surveying its production of aluminium alloy parts. Furthermore, the existing means of production of Lukhovitsky will be assessed and, following an analysis of both Russian and foreign markets for an initial list of 100 potential opportunities, around fifteen products with the most potential will be selected. The implementation of new business plans will be greatly aided by this assistance. By the end of the project, it is expected that MIG will be able to manufacture a structural unit for a civil aircraft in compliance with Western standards, representing a major step forward in the conversion of aviation industries.
