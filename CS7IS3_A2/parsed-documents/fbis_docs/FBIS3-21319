Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Still Cool to India's Proposals"] [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 26--Pakistan today expressed "disappointment" that India's latest proposals, aimed at taking the bilateral process of dialogue forward, "do not address what we (Pakistanis) regard as the fundamental and core problems in Kashmir." Outlining their "immediate reaction" to, and "preliminary views" on these proposals, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr. Shahryar M. Khan, told reporters here that India's "non-papers" on as many as six separate issues "miss the point" at stake, "beg the question" in focus or merely "address the peripheral" aspects of the primary issues. Making it clear that Pakistan would express its "considered" comments on the proposals, Mr. Shahryar Khan said "none of these non-papers, in our preliminary view, really goes to the depth of the two crucial issues" regarding which Islamabad had recently made its own proposals. These related to the modalities of holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir and "visible steps to stop (India's alleged) repression and human rights violations" there. It was within these Pakistani norms of judgment that Mr. Shahryar Khan saw India's proposal on converting the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of peace and tranquillity as suggestion for "a kind of mechanical agreement which would seem to be missing the point" that India was, in mooting this formula, "virtually asking us to accept the status quo on the line of control." Pakistan had already "indicated that this is not acceptable to it," he said. Real reason for tension: "The real reason for tension along the line of control," which India was now seeking to address, was its "repression" in Jammu and Kashmir, he said. India should take cognisance of this linkage, he argued, but indicated that Pakistan would, nevertheless, undertake "a careful consideration" of the proposal regarding the line of control and "react some time later." On the proposal regarding a bilateral ban on the first resort to a nuclear-weapons strike against each other, he said: "This proposal, in our view, begs the question. We are not nuclear powers. To have an agreement not to strike first is a basic contradiction in terms." Dismissing this proposal as an exercise at window-dressing and an essentially "peripheral" aspect of the relations between the two countries, he said India was silent on crucial issues such as "the control of weapons of mass destruction, or the control of ballistic missiles being manufactured indigenously in India or the control of fissile materials being produced." The proposal "does not come to grips with the real issue of regional non-proliferation," he said. No contradiction: Asked why Pakistan should shoot down the proposal for a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike, especially in the context of Islamabad's concern regarding the need to control India's production of fissile materials and indigenous ballistic missiles, Mr. Shahryar Khan said: "There is no contradiction." While, according to him, the proposal was based on the assumption that Pakistan was in possession of nuclear weapons, Islamabad's concern regarding "other issues such as fissile materials and ballistic missiles" should be seen in the context of "preventing (India) getting there," meaning the acquisition of a nuclear arms delivery system. To a question whether Islamabad's views against an Indo-Pakistan ban on a nuclear first-strike did not reflect his own assumption that both countries were not nuclear powers, he said: "India has exploded a nuclear device (in 1974). Its capability is a matter of conjecture." At this point, the official spokesman, who was also present, intervened to say that Pakistan had not exploded any nuclear device and that India's proposal was founded on "a presumption" that Pakistan was a nuclear power. What would be, however, acceptable to Pakistan, the spokesman indicated, was any proposal implying a unilateral commitment by India to desist from a nuclear first-strike against them in these circumstances. "Only an Update": Mr. Shahryar Khan, referring to what he described as India's proposals on "technical issues" relating to the Siachen, Sir Creek and Wular barrage questions, said India had merely presented "an update on the state of negotiations." Even in this sense, the "non-papers" in this regard were not reflective of the "consensus" already reached by the two sides. The "points at which the bilateral negotiations were left off (on these issues) have not been accurately reflected," he said. He also said Pakistan would study these and other proposals seriously, despite Islamabad's view that India might have presently tried to draw a red herring of proposals across the tracks of the international community to "deflect and divert attention" away from the core issue of Kashmir's political status. While Pakistan's initial reaction might suggest that it finds itself in no position to reject the proposals outright, diplomatic sources here said the reason could be traced to India's exercise at presenting Islamabad with draft agreements in certain respects. The sources draw attention to the proposals regarding peace and tranquillity on the line of control. It is said that India's prescription of maintaining peace "without prejudice to the known positions of the two countries" on the fundamental Kashmir issue can be seen as a draft accord which would not transform the existing line of control into a de jure boundary between the two countries. On the proposals regarding confidence-building measures, including a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike, the sources said Pakistan's willingness to consider them, despite its reservation regarding the nuclear-security status of India, could perhaps be seen in the context of India's parallel suggestions forbidding each side from launching a conventional attack on the other's economic targets and population centres. As for "the technical issues," India had suggested "immediate talks" on the Siachen issue in the light of its "specific" ground details regarding disengagement and redeployment of troops on either side. On the Sir Creek issue, it had outlined the "principles" of a possible agreement, while the technical draft of an agreement on Tulbul had also been presented.
