The eighth contact held at the truce village was designed to arrange for inter-Korea exchange of special envoys, but it only lasted for one hour, the shortest of the eight contacts made thus far. Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK delegation, told reporters after the talks ended that the major cause leading the contact to failure was the south's "sudden change in its attitude". The south side declared that it would "take a strong position" against the north, restore the suspended Team Spirit '94 joint military exercises with the United States, advance with its plan on the deployment of "Patriot" missiles in the south, and take part in international sanctions against the DPRK, Pak said. This showed that the south side did not intend to realize an inter-Korean exchange of envoys, the chief DPRK negotiator said. He added that the north side had demanded the south change its tough position, but had received no response.
