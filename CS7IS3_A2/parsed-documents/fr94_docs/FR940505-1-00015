FR940505-1-00015 FR940505-1-00007 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 46 CFR Part 540 [Docket No. 94&hyph;06] Financial Responsibility Requirements for Nonperformance of Transportation AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Proposed Rule; Extension of Comment Period. SUMMARY: By Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15149), as corrected by a document published April 18, 1994 (59 FR 18443), the Federal Maritime Commission proposed to remove the $15 million unearned passenger revenue (``UPR'') ceiling now applicable to passenger vessel financial responsibility requirements for nonperformance of transportation, because some vessel operators now have UPRs significantly exceeding $15 million. The Commission also proposed to revise the current UPR sliding scale accordingly_and to require coverage of 110 percent of UPR up to $25 million per operator, with coverage of 90 percent of UPR for amounts exceeding $25 million. Comment was also sought on an alternative proposal to require coverage of 110 percent of UPR up to $25 million per operator; 75 percent of UPR between $25 million and $50 million per operator; and 50 percent coverage for UPR over $50 million per operator. Additionally, the Commission proposed to remove self-insurance as an option for section 3 coverage (except for state or federal entities). Existing self-insured commercial operations would be provided one year following the effective date of any final rule in this matter to obtain other evidence of financial responsibility. These changes are deemed necessary to ensure that cruise passengers are adequately protected in the event of nonperformance of transportation. The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. now has requested a ninety day extension of the comment period and the International Council of Cruise Lines has requested that the comment period be extended to June. 15, 1994. The Commission has determined to extend the comment period to June 10, 1994. DATES: Comments due on or before June 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments (original and 20 copies) to: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol St., NW., Washington, DC 20573, (202) 523&hyph;5725. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bryant L. VanBrakle, Director, Bureau of Tariffs, Certification and Licensing, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol St., NW., Washington, DC 20573, (202) 523&hyph;5796. By the Commission. Ronald D.
