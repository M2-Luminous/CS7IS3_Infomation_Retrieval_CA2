FR941220-1-00019 FR941220-1-00007 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) amends 46 U.S.C. 6101 by adding the term ``significant harm to the environment'' to the list of reportable marine casualties. The amendment also provides that foreign flag tank vessels operating in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction beyond the navigable waters of the United States (i.e., within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)) must report to the extent consistent with generally recognized principles of international law, two categories of marine casualties, those resulting in_(1) material damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency of a vessel; and (2) significant harm to the environment. The Coast Guard is interested in information and opinions concerning how the Coast Guard should respond to the following major issues raised by the amendments to 46 U.S.C. 6101 as set forth in OPA 90. 1. Should regulatory changes be made to define and secure reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' casualties in the U.S. navigable waters (foreign flag and U.S. flag vessels)? Do the provisions in 46 CFR 4.03&hyph;2 (b) and (c) adequately define incidents which include those having a potential to cause ``significant harm to the environment?'' 2. How should the Coast Guard define and implement the requirement for reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' and ``material damage'' casualties for foreign flag tank vessels in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including the EEZ, consistent with ``generally recognized principles of international law?'' Do the provisions of 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1(b) and (c) adequately define incidents which include ``material damage?'' 3. How should the Coast Guard impose any reporting requirements for foreign tank vessels in the EEZ_on inbound, outbound, or transiting vessels? 4. Should any regulations be located as amendments to the existing regulations under 46 U.S.C. 6101 at 46 CFR part 4 or in the pollution prevention regulations implementing international pollution control agreements (33 CFR part 151)? Attendance at the January 20, 1995 meeting is open to the public. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should call the number listed in FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT no later than the day before the meeting.
