At a security-political forum of the German Bundeswehr Association in Bonn today, Gerster called for a defense structure law that would stipulate the basic figures concerning the strength and deployment of the Bundeswehr. Moreover, "external ideas and wishes determine the planning of the Bundeswehr." The government should pursue a policy aimed at limiting the armed forces to a number that is required for the country's and the alliance's defense and for the international obligations. In view of the difficult financial situation of the Bundeswehr, Inspector General Klaus Naumann appealed to the politicians to show the soldiers "the light at the end of the tunnel." The current situation is unbearable. A "critical point has been reached." The general mentioned big problems in the sphere of material preservation and ammunition for the exercises. He emphatically called on all parties to achieve a consensus on security issues. The credibility of the politicians must be ensured among the members of the Bundeswehr. Former Inspector General Dieter Wellershoff, who is the president of the Federal Academy for Security Policy, warned the states against a return to nationalism. "This contagious disease is not only spreading in East Europe," Wellershoff pointed out. With its new political strategy, NATO is showing the only possible way out of this dilemma: cooperation. "In Europe, we all must find the right path between positive attachment to our country and an indispensable openness to the world and international solidarity," Wellershoff stressed.
