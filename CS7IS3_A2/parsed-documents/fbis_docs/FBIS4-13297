FBIS4-13297 "drnes075_m_94001" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 JORDAN U.S. `Demand' To Deport Hamas Members Said Rejected U.S. `Demand' To Deport Hamas Members Said Rejected JN1904112794 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 18 Apr 94 pp 1, 11 JN1904112794 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Report by Fahd al-Rimawi] [Text] The Israeli war machine could not stand long in the face of some youths from Palestine whose belief in God and strong will made them decide to go for martyrdom. The Zionist Army, armed to the teeth by the most sophisticated U.S. weapons and with its most active intelligence organs, was helpless. It could not prevent the Hamas Movement from transferring its impressive, qualitative operations to the heart of Israel in 'Afula, Hadera, Haifa, and God knows where else. In only a few days or weeks, the voice of weapons overshadowed the hoarse talk about peace. Military and jihad action outshone the idle talk of the negotiations and the dozens of sessions and meetings that started more than two years ago in Madrid and are still revolving in a vicious circle without making any progress at all. For all these reasons, the Israeli government, facing the threat of collapse under the strikes of Hamas, chose to shift its losing battle to the political level and to the Jordanian arena. War is a continuation of politics by using other means. The opposite holds true. The Rabin government is trying at this time to survive and stay in power by reactivating foreign operations. These operations will be undertaken by the Mosad to liquidate Hamas leaders in Arab states. The Rabin government is also trying to export its crisis to the Jordanian arena, which is liable to explosion if the government was forced to clash with Hamas, which has strong support from Jordan's political-Islamic street in general, and the Muslim Brotherhood in particular. Information available to Egyptian and PLO security agencies indicates clearly that the Mosad's plans to assassinate Hamas leaders abroad are now ready for implementation. This prompted several Arab and Islamic states, including Jordan, to instate heavy security measures to protect the Hamas leaders. Those countries have also asked the Hamas leaders to observe maximum caution. Despite the fact that Jordan has rejected the Zionist logic of threats and responded to the rude threats of Rabin and Peres, Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has summoned Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, and Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official spokesman of the Movement, to his office several times. He asked them politely, but firmly, to take Jordan's circumstances into consideration and halt any political or media activity on its territory. The U.S. ambassador in Amman had earlier asked the Jordanian government to deport Nazzal and Ghawshah, in response to an Israeli desire. The government, however, strongly rejected this demand, proceeding from its concern about Jordan's national sovereignty and the right to citizenship which Nazzal and Ghawshah enjoy, since they bear Jordanian nationality. This is in addition to the strong relationship between Jordan and Hamas, since the 'Arafat organization snubbed Jordan in favor of a new relationship with Israel. AL-MAJD has learned from its own sources that the Interior Ministry has seized the passports of Nazzal, Ghawshah, and other Hamas members who have Jordanian nationality. However, no one at the Hamas office in Amman could confirm or deny the news, in reply to several queries by the AL-MAJD to the Hamas office, having failed to contact Ghawshah and Nazzal, who are apparently denying their presence to avoid answering reporters who are following with extreme interest the developments of the situation between the government and Hamas.
