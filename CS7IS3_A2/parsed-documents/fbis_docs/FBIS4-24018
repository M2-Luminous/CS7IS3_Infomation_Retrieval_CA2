The 11-member executive is to meet on Tuesday for its weekly gathering, the first since its three ANC MECs [members of the Executive Committee] boycotted the previous one in Ulundi. On Monday, ANC KwaZulu/Natal leader Jacob Zuma told a Durban press conference he would take the opportunity on Tuesday to solve the mounting crisis surrounding the choice of capital. But, he warned, the province was "heading for trouble" if the IFP went ahead with its unilateral plan to hold the first meeting of the legislature in Ulundi next week. Mr Zuma repeated the ANC's plan to boycott this meeting and he criticised IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi for meddling in the province's affairs. He was reacting to Mr Buthelezi's reported threats at the weekend to expel IFP members if they favoured Pietermaritzburg over Ulundi as the capital. Mr Buthelezi, he said, was behind the move to make Ulundi a provisional capital: "He has clearly discussed the matter in public and has been openly confrontational on the issue." If "national figures stopped interfering...if we are left alone we could work it out," Mr Zuma said, but added that central government would be forced to intervene if the issue was not resolved. He said that if central government was not convinced the region was ready to govern it would withhold powers from the province. Mr Zuma said the Transitional Executive Council had decided before elections that Pietermaritzburg should act as a provisional capital until the first sitting of the legislature settled the permanent capital venue. He said the issue should be discussed openly by the elected representatives of the province and all parties should abide by their choice. KwaZulu/Natal premier Dr Frank Mdlalose said on Monday the issue would be discussed at Tuesday's cabinet meeting. Dr Mdlalose repeated his personal preference for Ulundi as a capital, but added that no final decision had been taken and "the IFP will weigh all evidence carefully before making a final decision". He suggested a commission should examine the issue and make recommendations, which could take up to two months, and then a referendum should be held to test residents' support for either Ulundi or Pietermaritzburg.
