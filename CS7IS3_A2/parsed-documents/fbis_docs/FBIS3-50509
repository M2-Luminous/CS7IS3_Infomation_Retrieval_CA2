ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon opens the session, stating: "With 533 delegates, a 90.8 percent attendance, we declare our meeting open. It is now our duty to examine the third point of our agenda, the discussion of ratification of the decree laws and accords issued by the Council of State. We have in our hands a note from Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, president of the Council of State, listing the decree laws and accords issued from 1 June to 30 November 1993." Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Alexis Hernandez who expresses full support for decree laws no. 141 and 142, but stresses concern over their unregulated application, and speaks against the potential "for selfishness, personal interests." Delegate Alicia Blanco Fernandez states that decree law 141 lacks some definition and needs clarification of the activities it comprises. Delegate Genoveva Morales observes that people are upset with the halt on licenses for certain self-employment jobs and with the fact that messengers are exempt from paying taxes. Alarcon stresses that comrades have spoken in support of ratification, but have expressed concerns with implementation of the decree law. This, he says, is not the issue. Castro states: "Alarcon, I agree with what you have said and with the issue of methodology. Nevertheless, I am worried about the concerns of our comrades, some of them presidents of the People's Councils, who have to answer this and that. "Some comrades have brought up ideological issues. They said: I agree with this; but I do not like that because it might result in this or that consequence, misuse. I well understood the first two who spoke. But I did not understand the third comrade very well. I do not wish to get off the agenda and dedicate today, tomorrow, and the next day to discussing this, perhaps until 2 or 3 January, because we would destroy the agenda if we changed it. This is enough material for three days." Castro chats about the messenger job and the granting of licenses. Delegate Genoveva Morales adds that she disaproves of the fact that certain comrades are growing rich inappropriately and asks where they are getting the fuel, meat, rice, beer, and beans. Castro adds: "I am not bothered by the uneasiness. This means that people have a socialist awareness; they do not like to be robbed. That is bad news for the supporters of capitalism. Man, if the people do not understand this, how in hell are they going to resign themselves to living under capitalism? Capitalism is constant, incessant robbery, permanent, incessant inequality. I do not know if Alarcon wishes to talk a bit more about this." Alarcon and Castro chat about the number of speakers who have asked to speak. Castro states: "If there are mistakes, we are all responsible for those mistakes -- those who have promoted and issue decree laws. We could bring the comrade responsible for the decree here to speak. Everyone knows that we have to speak here and take responsibility for what is done. There are evident contradictions that anyone can understand. We have done certain things here that I have half regretted. It is the truth, but we cannot deny that there are contradictions." Delegate Jose Antonio Perez Gonzalez stresses his concerns with decree law 141. He believes that honest people should be allowed to be self-employed, and that although these jobs will not solve problems, it will help many people. He adds: "I do not think all these people are dishonest." Delegate Maria Ducas observes that there is uneasiness among the population regarding the fact that messengers do not pay taxes while others have many regulations piled on them. Likewise, there is a lack of control by the inspectors. The people are not aware of the details of the law, and certain comrades have been given licenses while others have not. Ducas gives examples of People's Council involvement in regulating proper implementation of the law, recommends that the granting of licenses continue, and that they stop worrying about where the supplies are coming from. Delegate Jesus Infante stresses that the problem with decree 141 is a lack of information among the people and a lack of standardized implementation. However, more of a consultation process ia required to avoid misinterpretation at the base level. Delegate Rodolfo Serrayonga points out that decree 141 is needed, and that its aspects are necessary and useful. The problem, however, lies in its implementation and control. Regarding messengers, Serrayonga stresses that a clear law regulating this service was annulled and replaced by vague guidance in decree 141. He adds: "What they have done is to regress in the case of the messengers." He goes on to say base-level bodies must ensure proper implementation. Delegate Manuel Sanchez Sardina expresses support for decree 141, but notes that there are some activities not included. Sanchez expresses concern with the video-show job, which might present an ideological danger, since no regulation exists on what can be shown. Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Xiomara Rivero who observes that the delegates must consider how the people accepted the decree and that like other presidents of People's Councils, she was told of the promulgation of the decree by the people, and that problems would have been avoided had a broad consultation process been conducted. She agrees with previous speakers that the base level bodies are responsible for proper implementation of the law. Delegate Jasin Chaspar observes that decree 141 is like building a train engine without any cars to follow, in this case, the inspection corps. He stresses that inspectors also need to be supervised, and that there is room for blackmail and bribery. He stresses that the People's Councils' role is very important. Raul Castro is shown sitting in the assembly. Alarcon introduces Francisco Linares, minister president of the State Committee for Labor and Social Security, but gives the floor to Delegate Lazaro Barredo who wishes to make a point of order. Delegate Barredo states: "Comrade president, I made my request to speak on this issue to the floor attendant yesterday morning because rather than on a problem of implementation, I had prepared an address on several concerns regarding the conception of the decree law. I made my request to speak, in writing, yesterday morning. I do not know what mechanism has violated my human right to speak. I am worried because I truly had certain concerns. I had been writing my address since yesterday on the conception of the decree, rather than its implementation. I would like to ask to be allowed to speak." Alarcon tells Barredo that he himself was not told of Barredo's request, and that since Linares had already been given the floor, he would speak first, then Barredo could do so. Francisco Linares states that the decree does not establish self- employment. Self-employment was established in 1978. The decree simply extended the number of approved activities and the requisites for those activities. He observes that no other legislation has caused as much interest, and that they have visited the provinces and talked with the workers. He goes on to say that two meetings have been held to analyze the application of the decree; that the concerns expressed by the comrades are the concerns we have all had. Linares points out, regarding the corps of inspectors, that steps have been taken in the provinces to establish controls and that this decree is helping to solve some of the problems being faced in the country. Linares acknowledges that they did not establish what light foods are, and that it was necessary to eliminate this activity because many of these restaurants or stands began to appear in Havana City. It was decided in a meeting with all the presidents of the provincial People's Governments not to grant any more permits for this activity. Linares observes that they had to stop the taxi service because these taxis had began offering their services to tourists, and that was not the idea. Linares stresses that the decree stipulates that the list can be increased or reduced, and that steps are being taken to regulate its implementation. Linares observes that there is no need to worry or believe that this will solve all problems, nor is it a prelude to capitalism. In the case of messengers, Linares observes that they have always existed and that this decree establishes exemption for messengers. He believes it is a good idea for messengers to be charged a license fee. He concludes by observing the number of measures that have been taken. At this point, Politburo member Carlos Lage states that they need to continuously examine the responsibilities and implementation measures, the scope of consultation and prior analysis, before taking a measure on implementation of the decree law. He stresses that the issue is complex and that not all is related to implementation, but to the issue's complexity and how it relates to the country's situation. Lage observes that the decree law should be reasonably malleable and that changes will be studied to perfect implementation. Lage stresses that the decree represents months of consultations and that they were waiting to see how it would work in its initial months. Lage points out that the complaints stem from lack of control, irregularities in implementation, and what is being done in practice, which have nothing to do with what was approved. Lage observes that the five jobs suspended were discussed and analyzed and that he believes there is a consensus on the need to approve the decree. Alarcon and Castro discuss the point of order made by Lazaro Barredo. Alarcon suggests postponing his comments until after a recess. Castro states: "Alarcon, but we did tell him he could speak." Raul Castro States: "Yes, we have to fulfill our promise." Fidel Castro and Alarcon discuss the intricacies of point of order procedures, efforts to keep the agenda's order, but still being able to give the floor to Barredo. Barredo states that the two basic pillars of the nation, when it comes to implementing changes, are independence and social justice, adding, "A social justice that does not mean egalitarianism or paternalism, but a social justice incompatible with forms that go against social ownership. Commander, as you mentioned in the Union of Cuban Journalists Congress: Our socialism has to be more efficient with state ownership as the base, linking responsibility and capability, linking the economic sense of control with costs, production, and services; all this without rejecting other concepts of social ownership, such as the cooperatives in certain sectors and as it is being done in certain areas of agriculture." He adds that certain points of decree 141 somehow raise doubts on ethical questions. Barredo warns that there is a pattern of inappropriate profiteering and illegal resources in projects such as this. Barredo stresses that self-employment is a vital need, but that in its implementation, there is gray area between self- employment and profiteering [meroliquismo]. He adds that turning those jobs into cooperatives might have been more appropriate, thereby avoiding competition between self-employment and state services. Barredo denounces the theft of spare parts for use in self-employment repairs. Barredo stresses that cooperatives might not make more money, but are a good tool to prevent negative trends. Castro asks Barredo what the moral of the story is: "Should we approve it or not, reject it or not?" Barredo answers that he is not against the decree, that it is important for Cuba, but that these issues must be pondered independent of its approval. At this point, Castro addresses the plenary for 90 minutes. This material is covered by Fl2912195592 and adds. Following this address, Fidel and Raul discuss removing the "etc." from the decree law. Raul asks: "Can this be done? I do not believe so. This has to be approved by the assembly. If we do not take out the `etc.,' we can agree to take out the `etc.' and that is it. Can this be done or not? If it cannot be done, do not even invite me to another assembly." Raul says this as he abruptly pushes the microphone away. This is followed by applause. Alarcon states that it is possible to do so because the "etc." only makes things more confusing. Fidel Castro, chuckling, states: "Approved the removal of the `etc.' This is not a solution, but it should help." Alarcon agrees and takes a vote on all decrees by show of hands. The video cuts to closing applause. No figures are given on pro or con votes, or abstentions.
