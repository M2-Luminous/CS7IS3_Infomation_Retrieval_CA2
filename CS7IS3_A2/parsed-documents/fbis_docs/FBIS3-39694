Around noon, a few hundred demonstrators, who had at first participated in a peaceful rally against the Republikaner, tried to break through the security cordons around Danube Hall. Policemen pushed them back, sometimes using truncheons. At the rally, Ulm Mayor Ivo Goenner (Social Democratic Party of Germany) warned against "philistines and intellectual arsonists." A democratic republic does not need "these Republikaner," he said, addressing approximately 3,000 people. Siegfried Pommerenke, land chairman of the German Trade Union Federation, warned the parties against "adjusting to the right-wing extremists in the race for votes."
