In an interview with CTK, the diplomat did not rule out the possibility that Israel's concerns could become one of the topics of Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's upcoming visit to Israel, scheduled for December 12-14. The diplomat also based his suspicion on an October 28 report in the French daily LE POINT, according to which the Czech firm Skoda Plzen allegedly signed an agreement with Iran to supply technology for nuclear reactors in exchange for deliveries of oil products. Referring to Skoda's cooperation with Iran in nuclear engineering, the manager for technical service of nuclear power plants of the Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi Plzen company, Frantisek Svitak, said today that Iran was interested in constructing a nuclear power plant and that Skoda could supply it with reactor equipment through the mediation of a Russian general supplier. In the interview with CTK, the Israeli diplomat pointed to similar deliveries to Iraq before the Persian Gulf War and stressed that Iran currently represented the biggest threat to Israel. Skoda General Director Lubomir Soudek visited Iran at the end of November and the beginning of December where he negotiated the possibility of cooperation in energy, transport engineering and the sugar industry. During his recent visit to Prague, Israeli Acting Defence Minister Mordechai Gur told CTK that supplies of armaments and military systems to the Teheran government by unnamed European countries have turned Iran into a threat to world peace. He said then that Israel would welcome the Czech Republic's participation in the Middle East peace process by exerting pressure on countries such as Iran and by controlling its exports to prevent these countries from pursuing aggressive and militant policies. According to Israeli Analyst Dani Kesem, who was quoted by the Czech press this week, Skoda is becoming for the American company Westinghouse and for the German concern Siemens the gate to the Iranian nuclear market. This statement was immediately denied by Skoda Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec who said he considered it misleading. Skoda effectively cooperates with Westinghouse in developing nuclear fuel for the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor) 1000 reactor destined for the Temelin nuclear power plant in Southern Bohemia, Svitak told CTK today. He said that non-active model tests are currently being conducted at Skoda's testing facilities for Westinghouse which is supplying models of nuclear fuel, to check the suitability of its nuclear fuels for the VVER 1000 reactor. Svitak said that Skoda had been promised it could provide similar tests at its testing facilities to check nuclear fuel for the VVER 440 reactors. With these reactors are equipped, for example, the nuclear power plants in Dukovany, Southern Moravia, and in Jaslovske Bohunice, Western Slovakia. It has not yet been decided which firm will supply this fuel. Westinghouse, Siemens, the French Framatome, and Swedish-Swiss ABB are participating in the selection process.
