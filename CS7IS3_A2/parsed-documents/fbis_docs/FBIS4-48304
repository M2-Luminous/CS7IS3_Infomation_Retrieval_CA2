Western countries declined at the three-day meeting to top up the African Development Fund until the bank implemented internal reforms recommended by independent experts and adopted policies to tackle mounting arrears on loans to member states. "Certain steps have to be taken following the report and certain policies adopted on resource allocation before we can commit new funds," Britain's senior representative Barry Hudson told the meeting. The bank's problems are believed to be behind the caution shown by SA in joining the bank, now that political objections to its membership have been removed. The meeting was attended by two SA observers, Eltie Links of the Finance Department and Development Bank of Southern Africa CE [chief executive] Andre la Grange. They presented a letter expressing SA's interest in negotiating membership, but indicated this would take some time. SA's caution is linked to the bank's parlous financial position -- it has liabilities of $700m [million] -- and the cost of the shareholding being offered, which is reported to be $275m over five years, with close to $2bn [billion] on call. Representatives of the African and non-African members agreed to meet again, probably towards the end of June, according to incoming chairman, Nigerian Finance Minister Kalu Idika Kalu. In talks that ended late on Thursday, the two sides came close to agreement on a replenishment worth around $2.6bn to the Development Fund. However, at the last minute some African states, led by Nigeria, rejected the country categories wanted by the Western countries, which would distinguish creditworthy countries that could borrow from the bank from others eligible only for interest-free loans from the fund. As a result, the replenishment pledges were withdrawn. Donor countries are alarmed at the mounting arrears on loans given by the bank, now more than $700m. The donors say only those countries with per capita income of more than $1,054 a year should be deemed good credit risks. SA would easily qualify on these terms. Countries with per capita income of $543 would be able to borrow only from the fund. Kalu told reporters the per capita income criterion was too rigid, especially at a time of fluctuating economic conditions in Africa. Members should look at supplementary indicators of economic health. The bank's vice-president for southern Africa, Adewale Sangowawa, is due to visit Johannesburg later this month to tie up arrangements for a conference on the bank in the city in October.
