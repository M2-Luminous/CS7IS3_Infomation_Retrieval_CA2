FR941019-2-00128 FR941019-2-00080 The commercial activities exception is a frequently invoked exception to sovereign immunity under the FSIA. Under the FSIA, a foreign government is not immune in any case: *␣*␣* in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States. 70 70 28 U.S.C. §1605(a)(2) (1988). ``Commercial activity of the foreign state'' is not defined in the FSIA, but is to be determined by the ``nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.'' 71 In attempting to differentiate commercial from sovereign activity, courts have considered whether the conduct being challenged is customarily performed for profit 72 and whether the conduct is of a type that only a sovereign government can perform. 73 As a practical matter, most activities of foreign government-owned corporations operating in the commercial marketplace will be subject to U.S. antitrust laws to the same extent as the activities of foreign privately-owned firms. 71 28 U.S.C. §1603(d) (1988). 72 See e.g., Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 112 S. Ct. 2160 (1992); Schoenberg v. Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V., 930 F.2d 777 (9th Cir. 1991); Rush-Presbyterian_St. Luke's Medical Ctr. v. Hellenic Republic, 877 F.2d 574, 578, n.4 (7th Cir.), cert. denied , 493 U.S. 937 (1989). 73 See e.g., Saudia Arabia v. Nelson, 113 S. Ct. 1471 (1993); de Sanchez v. Banco Central de Nicaragua, 770 F.2d 1385 (5th Cir 1985); Letelier v. Republic of Chile, 748 F.2d 790, 797&hyph;98 (2d Cir 1984), cert. denied , 471 U.S. 1125 (1985); International Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 477 F. Supp. 553 (C.D. Cal. 1979), aff'd on other grounds , 649 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied , 454 U.S. 1163 (1982). The commercial activity also must have a substantial nexus with the United States before a foreign government is subject to suit. The FSIA sets out three different standards for meeting this requirement. First, the challenged conduct by the foreign government may occur in the United States. 74 Alternatively, the challenged commercial activity may entail an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign government elsewhere. 75 Or, finally, the challenged commercial activity of a foreign government outside of the United States may produce a direct effect within the United States, i.e., there is an effect which follows ``as an immediate consequence of the defendant's *␣*␣* activity.'' 76 74 28 U.S.C. §1603(e) (1988). 75 See H.R. Rep No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 18&hyph;19 (1976), Reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6617&hyph;18 (providing as an example the wrongful termination in the United States of an employee of a foreign state employed in connection with commercial activity in a third country.) But see Filus v. LOT Polish Airlines, 907 F.2d 1328, 1333 (2d Cir. 1990)(holding as too attenuated the failure to warn of a defective product sold outside of the United States in connection with an accident outside the United States.) 76 Republic of Argentina, 112 S. Ct. at 2168. This test is similar to proximate cause formulations adopted by other courts. See Martin v. Republic of South Africa, 836 F.2d 91, 95 (2d Cir. 1987) (a direct effect is one with no intervening element which flows in a straight line without deviation or interruption), quoting Upton v. Empire of Iran, 459 F. Supp. 264, 266 (D.D.C. 1978) aff'd mem ., 607 F.2d 494 (D.C. Cir. 1979). 3.32␣Foreign Sovereign Compulsion Although U.S. antitrust jurisdiction extends to conduct and parties in foreign countries whose actions have the required effects on U.S. commerce, as discussed above, those parties may find themselves subject to conflicting requirements from the other country (or countries) where they are located. 77 Under Hartford Fire , if it is possible for the party to comply both with the foreign law and the U.S. antitrust laws, the existence of the foreign law does not provide any excuse for actions that do not comply with U.S. law. However, sometimes a direct conflict arises when the facts demonstrate that the foreign sovereign has compelled the very conduct that the U.S. antitrust law prohibits. 77 Conduct by private entities not required by law is entirely outside of the protections afforded by this defense. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706 (1962); United States v. Watchmakers of Switzerland Info. Ctr., Inc., 1963 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 70,600 at 77,456_57 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) (``[T]he fact that the Swiss Government may, as a practical matter, approve the effects of this private activity cannot convert what is essentially a vulnerable private conspiracy into an unassailable system resulting from a foreign government mandate.'') In these circumstances, at least one court has recognized a defense under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the Agencies will also recognize it. 78 There are two rationales underlying the defense of foreign sovereign compulsion. First, Congress enacted the U.S. antitrust laws against the background of well recognized principles of international law and comity among nations, pursuant to which U.S. authorities give due deference to the acts of foreign governments acting within their own spheres of authority. A defense for actions taken under the circumstances spelled out below serves to accommodate two equal sovereigns. Second, important considerations of fairness to the defendant require some mechanism that provides a predictable rule of decision for those seeking to conform their behavior to all pertinent laws. 78 Interamerican Refining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 1291 (D. Del. 1970) (defendant, having been ordered by the government of Venezuela not to sell oil to a particular refiner out of favor with the current political regime, held not subject to antitrust liability under the Sherman Act for an illegal group boycott). The defense of foreign sovereign compulsion is distinguished from the federalism-based state action doctrine. The state action doctrine applies not just to the actions of states and their subdivisions, but also to private anticompetitive conduct that is both undertaken pursuant to clearly articulated state policies, and is actively supervised by the state. See FTC v. Ticor Title Insurance Co., 112 S. Ct. 2169 (1992); California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). Because of the limited scope of the defense, the Agencies will refrain from enforcement actions on the ground of foreign sovereign compulsion only when certain criteria are satisfied. First the foreign government must have compelled the anticompetitive conduct in circumstances in which refusal to comply with the foreign government's command would give rise to the imposition of penal or other severe sanctions. As a general matter, the Agencies regard the foreign government's formal representation that refusal to comply with its commend would have such a result as being sufficient to establish that the conduct in question has been compelled, as long as the representation contains sufficient detail to enable them to see precisely how the compulsion would be accomplished under the local law. 79 Foreign government measures short of compulsion do not suffice for this defense, although they can be relevant in a comity analysis. 79 For example, the Agencies may not regard as dispositive a statement that is ambiguous or that on its face appears to be internally inconsistent. The Agencies may inquire into the circumstances underlying the statement and they may also request further information if the source of the power to compel is unclear. Second, although there can be no strict territorial test for this defense, the defense normally applies only when the foreign government compels conduct which can be accomplished entirely within its own territory. If the compelled conduct occurs in the United States, the Agencies will not recognize the defense. 80 For example, no defense arises when a foreign government requires the U.S. subsidiaries of several firms to organize a cartel in the United States to fix the price at which products would be sold in the United States, or when it requires its firms to fix mandatory resale prices for their U.S. distributors to use in the United States. 80 See Linseman v. World Hockey Ass'n, 439 F. Supp. 1315, 1325 (D. Conn. 1977).
