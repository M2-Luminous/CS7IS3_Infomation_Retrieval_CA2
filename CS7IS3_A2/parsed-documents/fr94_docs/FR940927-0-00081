FR940927-0-00081 FR940927-0-00011 Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary, due to the limited duration of actual river closures. Small Entities The Coast Guard finds that the impact on small entities is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) that this temporary rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism Assessment The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this regulation is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action required to protect public safety.
