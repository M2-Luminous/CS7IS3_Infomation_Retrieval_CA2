The Russian Ministry of Defense described any suspicions concerning Russia's violation of the ban on the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons as "completely groundless." In his turn our correspondent succeeded in meeting with an expert from one of Russia's special services who is well acquainted with the results of visits by a Russian delegation to biological facilities in the United States and Britain. What did our specialists see there? "A group of Russian experts visited several biological facilities in the United States in February-March of this year. These trips take place in the context of a Russian-American-British accord on reciprocal visits to the three countries' biological facilities. In the United States our experts visited two enterprises belonging to a private company, Pfizer, and the center for the study of animal diseases, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Agriculture." "At Pfizer's former plant for the production of biological weapons, manufacturing equipment formerly intended for the production of military-use biological compounds not only survives and is maintained in good working order, but is even being redesigned and modernized. No attempt was made to keep the specialists from seeing technological-apparatus lines for growing, concentrating, drying, mixing, and packaging biological preparations having a dual purpose (civilian and military), which, although they have not been operated for many years, are maintained in good condition." "Several of the firm's principal laboratories and production buildings boast specific architectural-design solutions, engineered systems for the protection of personnel and the environment, hermetically sealed equipment and manufacturing areas that do not correspond to the list presented by the firm of microorganisms on which work is being carried out. In other words, the possibility exists for conducting in these buildings work with the pathogens of dangerous infectious diseases of man and animal. It is noteworthy that right here our specialists were not permitted to take a sample." "In October last year and in January this year the Americans and the British also visited our Pokrovskiy Biological Preparations Plant, the Berdskiy and Omutninskiy Chemical Combines, and the Scientific Research Institute of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk. In 1992 American and British experts were invited to participate in an independent commission set up by directive of the Russian president to inspect the activity of the Institute of Particularly Pure Biological Preparations in St. Petersburg. That same institution which the West had accused of working on a 'superplague.' The Western experts were given the opportunity to visit unhindered any of the institute's structural subdepartments, laboratories, and premises, to talk with institute staffers, and to take photographs. It was acknowledged that the institute's activity does not contravene the 1972 Convention." "In the United States our experts encountered a different attitude, to put it mildly. The American side did not provide conditions analogous to the visit of the U.S.-British delegation to Russian nonmilitary biological facilities, as was stipulated in the earlier-agreed documents. Our experts were not admitted to several laboratories and one building. Tough restrictions on photographing and videoing were established for us. They were not allowed to take a biological sample. One facility was opened for visiting only after a time delay, and only following persistent demands from the delegation and our embassy. Things were no better during the visit to the facilities of the company Evans Medical Ltd in Britain." "I think that the new round of accusations against us is no coincidence. It is an attempt to preempt us. You see, a session of the Preparatory Committee of the Special Conference To Examine Potential Measures To Monitor the 1972 Convention is due to be held soon. Russia's desire to establish tough and wide-ranging measures to monitor compliance with the Convention is clearly not to some people's liking."
