Only one of his guards was wounded in the attempt. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, a source close to Shaykh al-Ahmar said the attempt occurred in an ambush on the northern road outside the town of 'Umran 60 km from Sanaa when the car of a group of tribal gunmen intercepted and collided with the first car in Shaykh al-Ahmar's motorcade which had already overtaken it. As the motorcade continued its journey with the shaykh's car between two guard cars, a hail of bullets rained on the motorcade from both sides of the road. The guards returned fire and although the attackers concentrated their fire on the shaykh's Mercedes, he was not hurt at all and the attackers fled. The attempt does not seem to have any political significance and is not linked to the current Yemeni crisis. There is speculation that it might be related to tribal differences. The source said that all members of the attacking group were identified as tribal men but he did not say to which tribes they belonged. He said that they were not from the area where the incident occurred and that they came from other areas. [passage omitted]
