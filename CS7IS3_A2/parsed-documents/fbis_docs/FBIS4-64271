He said Germany's major competitor countries have reduced their taxes to a greater extent than Germany over the past few years. "Despite the reduction in tax rates laid down in the law on industrial location guarantees, the relative gap between us and our competitors will begin to widen from 1995 onwards," said Fuest. Before the aforementioned law was passed, the total tax burden on a German capital company, consisting of corporate, industrial, and property tax, amounted to 66.2 percent. With the reduction of corporate tax from 50 to 45 percent, this tax burden has fallen to 62.3 percent. As a result of the 7.5 percent mutual increase in the corporate tax burden in 1995, the total tax burden on companies will again rise to 64.9 percent. All known surveys state that the effective rate of tax is very high in Germany. "Germany was and remains a high-tax country," said Fuest. On the other hand, in the former high-tax country of Sweden, enterprises are burdened with a mere 30-percent tax. In 1988, they were still burdened with 58 percent. The situation is similar in other countries. Bonn must reconsider more than just property tax, which leads to double taxation for enterprises and shareholders. The same applies to the equally earnings-unrelated industrial capital tax, from which the new laender have been exempted until 1995. A change in the method of financing local communities should lie at the center of reform efforts. There are patterns for a possible compromise in this sphere, which take into consideration the interests of industry and those of the communities. The abolition of earnings-unrelated taxes is of particular importance for risky investments. However, a reform of the taxation of enterprises is not expedient unless the general level of tax on the whole of industry is reduced. This can only succeed if the growth in expenditures is consistently kept lower than GNP growth. However, this rule must apply to laender and communities equally. In fact, west German communities have strongly increased their spending since unification. The Institute of German Industry reckons that between 1983 and 1989, the average annual increase in taxation (excluding social security contributions) was only 3.6 percent, but from 1989 to 1992 it was 8.6 percent.
