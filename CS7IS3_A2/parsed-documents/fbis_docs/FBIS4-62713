Thus, an earlier (December 1993) agreement may materialize, which provides for increasing Russian petroleum piping across Ukraine's territory to Central and West European nations from 5.5 million tons in 1993 to 8 million tons this year. The issue of transit piping and transshipment tariffs involving the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility remains unsettled, though, same as Russia's schedule of export petroleum piping. Ukraine has agreed to lower its averaged $3 per ton tariff, though no exact figure has been divulged. Nonetheless, as spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for Oil and Gas maintain, the deal is mutually profitable. Under the Russo-Ukrainian General Agreement the Koneks firm, which was co-founded by major Russian petroleum extractors, has been granted the exclusive right to export Russian crude petroleum and petroleum products. Russia's Transneft joint-stock company is in charge of piping petroleum to Ukraine's border. The Russian joint-stock company agreed specific schedules of petroleum delivery to Ukraine's border with its Ukrainian partner, Ukrtransneft, which is in charge of further Russian petroleum piping across Ukraine's territory to the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility. (For more details see UBN no. 13/1994). Besides, Ukrtransneft concluded additional contracts with foreign firms, engaged in Russian petroleum exports, in view of the Odessan transshipment facility's 15 million tons a year capacity. Currently, Ukrtransneft has such contracts signed with Lukoil, Telf, Stanford and Galaxy.
