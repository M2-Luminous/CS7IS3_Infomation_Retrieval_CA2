FR941128-0-00019 FR941128-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;13&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9077; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F, and FF Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters. This action requires an initial inspection of the pitch control assembly lockwasher (lockwasher) for dents at the inner tang inside radius, application of a torque stripe on the tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the torque stripe to detect any locknut slippage. This amendment is prompted by a report that a lockwasher failed in service and allowed a locknut to loosen. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective December 13, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 13, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;13&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems, Technical Publications, Bldg. 543/B111, 5000 E. McDowell Road, Mesa, Arizona 85205&hyph;9797. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Brent Bandley, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;123L, Northwest Mountain Region, FAA, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 E. Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425, telephone (310) 988&hyph;5237, fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHS) and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. (Hughes) Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters. MDHS received a report that indicated a pitch control assembly lockwasher (lockwasher), part number (P/N) MS172209, had failed in service. A subsequent investigation revealed that some lockwashers appear to have dents at the inner tang inside radius. The FAA has reviewed the reports and determined that failure of this tang could allow the locknut to loosen and eventually allow the pitch control assembly to disengage from the tail rotor assembly. Should these two tail rotor components separate, the rotorcraft crew would lose the capability of making necessary anti-torque corrections through the tail rotor to maintain adequate control of the helicopter. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The FAA has reviewed McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems Service Information Notice (SIN) No. DN&hyph;185, EN&hyph;78, and FN&hyph;64, dated September 23, 1994, which describes procedures for an inspection of the lockwasher, P/N MS172209, application of a torque stripe on the tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the pitch control assembly to detect slippage of the locknut. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires an initial inspection of the lockwasher for dents in the inner tang inside radius, application of a torque stripe on the tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the torque stripe to detect slippage of the locknut. Due to the critical need to ensure the integrity of the lockwasher and the short time-in-service before the initial inspection is required, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in the affected helicopters. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SIN described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.
