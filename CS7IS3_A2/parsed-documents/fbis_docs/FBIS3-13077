'Arafat told the Egyptian daily AL-JUMHURIYAH: "We don't want a force equipped with heavy arms and tanks. We are only asking for two battalions, about 1,000 men, carrying individual arms as part of a multinational force." He added that Russia, France, Britain and Belgium had agreed to take part in such an international force. Meanwhile the Palestine Liberation Organisation representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP that the observers must be deployed "immediately" in Hebron before the stalled PLO-Israeli talks can resume. The PLO has insisted that measures be taken to protect Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank before it agrees to resume talks with Israel on implementing the September 13 accord on Palestinian self-rule. The talks were suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre when a Jewish settler slaughtered 29 Muslims at prayer. Kamal said: "We are asking for an Israeli agreement in principle on international protection for Palestinians in the occupied territories which must start immediately with the deployment of observers in Hebron." 'Arafat told AL-JUMHURIYAH that if the PLO's demands on security guarantees were met, "the confidence of the Palestinian population could be restored."
