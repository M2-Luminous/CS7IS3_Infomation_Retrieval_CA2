Mr. Marin informed Mr. 'Arafat this very Wednesday [4 May], in Cairo, of the Community decision. It is now up to the Palestinian authorities to submit operational projects that the Commission can finance (equipment, wages, means of transport, etc., but excluding the purchase of weapons). This measure is only one aspect of Community aid to the Occupied Territories. The ECU10 million are from the 1994 budget, from a 50 million package for aid to these territories, 33 million of which have already been committed for housing, schools, and technical assistance. For the 1994/98 period as a whole, the Union is committed to supplying ECU500 million for economic development in the Occupied Territories. The joint action under CFSP decided on 19 April contains several other initiatives alongside the emergency assistance for the police force.
