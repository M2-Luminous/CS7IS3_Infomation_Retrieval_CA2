This commission is composed of two archbishops and five bishops and will be headed by Adolfo Suarez Rivera, who is the president of the Episcopal Conference and archbishop of Monterrey. Monsignor Ramon Godines Florez, the bishops' official spokesman, announced the creation of the commission when he explained the Episcopal Conference's stand on the Chiapas case. The Conference's position was presented in an eight-point document, which we will mention later on. Godines Florez basically commented on the cease-fire implemented in Chiapas by order of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. [Begin Godines Florez recording] It seems the suspension of the bombings and cease-fire are very important measures. We wish it was already in effect in order to begin a dialogue and seek reconciliation and peace. [end recording] Godines Florez also mentioned the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis as the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. He said that despite everything one must view this appointment with optimism because of Camacho Solis' great virtues as a mediator. Monsignor Godines Florez noted that the NAFTA text must be reviewed because it was negotiated behind the backs of the peasants and Indians, who know nothing about it. He said such a situation could result in more problems in the long run. With regard to the Episcopal Conference's position, I will sum up the eight-point document for you: Point 1: The reason for violence in Chiapas is the misery, neglect, and scorn the peasants and Indians of that state and of other parts of the country are experiencing. Point 2: We reject violence and the use of armed uprisings as a path to resolving true problems, such as misery and injustice. Point 3: We think it is wrong and harmful that, in addition to adding suffering to their poverty, groups insist on a class struggle. Point 4: We know it is not inherent of Indian cultures to attack adversaries because they have taught us hospitality and respect for human life. Point 5: It would be belittling for the Mexican Army to commit excesses in fulfilling its duty when its duty is to work for the security and freedom of the Mexican people. Point 6, which I believe is one of the most important points and one that the bishops mentioned last: In the face of accusations or suspicions that the church in San Cristobal las Casas, quote, encourages the armed uprising, unquote, the church stresses that if any Catholic Church member, by subjective conviction, decides to join the armed struggle, this is done independently from the mission they accepted as catechists. In any case, an accusation must not be based on assumptions but must be thoroughly proven. The Chiapas bishops have consistently urged the rebels to change their behavior and act as Jesus taught us in the Gospel. We cannot accept such accusations against priests, nuns, or the bishop himself. We are certain the bishop has always condemned violence, but he has also reported the misery that, in this case, is caused by abuses in power and structures that must be changed. These are six of the eight points. There are two more points. Point 7 states we are living an important moment in our country's history. It adds we must all change our attitudes. Point 8 says: In conclusion, we urge everyone to pray, which is the force that changes our hearts in accordance with God's will. With regard to the appointment of Camacho Solis as head of the Commission for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas, it notes all Mexicans must support the initiatives started by this commission.
