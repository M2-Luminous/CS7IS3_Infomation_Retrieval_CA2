Bremen lawyer Eberhard Schultz stated to journalists in Bonn on Thursday [24 March] that without German arms deliveries to Turkey, which have been carried out for many years, the ban of the PKK, and the prevention of the Kurdish New Year celebrations, there would have been no violent clashes and nobody would have been killed or injured. "German policemen are always used against the Kurds on behalf of the Turkish military regime," Schultz said. The representatives for the Kurds called on the FRG Government to rescind the PKK ban. Moreover, it is to refrain from deporting Kurdish demonstrators as planned because they are threatened by capital punishment in Turkey. Instead, Bonn is to advocate a peaceful, political solution of the conflict, it was stated.
