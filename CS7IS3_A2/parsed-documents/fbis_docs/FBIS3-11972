Only Niccolo Machiavelli was concerned about the art of government as it is and not as it should be. He specifically called attention to an overpowering phenomenon, the offspring of power, which he labeled the "foolishness of the leader," that is, the self-destructive mechanism that makes a leader fail, beginning at a specific critical point in time, because his commitment to power weakens him at a rate directly proportional to his performance. General Humberto Ortega has always been a remarkable Nicaraguan, both politically and militarily, and his presence became more meaningful even during the revolutionary transition. Beginning with the "Camilo Ortega of the Gringos [as published]," however, he began walking a path toward his own foolishness, which has now culminated with his voluntary appearance before the Military Prosecutor's Office, which he commands. In addition, he voluntarily waived a very significant part of his military authority "directly linked to military jurisdiction." The consequences of his foolishness were overwhelming and imminent: He was arrested. Although it was a "precautionary" arrest, he lacks the right, as is done with potential offenders, to leave his house, city, and country. Is this the self-destruct principle? We do not know for certain yet, but we are wondering. Helms' Geniegate How did Gen. Ortega allow himself to get involved in this case by behaving in an manner contrary to reason, contrary to the nation's best interests, contrary to his irreproachable behavior, and contrary to a clear analysis of the situation? He said he did it in the name of ethics and morality, but in this case, these issues should never have arisen. The general was definitely aware that the "Genie Case," at least in terms of the form it assumed after being mishandled, had nothing to do with the sad incident that shortened the life of young Jean Paul Genie. Gen. Ortega knows, as every prudent person in Nicaragua knows, that this case is being manipulated from the United States by those who, as a letter stated, "have attempted to subject to their whims the dignity and pride of Nicaraguans for more than a century. [no closing quotation marks as published] Bringing Gen. Ortega to court must have made the Jesse Helmses of the world lose sleep. I am sure of this. A couple of months ago, a prominent U.S. Embassy spokesman in Nicaragua told me that North Americans would accept many things from the Chamorro administration; they would not accept, however, that Lenin Cerna stay in the country and that the Genie case go unpunished, not because of the case in itself, but because it was the most direct way to fatally hurt Gen. Ortega, just as Watergate hurt Richard Nixon. U.S. strategists must now be "surprised" by Ortega's foolishness in facilitating the plot they devised to destroy him. As of this moment, Gen. Ortega is indeed under house arrest for a crime he did not commit. We do not know what will happen tomorrow because the Nicaraguan Week of Wailing began after the Judases of Camdessus, Alexander Watson, and Inter-American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias left. Iglesias promised to lend $500 million to finance three years of development in Nicaragua, and the black box of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] is still pending. A Plan To Destroy Judases! It is ridiculous that millions and millions of dollars that belong to Nicaraguans, according to a resolution by the International Court at The Hague, remain frozen in the vaults of the U.S. Treasury to ensure that the vaults of our Central Bank remain criminally empty, thereby leaving the Chamorro government vulnerable to all sorts of blackmail. Indeed, the Week of Wailing has begun. Anything can happen because the enemies are awake, and they are sending no flowers. Regardless of what happens, however, they can be sure about one thing: All of Latin America is behind Gen. Ortega and his foolishness. Regardless of the consequences of Gen. Ortega's foolishness, Latin America is supporting him by firmly waving the Bolivarian flag of independence, self-determination, democracy, and development with social justice. Latin America is committed to Gen. Ortega because of everything he was as well as everything he was not.
