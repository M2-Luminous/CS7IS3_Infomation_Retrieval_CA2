General Morgan was welcomed back to the port town Sunday by around 1,000 supporters following a decision by UN forces operating in Somalia to lift an order banning him from the area. Morgan accompanied his return to one of Somalia's most sensitive towns with an appeal for his supporters to "work together for peace," UN forces spokesman Chris Budge said. Many observers see the southern port as a likely flash point if the civil war between forces loyal to self-proclaimed interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and rival warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid re-erupts. The run down of UN forces and withdrawal of United States forces is seen as raising the chances of new clashes. The slimming down of the UN contingent is set to gather pace in February with the current force of 23,318 falling to around 16,000 by the end of March, Budge said. At its height, the UN force stood at 30,000. US, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian and Turkish contingents are scheduled to leave Somalia by April with their replacements due in the next few weeks. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali complained at the end of January that governments had ignored his request for extra troops for Somalia. With a force of 16,000 the UN would have to forego moves to disarm Somalia's fighting factions and limit itself to protecting ports, airports and relief supplies, Butrus-Ghali said. Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative in Somalia, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe, met Monday with General Mohamed Abshir Musa in Bossasso in northeast Somalia. Musa, whose party dominates the region, is tipped as a possible intermediary between Aidid and Ali Mahdi because of his contacts with both camps. Musa could be asked to kick-start stalled peace negotiations in Nairobi, sources close to UN forces said. Morgan's banishment followed a bloody struggle for Kismaayo with his warlord rival Colonel Omar Jays. Jays, closely allied to Aidid within the Somali National Alliance, has also been freed to return to Kismaayo but his whereabouts are unknown. "Apparently he is still in Somalia," Budge said.
