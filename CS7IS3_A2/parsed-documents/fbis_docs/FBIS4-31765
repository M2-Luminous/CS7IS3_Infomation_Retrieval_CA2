FBIS4-31765 "dreeu114__a94028" FBIS-EEU-94-114-A Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ANNEX Poland Spokesman Recalled From Post Spokesman Recalled From Post LD1306143494 Warsaw PAP in English 1344 GMT 13 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1306143494 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, June 13 -- Spokesman for the Defence Ministry Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki has been recalled from the post, PAP learnt unofficially Monday. The reason behind Rozbicki's dismissal was his article published in the Thursday issue of "GAZETA WYBORCZA" in which he argued that Poland's signing arms reduction agreements was unjustified. He also argued that shifting the military information service WSI (intelligence and counterintelligence) from the ministry's civilian structures and making it subordinate to the General Staff may bring positive results as, according to him, for the sake of state security it would be better if a civilian minister would not have full access to information delivered by the WSI. In response to the article the Presidium of the Sejm Defence Committee charged Rozbicki with "incompetence," "disrespect for civilian politicians" and "lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of full control of the state authorities over the armed forces." Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk also distanced himself from the text of the article.
