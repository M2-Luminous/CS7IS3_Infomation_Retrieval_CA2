Despite the fact, so to speak, that an alternate candidate for the office of Crimean Security Service chief -- Reserve Major General Volodymyr Lepikov -- has appeared at the Security Service building, Ivan Kolomytsev has left neither his office nor duties. Our correspondent Anatoliy Polonskyy has the details. [Begin recording] [Polonskyy] The law has won. This was made possible thanks to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's decree and a clear position of the Security Service staff, who have prevented their activities from being shifted from the legal sphere into politics. The Crimeans have obtained great moral support from their colleagues from other regions of Ukraine. A tribute should also be paid to Ivan Kolomytsev himself. During these extremely hard days, he has shown self-restraint, courage, and allegiance to the oath. Are Kolomytsev's supervisors satisfied with his professional skills? I have addressed this question to Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service. [Malikov] Yes, we are satisfied. Moreover, as I have been told, the Crimean president said that he had no reservations toward Ivan Kolomytsev, while visiting the service and examining the issue of replacing its chief. [Polonskyy] Why then did he decide to dismiss him? [Malikov] Excuse me, but this question should be addressed to someone else. I have met here with representatives of the Presidential Administration and the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers. I have also met with several representatives of Crimean political parties and movements, and I have not understood why such a problem has arisen. Moreover, I have reached an understanding with the majority of people I have had conversations with, that this issue must not be resolved in this manner. There is a legal way of appointing or dismissing the Crimean Security Service chief. This decision should be coordinated with the Crimean Supreme Council and, of course, the Ukrainian Security Service. [Polonskyy] Valeriy Vasylovych, what could you say regarding the Crimean press reports on reinforcing your service's military units in the Crimea? It has also been reported that special assignment units from Kiev arrived in the Crimea. How would you comment on this? [Malikov] As for reinforcing the Crimean Security Service with our special services, I can assure you, with all the responsibility, that such a fact has not occurred. Nobody has arrived here, to reinforce, or do anything else. Regarding other military units, I have received neither official nor operational reports indicating that this has taken place here. [Polonskyy] Is something currently threatening the national security in the Crimea? [Malikov] I do not know of any factors which would somehow influence the national security of the Crimea. I do not know of anything that would threaten the national security -- something that exists only in the Crimea and does not occur in other regions of Ukraine. [Polonskyy] So, there are no grounds for introducing a state of emergency in the Crimea? [Malikov] As of today, I do not see any. [end recording]
