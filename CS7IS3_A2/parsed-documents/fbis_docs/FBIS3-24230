I had occasion several times at the council of the Duma to defend the principle of pact voting. For the first time from the beginning of work of the new parliament, I had a reason to tell the voters: Everything possible was done not to repeat the nightmare of the recent past, and so that the dead do not grasp for the legs of the living. Manifestos, memoranda, declarations--these are not documents of direct action. But there are quite a few examples in the history of many states about what kind of role the declaration or nondeclaration of such documents can play. I will risk saying that the resolutions adopted by the Duma really provide an opportunity for accord. It, of course, can be missed due to a misunderstanding or malicious intent. Unfortunately, the behavior of some of our natural allies--deputies from Russia's Choice and the Yavlinskiy bloc--is a reason to suspect at least elements of such intent in their attitude toward the Memorandum. Very much depends now on the mass media, inasmuch as it is it that brings the essence of one or another decision of the legislative or executive authority to the people. If all commentaries reduce the usefulness of the adopted Memorandum to zero, then its value really will prove to be no more than the value of the paper it is written on. The search for accord is not a very simple matter, but its necessity should be recognized. The fighting fervor of the antagonistic parties, which once almost brought Russia to the brink of a civil war, remains. There is evidence of attempts by individual deputies to undermine the adoption and to dodge it at the last moment. But if the president, nonetheless, intends to observe the Constitution and not to violate the authority of the Duma, then the people who are under investigation in Lefortovo will be amnestied. How they behave in the future depends on us. Orientation on a continuation of the confrontation and on a vendetta will not lead to anything, especially when the character of the persons involved in the dispute from both sides is taken into account--of the president, of Khasbulatov, and of Rutskoy. The characters are not easy to get along with--I would say, they are Russians. I am convinced that there are no prisons that hold you forever. It is impossible for the trial of the participants in the October events not to turn into a political trial. An example of such a trial is the GKChP [State Committee for the State of the Emergency] affair, to which there is no visible end without an amnesty. The more quickly it takes place, the fewer reasons there will be for being concerned about the fate of future elections--both local and presidential. I am confident that many alleged political authorities will waver considerably after an amnesty. We, for example, do not intend to fight for Rutskoy's electorate, but such a fight is in prospect for Vladimir Volfovich. In addition, I do not think that an investigation into the October events is really advantageous to the current executive authority, inasmuch as any investigation inevitably will get stuck on Edict No. 1400, which the author himself recognized as unconstitutional. I want to close this page, and not only I. Individuals continue to threaten a civil war, but I would ask them to calm down and to leave the matches alone.
