Notification of this was made during a meeting of the Cease-Fire Commission this morning. Asked to comment on the issue, the government's Major Eduardo Alexandre said it was a regular movement that will eventually culminate with the abolition of militia forces. Some time ago, the government troops that had occupied Sangage after the General Peace Accord were forced to withdraw by the Cease-Fire Commission. Meanwhile, Renamo soldies are moving toward Salamanga Assembly Area in Maputo Province. This area has not yet been approved because of a dispute between the government and Renamo.
