FR941103-0-00120 FR941103-0-00016 (i) Each pressure relief device must be able to withstand dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding one gallon before the relief device recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. An acceptable test procedure is outlined in TTMA RP No. 81_``Performance of Spring Loaded Pressure Relief Valves on MC 306, MC 307, and MC 312 Tanks,'' May 24, 1989 edition. (ii) After August 31, 1995, each pressure relief device must be able to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the design set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding one liter before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81, cited in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, is an acceptable test procedure. * * * * * §178.345&hyph;13 [Amended] 22. In §178.345&hyph;13, a heading is added to paragraph (c) to read `` Leakage test .''. §178.345&hyph;14 [Amended] 23. In §178.345&hyph;14, in paragraph (d), the following changes are made: a. The paragraph heading `` Multi-cargo tank cargo tank motor vehicle '' is revised to read `` Multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle ''. b. At the end of the second sentence, the phrase ``unless all of the cargo tanks are identical'' is revised to read ``unless all cargo tanks are made by the same manufacturer with the same materials, manufactured thickness, minimum thickness and to the same specification''. 24. In §178.345&hyph;15, a sentence is added in the beginning of paragraph (b)(2) and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows: §178.345&hyph;15 Certification. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) For each ASME tank, a tank manufacturer's data report as required by the ASME Code. *␣*␣* * * * * * (e) Specification shortages. If a cargo tank is manufactured which does not meet all applicable specification requirements, thereby requiring subsequent manufacturing involving the installation of additional components, parts, appurtenances or accessories, the cargo tank manufacturer may affix the name plate and specification plate, as required by §178.345&hyph;14 (b) and (c), without the original date of certification stamped on the specification plate. The manufacturer shall state the specification requirements not complied with on the manufacturer's Certificate of Compliance. When the cargo tank is brought into full compliance with the applicable specification, the Registered Inspector shall stamp the date of compliance on the specification plate. The Registered Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Compliance stating details of the particular operations performed on the cargo tank, and the date and person (manufacturer, carrier, or repair organization) accomplishing the compliance. 25. In §178.346&hyph;1, new paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) are added to read as follows: §178.346&hyph;1 General requirements. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (9) Single full fillet lap joints without plug welds may be used for arc or gas welded longitudinal seams without radiographic examination under the following conditions: (i) For a truck-mounted cargo tank, no more than two such joints may be used on the top half of the tank and no more than two joints may be used on the bottom half. They may not be located farther from the top and bottom centerline than 16 percent of the shell's circumference. (ii) For a self-supporting cargo tank, no more than two such joints may be used on the top of the tank. They may not be located farther from the top centerline than 12.5 percent of the shell's circumference.
