New figures on the AIDS situation in Israel arrived at the Health Ministry this month. Since 1981 1,134 AIDS carriers were discovered, 784 of them men. Of these carriers, 33 left the country and 29 died of causes not directly related to the disease. So far 202 people have died of AIDS in Israel; 16 of the patients have left the country. Only 26 women are registered as AIDS patients at the present time, approximately 10 percent of the living patients. Over the last few years there has been a steady increase in the number of women contracting AIDS in Israel. The reason for this is the increase in the number of hetrosexually contracted cases.
