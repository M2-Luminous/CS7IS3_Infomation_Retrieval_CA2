The Board is established to formulate policy guidelines for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The Board is responsible for selecting subject areas to be assessed, developing assessment objectives, identifying appropriate achievement goals for each grade and subject tested, and establishing standards and procedures for interstate and national comparisons. On May 12, two committees will be in open session from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. The Subject Area Committee # 2 will be briefed on the test development work for the NAEP arts education assessment; hear about a national survey of arts instruction; and review the cognitive item review schedule. The Committee will also be provided information on the International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The Achievement Levels Committee will examine the issues involved in selecting exemplary items for the achievement levels, and be briefed on the progress of the 1994 level setting activities in geography and history. The committee will also be briefed on the plans for ``reinvesting'' the 1992 reading achievement levels to be used to report NAEP results in 1994 at the 4, 8, and 12 grade national levels and state grade 4 level. On May 13, the Executive Committee will meet in open session from 7 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. The proposed agenda includes review and discussion of the principles governing the NAEP subject area assessment scheduling, and briefing on the status of NAEP reauthorization.

Two of the three committees will meet in open session: the Reporting and Dissemination Committee, and the Design and Analysis Committee. The Reporting and Dissemination Committee will consider plans for the release of future NAEP reports. The Design and Analysis Committee will hear a presentation on feasibility studies for reporting NAEP data below the state level; and discuss score scaling issues.
