Hyundai Electronic Industries Co. and three other Hyundai corporations contracted to buy Maxtor Co., a San Jose-based hard disc manufacturer, last August. The Hyundai companies agreed to finance their acquisition with a loan from Citibank, a U.S. bank which Hyundai said has promised to lend $150 million. The takeover of Maxtor, the fifth largest hard disc manufacturer in the world, which has production lines in Hong Kong and Singapore, is certain to add muscle to the Hyundai Business Group's electronics division. To obtain approval for its takeover plan, a government official said, the Hyundai Business Group lobbied hard at the Economic Planning Board, the Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea. Officials from these government agencies form the committee deliberating on foreign direct investments, chaired by Yim Chang-yol, second assistant minister of finance. Instead of holding a meeting on Hyundai's acquisition plan, the committee received written opinions from its members by Friday. Based on the committee members' opinions in favor of Hyundai, the Ministry of Finance instructed the Bank of Korea yesterday morning to give a green light to the takeover plan. Does this approval by the ministry signal any change in the government attitude toward the Hyundai Business Group, whose founder Chong Chu-yong antagonized President Kim Yong-sam by challenging him in the presidential election in December 1992? There are signs of improving relations between the government and the Hyundai Business Group. When he encountered Chong at Korea University where the late honorary chairman of a vernacular newspaper lay in state last week, President Kim smiled and shook hands with the Hyundai founder. Another sign of improvement came earlier this month when the Bank of Korea approved Hyundai Motor Co.'s plan to invest $6.8 million in a joint venture auto company with a Malaysian corporation. Despite these signs of improvement, however, it may be too early to say that the government has buried the hatchet. Though it has approved Hyundai's plans for investments abroad, the government is holding back its decision on Hyundai's plans to raise funds for investment in the nation. The Hyundai Business Group has applied to the Korea Development Bank for 832 billion won in loans to finance its auto, electronics projects and other projects. It is apparent the government-owned bank cannot make any decision on the issue without a cue from the government, although an official from the Ministry of Finance maintained that his ministry is not involved in any specific loan request to the bank. In addition, the Securities Supervisory Board has not allowed Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development Co. and three other Hyundai corporations yet to sell their stocks over the counter.
