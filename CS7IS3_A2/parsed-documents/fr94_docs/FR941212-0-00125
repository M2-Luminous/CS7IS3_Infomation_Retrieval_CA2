FR941212-0-00125 FR941212-0-00019 The following are examples of types and categories of property losses for which compensation will not be allowed: (a) Property lost or damaged as a result of claimant's negligence. Property damaged or lost, in whole or in part, as a result of any negligence or wrongful act of the claimant, the claimant's spouse or family member, or any agent or employee of the claimant acting in the scope of employment, is not compensable. Negligence may be defined as failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent person would have exercised under the same circumstances. (b) Property damaged or lost while located at quarters within the United States that were occupied by the claimant but were neither assigned nor otherwise provided in kind by the Government. (c) Intangible property. Loss of property that has no extrinsic and marketable value but is merely representative or evidence of value, such as non-negotiable stock certificates, promissory notes, bonds, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, insurance policies, baggage checks, and bank books is not compensable. Similarly, a claimant may not be compensated for the inability to use nonrefundable tickets or recover lease or utility deposits. Loss of a thesis, or other similar item, is compensable only to the extent of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant in preparing the item such as the cost of the paper or other materials. No compensation is authorized for the time spent by the claimant in its preparation or for supposed literary value. (d) Incidental expenses and consequential damages. The Act and this subpart authorize payment for loss of or damage to personal property only. Except as provided in §536.165, consequential damages or other types of loss or incidental expenses (such as loss of use, interest, carrying charges, cost of lodging or food while awaiting arrival of shipment, attorney fees, telephone calls, cost of transporting claimant or family members, inconvenience, time spent in preparation of claim, or cost of insurance premiums) are not compensable. (e) Real property. Damage to real property is not compensable. In determining whether an item is considered to be an item of personal property, as opposed to real property, normally, any movable item is considered personal property even if physically joined to the land. (f) Articles acquired or held for sale or disposition by other commercial transactions on more than an occasional basis, or for use in a private profession or business enterprise. (g) Enemy property or war trophies. (h) Property acquired, possessed, or transported unlawfully or in violation of local law or competent regulations or directives. This includes loss or damage to vehicles not properly registered or insured in compliance with local law or competent regulations or directives. (i) Loss of money in any amount during shipment or storage with baggage or household goods. This includes coin collections. (j) Property stored at a commercial facility for the convenience of the claimant and at his or her expense. (k) Substantial fraud. The head of an area claims office may completely deny a claim that he determines to be substantially tainted by fraud. (l) Not a proper claimant. See §§536.164 and 536.165(a)(2). §536.167 Time prescribed for filing. (a) No claim may be paid under this subpart unless it is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. A claim is presented when it is received at a U.S. military establishment, not when it enters the mails. For purposes of this subpart, a claim accrues at the time of the incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage is or should have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of due diligence. In the case of multiple deliveries on the same Government Bill of Lading, the claim accrues for those later received items when they are delivered. The claim filed for the initial damage will be amended to reflect the subsequently claimed items. If personal property remains in storage after the expiration date of legal entitlement to storage at Governmental expense, a claim normally accrues on such expiration date. (b) If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after the claim accrues, and if good cause is shown, then the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after the war or armed conflict is terminated. A claims office may telephonically obtain the authority to grant additional time to file a claim, from the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division. If good cause for delay in filing is not established, the intervention of war or armed conflict, in itself, will not permit payment of a claim presented later than 2 years after accrual. Pursuant to the provisions of Pub. L. 96&hyph;446 (94 Stat 1967), periods of captivity are excluded in computing the 2-year statute of limitations. (c) If a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in nontemporary storage has sustained partial damage, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant has an opportunity to ascertain the extent of the loss, or the claimant's entitlement to Government shipment or storage expires, whichever occurs sooner. However, the claimant is expected to exercise due diligence in attempting to ascertain the extent of the loss. Moreover, when a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in nontemporary storage at Government expense has sustained complete destruction or loss, the statute of limitations begins to run when this notification is received. §536.168 Form of claim.
