The government forces' delegation promised the RPF forces' delegation that they would address the demands of the RPF in order to correct misdeeds. The two delegations agreed that the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] would meet both sides in order to fix another date for the resumption of negotiations. Meanwhile, the two delegations agreed that UNAMIR's operation of taking civilians from the fighting areas to the sides of their choice would resume today. In this respect, the RPF forces' delegation announced in the meeting that the RPF had agreed that government forces could send envoys to Amahoro stadium, in the RPF- controlled area, to talk to people who have taken refuge there. It is worth recalling that the people who took refuge at Amahoro stadium and whom the government claims belong to its side, have clearly stated that instead of going to die in areas still controlled by government forces where nobody cares, they have chosen to stay at Amahoro stadium. This means that they are not afraid of reports that those who go to the government side are shot by RPF forces, as the government forces' negotiator, Colonel Gatsinzi, said on Radio Rwanda this morning, to deceive the [word indistinct].
