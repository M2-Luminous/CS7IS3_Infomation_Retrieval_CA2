It seems as if many people had been waiting to see these ideas that have so much to do with our future set down in black and white. Apart from the need to identify these serious problems, everyone asked how to stop a phenomenon that is compromising our society's value system. Who will our leaders be, and what will they be like in 2010 or 2020? We wonder about this if our children grow up immersed in contradictory situations: when they are told one thing by their families or their school, and then they see shady deals or observe goods coming from the black market, as well as other improper behaviors. Such situations also have equivalents in language, in which actions have an abstract representation. For people now in their thirties, the expression being a fighter was related to high ideals. Not so now. Earning a living used to be applied to examples of self-denial and hard work in extreme poverty: mothers who worked as laundresses, fathers who held multiple jobs, all of which they undertook to support their family. Not anymore. Making good bread used to mean just what the words said, and was a badge of pride if applied to a creator of bakery delicacies. Now, though, that expression may refer to the productive night of a petty thief who skims off goods from a state store. Similar semantics have produced at least a hundred linguistic innovations related to that vital area where things that belong to all are enjoyed by a few, and what should be distributed through the commercial network goes out through back doors, to be sold on street corners, in city alleys, and semiconcealed outlets. These phenomena are certainly hard to root out while we are living in this time of shortages, but it is essential to act from an ideological viewpoint if we want to preserve values that are the mainstay of our nation's ethical heritage. Hitting Bottom That is the title of a book my colleague Jorge Rodriguez Hernandez is writing, in which he reveals, denounces, lays bare, and reports on trends in the black market and other distortions of Cuban market relations at the present time. Jorge investigated these problems in response to calls from listeners to his radio program, who contacted him and asked him to look into the numerous irregularities on the fringes of or in the underground economy. He has compiled over 1,000 files and documents on embezzlement, pilfering, corruption of various sorts, and the outcome of trials in cases that were detected. After five years of systematic work, he has prepared a number of graphics illustrating his investigations, plus pertinent contents of official reports, speeches, and information. Between 1988 and 1990 my colleague followed 35 court trials. In reviewing his notes, Jorge found that 25 of these economic crimes took place in the capital, and the total damages to the nation came to 19.5 million pesos! In three cases the persons implicated were handling over 1 million pesos in each case, and in another 11 cases, over 100,000 pesos. On 32 occasions over three persons were involved. In 19 cases the administration was involved, and in another 19, businessmen, officials, accountants, and drivers were involved. Of these 35 crimes, 94 percent happened in the area of material distribution, and within that category, 80 percent involved commerce, restaurants, and services. Fraud was a component of the modus operandi in 91 percent of the cases. "All this shows," Jorge Rodriguez told me, "the organized character and the degree of complicity of people who, far from exercising positive authority, become lawbreakers. Another symptomatic feature is the occupational status of the criminals, for these are people with jobs, people who work, and in their position or job they become corrupted and corrupt others." "In black market retailing," he added, "the situation is different: the biggest suppliers are individuals with jobs, and it is usually unemployed people who take the product to its final destination." Four Years of the Black Market Jorge has become an expert on the underground economy. One of his most careful investigations always arouses interest. Over a four-year period he followed black market price trends of 19 important consumer items: fats and oils, coffee, fluid, condensed and evaporated milk, beans, cigars, rum and beer, laundry detergents and bath soaps, butter, chicken, beef, and eggs. A combination of one unit of each of these goods comes to a total, at the official price, of 17.29 [pesos]. Jorge began his calculations in the last quarter of 1990, and they have continued through 1993. Underground sales have fluctuating prices that rise as demand increases and supply declines, just like in capitalism. So buying a pound, bottle, or part of the 19 products selected for the study would have cost between 129 and 150 pesos in September 1990; between 185 and 226 in October 1991; and in July 1992 these black market prices had risen to between 283 and 398 pesos. Three months later, at the end of October, they were between 347 and 508 pesos. On 31 January 1993, while the state market allowed Cubans to continue purchasing what was available of these items for the same minimum price they had cost years before, in the underground economy they cost between 392 and 570 pesos; three months later, at the end of April 1993, they cost between 489 and 660 pesos. More recently, at the end of the first two weeks of October, these prices had almost doubled: between 788 and 1,014 pesos in Cuban currency. If a buyer in this market earned a minimum salary of 100 pesos a month he could not have made these underground purchases unless he also got between 29 and 50 pesos in addition in 1991; between 158 and 233 in April 1992, and between 389 and 560 in April 1993. If he received a maximum salary of 450 pesos, three years ago he could have bought all these items easily, but on 30 April 1993 he would have been 40 pesos short because by that time prices had risen between 28 and 38 times. In October the increase came to between 45 and 59 times. All these factors will be used in forming individual and collective judgments of what is happening and what to do to diminish the harmful nature of these phenomena. It will at least be useful to speak out openly about this as a reality that must be temporary, and to inculcate in minors a sense of how this double standard of morality destroys the honor of society as a whole. Making lies and simulation a standard of behavior is highly dangerous. Promoting or participating in embezzlement, bribery, or complicity in thefts from the state, and, therefore, from every other citizen, means a crisis of values that, aside from needing to be put down and punished, must quickly be rooted out from both institutions and individuals. It is vital to stop robbery and corruption and to force them back so they will not destroy the social conscience of our times. In the history of Cuba and in that of other countries, never have petty criminals figured among the legions of those who love and create. Five Hundred People Surveyed What do people think, and how do they react, whether or not they are involved in activities that give rise to these situations? Jorge Rodriguez Hernandez asked 500 workers, 44 percent of whom were under 30, and 54 percent of whom were male. They worked in commerce, restaurants, and services. They were employees in the Matadero and la Planta Habana, in food service, in factories, and light industry shops, in addition to professionals, middle management, and white-collar employees. They were members of the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] and MININT [Ministry of the Interior], plus some retired people, housewives, and people who were unemployed when the survey was conducted in 1991. What did these 500 people say? Sixty-six percent said they were dissatisfied with the way material and financial resources were being protected; 57 percent said they were also unhappy about the use made of those resources. Fifty-five percent felt that their standard of living was not the same as that of other members of society; 72 percent added that their needs were not being met as were those of other people. In spiritual and cultural matters, 57 percent said they believed those needs were being fulfilled on an equal basis. Jorge asked people who work in restaurants, services, and commerce what they thought about the connection between their salary and their contribution to society. Sixty percent thought there was no correlation, and 64 percent thought there was no correlation with the quality and service they provided. And one interesting fact to note: between 61 and 66 percent of those polled in these sectors did believe that social property was well protected and used in terms of normal socialist aspirations. The details of these evils obviously need much more than one investigative report. These really are issues that cry out for public thought and discussion. Starting with the crisis in authority affecting some people who should be controlling and protecting; and the decline of the community's scorn for a group of behaviors linked to crime and disorder.... For, as my colleague Jorge Rodriguez noted: "Many of the efforts of the state leadership are devoted to plugging up the holes used by people engaging in shady deals. The other thing is that in Cuba there is no exploitation in production. Exploitation is privatized and the traffickers in money and merchandise are the ones engaging in exploitation." We wondered over and over what can we do about this? What can be done, aside from doing our jobs responsibly, at a time when this entails greater sacrifices?
