According to its official newspaper EL DIARIO, which was sent to the Lima media on Monday, an "impostor" took the place of its imprisoned leader, Abimael Guzman, to issue an appeal for peace to the Peruvian Government in October 1993. EL DIARIO said, "We know reactionary people have Guzman hidden and isolated in the Navy's dungeons. We reject the October video, which presents an impostor, a man they prepared for over a year to replace Guzman on television." Shining Path thinks the government's campaign for "a peace agreement justifies the assassination of President Gonzalo (Guzman)," and so it asks that the health of its leader, who was arrested in September 1992 and is currently serving a life sentence at the naval base in El Callao, "be taken care of." Nevertheless, the opposition magazine SI claims, in its Monday edition, an uneasiness prevails among high command members of the Navy, who are in charge of Guzman's custody, over the meetings held between the Shining Path leader and the imprisoned leaders of the organization at the officers' club in El Callao Naval Base. According to official information, during those meetings they wrote the letters from Guzman and his comrade, Elena Iparraguirre (one letter remains unpublished), issuing an appeal for peace; and another one along those same lines from four imprisoned leaders. SI magazine reports, citing reliable sources, that Shining Path's demands to achieve a peace agreement include "a general amnesty for all of its imprisoned activists," so they can hold a congress to establish the groundwork for peace. The magazine, along with all Peruvian media, thinks a division prevails within the Shining Path between the group which advocates peace, led by Guzman, and a group of "hard-liners" who do not want to end the armed struggle, which began in 1980 and which is represented by leaders who are still at large. Conversely, EL DIARIO calls the division "false" and denies Guzman wants peace; it does admit the imprisoned activists include a handful of "capitulators, now lackeys of the dictatorship (President Alberto Fujimori's Government), who are trying to plant the idea of capitulation among the people." EL DIARIO also publishes a statement from female Shining Path members, currently at the women's prison in Lima, who also recognize the existence of "a small revisionist, black group of capitulators that wave the flags of peace while shouting threats that will have deadly consequences." To conclude, the January edition of the Shining Path newspaper, which is banned in Peru and the possession of which is proof of active participation in the organization -- a fact that may be punished with a life sentence -- is exclusively dedicated to proving its total loyalty to Guzman.
