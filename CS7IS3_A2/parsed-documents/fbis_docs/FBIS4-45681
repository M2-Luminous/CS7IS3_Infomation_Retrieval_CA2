It follows that the state cannot effectively control its natural and mineral resources. Strong lobbies after a quick buck see this country as their promised land, the paper writes. According to press reports, raw materials, building materials -- including sandstone and gravel sand -- and fuels accounted for over 53 percent of Czech exports in the first nine months of last year. These figures provoke anxiety, the paper writes, asking whether in the future the Czech Republic will have enough resources to afford to buy such materials on the world market. There is no pro-export policy to stimulate small businesses with their potential for clever ideas and so the unscrupulous pillaging of the land has been going on unchecked. What is more, there are no legislative guidelines to provide that the present conditions of early capitalism in the sector become more like those of developed societies who protect their natural wealth. Compared to 1989, stone exports have gone up 90 times. The Vrsetin hill in the Ceske stredohori mountain range has been all but flattened. The paper asks whether the whole of Ceske stredohori is to disappear for some people's profit and if so, who is going to be responsible. Ceske stredohori is state property and should not be owned by companies. Incidentally, stone is marketed, among others, by the former agent Pavel Minarik, the paper says, quoting from Minarik's interview with LIDOVE NOVINY. Minarik has recently lodged an appeal against a four year jail sentence handed down last September for his part in plotting to put Radio Free Europe in Munich out of action in the 1970s. The project of cement works at Tman, central Bohemia, endangers a nature preserve of Cesky kras, an area of underground sandstone caves unique throughout the world. Already intensive work is going on at railway reloading points in Vimperk, Volary and Prachatice, all South Bohemia, through which sandstone passes on its way abroad. This year's cement export quota amounts to almost two million tonnes. It is not known how much earth needs to be dug to yield that amount, the paper says. Germany prohibits the use of digging mechanisms harmful to the environment, which is why profit-hungry German businessmen ship them to this country where their use is unrestricted. Commenting on Tman, Czech Minister of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy has allegedly said that he "never spoke in favor of the cement works." The hopes these words might incite are dashed in the light of the recently destroyed village Libkovice, North Bohemia -- a place, the paper says, that he surrendered to the coal lobby. But rather than Germans, district officials at Beroun, Central Bohemia, administering Tman, employees of the State Hygiene Authority and local officials at Tman are to blame. American Indians are said to have once sold land for a few bottles of whisky, the paper says, adding that delegating too much authority to towns and villages is courting disaster for society and nature. The construction of waterways is yet another example of profiteering. It may be gravel sand lodged in the river beds and not actual river transport that companies such as Ecotrans Moravia and its sister companies are interested in, the paper speculates. The profitability of river transport is questionable and the value of property affected by waterway projects is plummeting. Once they have been completed, the surrounding environment is eventually reduced to steppes. However, the law banning projects harmful to the environment, pushed through by the Ministry for the Environment, is there for people to lean on if they want, as they should, to defend their beautiful country and pass it on to their children, Valcikova says in CESKY DENIK.
