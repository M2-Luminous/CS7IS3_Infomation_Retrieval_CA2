FR940826-0-00117 FR940826-0-00019 Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A outlines FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA. Small entities are defined as independently owned and operated small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. Because this rule will directly affect certain individuals (who are not defined as entities), the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. International Trade Impact Assessment Because the rule only will affect certain individuals, it will not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services to the United States. Federalism Implications The rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and that of any state, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The respondents affected by the amendments are private citizens, not state governments. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). In addition, this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
