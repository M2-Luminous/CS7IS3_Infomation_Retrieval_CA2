Since the beginning of this year, some indicators in consumption and production have pointed to improvements in business activities, Mieno said in an opening address to a three-day quarterly meeting of the central bank's branch managers and overseas representatives. But "final demand as a whole" still remains stagnant, as shown by declining corporate capital investment, and a further careful watch is necessary to see if those bright signs are sustained and spread to lift the economy, Mieno said. Mieno said personal consumption is showing signs of "stopping falling and recovering," and production is expected to increase in the January-March quarter after posting a sharp decline in the previous quarter. Under these circumstances, corporate sentiment is regaining stability, he said. Ongoing inventory adjustments and the spreading effects of past fiscal and monetary measures as leading to these improvements, he said. [sentence as received] There is also a possibility, however, that they might have stemmed from special window-dressing efforts by companies ahead of the book closing last Thursday for fiscal 1993, the central bank chief said. Mieno also pointed to continued downward pressure on the economy from ongoing corporate restructuring efforts to cope with the yen's sharp appreciation over the past year, as well as asset deflation after the collapse of the economic bubble of the late 1980s. On monetary policy, he said the central bank will continue carefully monitoring economic and financial-market developments. In this connection, the easing of credit so far is contributing to form the basis of macroeconomic recovery by facilitating corporate restructuring, Mieno said. Short-term market rates are moving at low levels, although long-term market rates have risen recently from year-earlier levels because of the evaporation of "excessive market hopes" for lower rates late last year, he said. Mieno said the financial authorities must push forward deregulation and other measures in capital markets to back up efforts by companies to restructure and by financial institutions to liquidate bad loans. He said "utmost use" of markets is important to facilitate various adjustments and to put the economy into a sustainable growth phase without inflation. Bank of Japan branch managers from 33 domestic branches and three overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on the economic conditions of their respective areas and to confirm monetary policy. Attention is fixed on whether the three-day meeting will lead the central bank to paint a brighter economic picture. At the previous meeting, the branch managers spelled out a recovery in corporate sentiment. Mieno will hold a press conference Wednesday to wrap up the meeting.
