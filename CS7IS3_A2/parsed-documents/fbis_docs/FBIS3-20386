Replying to a question at this weekly news conference today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman recalled that Article 40 of the Lausanne Treaty grants the Turkish minority in Western Thrace the right to establish, run, and inspect its own educational institutions. Within this framework, Ataman said, Turkish teachers from Western Thrace are supposed to teach in the minority schools. However, he added, the Greek Education Ministry terminated these teachers' contracts and announced that it would appoint the teachers itself. Ataman explained that following this decision, the Turkish teachers started a boycott of the schools from 28 March to 1 April, with 100 percent participation. He stressed that in this way, the Western Thrace Turkish minority protected its rights and expressed its reaction to the decision by the Greek authorities. He added: The elimination by the Greek Government, through arbitrary decisions, of the most basic rights of the Turkish minority in Western Thrace -- rights granted to them through international agreements -- is utterly unacceptable. We are making the necessary representations to ensure that the decision is corrected. At every forum, Turkey will continue to raise and elaborate on the issue of the violation of human rights in the Western Thrace. We expect and demand the Greek Government to stop this unjust practice as soon as possible. Asked to comment on Greek press reports that Turkish warplanes intensively violated Greek airspace on 25 March, Ataman said that Turkish planes carried out routine and individual training flights in the international airspace of the Aegean on 25 March, flights that do not call for issuing an alert to pilots. He said: Planes of the Turkish Air Force have been carrying out training and exercise flights in the international airspace of the Aegean for years, within the framework of rights granted to them by international law. During these flights, the pilots are always careful not to violate the 6-mile national Greek airspace.
