[applause] I come before this august hall for the last time, in accordance with the precepts established in the Constitution of the Republic, before the honorable representation of the people in my condition as constitutional president to render my report on my activities as ruler of Honduras. In the next few hours, I will relinquish power over the nation to my legitimate successor, who was chosen by the people through the democratic system, which Hondurans have respected since 1980 -- free suffrage, whereby the will is reflected as the sovereign expression of the people. As ruler, as an Honduran, I am pleased to hand over the power in a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, which is the result of a harmonic policy we applied on all the national sectors, seeking concerted agreements to all the national problems to find the proper solutions which would allow us to create plans that would prove to be consequent with the Honduran reality. Recently, in a ceremony in my honor, hosted by the previous assembly -- and I again acknowledge Rodolfo Irias Navas, former president of the Congress of the Republic -- I said: Ruling is not an easy task. Managing public businesses can be difficult as is satisfying the people's different aspirations because the nation's resources are not sufficient to fulfill everyone's desires, thereby making it necessary to establish priorities that serve as a framework to attain, mid- or long-term, the objectives aimed at benefiting the people. In the government report I will give to the secretariat of the sovereign National Congress, you honorable deputies will find details of the work undertaken during the first trimester of 1990 and their effects, which really interest us as they contribute to the national development in all of its aspects. I am pleased, and I say it honestly, to have placed Honduras on the promising path to a free economy, freeing us from the chains of paternalism and protectionism that hindered Hondurans' creativity, overburdened the State, and paralyzed particular initiatives for production and competition. It was also an honor for my government to have made gigantic steps in modernizing the highway system, technology, expanding telecommunications, and making accessible the extraordinary world of computers to our children. They are now available in the schoolrooms of our beloved Honduras. I can say with deep emotion and pride that I have laid a groundwork for the future, when new leaders and generations will expand on our efforts regarding environmental protection, human rights, which are respected now more than during any other time in our history, and Honduras' reconciliation through ideological tolerance, which we have established, and the initiatives that we have sponsored with the determination to deal seriously with corruption. In the field of education, which I want to emphasize, we have built a number of primary school classrooms throughout the country. This reveals my government's firm support for education, because we have built schools for thousands of children who lacked school facilities in their communities; in addition, thousands of desks were donated through the Honduran Social Investment Fund. These desks have alleviated the discomfort of the many young Hondurans who had to sit on the floor. On handing over the administration, I can say that no child will have to be ashamed and sit on the hard floor. Our determination to stimulate education in Honduras is indicated by our help in refurbishing primary and secondary schools and constructing new centers, particularly trade schools, which give thousands of young people an opportunity to learn working skills to the benefit of the area in which they live. In the health sector, hospitals were repaired, and hundreds of health centers were built during my administration. They were equipped with everything necessary to serve the people. In many instances, semidilapidated buildings were all that remained of previous administrations. People often despaired of never having an adequate place to which to go for treatment of their most pressing health needs. An organized health sector work structure will be handed over to the new government, which will assume office on 27 January. Diseases which have ravaged the child population were put under control. We have tackled the terrible cholera with determination via prevention drives, the speeding up of construction of latrines, and by making the people aware of the need to take sanitary measures to defeat the epidemics that crossed our border to obliterate the lives of hundreds of Hondurans. In the social area we have sympathized with sectors that for a long time have been relegated or excluded as the result of neglect. For this reason, we have established a bonus for unwed mothers, an economic aid instrument to help them take care of the basic problems of their children, children whose extreme poverty has barred access to food and education. In addition, school bags and footwear were given out to the children of many schools in municipalities, villages, and hamlets via the family assistance program. My administration's relationship with rural and urban workers has been consistent with a policy of understanding, within the patriotic purpose of maintaining a climate of harmony, which translates into national well-being. Fellow countrymen, ladies and gentlemen, deputies, before I hand over the presidential office, I would like to express my deep satisfaction over the fact that, with the cooperation of worthy and distinguished Hondurans and well-known international jurists, it fell on me to end the old territorial dispute with our neighbor, El Salvador. The century-old controversy, which weighed down on the two countries like a dissociating factor of the regional peace, ended with a fair ruling, which confirmed our sovereign rights on the sacred national territory. I will keep this achievement, which we Hondurans share proudly, as a reminder of what we can do when we join forces. At all times, and regardless of political inclinations, we contributed as Hondurans to a common cause, which in time had alienated us from the unionist principles envisioned by the immortal hero of La Trinidad. Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, today, during my last official intervention as Honduran president and in the presence of a new Congress elected by the people, I would like to recognize the entire nation, because we have demonstrated again our people's political maturity and deep-rooted reliance on democracy. I am leaving my performance as president printed on history's pages so that what I wanted to do for my homeland can be assessed in the future. To point out achievements or mistakes should not be the part of sectarian inclinations, rather, of a position that will make it possible to review in the future what we did to reinforce Honduras preserving its name and prestige as a result of our democratic training. History is wise, because when Marco Aurelio Soto decided to reform Honduras, the critics of his time shot poisoned arrows at his honorable person, not realizing that those changes would allow us to begin a new century of hope. Such was the case of late illustrious President Juan Manuel Galvez who founded the national banking system, modernized education, allowed all Hondurans to participate in the matters of state, and spoke on behalf of free expression in every possible way. History was also late in recognizing the social contribution of Jose Ramon Villeda Morales, another illustrious Honduran who [applause] as president gave the people social security, labor law, and land reform. Deputies, with devotion for Honduras I would like to say that, in setting aside by political feelings, I feel proud to reach such a significant moment in my public life, when I can pass on the presidential sash in an atmosphere of peace and harmony to the citizen who captured the people's approval, Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina. [applause] Honorable representatives of the people, my mission as the leader of Honduras' destiny is about to conclude. I encourage you to make a united supreme effort, from your high posts, as vested upon you by the people and only by the people, to continue living in democracy, maintaining the highest national interest first and foremost. I thank you one and all, and I especially thank the Honduran people for the highest honor ever granted to my family, my wife Norma, and myself, of serving this beloved country, Honduras. Thank you.
