According to the draft law, Latvian citizenship could be granted only to ethnic Latvians who have returned to the republic; those legally residing in Latvia before 1940 but lacking citizenship; spouses of Latvian citizens living on the Latvian territory over 10 years and citizens of Lithuania and Estonia permanently residing in the republic. In addition, the factions proposed setting the annual quotas for granting citizenship at 0.1% of the Latvian population. At the moment, it is about 1900 persons a year. The authors of the draft law propose the beginning of the naturalization be linked with the ultimate withdrawal of Russian troops. At a press conference, they pointed out that their proposals were an alternative to the document prepared by the ruling coalition, encompassing the factions "Latvian Way" and "Peasants' Union," which was passed in the first reading last December. This draft law stipulates that the Latvian citizenship could be granted to former citizens of the Soviet Union permanently residing in Latvia for over 10 years and having command of the Latvian language. The annual naturalization quota will be set by the republican government.
