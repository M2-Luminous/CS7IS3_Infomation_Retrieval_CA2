Two of the victims required hospital treatment for serious injuries. The police said they suspected that a bomb was thrown into a crowd watching a MANORA traditional southern soap opera around 1.40 a.m. The blast left a hole about three inches deep and 13 inches in diameter in front of the stage. About 300 people were watching the soap opera when the bomb went off. The blast sent spectators fleeing, the police said. One of those injured allegedly told the police he overheard a group of teenagers whispering that a bomb would explode and that they should leave quickly. Governor Banyat Chanthasena, who visited the injured in hospital, told reporters that the blast was intended to disrupt the city's festival. He said he had earlier told the police to step up security checks on Saturday night, the last day of the event. But thorough checks were not possible because more than 20,000 people attended. By late last night, no separatist group had claimed responsibility for the blast. Col. Phongsak Ekbarinasing, deputy commander of Task Force 43, said he believed the incident was not perpetrated by separatists but by some trouble-makers.
