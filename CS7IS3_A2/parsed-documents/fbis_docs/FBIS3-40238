Attempting to convince us that the mission of this newspaper is different from that of a supplement of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, he convinces us even more that, at the present time, the newspaper of the Ministry of Defense is for the personal use of [minister of defense] Zhulali and his staff. It has only words; it lacks logic and lacks the facts and laws which support its reasoning. Reform in the military is essential and all political forces are united in this opinion. But it is abnormal and antidemocratic to give the current government the sole credit in this area. It would be more realistic to concede that the need for reform was conceived during the time of the Nano government and the stability government. Indeed, during the stability government, despite the difficult conditions which the country and the military were experiencing, serious work was done to carry out reform in the area of laws, organization-building, regulations on exercises and preparedness, and living conditions, so people began to say that only the clocks and the officers were working in the country. If you condemn and criticize issues related to reform this does not mean that you are against reform. None of the newspapers attacked the need for reform but only the means, forms, and methods and the violations of the law. There are thousands and thousands of soldiers who can prove that this reform has been carried out on the basis of partisan criteria. It is a bitter reality that the appointment and dismissal of cadres are being carried out on the basis of authorization from Democratic Party cells. It is unfortunate that the current command and control apparatus is completely politicized. This is not only illegal but also very dangerous for the future of the military and of defense. If you claim that everything which has taken place in the army has been achieved during the period of the democratic government (that is, during the Democratic Party's governing), this is an extremely nihilistic and hostile claim. You forget, and not unintentionally, that the basic laws on removing the military from political and party control were passed during the time of the stability government and the technical government. There has been a lot of talk, even by the minister of defense, about the fact that military reform requires a package of laws. Where are the laws besides the law on ranks to which the minister added four perverse, offensive, and illogical articles? Where are the law on social security, the law on labor relations, and the decision on the 42-hour work week? All these are lacking because no one is interested in having the army being directed by these laws and in having a reform carried out with a full juridical platform. Experience and tradition are national resources in the army, just as in any other field. Investments have been made for them and cannot be lightly dismissed. It is not just a matter of economic treatment which leaves much to be desired in the moral sphere or of the melding of generations to conserve and utilize the experience and skills of the elders and to keep the so-called "generation conflict" out of the army. With such a well-thought out and scientific melding, the army would be stronger and the tasks would be carried out with fewer sacrifices. Can it be said that this is good for the army: almost 70 percent of the officer cadres who have attended Tirana University, about 65 percent of the cadres who have attended the Academy of the General Staff, hundreds of skilled specialists and technicians, and about 50 percent of the military with scientific titles and degrees have left the army? New appointments have been made only by order, with authorization. Promotions of two or three levels have been made within four or five months and, what is worse, assignments have been given on the basis of region. We never said that the most inept have been left behind but the inept are in charge. Aren't the following data sufficient proof: about 30 percent of the division commanders are from Kavaje and 40 percent are from Diber and, with some exceptions, their level is below average. This practice of assignment on the basis of region, which has the blessing of Zhulali, has resulted in transfers for no reason at all, unjustified dismissals and appointments. Within a year, four or five division commanders have been transferred and this practice is continuing. Is is normal for a person who studied in more than two university departments and who knows four foreign languages to be replaced as director of intelligence by a person who has only military training, to satisfy the needs of the times? This and other appointments prove that appointments and dismissals have taken place on the basis of the cell system. Without giving exact figures, it is sufficient to mention that the staff which is currently directing this reform considers that only the cadres from Diber, Kukes, and Tropoje are the most trusted. The testing which takes place in the army is only a smokescreen to cover up and justify appointments on the basis of partisan criteria. Isn't it revolting that cadres with truncated military training are assigned to positions and youths who have studied at military schools, the academy, and departments of Tirana University, and who know foreign languages, are out on the streets, selling cigarettes? The Tirana garrison is monopolized by people from Tropoje and Diber. They are occupying positions while talented specialists and soldiers are out in the cold. A short time ago, six newly appointed young cadres in the Academy of the General Staff were dismissed for no reason. These are problems which are reflected in the entire structure of the army. Their results are felt by thousands of officers. However, the accusations of corruption which are being made against the minister of defense continue to be disturbing and should disturb the entire management apparatus of the ministry. The name of the minister is never mentioned alone; it is linked with the names of other cadres from the top military hierarchy. The task which the author of the article in USHTRIA DHE KOHA has taken upon himself is nothing but unjustified servileness. Safet Zhulali has never had the strength and courage to break away from his blind partisan position. During his entire activity with his staff, he has tried to organize and manage his work according to a blue ideology. It would have been to the credit of the newspaper and it would have been courageous of those servile newsmen not to protect corruption but to delve deeply to expose it, regardless of the names, colors [orientations], and positions the people involved might have. So far, they have not said anything about the accusations which have been directed against the minister of defense. This newspaper and its newsmen have not dared to say that the expenditures in the homes of generals currently in the Ministry of Defense are violations of the law. How can this be defended in light of the undeniable fact that $400,000 have not yet been repaid to the Ministry of Defense. Also, a ship with contraband cigarettes set sail for an unspecified destination, by order of the fleet commander. Ships with goods which have not passed through customs have entered Albanian territorial waters and the minister of defense and other high-ranking military officials, whom their newspaper, USHTRIA DHE KOHA, can only defend, have been implicated. Reform is defended by laws, with arguments and facts. Corruption is not defended by writings, by servileness, and by demagoguery. The truth will come out, whether or not Zhulali, his generals, and his servile scribblers want it. Perhaps tomorrow this reform will be analyzed more than it has been analyzed by a major in USHTRIA DHE KOHA and the responsibility and duties will be more extensive. Perhaps tomorrow another Blerim besides Mr. Cela will have the courage to examine corruption to its very core. Then what will be left for the servile journalists? They will continue their work and, if another Zhulali appears, they will continue to do what they have always done. They will continue to fanatically defend the superior who keeps them in their job.
