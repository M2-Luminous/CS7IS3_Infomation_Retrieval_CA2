The teams produced two electric boilers with capacities of 100 and 80 liters. The boilers are useful in the production of silica glue, which requires heating for higher concentration. Silica glue is used in basic materials that go into the production of ceramic moulds and also in textile and paper industries. The teams have also produced a mill for grinding (malachite) which is used in production of ceramic moulds, refractory cement, furnaces, and heat-resistant moulds. The designed production capacity of the mill is 480 kg during a 24-hour operational period. MIO teams in "17 April Factory" have succeeded for the first time in producing induction coil for melting and casting furnaces. This equipment, which is essential in induction furnaces to transform electric power into thermal power, is used in melting such metals as brass and aluminum. The induction coil used to be imported with hard currencies from abroad.
