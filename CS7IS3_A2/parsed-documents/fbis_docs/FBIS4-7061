The so-called Democratic Bloc of the NDF, in a clandestine press conference outside Metro Manila yesterday, said Communist Party founder Jose Ma. Sison and Luis Jalandoni "have forfeited their right" to represent the NDF in the peace talks because they have "subverted the integrity of the NDF." The development was a consequence of the internal squabble that has split the leftist movement since last year. The NDF opposition bloc also said it has disowned the leadership of Jalandoni, Communist Party Chair Armando Liwanag (believed to be the rebel name of Sison), and NDF Chair Manuel Romero. Sol Oriente, spokesperson of the NDF-Democratic Bloc, however, said they are not yet entering into "the fray of the negotiations" between the government and the Sison-Jalandoni group, which she said, was about to "self-destruct" anyway. The NDF opposition bloc said the ongoing peace talks were an "exercise in futility" because of the insincerity of both sides. Oriente said her group emanated from the so-called "Verdaderos" which denounced last year Liwanag's alleged maneuvers in the NDF. She said the group will first consolidate its ranks before coming up with its peace panel within the year. Oriente hinted that government representatives have already approached them. Servando Populo of the NDF-Visayas said that if conditions warranted, they may be amenable to a local venue. "It's actually a secondary issue for us," he said. Populo, a priest who once worked with Jalandoni in the Visayas, said they may open their guerrilla zones to the government panel and give negotiators safe-conduct passes. His group is also entertaining the possibility of a "rotating venue" wherein the government and the NDF will take turns in choosing the site. Oriente said Sison's group has been so preoccupied with acquiring a status of belligerency -- like insisting on a foreign venue and getting a third party observer -- that it failed to bring the negotiations toward the discussion of substantive issues. At the same time, Populo hit the Ramos Administration for its continued "total war policy," arrests of political dissenters, and lack of implementation of real social and economic reforms. In a statement signed by 12 ranking rebel leaders from all over the country, the "NDF opposition" accused the Liwanag camp of rewriting the underground umbrella organization's history by declaring all resolutions of the NDF 1990 Congress non-existent; suspending all national leading bodies and structures; and, usurping the leadership of the NDF. "Objections and protests were severely dealt with through arbitrary ouster and expulsion of leaders and individuals, and disenfranchisement of entire chapters and sections," the statement added. The anti-Sison group is reportedly composed of national council and national executive committee officers, leaders, and mass members of the Christians for National Liberation (CNL); Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan [Union of Nationalist Teachers] (Kaguma); Malayang Samahang Pangkalusugan [Independent Organization for Health] (MSP); Pambansang Katipunan ng Magbubukid [National Union of Farmers] (PKM); Rebolusyonaryong Konseho ng Kilusang Unyon [Revolutionary Council of Union Movement] (RKKU); Moro Revolutionary Organization (MRO); Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan [as published; Independent Movement of New Womanhood] (Makibaka); Kabataang Makabayan [Nationalist Youth] (KM); and the NDF-Visayas, NDF-Mindanao, NDF-Western Europe, and NDF-United States of America. They blamed the Liwanag faction of practically cutting party membership into half because party cadres and members were either sacked or voluntarily left, disillusioned with its "absolutionist and undemocratic leadership." "What Liwanag has today is his party faction masquerading as the NDF," the statement said. The group also denounced the announcement by Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal that a "people's court" has been convened to mete out death penalty to four ranking CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines] leaders accused by Sison as "renegades." They are former NPA [New People's Army] Chief Romulo Kintanar; former CPP Secretary General Ricardo Reyes; former CPP Visayas Commission Chief Arturo Tabara; and, Metro Manila CPP Chief Felimon Lagman. Earlier, Rosal, speaking for the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People' Army, admitted responsibility for the assassination of former NPA leader Leopoldo Mabilangan alias Ka Hector last Easter Sunday.
