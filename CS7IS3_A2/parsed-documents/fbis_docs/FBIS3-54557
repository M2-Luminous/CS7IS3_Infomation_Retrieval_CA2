The differences continue to stall the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinian delegation to the talks, headed by Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO's Economic Department, comprises Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal. The Israeli delegation is headed by Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and comprises Uzi Dayan, political planning director at the Ministry, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry. The two delegations have held four sessions since the Israeli delegation arrived in Cairo. One session took place at Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's residence in the al-Andalus Palace in Heliopolis. Sources from the Palestinian delegation told MENA that the basic points of difference still revolve around the issue of security control over the crossings into Jordan from Jericho and into Egyptian Rafah from the Gaza Strip. Israel rejects a noticeable Palestinian security presence on the King Husayn Bridge--the Allenby Bridge--crossing into Jordan. The same sources said that Israel is demanding its own security presence to observe people traveling to the autonomy region even if Palestinian-Israeli agreement is reached on an Israeli security presence in which Israeli security men are hidden behind a screen and won't be obvious. The same sources noted that the negotiations to have the Israelis accept the symbols of Palestinian sovereignty over the autonomy areas have finally culminated in Israel accepting the Palestinian flag being hoisted over the special crossing for travelers to and from the autonomy region. As for the Jericho region, the same sources clarified that Israel still refuses to hand over power to a Palestinian autonomy to administratively control the areas of Jabal al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis on the River Jordan. It only allows religious control during religious celebrations. Israel also refuses to place the area of Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which falls on the main Jerusalem road, under Palestinian control. The current Palestinian-Israeli round of talks is expected to end at around 1400 today and resume its meetings later in the afternoon. The same Palestinian sources also said in a statement today that the points they will reach agreement on during this round of talks, which is considered an attempt to support the negotiations and propel them forward, will be presented to president 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres during their meeting on Saturday evening in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the international economic forum that starts its meetings there today.
