FR940826-1-00007 FR940826-1-00001 The Prairie Farms witness viewed the 10-cent differential as a ``nuisance'' differential and summarized their opinion in four major points in support of Proposal One: (1) that the proposal is supported by the majority of the dairy industry; (2) the proposal would result in a 10-day earlier announcement of the Class II price along with the Class I price, which would simplify price changes to customers in a more timely manner; (3) that Class I and Class II prices will move in the same direction and at the same magnitude; and (4) that Class II price swings will be more moderate, resulting in more stable consumer prices that hopefully will increase Class II product sales. The witness representing Kroger Company testified to their support for the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, offering that adoption of the proposal will enable processors to intelligently inform their customers of changes in costs for Class I and Class II products simultaneously. This witness similarly expressed concern of a declining Class II products market. In support of the fixed 30-cent differential feature for Class II pricing, the Kroger witness maintained that the value of Class II milk to dairy farmers is greater than the intended target differential of ten cents contained in the current Class II pricing formula. This witness also asserted that it is important to establish a pricing level which recognizes these market realities. He maintained that a 30-cent Class II differential added to the basic formula price recognizes the increased value of Class II milk and establishes a competitive price level for Class II products. The Kroger witness testified that this proposal would, over time, establish revenue neutrality with the current Class II pricing method. The witness for Crowley Foods, testifying in support of the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, voiced identical concerns about Class I and Class II price relationships and went further to mention that the 30-cent fixed differential also offers a happy medium between the price concerns of producers and processors. Additionally, the Crowley Foods witness said that announcing the Class II price an additional ten days in advance of the current Class II price announcement would afford improved promotional planning and ensure that Class II prices move in tandem with fluid prices. Testimony by the witness for Dean Foods offered his organization's support for the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal. The witness representing the CMPC offered testimony in support of Proposal One. However, CMPC sees the need to retain the ``add-back'' feature of Class II milk pricing. Hence, their support as proponents for Proposal Five. The CMPC witness emphasized the role of Class II products in the market place, offering evidence that customers demand the same basic product and equal service levels (and costs) for their Class II milk as with Class I milk. However, this witness testified, the current Class II pricing system does not generate adequate returns to pay for the costs of service so closely associated with Class I. This witness offered evidence in support for a 30-cent differential, indicating it is the minimum justifiable differential level. However, the witness tempered support for this level with concern that in no event should such apparent increase in the Class II differential be permitted to result in no real price increase, hence their support for the fifth proposal for retention of the ``add-back.'' The impetus for retaining the add-back provision offered by the CMPC witness drew from the Recommended Decision of October 31, 1989 (54 FR 33709) that concluded that Class II milk should not be less than the value for Class III milk. Although the CMPC witness acknowledged that a Class II differential increase without an add-back feature would lessen the risk of loss to producers, they continue to assert that the add-back provision provides the necessary guaranty against such loss. The brief filed by CMPC elaborated further on their support for retention of the add-back provision. In their view, the add-back provides the month-to-month guaranty against lost revenue to producers. This is necessary to retain, stated the CMPC brief, because producer and handler prices are computed on a month-to month basis and not on the basis of annual, or three year or six year average prices. Support for Proposal One was offered in a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Foods Group, Inc. (SFG), and Anderson-Erickson Dairy Company (AE). The SFG owns and operates six fluid processing plants in Texas and Louisiana and processes Class II products. The AE operates a fluid processing plant and an ice cream plant in Des Moines, Iowa. In the opinion of SFG/AE, only Proposal One provides the changes necessary to correct the problems currently associated with Class II milk pricing. The SFG/AE brief points to producer and handler agreement that Class II pricing needs to move in the same direction and at the same rate as Class I prices and that advance pricing of Class II milk is critical to the ability of the industry to sell finished Class II products. They also point out that there is universal agreement that the existing Class II price formula is unacceptable and that Class II pricing should be based on the Minnesota&hyph;Wisconsin (M&hyph;W) price series. On the basis of the record, the SFG/AE concludes that the Class II price must be based on the second prior month's M&hyph;W plus a differential of not more than thirty cents without an add-back. Testimony offered in support of Proposal Two, which would establish the Class II price as the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.10 and have this price announced by the fifth day of the preceding month, was received from: a. The proponent, Friendship Dairies, Inc.; b. Kraft General Foods, a large handler of producer milk that operates plants that process Class II and Class III products in many states; and c. Galloway Company, a regulated handler under Federal Order 30 that primarily produces sweetened condensed milk, and ice cream mixes. The proponent witness representing Friendship Dairies, Inc., offered testimony on the need for the Class II differential to be set at ten cents, and for the ``add-back'' provision of current Class II milk pricing to be eliminated. The testimony offered in support of their proposal rested largely on prior decisions issued by the Department which had determined that ten cents above the basic formula price was the appropriate price (differential) level for Class II milk. Additionally, this proponent witness agreed with other testimony that eliminating the Class II product price formula and using the second preceding month's basic formula price would more accurately reflect the true direction or magnitude in the movement of the Class III price and simplify the pricing of Class II milk. This witness emphasized that this distortion was most attributable to the ``add-back'' provision.
