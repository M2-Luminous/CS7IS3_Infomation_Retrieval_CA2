['Arafat] Thank you. I am very glad I can talk from this radio and from this Algerian information rostrum which, I can still remember, afforded me the first opportunity to give an interview to EL MOUDJAHID before I was elected as chairman of the PLO. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In an interview we had with you two years ago in Tunis, we asked you about the future of the Palestinian-Israeli talks, and your answer came in the form of a disapproving question [as heard], so what has changed in your stance? ['Arafat] We now say (?yes), because what is happening now is based on the first recognition of the Palestinian people. In the past, they wanted to recognize neither the Palestinian people nor the PLO, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. They wanted to give us autonomy, autonomy [word repeated in English]. Full stop. Autonomy to the inhabitants, not to the land. But now, the decision is the withdrawal -- when we say Gaza and Jericho first, this means the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the first Palestinian land, so that it becomes a Palestinian liberated land and the Palestinian liberated flag is hoisted over this free Palestinian land for the first time in this century. Yes, we still have big problems facing us. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. President, the Palestinian authority will be organizing elections. Do you expect participation by the opposition, and do you expect victory in these elections? ['Arafat] In reality, according to what was conveyed to me, my brothers in the opposition -- I cherish this Palestinian opposition [pauses] we are a democratic movement, a democratic scene; as Voltaire said: I might disagree with you, but I am prepared to fight for your freedom of opinion. Our constitution, which we announced in Algiers, provides for the majority to respect the view of the minority, and the minority to follow the decision of the majority. The opposition have let us know, in the talks we have had with them, that they will be taking part in the coming elections. This is official. Bu at the same time, we ask them to come and participate with us from now, because this is the homeland of all, and let everybody build. They should not leave us for ourselves now, and come only when the food is cooked. I have the right to ask them to start building now. Let us build together. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You have mentioned in one of your statements the issue of jihad, a word which aroused a strong reaction in Israeli spheres. How will you deal with the conditions on relinquishing the armed action? ['Arafat] If people think that we are going for a leisurely walk [words indistinct]. I know that we are not going for a leisurely walk. You should know that every day we have a problem. Are you following me? What could one say? Every day we have a problem. Every day we have an issue over which we disagree. We know that we are not going for a leisurely walk. Did you forget the first and second Evian treaties in Algeria? We have the same story. [passage omitted] There are secret organizations within the Israeli Armed Forces which collaborate with the settlers, just like what happened to you in Algeria. Our situation is similar to yours. Yes, we do have problems, and those who think that we are going for a leisurely walk, let them know that we are not. Is this homeland not worth suffering for? We have paid the price of peace with our blood. Our leaders have been assassinated. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. President, the last question. The subject of Jerusalem is one of the challenges facing the negotiations in the future. How do you see this subject? ['Arafat] [passage omitted] The Israeli ruler must understand one thing: That sacred Palestine, Arab Palestine was occupied in 1967 and in accordance with Resolution 242, Jerusalem, Arab Jerusalem, is part of the Arab and Palestinian territories which were occupied in 1967. The basis from which we have proceeded in Madrid, Oslo, and Cairo is Resolutions 242 and 338, namely the lands which were occupied in 1967 including holy Jerusalem, Arab Jerusalem. Even the governments closest to them and their strategic ally the United States of America did not accept the decision that Israel should include Palestine's eternal capital. The capital of Arab Palestine is the capital of the state of Palestine. The battle is for it. We know that there are Israeli attempts to bring about demographic change. I say to my brother Arabs, Muslims and Christians: Jerusalem is not my Jerusalem, it is also your Jerusalem. Thank you.
