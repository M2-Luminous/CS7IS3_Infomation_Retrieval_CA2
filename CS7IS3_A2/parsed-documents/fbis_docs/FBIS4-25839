Its terrain is mountainous and covered with thousands of steep ridges and peaks. The area was formerly an impoverished county, severed from the rest of the country by its poor transportation conditions, lack of resources, thin layer of soil over its rocky fields, and with water as costly as oil. In the wake of reform and opening up, Linzhou people have brought forth their past "Red Flag Canal" spirit, and scored new accomplishments under the leadership of party organizations at various levels. At the end of 1993, the city's gross output value was 4.89 billion yuan and its financial revenue ranked among the advanced in Henan; a favorable balance in savings deposits of urban and rural residents was 2.77 billion yuan, topped the whole province. The city's comprehensive purchasing power jumped from 44th place in 1990 to 12th in the province. In their march to mount a new economic plane and achieve comparatively well-to-do living standards, Linzhou City has persisted in "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both," reaping a bumper harvest in building both material and spiritual civilizations. The running water in the Red Flag Canal clearly reflects the new image of the Linzhou people devoting themselves without reservation to accomplishing the task, making efforts to progress, and being prosperous and civilized in the 1990's. Never Give Up the Soul of the Nation Talking about Linzhou people, we naturally associate them with the Red Flag Canal, which is their pride and joy and an immortal monument. It was in the three years of natural disasters during the 1960's, under the circumstances whereby the 200,000 residents of the locality were allowed a daily ration of only 300 grams of grain, using the strength of carrying poles and their own bare hands, they leveled out 1,250 hills, built 157 aqueducts, dug 21 tunnels, and completed an artificial canal, the Red Flag Canal, which was 1,500 km long. This tied a silvery ribbon around the waist of Mount Taihang, bringing in the waters of the Zhang He. Linzhou people in the 1990's have become well-off and their concepts have been rethought. Confronted with the current of reform and opening up and the pounding from the commodity economy, does the past pioneering spirit of hard work with perseverance continue to shine along the Red Flag Canal? Mao Wanchun, Linzhou City CPC Committee secretary told this reporter: "The Red Flag Canal spirit is a tremendous source of wealth for us. We must bring forth the pioneering spirit of hard work with perseverance to strive for a new `Red Flag Canal' project for construction, reform, opening up, and economic development." Anyang Dafang Ceramic Company Ltd., was the first joint-venture with Chinese and foreign investment in this small city and there was a very heartwarming story in the course of its development. On 18 June 1993, a team of Italian experts involved in the joint-venture arrived in Linzhou to install equipment, making slight of the long journey. When they saw that two presses, each weighing 50 tonne and 6m in height were still to be positioned, they asked the factory to order the services of a 70-tonne crane. There were no 70-tonne cranes in Linzhou, not even in the Anyang areas. When the factory director Hou Yonghe told the Italian team that he had decided to position the machines using manpower, an Italian expert said bluntly: "The conditions for installing the machines basically do not exist in this place; the positioning will take a very long time. We will return to Italy first and come back again in six months time to install them." With these words, they went straight back to the guest house. To win time, Hou Yonghe followed them to the guest house, and explained to them the possibility of positioning the equipment by manpower; however, the foreign experts shook their heads, because never in their lives had they witnessed such an action and they had been to every part of the world. At last, Hou Yonghe entreated; "Please give me three days; if we fail to position the presses by the end of three days, I will personally see you off at the Zhengzhou Airport!" The foreign experts laughed at this, and the team leader said: "Three days, Mr. Hou? I don't think it possible even if you have 10 days! If you succeed in positioning them in three days, I will give you a $1,000 reward to show my appreciation!" Although time was won, the director's heart was heavy. There was no retreat, they had to cross the Rubicon; it was time to test the Chinese will. A crack team comprising more than 20 workers was formed. They borrowed six 50-tonne screw jacks, four 20-tonne pulleys, and 200 railway sleepers from another factory. Thus, the 50-tonne equipment was moved upward inch by inch, and forward millimeter by millimeter. It took them 38 hours to fulfill the task; none of the workers left the work site, and the factory director did not shut his eyes for a wink of sleep; consequently, the two mammoths were positioned, the whole process was likened to "ants gnawing at a bone." At the guest house, the interpreter repeated the message twice, but the Italian experts remained doubtful. It was not until they arrived at the work site in the workshop, when Mr. Piarener, the technological executive witnessed the result with his own eyes, that he suddenly hugged Hou Yonghe, and said with admiration: "That is unbelievable, really unbelievable! Linzhou people are swell!" The Italian experts were totally convinced and promptly contacted their general executive and the decision was made to invest more in Linzhou to build a second and third production line. Today, the pioneering spirit of hard work is often thought and talked about among Linzhou's cadres and masses; furthermore, new essences of the spirit are found through constantly talking about it. Hou Yonghe said: "Through practice in running a joint-venture with Italian investment, we have come to a profound understanding that the pioneering spirit of hard work hard with perseverance is also in the investment climate." Wang Fasui, party branch secretary of Yaochun Town's Shijiahe village, said: "The pioneering spirit of hard work with perseverance we refer to today is not confined to living a frugal life and being willing to contribute one's greatest efforts to work; the more important point is a spirit of "dauntless persistency," being bold in blazing new trail, developing an undertaking, working with perseverance, and making progress in a scientific way." On five occasions, Henan Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun has been to Linzhou to conduct surveys and summarize experiences. He said: "The pioneering spirit Linzhou people shaped in the course of building the Red Flag Canal, being continuously enriched in the period of reform and opening up, embodies the combination of our fine national spirit and the modern idea of reform and opening up and making concrete the great pioneering spirit of the new period advocated by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; it is the crystallization of the national soul of the Chinese nation." Use the Best "Steel" To Make the Knife's Edge In the past, Linxian was synonymous of poverty and backwardness but, with today's economic development, Linzhou's financial "cake" has become ever larger; consequently, the purses of ordinary people have become fatter with each passing day. When they briefed visitors in tunr on the splendid accomplishments of the Red Flag Canal, they were proud of the fact that the favorable balance in savings deposits of Linzhou residents topped the province. It is true that poverty does not spell socialism. The more precious is the fact that as Linzhou people advance on the path to becoming comparatively well-off and prosperous, their fine tradition of being diligent and thrifty and working hard with perseverance has been sustained; they are spending the precious wealth they have created through their own diligence on those projects whereby a whole generation or several generations will benefit. Members of Linzhou City's leading bodies at various levels took the lead in sharing and paying for their meals with the masses in their homes. People from Shijiahe village who became well-off have all moved into rows of country-villa-style two-story houses. They have digital telephones and closed-circuit television installed in addition to a central water supply and their children are entitled to free nine-year compulsory education. It is a billion-yuan village and is famous far and wide. However, in this very same billion-yuan village, there are only four cars, all public owned and used exclusively to receive or send off experts and professors or other guests invited to the village. When village-run factory directors are on an errand, they take the bus to Anyang and then take a train. When they were out of town on errands, almost every one would take pancakes and noodles for meals, and book the cheapest hotel rooms which charge under 20 yuan. Dingjiao Village ranks sixth in Henan's economic construction at village level and is one of Linzhou's richest villages. Here, when young people get married, the popular way of celebration is "eating from the same big pot." On a wedding day, one huge pot is used to prepare steamed rolls and rice, with another huge pot used to cook vermicelli, meat, bean curd, and vegetables. Together with the guests, mostly neighbors, the bridegroom and bride of the day will be given a bowl of rice or steamed rolls along with a bowl of the hotchpotch, it is simple but lively and exciting. Li Chunsheng, the village party branch deputy secretary said: "It isn't that we cannot afford it but we just do not go in for ostentation and extravagance. It is not our way. Now that we are well-off, we have not become extravagant in our weddings or funerals." Linzhou people who take the long-term view, think not only of themselves but of others since they became well-off. Their focus of attention is placed not only on the present but more on the future. Regarding some social welfare undertakings and matters involving long-range interests, people in the hometown of the Red Flag Canal have always shown an easy generosity. In Linzhou, there are far too many examples of ordinary people and incidents of donating funds or making investment in running educational undertakings. Perhaps the statement by Li Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village CPC Committee branch secretary summarizes the idea they share: "Should we farmers, who cannot possibly clear all the mud from ourselves, want to become rich and be so forever, we must rely on talented people." Elderly Song Qisheng of Chengguan Town's Beiguan village, donated the bulk of his 300,000-yuan lifetime savings, as his old age actually approached, to build a three-story school building with a floor space of 1,400 square m, which he personally designed and oversaw its construction. He left it to the small mountain village which had nurtured him before he passed away. This "Qisheng School Building" now has some 650 county children in 10 classes. At Linzhou City Educational Commission, this reporter learned that, by the end of 1993, the city had collected 220 million yuan in educational funds, of which 150 million yuan came from voluntary donations from society and the masses; 718 persons made donations ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan, 82 persons donated over 10,000 yuan, and the highest donation was 490,000 yuan. Covering the various villages in Linzhou, this reporter found that the best buildings were the schools. According to a briefing, some 440 brand-new schools have built here; consequently, entrance examinations for high school enrollment were abolished. The school building in Hejian Town's Beixiaozhuang enjoys a reputation as "the Presidential House" because of its most up to date design. Some 96 pupils from Linzhou First Primary School were awarded with national prizes in the "National Olympic in Mathematics for Primary School Pupils." Su Qishu told this reporter: "Presently our city is building a school for the deaf and dumb, so that the handicapped can receive a regular education. Although the city finances are not sufficiently ample, the city would rather be thrifty in other areas than spare money on education; we want to use the best steel to make the knife's edge." Writing a New Chapter on Common Prosperity In front of the Dingjiao Industrial General Company's office building in Dingjiao village, Yaochun Town, Linzhou City stands a quasi-bronze statue of an ox willingly serving the masses; it is bending its back as it forges ahead and is a magnificent piece. Li Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village general party branch secretary, concurrently Dingjiao Industrial Group General Company manager said: "There is some foundation to our economic development but we must continue to work hard. We communists just follow the example of the ox in guiding the masses to advance toward common prosperity. Because a number of such willing and had-working people have persisted in a correct orientation, Linzhou is taking a broad avenue toward common prosperity in building a new order for the socialist market economy today. In the vanguard marching along this avenue, communists have composed a symphony about working hard with perseverance, always being ready to devote themselves, and cherishing and working for the people through their actions. Shibanyan used to be the remotest and most backward township, located at the highest altitude above sea level in Linzhou. A folk song has it: "Rocks on the road are as large as oxen; mountain floods have left gullies everywhere; people worry while riding bicycles or traveling on foot; and the most dreadful thing is the meeting of two cars going in opposite directions." Because of its natural conditions, when 10,000-yuan households, billion-yuan villages, and star towns surfaced among people in other localities down the mountain, the masses here could only just manage to have sufficient food and clothing. Yhe Linzhou party organization did not put Shibanyan Township out of its mind. In 1992, the city party committee organized an effective leading body for the township; again, in 1993, the township was opened up as the city's special experimental zone for economic development, while allowing it various preferential policies and giving the green light to Shibanyan's economic development. When this reporter arrived in the township on a rainy day, he saw the roads here had been widened, with electric wires and telephone lines installed; enterprises in townships and towns along with the tourist industry were on the rise; 16 enterprises from Hong Kong, Zhengzhou, and Anyang came to this "most exciting place" and to date 15 million yuan in investment funds have been received. Today, Shibanyan is gradually being reinvigorated in its takeoff. In Linzhou's villages, which have became prosperous one after another, the communists there always have the masses and collectives in mind and they are doing their best to fulfill their communist duties, portraying a new generation of Linzhou heroes. Wang Fasui, Shijiahe village party branch general secretary, concurrently general manager of Shijiahe Enterprise Group General Company, together th his partners was entitled to receive a percentage of the profits of 1.27 million yuan when the first round of contracted projects was completed. Should they keep the money to themselves or invest it as a collective accumulation in reproduction? Wang said: "It would be telling a lie to say that the huge sum did not move us. However, we communists should have loftier ideals. The enterprises in the village have only just started and we communists should not think only of our own personal gain. The more important point is to lead the masses to work hard to make progress and realize common prosperity." In the end, Wang Fasui convinced his partners and resolutely donated the whole sum to the village. In his briefing, Di Jianzhou, Yaochun Township party committee secretary said that Li Jingyuan, a party member from Lijiagang Village started building a casting workshop after his demobilization from active service and was capable of making a profit of 100,000 yuan each year. In 1991, the villagers unanimously elected him village party branch secretary, with an annual wage of only 6,000 yuan. Put to the test of money and interest, Li Jingyuan said: "Despite the fact that I personally have become well-off, the villagers have not. The masses have faith in us communists. Under such circumstances, we must guide the masses to eradicate poverty and forge ahead to become comparatively well-off." Today, 80 percent of peasants in Lijiagang are living in two-story houses, every villager is exempted from various charges, and Lijiagang has become the third "wealthy household" among the town's some 50 administrative villages. It is precisely because there are hundreds of fine elements like Wang Fasui and Li Jingyuan that Linzhou, the brilliant star of building the material and spiritual civilizations, has risen over the Central China Plain. The responsible persons from the province's 17 prefectures and cities, county party committee secretaries from its 118 counties, and 2,500 party branch secretaries from impoverished villages have all visited Linzhou. Since the second half of 1993, they have arrived in Linzhou in turn to be baptized by the Red Flag Canal spirit. The reinvigoration of a city and an area is not all the Linzhou people are after and it is their wish that everyone will become well-off. Mount Taihang has endowed Linzhou people with the boldness of vision and the courage to overcome difficulties and the Red Flag Canal water has nurtured their pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance. Linzhou, the pearl of Taihang, will become even more splendid in the future.
