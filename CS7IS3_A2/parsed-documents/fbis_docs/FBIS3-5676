Speaking to reporters in the ministry after attending the weekly cabinet meeting today, he said the British step is a good sign, but the government decided not to lift the ban on awarding new government contracts to British companies. Britain is Malaysia's traditional arms supplier, particularly main defense systems and equipment such as warships and aircraft. Since 1988, Malaysia has bought defense systems and arms worth over 4 billion ringgit from Britain, while two huge military projects involving British companies have yet to start.
