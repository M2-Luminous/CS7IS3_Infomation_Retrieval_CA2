The Tuol Kork community dike clinic opened its doors to the public in June of this year and is a joint project between Phnom Penh, the World Health Organization and British Volunteer Service Overseas. It is the first step in an attempt to monitor and research the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV among prostitutes and their clients. Although the clinic cannot do HIV tests, Dr. Ouk is qualified to do pretest counseling and refer patients to the Pasteur Institute for testing. She has already nine patients inquire about HIV tests, but after pre-test counseling, only four of them decided to go through with the test. "Many are afraid to know the result, because they think they will have to change their lifestyle," Dr. Ouk says. "I say that it is good for them to know that they are HIV positive because then they can look after themselves, have good eating habits, good work, good hygiene of the body, good exercise, and not have sex any more without condoms. "I tell them they will need some people to support them when they get AIDS and if there is ever some drug, they will know very soon and can cure themselves." Last month, Dr. Ouk and her male colleague saw 193 patients (more than 25 percent of them commercial sex workers) and treated 102 sexually transmitted diseases. The examination room is sparsely furnished with a sink, table, a few chairs and an examination bench. A worn microscope rests on a bench near the window from where one gets a view of the marshy dike and thatch-roofed local houses. "They come here because they are afraid of HIV, because they sometimes tear their condom and because they didn't know about HIV, so they didn't use condoms ... they don't give them education about HIV, they look so sad," she said. "Our biggest problem is gonorrhea, but I can't tell you about HIV or syphilis because we don't do the blood tests here, only refer them." Dr. Ouk claims ignorance is the biggest barrier to combatting AIDS in Cambodia. She tells a story of a man who is believed to be peddling a bogus inoculation against AIDS and STD in the Tuol Kork brothel strip. She has heard it's 10,000 riel a shot and would-be buyers are told they must have one every month. Even the brothel owners tell me, "we never saw AIDS here, what does AIDS mean?" she says. They don't understand HIV because they can't see any symptoms, she adds. About 1,000 prostitues work from wooden shacks along the Tuol Kork strip, many of them are ethnic Vietnamese, but the Cambodians are well represented as are half Khmer-Vietnamese. "Before the election many went back to Vietnam, but after that they came back with many of their relatives," she said. "The youngest I met was 14, but most are 16 years old." "They are usually from poor families, sometimes they have a broken heart, sometimes their family sells them." She says it is usually the mother who brings the girl in for sale and a lot end up paying off their parents' gambling debts. "They think if they are rich and they have enough money they will go back and married to a good man. If they have gold and good clothes it will be easy to find a man to marry when they go back." If a prostitute gets pregnant, her brothel usually arranges an abortion for her. A girl fetches her highest price for her virginity. According to Dr. Ouk, it's an Asian belief that oral sex with a virgin will improve the health of old men and increase longevity, and the new rich Khmers are joining visiting Hong Kong and Singaporean businessmen in bidding for young girls -- the going rate is $800 a week which is split between the girl's family and the broker who procures the virgin. The customers are always over 40 years old, Dr. Ouk says. Local Cambodian men claim virgins can be bought for $300 to $400 if you know how to cut out the middle man. Dr. Ouk says a girl will usually spend a week with the man who buys her virginity and after that will start to earn around $100 a time for the next month as she's still "fresh". Subsequent months she will earn around $20 a time if she stays in a dancing hall, but most of the girls in Tuol Kork earn between $2 and $4 a customer. The one-time fee decreases with time and wear and tear. "The average number of clients for the girl per day is five to six, but some of them get ten every day -- she is the pretty girl," Dr. Ouk says. "The pretty girl can get a high price and many clients." One afternoon a week, brothel owners and prostitutes are invited for health education sessions at the clinic, but to date attendances are low. Dr. Ouk is concerned that HIV will quickly spread throughout the whole country as the prostitutes are a transient population and usually come in from the provinces to work in the city for a year before returning to their home district. She believes 95 percent of Cambodian males visit a brothel at least once in their lives. It is an acceptable part of Cambodian culture. Last week she treated a 16 year-old boy for gonorrhea. The Tuol Kork community dike clinic is open four mornings a week from 0800 to 1100.
