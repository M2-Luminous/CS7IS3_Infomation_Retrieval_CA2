FR940926-2-00082 FR940926-2-00070 OMB then revised the policy with respect to educational institutions. In 1982, Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' was revised to allow interest for both buildings and equipment (47 FR 33658, August 3, 1982). OMB has since revisited the policy with respect to State and local governments. In 1988 and 1993, OMB proposed to revise Circular A&hyph;87 to allow interest on equipment, as well as on buildings (53 FR 40352, October 14, 1988; 58 FR 44212, August 19, 1993). OMB expects to issue a notice shortly that would make final revisions to Circular A&hyph;87. OMB is now proposing to change the policy with respect to non-profit organizations. In this notice, OMB proposes to revise Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' so that interest would be allowed for both buildings and equipment. Based on OMB's experience under the three cost principles circulars, OMB believes that the proposal would result in lower costs to the Federal Government. In addition, this proposal would result in greater consistency on the allowability of interest across the three cost principles circulars. During the last few years, OMB has received a number of requests for waivers from Circular A&hyph;122's prohibition on the allowability of interest. As a result of reviewing the individual waiver requests, and based on the general experience gained under Circulars A&hyph;87, A&hyph;21, and A&hyph;122, OMB believes that allowing interest should encourage non-profit organizations to purchase rather than lease facilities in those situations where purchasing would result in lower costs than leasing. Consequently, OMB has decided to propose revising Circular A&hyph;122's interest policy. This proposed revision to Circular A&hyph;122 would establish four criteria that must be met for interest to be an allowable cost. These criteria are intended to encourage decisions beneficial to the non-profit organization and the Federal Government. First, the non-profit organization must perform a lease/purchase analysis which shows that purchasing through debt financing is less costly to the Federal Government than leasing. Second, financing is provided at an interest rate no higher than the fair market rate. Third, investment earnings are used to offset allowable interest cost. Fourth, when it is expected that the Federal Government will reimburse 51 percent or more of an asset's cost, the non-profit organization must demonstrate the need for the asset in the conduct of federally sponsored activities. The fourth criterion is in addition to that which applies to State and local governments (Circular A&hyph;87) and educational institutions (Circular A&hyph;21). OMB believes that the first and fourth criteria are especially important in the context of grants to non-profit organizations. As a general rule, the Federal Government contributes a small share of the costs of assets purchased by State and local governments and educational institutions. Since those entities must themselves fund the majority of the costs associated with acquiring an asset, they have an incentive to make the most economical lease/purchase decision. In contrast, for non-profit organizations covered by Circular A&hyph;122, the Federal share of costs is often substantial. Since this greater Federal share could decrease the incentive for non-profit organizations to make the most economical lease/purchase decisions, these additional criteria are designed to ensure that a non-profit's decision to purchase rather than lease is based on an assessment of the relative costs of leasing versus purchasing, and a demonstrated need for the asset (where the Federal Government will reimburse over half the asset's cost). The revised policy would apply only to assets acquired after its final issuance. OMB requests comments on all aspects of this proposal. John B. Arthur, Associate Director for Administration.
