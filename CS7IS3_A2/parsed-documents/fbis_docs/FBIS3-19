FBIS3-19 "cr00000012894001" 10 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-032--EGYPT EGYPT: POLITICAL ISLAM REVIEW, NO. 4 The following is the fourth of a series of editorial reports on political Islam in Egypt. These reports include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews, commentaries and other islamic affairs items that were published in the Cairo Arabic-language weeklies 'AQIDATI, AL-NUR, AL-SHA'B, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH. This review covers the "January 1994" issue of AL-NUR, indicating that the paper is apparently now published monthly, rather than weekly, as only this and the Muslim Hegira date of 23 Rajab 1414 appear on the front page. Contents of this issue include the following: Saudi Shura Council Opening Highlighted Anti-Islamic Claims Against Ministry Upheld News in Brief Islamic Insurance Rules Discussed Certifying Islamic Interpreters Death for Apostates Dictated by Islam Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended Islamic "Subversives" Beware Saudi Shura Council Opening Highlighted AL-NUR Board of Directors Chairman al-Hamzah Di'bis wrote, in a lengthy factual two-page report, about the inauguration of the Shura Council in Saudi Arabia to which he was invited. His report described the scene and covered the speeches delivered by the chairman of the Shura Council and the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. Anti-Islamic Claims Against Ministry Upheld Reporters Muhammad Hilmi and Ahmad Mustafa underscored views of a number of ulema, supporting the "serious charges" leveled by People's Assembly member Jalal Gharib 25 December against the minister of culture that the ministry, through its publications and cultural functions, "encourages deviation and spreads anarchy and vice in Islamic society." News in Brief The General Assembly of the General Federation of Doctors "has strongly rejected, for the third time, invitations by the Israeli Health Ministry and Ben-Gurion University to conduct joint medical research."

The society provides them with clothing, daily meals, and allows them to stay in the center, which is supplied with modern equipment." (page 8) Islamic Insurance Rules Discussed Dr. 'Abd-al-Muttalib 'Abduh, head of the Statistics and Insurance Branch at the al-Azhar University's College of Commerce, was interviewed, discussing shari'ah rules on contemporary insurance systems, including commercial, cooperative, life, and social insurance. He noted that several Islamic conferences on insurance were held and that they all ended with recommendations, but no decisions. Certifying Islamic Interpreters Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, professor of jurisprudence at al-Azhar University, was interviewed, explaining the qualifications needed for someone to interpret the teachings of Islam. He pointed out that individual interpretation of Islam by qualified and highly educated people will remain open "as long as there is life to prove to the world that the Islamic shari'ah is suitable for all times and places and is consistent with the time in which we live." Death for Apostates Dictated in Islam Writer Hasan Mahmud Khalil, speaking on the issues of death sentences for apostates (hadd al-riddah) and religious freedom, argued with those who claim that there is nothing called a death sentence on apostates because there is no verse in the Koran that calls for punishing a Muslim apostate on earth and that this contradicts religious freedom. He noted that while it is not mentioned in the Koran, it is mentioned in the Sunnah (prophetic sayings) and the Sunnah, he said, is the second source of legislation and Islam after the Koran. He added that Sunnah contains various religious legal rulings. There was a Sunnah that confirmed what is contained in the Koran and another that explained the Koran. He further explained that "Islam protects rights and freedoms, and the first of these freedoms is the freedom of belief and expression. No one is forced to abandon or change his religion. A person can choose which religion to believe and accept, but if he adopts Islam willingly, he accepts its rules and submits to its obligations. He will be asked about every shortcoming." Khalil also said that "the punishment for apostasy was legalized to safeguard religion, ensure its course, deter those who wish to enter Islam to achieve certain purposes and then return to their infidelity, and purge society of such hypocrites and exploiters of religion." He concluded that apostates are more dangerous to Islam than non-Muslims because they distort religion and deceive many people who are not familiar with Islam." Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended Writer Muntasir al-Zayyat argued, in an article entitled "Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman; The Other Side," that Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman is being held in the United States on political rather than legal grounds. He said that the indictment issued by the federal court in New York in the case of the World Trade Center explosion on 4 September did not include the name of Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, although much media clamor was raised at the time. This, al-Zayyat said, "opens the way for his possible release soon." Al-Zayyat then recalled that the U.S. Administration several months ago wanted Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to leave the country, saying that his entry into the United States was improper. Describing this as "ridiculous" and "surprising," he said that if Shaykh 'Umar's entry visa, which he received in Khartoum, was wrong, then why did no one find fault with his previous 1985 and 1987 entries to the United States? He further argued that the U.S. Administration wanted to get Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman out and could not explicitly express that; therefore, it said that he violated immigration laws and began looking for a country to take him. The problem became more complicated, al-Zayyat said, when the Egyptian Government asked for his extradition and the prime minister of Afghanistan agreed to receive him. This was unacceptable to the U.S. Administration, he said, adding that the day when 'Abd-al-Rahman's lawyer officially requested that the shaykh be allowed to leave for Kabul, he was officially charged to prevent him from traveling there. "Therefore, the problem is not governed by legal considerations, but political. If Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman was treated according to law, he would always emerge victorious." The writer then tried to shed more light on the "critical and fabricated problem" of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman. He said: "The man has always paid for his daring beliefs and views." His freedom has been restricted since the death of former President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, when he called from the pulpit that no prayers should be made for President 'Abd-al-Nasir. Al-Zayyat then reviewed Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's struggle for his beliefs in Egypt since that time, noting that he was subjected to ugly" torture during his imprisonment from 1981 to 1984 and was insulted and defamed by "all the media." The writer added that when he left prison, he was strong and continued to adhere to his beliefs and call for the application of the shari'ah. He was threatened by former Interior Ministers Zaki Badr and 'Abd-al-Halim Musa and, as a result, left Egypt and has not since returned. In further defense of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the writer said: "In the case of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the law worked in his favor. However, the law now is not respected in Egypt by those who make it. The problem is being tackled on a political basis, and the political situation today is hostile to Shaykh 'Umar and all those who follow in his footsteps." Al-Zayyat continued: "The proceedings for the trial of Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman are being resumed in al-Fayyum at a time when such measures were suspended in New York. It is Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al- Rahman's fate to pay the price for his adherence to his beliefs and his Islamic call." Islamic "Subversives" Beware Dr. Sa'd al-Hilwani, history lecturer at the al-Azhar University's Arabic language college, warned of attempts by subversive elements to undermine the Muslim religion. He also warned against moral and religious degeneration as a result of immoral literature, referring in this regard to the question submitted by Jalal Gharib, an independent deputy of the People's Assembly, to the minister of culture on the issue.
