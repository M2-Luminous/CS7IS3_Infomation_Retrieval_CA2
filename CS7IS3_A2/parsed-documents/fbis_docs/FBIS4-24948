The Russian-built Tupolev-154 plane bound for the southern city of Guangzhou crashed some eight minutes after taking off at 8:20 A.M. Local time, said an official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). According to officials from the Xian emergency center, by noon some 50 to 60 bodies had been pulled from the wreckage and "there was little hope for more survivors." So far one survivor has been found and is in critical condition, the official said. Searchers have also identified one passenger as a "European." The officials refused to speculate on the cause of the crash and said there was no evidence of an explosion. Flight WH 2303 carried 13 crew members and 146 passengers, with at least four of the passengers being foreigners, the CAAC official said. In 1993, five airplanes crashed in China killing 76 people, and eight planes were hijacked. The crash Monday was the first in China this year. CAAC replaced its director in January due to the poor safety record of China's airline companies. Xian's new airport was built in 1991 and is located some 50 kilometers northwest of the city, which is a popular tourist destination. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials in Tokyo said there were apparently no Japanese passengers among the 159 people aboard the Chinese Northwest Airlines plane which crashed Monday morning in Xian. According to reports reaching the Japanese Embassy in China and the Japanese Consulate General in Guangzhou, there were no names that appeared to be Japanese on the list of passengers, the officials said. But since some Japanese and Chinese names are similar, the embassy is still trying to confirm whether there were actually no Japanese aboard, they said.
