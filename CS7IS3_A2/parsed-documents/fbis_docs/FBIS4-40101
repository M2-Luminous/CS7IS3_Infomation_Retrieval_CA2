It is feasible that the country may either enter a state of chaos and disintegration, become a police state, or emerge as a real federation with developed local self-government. I am convinced that federalism today is the only means of preserving a stable political regime and state unity. That is why it is so important to formulate a state regional policy. Its main objectives should be to even out the position of citizens in all regions, guarantee human rights and citizens' rights, and protect the territorial integrity and unity of the economic area. The main conflict within the Russian Federation's state system resides in the existence of ethnic and territorial models for the organization of authority in the regions. There is real asymmetry within the federation, and equalizing the status of oblasts and kray to the level of republics within the Russian Federation means considerably relieving this asymmetry. But the conflict between the ethnic and territorial models will take its toll on the Russian state system for a long time to come. Contrary to the assessments being heard today, Russia is a federation based not on a treaty but a constitution. At the same time Articles 11 and 78 of the Russian Federation Constitution enable the diversity of the state's regions to be preserved while the Federation Treaty is an instrument of the law in force. However, the treaty-based form of delimiting authority between organs of federal power and Federation components may be used with regard to republics that have not signed the Federation Treaty. The constitutional norms regulating the demarcation of powers are primarily imperfect in that the legislature and judiciary are excluded from this process. This has led to the government and other executive organs virtually having a monopoly on deciding the substance of national policy. There is another problem in relations between the center and the regions: Federation components received the right to legislate and are making vigorous use thereof. At the moment one is not conscious of pressure from local legislation, but there is a threat of unified legal standards becoming weakened. It is absolutely essential that the federal parliament retains its unsurpassable initiative in respect of the fundamentals of legislation. "Model" legislation is needed -- standard acts which are generally borrowed by republic parliaments and kray and oblast legislative assemblies. What is more, the Law on the Constitutional Court must finally undergo a second reading because the federal executive and legislature do not have the authority to abrogate acts adopted by Federation components. It is the Constitutional Court that can determine the framework of the treaty process governing the mutual delegation of powers and demarcation of objects of jurisdiction between the center and the regions. Many people say that any kind of treaty process brings down the Federation. However we would remind you that three years ago Russia and Tatarstan flexed their muscles at one another. They had enough courage to resolve the conflict by first economic agreements and then a bilateral treaty. In my view the same mechanism is quite applicable in relations between Kiev and Simferopol and in conditions in the Dniester Region and Karabakh. In our view, interregional economic associations represent a system compelling state centers in the CIS countries to embark on integration by means of reciprocal treaties. On that basis a confederative core of three or four states can and must be created within the CIS. Otherwise the processes of integration could be uncontrolled. Nor must one forget that, given the separatism in a number of regions, market relations do not eliminate but intensify the regional imbalances. In this connection prices of power and railroad transport tariffs must be subject to mandatory regulation. One must also bear in mind the fact that certain regions are wholly "tied" to the fuel and energy complex, the military-industrial complex (Udmurtia), or the agro-industrial complex (Altay) and regional state administrative and economic structures are being consolidated, yet the configuration of the Moscow political elite virtually does not reflect these processes. The state's future should not be decided within the Garden Ring, otherwise the "rules of play" will not be accepted by all the participants.
