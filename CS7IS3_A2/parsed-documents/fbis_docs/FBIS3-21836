No arrests have been made as yet. The drugs were discovered in containers for hairspray and chocolate syrup, inserted in a shipment of packaged soap arriving from Bangkok, Thailand. The Federal Judicial Police director, Adrian Carrera, remarked that this was one of the most significant drug confiscations made in the nation's capital. The amount of Thai heroin seized in Mexico City, combined with the shipments confiscated during January of this year in the towns of Tijuana and Ensenada, brings the present total to 136 kg. Investigations conducted previously resulted in the discovery that a large shipment arriving from Asia was to be stored in Mexico City for subsequent transfer to the United States. The Interception Directorate of the PGR's National Institute To Combat Drugs ordered an operation with members of the counternarcotics police detailed to the AICM. The latter, in fact, detected the drug shipment at the Mexican Postal Service offices in that airport terminal. At 1100, the MPF [Federal Public Prosecutor's Office] ordered the inspection procedure to be applied, including the shipment that arrived from Thailand. What was presumed to be hairspray and syrup came in a cardboard box with packages of toilet soap, and those hairspray and chocolate syrup containers were found to be filled with heroin. The heroin base, with the technical name monoacetylmorphine, is an opium gum derivative used as a basic ingredient in processing heroin. To produce the narcotic, the monoacetylmorphine must be mixed with a liquid chemical reagent, known as acetic anhydride. The Federal Judicial Police are continuing the investigation, and already have clues leading to the arrest of those who were to receive the drugs in Ensenada, Baja California. A probe is also under way to determine possible links between this shipment and others seized recently, because similar methods were used to move it from the Asian Continent.
