Mr. Monory, who was the guest on the Radio-J "Forum" program on Sunday, 15 May, said: "Employment deserves more than passing comments. It requires a series of measures. We must stop indulging in demagoguery and controversy.... I think that the majority and opposition should not taunt each other with each other's failures." The Senate speaker hopes that the presidential election will provide the opportunity "for a great debate" on this employment question. "Otherwise, we will be heading for decline," he said. [passage omitted] Questioned on the disagreement between the prime minister and the president of the Republic on the question of the moratorium on nuclear tests, Mr. Monory expressed the view that this controversy is "rather pointless" because "our decision," he said, "is determined more than ever by the attitude of our big partners." Taking up the argument used by Francois Mitterrand during his 10 May television speech, he added: "It is true that if the others do not resume the tests, we will not resume them, and if the others do resume them, we will resume them." On the question of the European elections, the Senate speaker, who had supported Dominique Baudis as candidate to head the UDF-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list, thinks that "35 percent" would be "a good score."
