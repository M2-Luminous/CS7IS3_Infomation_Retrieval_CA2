In an interview with Qobi Meydan today, Guzofsky said the present government and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin should be toppled. [Begin recording] [Guzofsky] Support should be mustered for the removal of Yitzhaq Rabin from government. Definitely. [Meydan] You do not rule out the physical option. [Guzofsky] I do not know what you mean by physical: Putting a bullet in his head? Is that what you mean? [Meydan] I was just asking. [Guzofsky] You were just asking. I think that so far, the actions of Kahana Hay in Israel, the United States, and throughout the world have been within the law. In Israel the rules are different because Yitzhaq Rabin and the fools in government are preventing Kahana Hay and Kakh from operating legally and democratically. So they should not be surprised afterward. [Meydan] Do I hear a threat? [Guzofsky] I did not make a threat. I am merely saying that when a regime prevents its people from electing freely and when it prevents the Kahana Hay and Kakh people from being elected, they should not ask afterward why we act undemocratically.
