As we know, deputies have very differing views on reform in this country. They evaluate in different ways the possibility of applying Chinese experience in Russian conditions and of reaching a solution to border problems. Nevertheless, at meetings with the Chinese leaders, the deputies appeared to display a united front, confirming that China continues to be one of the priorities in Russian foreign policy. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Ivan Rybkin, head of the Russian delegation, also agreed that economic changes must be based on concrete conditions in each state. But stability in society is an indispensable prerequisite for any reform. At the meetings both sides recalled the longstanding friendship between the peoples of Russia and China and the lengthy frontier which they share. But this is no longer enough for the effective development of bilateral cooperation. As Ivan Rybkin put it, the Chinese leaders took note of specific proposals to change the situation. These will be discussed in detail at the upcoming meeting of the Russo-Chinese commission on trade and economic cooperation and during the visit to China by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
