Black inked or highly filled types in particular have created problems. It has now been possible to resolve this problem under a joint project of the Development Group for the Recycling of Plastics [EWvK] in Wiesbaden together with Bavarian Motor Works [BMW] in Munich, plus the European Automobile Manufacturers' Joint Research Committee and Bruker Analytical Measurement Methods in Karlsruhe. At the "Recycle '94" trade fair in Davos, 14-18 March, and at the 23-24 March annual meeting of the Association of German Engineers [VDI]-K [expansion not given] in Mannheim, the project partners demonstrated the new detection system for rapid identification of plastics. According to EWvK, it is possible with a rapidity measured in seconds to distinguish 23 different types of plastics and blends in all known modifications using the equipment developed by Bruker. To do so, it is necessary for only one second to hold the pieces needing identification to a measurement window and activate a foot switch. In three seconds the result shows up on the monitor. Prior processing of the pieces is only required if they are painted or underwent surface treatment. Removal of the paint using a finger milling-cutter or a conical pin-type milling-cutter, ranging over only a 10 millimeter [mm] diameter, is sufficient prior preparation for the sampling. Bruker's original piece of equipment has been undergoing testing for months at the BMW disassembly center in Landshut. According to EWvK, the experiments have gone so well that the sorting of the plastic pieces using disassembly manuals that has been performed until now in Landshut, has undergone replacement. The plastics are now separated by means of the identification system. Already during the test phase, there has been a definite decline in the contamination of pure sorts of materials through mis-sorting.
