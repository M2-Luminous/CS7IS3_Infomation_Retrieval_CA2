[Hawatimah] As soon as we received word about the massacre, the DFLP urged our people inside the occupied homeland and abroad to observe a general strike for three days. I declared this personally over the radio. Our people's response was excellent. Confrontations are still going on. They covered all of the 1948-occupied territory, from the Galilee to the Negev. This is in addition to the occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem. In the diaspora, demonstrations, marches, and protests have not stopped. We have also called for a halt to the negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli track until the settlements are dismantled, in line with Security Council Resolutions 465, 605, 507, and 726. These resolutions were issued during the Carter, Reagan, and Bush presidencies. We also urged that the settlers be disarmed and that international protection be provided for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, as happened in Sarajevo. [passage omitted] In addition to these political steps, the intifadah will continue to resist occupation and settlement activity. Also, armed fedayeen resistance to the occupation troops and the settlers will continue. [passage omitted] [Salihah] Do you support fedayeen operations against the settlers? How will you react militarily? [Hawatimah] We have stated clearly that the crime will not go unpunished. The punishment will definitely be against the settlers who are armed to the teeth in full view of the occupation. The crimes of the settlers are the outcome of the current political climate and Rabin's hawkish policy. Rabin insists on having everything: territory, crossings, and security. He is also pursuing settlement activity. He earmarked $100 million in 1994 to expand the settlements. This is in addition to the ideology preached by the Israeli rabbis, urging settlement and expansion and making the Palestinian territory a disputed land. Therefore, our fedayeen operations will necessarily target the settlers. Every settler is a target of the strugglers of the Red Star Battalions, the DFLP's armed wing. The past stands witness that we are faithful to what we declare. The coming days will see appropriate reactions to this horrendous massacre. [passage omitted]
