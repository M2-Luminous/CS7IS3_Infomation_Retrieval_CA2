FBIS4-58694 "drnes088_j_94030" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Fighting Continues; Airport Bombed; Calls for Peace Made Fighting Continues; Airport Bombed; Calls for Peace Made `Traitor' al-Bid To Face `Severest Punishment' JN0605063894 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 6 May 94 JN0605063894 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: Despite the patience we have demonstrated and the concessions we have made out of our concern to preserve unity and democracy and the country's safety and security, and despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, two and one- half months ago -- a document whose signing was supposed to end the crisis and to signal the beginning of its implementation -- the secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by war criminal al-Bid and his secessionist gang, which is rebelling against Constitutional legitimacy, has insisted on continuing the crisis it created, refusing to even appear before the House of Representatives to take the Constitutional oath. This gang has prevented the convening of official institutions within Constitutional legitimacy and went so far as to start a series of painful and bloody clashes between the comrades-in-arms of the Yemeni people. This began with the attack on the al-'Amaliqah forces in Abyan, besieging the citizens in Mudiyah, creating sedition in the (Harth Sifiyan), and intentional provocations in Shabwah and Dhamar, and finally starting the horrible and disastrous fighting between the Third and First Armored Brigades at the 'Imran military camp. The secessionist gang in the YSP leadership was not satisfied with creating these disasters and tragedies, perhaps because this gang has not yet lost hope of carrying out its suspect and evil plot. This gang has brought the military situation to this degree of seriousness in total disregard of the possible threats to the country. Its blind hatred has covered everything in the country, including the land and the people, and the state and its achievements. The gang started an all-out war on the evening of the sad and gory Wednesday in all parts of Yemen. This began at 2005 with an attack against the Presidential Guard battalion in Dhamar and the siege and attack with all kinds of weapons against the Central security detachment in Aden. The same night, they carried out a comprehensive attack against the units of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area in the Lahij Governorate, and sent the Air Force to strike vital and strategic targets in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz. Thus, the YSP tyrants, led by the traitor al-Bid and his secessionist, criminal gang, have indulged their hatred to its utmost by attacking the people, the homeland, unity, and democracy, prompted by the grotesque megalomania of their secretary general, al-Bid. This is a flagrant rebellion against Constitutional legitimacy and high treason to the homeland and humanity. Thus, the people will never forgive them. They will bear the curse of God and history. They will face the severest punishment. Their final fate will be the darkness of their graves. As for the heroes of the Armed and Security Forces, the protectors of unity and democracy, they will be held high by the support of our struggling people in the epic of pride and glory. With their chaste blood and sacred sacrifices, they are writing bright pages of decisive victory for the homeland, the people, unity, democracy, justice, and prosperity, God willing. If you will help the cause of Allah, he will help you and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]
