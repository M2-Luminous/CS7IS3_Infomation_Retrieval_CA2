He added that the southern forces repulsed the northerners at a location 130 km west of Saywun, taking 28 northern soldiers prisoner. We have the following report from [MBC correspondent] in Shabwah Tawfiq Jazulit: [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The Governorate of Shabwah in south Yemen is characterized by its harsh desert topography. It consists of valleys, plains, and barren areas. It is about 100 km wide and from the coast to the Saudi borders it is over 300 km long. Shabwah is considered one of the most difficult and dangerous fronts, especially since travelling from one area to another is very difficult, if not virtually impossible in some places. Shabwah's strategic importance is that it is oil-rich. Because of its large size, the southern forces are very spread out. [Unidentified soldier] This force is merely the rear guard; the rest of our forces have advanced close to the capital of the governorate. Our closest positions to the capital are 10-15 km away. [Jazulit] The governor of Shabwah and commander of its front, Ahmad al-Fayiz Sarimah, says his forces control some parts of the vast area of Shabwah. [Sarimah] In Shabwah, we now control 95 percent of the region. We welcome you now, if you have the time, to travel with us to (Qirdan), Wadi Armah, al-Sa'id, al-Musayni'ah, Nisab, 'Azzan, and Mayfa'ah, except for the city of 'Ataq, which is no more than 5 square kilometers. [Jazulit] With the respect to Shabwah's oil, the region's governor does not have any objections to allowing all Yemeni sides to use it so long as this is arranged through dialogue. [Sarimah] If this is done through consent, negotiations, and Arab generosity, we do not mind sharing it with our brothers. This is a characteristic of the Arabs. [Jazulit] The city of 'Ataq, which is about 50 km away from where we are now, is not considered by the military command to be a position of vital strategic importance like the oil wells that could play a decisive role in terminating the fighting between Aden and Sanaa. And the war goes on. [end recording]
