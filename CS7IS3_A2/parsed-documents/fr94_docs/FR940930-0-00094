FR940930-0-00094 FR940930-0-00017 42 CFR Part 417 [OMC&hyph;009&hyph;FC] RIN: 0938&hyph;AG92 Medicare Program; Qualified Health Maintenance Organizations: Technical Amendments AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Final rule with comment period. SUMMARY: This rule clarifies and updates portions of the HCFA regulations that pertain to Federal qualification and continued regulation of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), inclusion of qualified HMOs in employee health benefits plans, and the administration of outstanding loans and loan guarantees that were awarded before October 1, 1986, under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This rule is part of a special project to clarify and update all of 42 CFR part 417, which contains the regulations applicable to all entities that provide prepaid health care, that is, HMOs, CMPs (competitive medical plans) and HCPPs (health care prepayment plans). These are technical and editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the regulations. They are intended to make it easier to find particular provisions, to provide overviews of the different program aspects, and to better ensure uniform understanding of the rules. DATES: Effective Date: These regulations are effective on October 31, 1994. Comment Date: We will consider all comments received at the appropriate address as provided below no later than 5 p.m. on November 29, 1994.

Background This rule revises subparts D, E, F, and V of part 417 of the HCFA rules as part of the special project noted in the SUMMARY. The first two steps in the project to clarify and update part 417 were the publication of two final rules identified as OCC&hyph;22&hyph;F and OCC&hyph;15&hyph;FC. The first was published in the Federal Register on October 17, 1991, at 56 FR 51984; the second, on July 15, 1993, at 58 FR 38062. The regulation identified as OCC&hyph;22&hyph;F_ •Removed most of the outdated content; •Redesignated certain portions of part 417 to free section numbers needed so that new rules can be incorporated in logical order; and •Designated the remaining text under subpart headings that identify the different program aspects so that it is easier to refer to those aspects and to find particular rules. The second regulation, identified as OCC&hyph;15&hyph;F_ •Through nomenclature and definition changes, established certain terms to be used throughout part 417 with the aim of avoiding confusion, making clear that responsibility for the prepaid health care programs has been delegated to HCFA, and ensuring use of the most precise terms available. •Established a separate subpart C with four sections to set forth the many requirements that apply to the organization and operation of HMOs, and that were previously compressed into a single section (§417.107). As a result of the redesignations made by OCC&hyph;22&hyph;F and OCC&hyph;15&hyph;FC, §§417.107 through 417.119 are now available for new rules that are required because of statutory amendments that affect the furnishing of services by qualified HMOs or may be needed because of future changes in the statute. B. Changes in the Regulations In order to clarify and update subparts D, E, F, and V, this rule makes the following changes: •Uses terminology established by OCC&hyph;15&hyph;FC or that reflects accepted usage in all HCFA regulations.
