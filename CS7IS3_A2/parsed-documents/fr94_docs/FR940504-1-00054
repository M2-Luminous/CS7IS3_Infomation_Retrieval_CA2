FR940504-1-00054 FR940504-1-00018 On January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under OPA. 59 FR 1062. Section 990.78(b)(5) of NOAA's proposed rule includes standards for the use of CV. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83; see also 59 FR 1142&hyph;48. In the interest of consistency and after consultation with other Federal agencies, the Department is soliciting comment on whether the Department's type B rule should be revised to include standards for the use of CV substantially similar to those proposed by NOAA. Upon consideration of the comments received in response to this notice, the Department intends to issue a final rule. NOAA's proposed standards for use of CV cover five areas: (1) Survey instrument design and development; (2) survey administration; (3) the nature of the results; (4) calibration; and (5) reporting. NOAA's proposed standards are intended to provide flexibility to trustee officials so that they can take advantage of new developments that may occur in CV methodology. Further, any standards included in the Department's type B rule may be subject to amendment during the statutorily required biennial review of the regulations to reflect the results of new research. A. Survey Instrument Design and Development The reliability of a CV study begins with the design and development of the survey instrument. NOAA has proposed several survey instrument design and development standards. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B rule, is as follows: Survey instrument design and development_(A) Willingness to pay for Prevention or Restoration. (1) The survey instrument shall elicit from respondents their willingness-to-pay (WTP) either to prevent described injuries to natural resources or to restore injured resources as described to their baseline or comparable condition. (2) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for selecting a prevention program or restoration program as the commodity to be valued. (B) Commodity definition. (1) During development of the survey, the trustee(s) shall determine whether respondents understood and found credible the description of the injuries (including whether they are permanent or interim losses) and the program (including the timing of the process) for preventing injuries or restoring the natural resources. (2) Prior to the value elicitation, the trustee(s) shall identify the natural resource context of the injured resources, if related resources exist, including commodities that might serve as substitutes. (C) Budget constraints. Prior to the value elicitation, respondents shall be reminded of their budget constraints and their alternative expenditures. Respondents shall be reminded that their WTP for the environmental program in question would reduce their expenditures on other goods. This reminder should be more than perfunctory, but less than overwhelming. The goal is to induce respondents to keep in mind other likely expenditures, including those on other environmental goods, when evaluating the main scenario. After the value elicitation, respondents shall be reminded again of their alternative expenditure possibilities. Respondents shall be given an opportunity to reconsider and change their votes (bid) after this second reminder of alternative expenditure possibilities. (D) Comparability with real transactions. (1) The survey instrument shall use a credible choice mechanism and payment vehicle.
