FR940314-1-00003 FR940314-1-00001 4. Review and update the Supplemental Structural Inspection Documents (SSID), and 5. Assess repair quality. The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item 2 in July 1989 and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program. The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item 1, above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.'' The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation of the structural modifications identified in the Boeing Document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437 (58 FR 8693, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes. Additional structural inspections are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5580 (52 FR 7564, March 12, 1987), which references Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 28, 1986, and Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986. The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item 1. The Working Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory modification of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled safely by repetitively inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications, the inspections should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions have occurred infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability of an inspection program to detect the damage before it impairs safety. The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandatory inspection following modification to ensure the successful long-term operation of Model 747 series airplanes. The procedures contained in this service bulletin address reports of corrosion and cracking in the body skin of the lap joints under the wing-to-body fairing on Model 747 series airplanes that had accumulated between 21,500 flight hours and 33,000 flight hours. Operators have also reported finding corrosion and cracks at the lower body lap joints forward and aft of the wing-to-body fairing on airplanes that had accumulated more than 9,000 flight hours. Additionally, operators have reported finding fatigue cracking in the body frames adjacent to the lap joints on airplanes that had accumulated more than 10,000 flight cycles. Continued operation of these airplanes with corroded lap joints and cracked or broken adjacent frames could cause the skin to separate, which could lead to rapid loss of pressure in the airplane. The FAA has concurred with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate the inspections to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet. The FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 26, 1992, that describes procedures for external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking in the upper row of fasteners in the lower lobe of the fuselage skin lap joints. Certain inspections to detect cracking of the lower lobe lap joints described in this service bulletin are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, which references the original issue of this service bulletin, dated March 8, 1986, and Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986. The ``full'' modification (including the ``permanent'' repair) and the ``optional'' modification of the lower lobe lap joints described in this service bulletin are required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, which also references both the original issue of this service bulletin and Revision 1. The inspections to detect corrosion described in this service bulletin are required by AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990). Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external high frequency eddy current inspections to detect cracking in the upper row of fasteners in modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The requirements of this proposed AD are not intended to duplicate, rescind, or supersede the requirements of AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, or AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05. The FAA's intent is to require the external HFEC inspections, described above, of older airplanes following the mandatory modifications required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, in addition to those inspections required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1 and AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05. There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 118 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $804,760, or $6,820 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.
