In his appearance on Channel 2's "Buenos Dias" program, Gurdian criticized the executive branch for being slow to resolve the property issue. In contrast, he cited examples of cases being resolved quickly under U.S. pressure. Gurdian related the accusations he had heard from peasants that military personnel are carrying out attacks in the north. With regard to the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), he explained that Cosep is interested in a dialogue with the FSLN "in order to seek concrete solutions for Nicaragua," but that this should "in no way be interpreted as seeking an alliance with Sandinism."
