What are the real causes of that? [Tahir] The other side, that is the ruling military regime in Sanaa, prepared for the war a long time ago. And the treacherous attacks on our units in the north were real "rehearsals" for the war. Besides, the regime in Sanaa has pushed all its army and tens of thousands of armed tribes loyal to it and 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar [leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping], and all the state's human and material resources into this war. As for us, we have confronted this all-out war with modest human and material resources. [passage omitted] [Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation in the fighting against you, but you have failed to prove it through POW's, equipment, or anything else...? [Tahir] There is no doubt at all about the participation of Iraq, Sudan, and other states in the war alongside the ruling military regime in Sanaa. There are Iraqi military personnel and soldiers fighting alongside northern forces. A number of them were arrested on the Shabwah axis, and the media covered this issue then, with both sound and picture. I can confirm to you that the war launched against us is run from A to Z by Iraqi experts. Sudan too is participating in the war directly or indirectly, proceeding from the alliance declared between the two regimes in Sanaa and Khartoum -- the alliance in which extremists are playing the major and crucial part. The "Afghan Arabs" group is also participating in this war alongside northern forces. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Is it true that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih wanted to capture Aden, or did he put pressure on this front to keep your forces there in order to seize the oil area in Shabwah? [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to capture Aden or occupy the oil area in Shabwah. All he has done is inflict further destruction and ruin on Yemen, killing more innocent women, children, and elderly and destroying the northern and southern armies. And the days have proved since the fighting broke out on 27 April that this war is a losing war in which there is no victor, and certainly it will backfire on those who ignited it. [Qallab] The northerners accuse you of receiving military aid from some neighboring states. What truth is there in these accusations? [Tahir] These accusations are designed for the media and to divert attention from the aid the other side is receiving from a number of states. Media and diplomatic sources abroad have on several occasions revealed the names of these states. [passage omitted] [Qallab] As is known, you are using Soviet and eastern weapons in general. How you have been able to sort matters out during the war, especially with regard to spare parts? [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend ourselves and the sovereignty of our state. [Qallab] If a cease-fire is announced, how will the issue of the land seized from the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY] during the war be tackled? [Tahir] The cease-fire issue is no longer a Yemeni affair. It is now an international affair in accordance with Security Council Resolution 924, which was adopted only after 'Ali 'Abdallah's refusal to respond to the voice of reason and logic and all Arab initiatives and appeals to halt this war, whose only aim is to kill and destroy. We presented an initiative to form a team of international observers to watch and implement the cease-fire and withdraw northern forces to their previous positions before the fighting broke out. I would like here to stress that we will not abandon a single inch of the DRY's territory. [passage omitted] [Qallab] As defense minister of the Republic of Yemen who knows a great deal, which is really the quarter planning and leading northern operations? [Tahir] I was defense minister of the Republic of Yemen. I am now defense minister of the DRY. And I know that the military regime in Sanaa planned a long time ago for this criminal all-out war against our people in the DRY. I also know that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers and Iraqi military experts planned and led the military operations against our people. But their plans have failed or at least have not been implemented according to plan. That is with the exception of inflicting further human losses and destroying the economic structure of both parts of Yemen, south and north. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you to declare a state in Hadhramaut, make Aden a free zone, and annex the governorates seized by northern forces to the north? [Tahir] There is no doubt about that. And when the regime in Sanaa talks about legitimacy and unity, it does so for overt media and political consumption. But I stress to you that our people will fight bravely and valiantly to defend every inch of the DRY's territory. [Qallab] What unity formula would you accept after the failure of the previous formula, which led to this devastating war? [Tahir] It is difficult to talk about any form of unity with the Sanaa military regime, which slaughtered unity and wanted to annihilate our people, occupy their land, attack their honor, and plunder their money and resources.
