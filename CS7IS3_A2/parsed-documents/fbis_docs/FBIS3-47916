Some time ago, the final damming of the tideland of Chongsu island in South Hwanghae Province was completed to bring 1,000 hectares of tideland under cultivation. Last year saw the reclamation of 3,300 hectares of Kumsong tideland. The three farms which made their appearance in the Kwaksan tideland in North Pyongan Province reaped a rich crop in their first year's farming. These tideland-turned fields have a favourable condition for comprehensive mechanisation of paddy farming. Their irrigation networks are also flawless. Korea, which has a limited arable land with mountains occupying the greater part of its area, has directed big efforts to tideland reclamation, steadily increasing the investment in it. Tideland reclamation has been pushed ahead in various areas on the west coast. As a result, a hundred and scores of islets have been linked with the land, the length of the coastline has been drastically shortened and over 80 fishing ports have moved to the skirts of the outstretched land. A number of farms have appeared in the tideland-turned fields. Modern socialist villages with fashionable residential houses have cropped up in the former tideland of Yomju county and Tasa island in North Pyongan Province. Tideland farms with a thousand and several hundred hectares of arable land each have come into being in Onchon, Chungsan, Pyongwon, Sukchon and other areas of South Pyongan Province. South Hwanghae Province has several tideland farms. The fields of the Yangji and Namhae cooperative farms situated in the vast tideland-turned field of Unchon county have been arranged for mechanized farming. Last year, the June 3 and Ansok cooperative farms in Onchon county and many other farms in former tideland reaped more than 8 tons of grain from each hectare.
