Polay was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is serving in a prison at the naval base of the port of Callao, where Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman is serving a similar sentence. Otilia Polay voiced concern over her son's health, and said she was worried about the "physical deterioration and psychological strain" under which she found him during a visit she paid on 24 May. Mrs. Polay added that this was the first time in 14 months she had been allowed to visit her son, whom she believed was "being illegally maintained in complete isolation, as according to the law he can be maintained in isolation for a maximum of one year." Otilia Polay said her son told her he is completely isolated in a cell measuring two meters square with a skylight 15 centimeters square, and that at night the very poor artificial light does not even allow him read the Bible, "the only book he is allowed to read." She added that her son told her that for months he was allowed out into the daylight for only five minutes a day, and that now he is allowed 15 minutes a day "when according to the law he should be allowed 30 minutes." The mother of the terrorist leader stated: "He is completely isolated and not allowed to speak to anybody." She said she believes that "the only purpose of all this is to destroy him physically and mentally with a system that violates minimum human rights." Polay told his mother that Abimael Guzman and other SL leaders who are in the same prison "receive numerous visits, and are able to assemble freely and go out in groups into the daylight for much longer" than he is allowed. Otilia Polay today held a news conference at the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), where she appeared to request an audience with the members of the Human Rights Commission to explain her son's situation and lodge a formal protest, she said.
