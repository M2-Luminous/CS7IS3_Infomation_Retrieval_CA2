The North Ossetian leader went on record for the continuation of the dialogue with the Ingush side, but bluntly rejected the idea of a moratorium on border changes. In his opinion, it is necessary to completely delete from the agenda the question of recarving the borders of the North Caucasian area, because this may provoke a new tragedy in the region. The North Ossetian president dwelt at length on the forthcoming celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia's accession to Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city of Vladikavkaz. The jubilee celebrations, devoted to these dates, will be held from October 7 to October 15. Galazov said that these dates "have not lost their importance at all, but are assuming a new historical meaning in the light of modern political problems".
