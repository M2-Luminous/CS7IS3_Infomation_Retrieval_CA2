This became clear as the Freedom Alliance closed ranks on Thursday [3 March] and backed the mediation initiative proposed by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi with the African National Congress' [ANC] national working committee also giving it the green light. The proposal, made at the Buthelezi/Mandela summit on Tuesday, now needs only the government's backing to ensure agreement by the majority in the multiparty negotiating process. [passage omitted] Mr F W de Klerk and his government will now have to give its response to the mediation proposal, an option not popular with the NP [National Party] government in the past. An all-inclusive settlement has, however, become a clear priority for the two major parties and there seems little chance, observers say, that Mr de Klerk will resist ANC President Nelson Mandela in accepting it. The Angola/Namibian settlement is cited as a clear precedent of successful international mediation involving South Africa. The Alliance backing came after a three-hour meeting between leaders at a Constantia Hotel in the Cape on Friday morning. Speaking on their behalf, Alliance Chairman and Bophuthatswana Foreign Minister Rowan Cronje said they were backing the intiative and were united on the issue. It was up to the ANC to indicate its acceptance of the offer. Mr Buthelezi said the offer was made in return for a recommendation to his Central Committee to register "provisionally" to give negotiators a chance to find a settlement. He rejected Mr de Klerk's view, expressed in Parliament on Wednesday, that negotiations could continue to reach agreements which could be implemented after the elections. "We want a settlement before elections," he said. The Alliance accused the government of having unilaterally suspended negotiations, but the new initiative has given the process new momentum which the government will find difficult to resist. Mr de Klerk acknowledged the IFP offer in Parliament on Wednesday with careful wording which clearly left the door open. Asked whether there was enough time, Mr Cronje said at the Thursday summit the principle first had to be accepted before details of the who, where and when could be negotiated. He made it clear the Alliance was taking its cue from the IFP Central Committee's decision on Friday which in turn was subject to ANC acceptance. Mr Buthelezi's response was that if the IFP Central Committee accepted the initiative it was implicit that it considered there was enough time to negotiate and participate in the elections, although the Alliance and the IFP's position remained that the election date itself had to be postponed. Although there is virtually no chance of the latter, senior negotiators said on Thursday night a concession by the government and the ANC on international mediation was now a logical next step. Postponements of technical deadlines could then follow. The Alliance was confident enough to appoint a committee to deal with the details of such a process once the IFP's Central Committee decided in favour of it.
