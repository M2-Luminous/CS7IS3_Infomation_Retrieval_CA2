Criticizing the recent British charges against Iran including the alleged Tehran's support for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the expelling of Iranian charge d'affaires from Britain, `JOMHURI-E ESLAMI' wrote in a commentary that the British officials have launched an "extensive propaganda campaign against the Islamic Repulic of Iran with an aim to satisfy American statesmen." The article referred to the forthcoming visit to Britain of the U.S. President Bill Clinton, scheduled next Sunday, and said that the British mass media, by resorting to fabricated allegations, once again are trying to accuse Iran of having supported the IRA. The British officials have created a smokey screen whenever they had failed in their foreign policy, said the article adding that the present propaganda ploy against Tehran comes in the aftermath of the last month disclosure of Britain's eavesdropping at the Iranian Embassy in London.
