FR941019-2-00141 FR941019-2-00081 (i) The first part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to report or grant back rights to FLOAT TECHNOLOGY improvements. Inasmuch as all such improvement reporting and grant-back provisions in licenses to U.S. LICENSEES expired long ago, this proposes an unnecessary addition to the provision of the Judgment. (ii) The second part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas. We note that Defendants have not imposed express contractual restraints upon the export of glass from the United States by PPG nor by any other U.S. LICENSEE. Nevertheless, there have been instances when defendants relied upon their patents in the destination countries to limit or prevent such exports when the U.S. LICENSEE was unable to persuade Defendants to grant or sell a full waiver of those foreign patent rights. The patents on which Defendants relied for this purpose, however, have now expired along with their counterpart U.S. patents, denying them the means to carry on this form of export restraint. (iii) The third part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to arbitrate rather than litigate disputes unless substantive U.S. antitrust law is applied. The Judgment will foreclose most such disputes in the future by the prohibitions and conditions that it places on Defendants' ability to require U.S. LICENSEES to pay FEES, observe LIMITATIONS, or maintain CONFIDENTIALITY with respect to the use or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Moreover, even prior to the entry of any judgment herein PPG has obtained the very result that this request seeks. Specifically, we refer to Judge Browning's finding That arbitration *␣*␣* will not operate as a prospective waiver of PPG's statutory claims due to Pilkington's express representation and consent to the substantive arbitration or PPG's claims pursuant to U.S. antitrust law. PPG Industries, Inc. v. Pilkington et al., CIV 92&hyph;753&hyph;TUC&hyph;WDB (D. Ariz. July 9, 1994) (Order Granting Stay and Compelling Arbitration). (iv) The fourth part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to bear the burden of proving that SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY has become publicly known before being relieved of territorial and use restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A. accomplishes precisely that result. 2. You propose to expand the coverage of subparagraph IV.A.1. to include processes developed with the use or aid of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY so as to preclude Defendants' future reassertion of arguments that technology developed in minds ``tainted'' by prior knowledge of Pilkington technology also belongs to Pilkington. However, the Judgment precludes Defendants from making such assertions. Any ``taint'' claim by Defendants is enjoined by subparagraph IV.A.1., inasmuch as it would ``require *␣*␣* any U.S. LICENSEE to *␣*␣* observe LIMITATIONS,'' LIMITATIONS being defined in subparagraph II.K. as including ``any restriction or limitation, or purported restriction or limitation, of the use of FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, whether the result of an affirmative prohibition or a limited authorization.'' In the discussions leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court for entry, Defendants' representatives repeatedly acknowledged to the Department that the taint issue had been resolved against Pilkington in the ``Shenzhen'' arbitration (a point you also make in your comment) and in subsequent judicial review thereof, and that they considered this a final determination precluding them from again asserting ``taint'' against your client. 3. You propose limiting IV.A.3.(b) by adding the word ``SUBJECT'' just before the words ``FLOAT TECHNOLOGY,'' stating that we appear to have omitted the word by oversight. Contrary to your assumption, however, the text of this provision intentionally covers all FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. By omitting the word that your proposal would add, this provision protects against future Pilkington misappropriation charges any U.S. LICENSEE who transfers any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (e.g., in connection with building a float glass plant abroad). This protection will cover not only charges of misappropriating SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, i.e., FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the U.S. LICENSEE under its LICENSE AGREEMENT, but also FLOAT TECHNOLOGY that found its way to the U.S. LICENSEE via a third party (e.g., by hiring a former Pilkington employee) as long as the U.S. LICENSEE, when transferring such technology, includes in the agreement of transfer ``a lawful and commercially reasonable provision requiring the transferee to maintain CONFIDENTIALITY.'' Such confidentiality provisions are customarily included in technology transfer agreements, so that this provision imposes no significant burden on U.S. LICENSEES, while protecting them against such claims by Pilkington. 4. You propose deleting subparagraph IV.A.4. and changing subparagraph IV.A.1. to ensure Pilkington cannot pursue monetary relief in proceedings regardless of when they were instituted, pointing out that in 1992 Pilkington instituted an additional arbitration proceeding against PPG on a claim growing out of a 1978 settlement concerning LB technology. Subparagraphs A.1. and A.2. of the Judgment enjoin Defendants' further pursuit of injunctive and declaratory relief against U.S. LICENSEES' ``violations'' of license restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A.4. creates a narrow exception that permits Defendants to continue to pursue solely monetary (but not injunctive or declaratory) relief, but only for past conduct, and only in proceedings instituted before May 25, 1994. Your comment indicates that your concern about this exception is raised by a single dispute that Pilkington initiated in 1992, one that arose out of a 1978 settlement of an earlier litigated dispute. The Department of Justice's role in this civil Sherman Act case extends to securing prospective relief that assures open competition for the benefit of the public. ``[T]he antitrust laws *␣*␣* were enacted `for the protection of competition, not competitors,''' Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 488 (1977), quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320 (1962). To that end, the Judgment enjoins Defendants not only from prospective enforcement of previously obtained equitable relief but also from the imposition of FEES, as defined in subparagraph II.C., for the prospective use or sublicensing of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Contrarily, the claim to which you allude is limited strictly to monetary relief for your client for past conduct. Thus, no matter how ill-founded or unjust this Pilkington monetary claim against PPG may be, its assertion is a private matter and consequently concerns only the private parties involved.
