At the ongoing NPC annual session, deputies today continued to discuss the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng. Speaking to deputies from Hebei Province, Premier Li expressed the hope that Hebei, a major grain and cotton producer in China, will pay particular attention to the expansion of a water-efficient farming sector, the promotion of scientific farming and development of a diversified economy on the basis of increased grain and cotton production. Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, listened to several deputies from China's most populous province of Sichuan speaking on agricultural production. He said that Sichuan has a great potential for expanding the farming sector, with large areas of mountainous and hilly region, plains and a large rural workforce. He said that Sichuan should vigorously expand production of cash crops in hilly regions and pursue a diversified economy. State Councillor Chen Junsheng also urged Sichuan Provincial authorities to readjust the province's agriculture structure on the basis of stabilizing grain production. Speaking to deputies from Jiangxi Province, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji repeatedly emphasized the importance of agriculture and grain production. He expressed the hope that Jiangxi officials and people will try to step up agricultural production in a bid to promote economic growth and social stability. Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, delivered a speech on agriculture to NPC deputies from Jilin Province, the largest commodity grain producer in China. Jilin harvested 15 million tons of grain in 1993. According to Tian, agricultural development, rural prosperity and the rising income of farmers are essential to the success in deepening reforms, opening China wider to the rest of the world, promoting economic development and maintaining social stability. He made the following proposals to expand agriculture production: -- Taking the road of seeking high yields, and improving the product quality and farming efficiency; -- Achieving an all-round development in farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fisheries; -- Vigrously expanding rural industries to increase farmers' incomes; and -- Pushing farm products onto the market and encouraging farmers to become involved in commodity circulation. Speaking to deputies from Inner Mongolia, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said that China must rely on its own efforts to feed its huge population. "So long as we ensure a sufficient supply of grain, vegetables and other daily necessities and keep prices under control, our society will be stable," he said. State Councillor Li Tieying and Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also spoke of the importance of agriculture to deputies from Gansu Province. Li Tieying, who is also the minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that agriculture serves as the basis for Gansu to achieve a sustained and rapid economic growth and narrow the gap between it and developed areas in eastern China. Wen Jiabao, who is also a member of the secretariat of the party central committee, stressed the need to maintain a sustained increase in grain production by stabilizing the acreage sown to grain crops and pursuing a diversified rural economy. Where possible, it is necessary to expand the acreage sown to cotton, plant more fruit trees and develop livestock breeding, he said.
