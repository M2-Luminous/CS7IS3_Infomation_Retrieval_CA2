Vietnam is quick to adjust and therefore likely to catch up with Thailand within five years despite the fact that Vietnam now is 20 years behind Thailand. He said the Vietnamese people are very diligent by nature. Vietnam is a big competitor of Thailand in rice exports, but the quality of Vietnam's rice is still lower than Thai rice. Thailand, he said, must try to improve the quality of its rice export, especially in terms of packaging.
