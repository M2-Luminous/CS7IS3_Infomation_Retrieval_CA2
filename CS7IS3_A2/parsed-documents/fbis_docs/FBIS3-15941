The talks merely complicated relations between the two states still further. The negotiations are bogged down over the question of 11,000 military pensioners who wish to go on living in Estonia. Since over half of these retired personnel are younger than 60, Tallinn considers that they pose a threat to Estonia's national security. It says the question of the pensioners cannot be linked to the withdrawal of the last contingent of Russian troops, 2,500 men in all. However, the Russian delegation has refused to sign the withdrawal agreement unless the question of the pensioners who want to stay on in their apartments is first resolved. After the failure of the last round, Tallinn initially intended to suspend the negotiating process in order to draw world attention to the problem. However, a meeting of the cabinet made a different decision. It adopted a statement, accusing Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the Baltic region, but calling on Moscow to start consultations -- at a high political level, as it was put.
