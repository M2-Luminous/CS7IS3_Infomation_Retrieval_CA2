The two were convicted of trying to hijack a plane from China Eastern Airlines. Chief criminal Zhang Daxing, a self-employed businessman, was sentenced to life imprisonment with his political rights deprived for life, and his accomplice Chen Jiangfu, a self- employed tailor, was sentenced to ten years behind bars with his political rights deprived for one year. On January 28, 1994, Zhang Daxing, a native of Taicang county in Jiangsu Province, and Chen Jiangfu, a native of Wujin county in Jiangsu, bought air tickets from Shanghai to Hangzhou for the following day. Zhang told Chen his intention and detailed plan to hijack the passenger plane to Taiwan and showed him a letter of blackmail to be used in the move. On January 29, the two men got on the airplane, flight 5513, of China Eastern Airlines. Soon after the plane took off, Zhang got up and declared with the letter that the plane was hijacked, threatening to explode it if it refused to fly to Taiwan. Meanwhile, Chen kept an eye on people on board, following Zhang's orders. The two hijackers were subdued and arrested after the airplane landed at the airport in Hangzhou. They were convicted by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court in its first ruling according to law. They pleaded guilty and did not appeal to the higher people's court. A spokesman of the Supreme People's Court pointed out today that hijacking civil airplanes is a grave crime as it endangers the safety of passengers and their property, adding that criminals should be sternly punished according to law.
