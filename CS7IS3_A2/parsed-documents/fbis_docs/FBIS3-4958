In letters sent to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other U.S. officials, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry insisted that many pacts have worked well on raising imports of U.S. products, the official said. These letters point to the fact that Japan's imports of U.S. beef nearly doubled in 1992 from 1988 following a bilateral trade agreement and that the ratio of foreign products to government purchases of computers climbed to 18.9 percent in fiscal 1992 from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991. Also cited in these letters are statistics showing an increase in sales of imported autos in defiance of a general market slump and progress in cooperation between Japanese and U.S. firms in boosting the U.S. share in Japan's chip market. In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the United States has insisted past trade pacts have not worked well because of a lack of objective criteria.
