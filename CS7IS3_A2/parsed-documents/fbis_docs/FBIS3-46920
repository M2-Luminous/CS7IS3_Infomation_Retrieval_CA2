Johnson; "The Day Will Come When Mongolia Will Render Assistance to Others..." -- MONTSAME headline; date and place not given] [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 30 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- 1. Question: Can you tell us about achievements in Mongolian-American relations during 1993? Answer: Before anything else, on behalf of the government and people of the United States, I would like to wish the people of Mongolia a happy New Year 1994, and express the hope that the year will be full of success, good fortune, and happiness. In 1993, our relations continued to show important and positive developments. I will cite just a few examples: the successful visit of Prime Minister Jasray to the United States in June, our statement in support of Mongolia's status as a nuclear free zone, the delivery of food and other aid to Mongolia in the spring and fall, and the deepening of our cultural and educational exhanges with the arrival of our press and cultural attache. These are developments for which both sides have worked hard and cooperated successfully, so we feel great satisfaction over our work this year. 2. Question: What would you like to say about the future of relations between Mongolia and the U.S.? Answer: In a very short time, our two countries have established a very good foundation for stable, friendly and active relations. As ambassador, I would like to continue to build on this foundation. Of fundamental importance to our relations is our shared commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, political pluralism, and to a market economy. In this regard, the example given by the citizens of Mongolia in this year's presidential elections cannot be overlooked. President Ochirbat was re-elected in an open, fair, and internationally monitored election, an event that all people of Mongolia should feel great pride about. Having said all of the above, I must add that there remains a great deal that we can do to further develop relations. For example, our economic links are still far below what they should be. Mongolia needs to intensify its efforts to attract investment to this country. We need to establish more contacts in the areas of science, information, and culture. These are things that I am working on as ambassador and will continue to pay attention to. 3. Question: What do you think about the current reform process in Mongolia? Answer : My country supports Mongolia's efforts to make a successful transition to a market economy. These efforts have involved pain and sacrifice for many Mongolians, and for many people it may be hard to see progress. But there has been progress. Inflation during 1993 has slowed dramatically, and should continue to slow down in 1994. The decline in GDR [expansion unknown] has been reduced, and if present policies are continued, we believe that there will be positive economic growth in 1994. Some areas of business are already expanding, for example the textile sector. The important thing is for Mongolia to keep ahead with the reform process, because it is beginning to show results. More results will be visible in the next year or two. To help ease the transition, my country has provided food and economic assistance. We will continue to support your efforts. However, we also look forward to the day when Mongolia will be assisting others, and not receiving assistance from abroad.
