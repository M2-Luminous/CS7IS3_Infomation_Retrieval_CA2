In summary, the situation manifests itself in the following three ways: 1. Although the market has rapidly expanded, trading has, conversely, declined. From 1992 to 1993, the number of new companies and the aggregate market value of the Shenzhen and Shanghai markets have steeply increased from 71 companies and somewhat over 20 billion yuan to 182 companies and 352.1 billion yuan. The general rule is that an expanding market will of course result in an expanding trade volume, but here in this case the facts run counter to what one would have wished for. Since the Chinese stock market turned bearish in July of last year, trade volume and trade value have declined day after day. There had indeed been times when the daily trading volume was around 1 billion, but trading volume at the current stock market is now completely different. 2. People show are low-spirited, and speculative activities overshadow investments. For quite a while now, the stock market has been in a turbulent, restless state, with many shareholders having "thrown good money after bad," a fact which has had a strong dampening influence on investment enthusiasm. It rather increased speculative inclinations, so that purely speculative trading, eagerly getting in on upward moves and abandoning items with declining tendencies, artificially creating sudden spurts in the market, giving forth fictitious notions, all such activities have become common occurrences. 3. It will still take quite some time to bring order into the disorderly state of share prices. Looking at the actual conditions in the stock market we see that there is no orderly way in which the first-, second-, and third-line share prices change, quite a few third-line share prices are higher than the second-line share prices, or even higher than the first-line share prices. A major reason for this is that the entire process of adjusting price positions is beset with much that is unrelated to the law of value, such as the procurement mentality, and regionalism, with the result that prices for some mediocre shares are high above those of quality shares. Faced with so grim an general trend, anyone in the role of an investor will of course be concerned and entertain fears, and it also stands to reason that agencies charged with the supervision and administration of securities trading, no matter at what level, should be extremely vigilant. Society generally believes that China, being a socialist country, where there is government support, and regulation and control by the state, cannot possibly meet with a calamity on the stock exchange. Anyone who will still stubbornly cling to this outdated idea, disregarding the many concealed danger spots that do exist in the operational processes of the stock market, is certainly very much wrong. Where, then, are the problems in this grim overall state of affairs? In my opinion, the fundamental problem that presently impedes the steady development of the stock market is the incongruous state of the supply-demand relation and the imbalance between supply and demand. This contradiction will still be the major factor that will impede stock market development in China, also throughout 1994. At present, the supply-demand contradiction manifests itself mainly as an excess of supply over demand. Let us first look at the supply side: The aggregate market value of the two markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen is now 352.1 billion yuan. Let us, furthermore, make an initial calculation: In 1994, it is planned to introduce to the market 5.5 billion yuan of new share offerings. Add to this the bonus shares [song pei gu 6623 6792 5140], state-owned shares, and shares owned by judicial persons, that will come on the market and be transferred, and also some shares for which transfer had not been completed in 1993; thus, the total amount will not be less than 10 billion yuan of shares. Converting at the rate of 10 yuan market value per share, we can then estimate that the total capital brought into the market will be over 100 billion yuan. These figures clearly demonstrate how large the supply will be, and how rapid a growth will occur. However, quite a number of specialists and scholars, who are engaged in studies of the stock market, make light of the increase in supplies and the subsequent pressure on the market. Commonly, the following three different theses are expressed in this connection: According to the first thesis, the absolute volume increase, as between 1993 and 1994, a mere 500 million, did not at all amount to very much, and besides, the infusion into the market has occurred evenly and in a well-distributed way. Market operations could easily foresee developments, so that this could not possibly have generated a shock of any severity. If analyzed from the angle of the total volume, of deposit volume, and of increase volume, this point can be further explained. As far as the single share offerings introduced into the market and the total market value are concerned, net increases in 1993, as compared with 1992, had been 1.5-times and 16.5-times, respectively, and in 1994, as compared with 1993, again 1-time and 0.3-times. It shows that the impact on the market in 1994 was much weaker than in 1992. The second thesis argues that the expansion has not only had a one-way, but rather a two-way effect. With the issue of new shares in the market, it was not only the supplies that increased, but they also brought along capital, which in turn initiated demand. The third thesis argues that there exists a huge demand potential which can easily cope with the pressure generated by the expansion. According to statistics, total savings deposits by the entire population amount to 1.5 trillion yuan, while the total amount brought into the stock market was only 100 million yuan, which accounts for not even 6.7 percent. This thesis argues that capital follows market conditions. Once the market situation is favorable, capital sources will open up widely. Let us now examine the situation from the demand angle. Without too many qualitative analyses, here only three calculations: First, if we distribute the total 100 billion accretion of new shares among 16 million shareholding citizens (China now has 8 million shareholding citizens), each of them would have to invest another 6,250 yuan, while not withdrawing original investments, which would amount to having to buy 300 "development shares" [4099 1455 5140 4384] (computed at 21 yuan per share). Second, what portion of the 1.5 trillion aggregate deposits represents peasant deposits and what portion represents deposits by urban resident? According to investigation and analysis, not quite 0.5 percent of the urban residents' deposits could be truly available for investment in the stock market. That means at most 7.5 billion yuan could be made available from the said capital fund, which would make up only 7.5 percent within the new stock accretion. Third, new offerings of shares during the second semester of 1993 expanded at an average monthly rate of 7.4 percent, while the influx of capital into the market increased at the rate of only 3.5 percent, thus leaving a disparity of 3.9 percent. Some particular shares even showed a reverse movement, such as the "development A shares." The total share capital expanded from the 140 million yuan of 1992 to 270 million yuan in 1993, thus supplies increased 93 percent. However, only not quite 40 percent of the 1992 amount came in in 1993 as the capital of "development A shares," demand having thus declined by somewhat over 60 percent. In 1994, which is supposed to be the "Bond Buying Year" and the "Fund Building Year," the divergent flow of capital will no doubt receive much attention. In view of the present trend, our prognosis is: On the one hand, supply will expand at an accelerated pace, and, on the other hand, demand will, conversely, decline, and this will further aggravate the conflict between supply and demand. The shortage of capital funds in the stock market will increasingly constitute a bottleneck that will hamper the development of the stock market. What is the remedy? The radical cure would be to return again to the real demand of the market, to effect a well-balanced adjustment of the current plans for the issue and market offering of shares, so as to have demand determine supply, and to truly establish a plan for the issuing and market offering of shares on the foundation of actual demand in the stock market.
