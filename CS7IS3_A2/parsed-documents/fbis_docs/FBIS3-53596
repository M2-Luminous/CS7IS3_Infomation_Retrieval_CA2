But, I was very happy during the MEED [Middle East Economic Digest] conference in London last week to emphasize the importance of the Middle East as free trade area. This is a goal to which we all have to work with (?conscience) and a great deal of understanding. And I think that this understanding is developing as a result of these personal contacts.

[Begin Brown recording] I now am increasingly sensitive about the impact that it's having on the Jordanian economy and I intend to pursue those discussions when I get back to Washington.
