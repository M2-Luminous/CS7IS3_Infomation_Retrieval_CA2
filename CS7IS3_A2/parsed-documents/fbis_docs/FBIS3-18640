The signals of increasing intolerance of fiscal pressures, which the League has gathered and ridden in recent years, have been picked up by everyone, and everyone has taken a stance on taxes. In many cases positions are fairly well defined, with programs on fiscal decentralization, tax pressure, the distribution of revenues between direct and indirect taxes, the reduction in the number of taxes, and tax policies to stimulate investment and employment. Among them, the topic which has suddenly become a hot potato is income tax, the famous and infamous 740. This is the electorally most sensitive tax, the one people notice the most because it affects their pocketbook. The Right The proposal which opened the debate on this topic is that of Forza Italia, which intends to apply a single income tax rate of 30 percent regardless of people's income, thereby radically changing the present system with its so-called "progression," by which the rate rises with the level of earnings. However, Forza Italia completes its proposal with a series of deductions and exemptions (not detailed in the electoral program), which would effectively lower to well below 30 percent the amount which those in the lowest brackets would have pay. According to a purely rationalistic calculation, this system, which would reduce the revenue coming from the highest tax brackets and maintain more or less unchanged that coming from the medium and lower brackets, would lead to an overall reduction of taxation. Forza Italia's economists believe that the reduction would be more than compensated for by receipts from taxable income from many of those people who have until now evaded, owing to, among other things, excessively high rates. Among the parties of the right, the League's program, which devotes a large amount of space to tax federalization, limits itself, on the issue of personal income tax, to proposing a reduction in the levy, without further details. The National Alliance's program proposes "lightening the tax pressure on citizens and on companies, while adopting special forms of protection for families in general and for single-income families in particular." The Center The Pact for Italy lists seven "pacts" which Italy's citizens need to make with the state. The first of these is the "tax pact." On personal income tax, there are two proposals: the first is for a "tax rate structure which means that, taking the different taxes as a whole, in no case will the total amount levied exceed one-third of the income of any physical person or corporate body;" while the second provides that "personal income tax should refer not to the single individual but to the family nucleus." This is what is presented in the official program. Yesterday Pact leader Mario Segni spoke of reducing the number of tax rates to three or four (from the present seven) and introducing tax deductions for the lowest brackets. Augusto Fantozzi, a lecturer in tax law and the draftsman of the taxation portion of the Pact's program, distancing himself a little from the maximum rate of one-third of income, spoke yesterday of reducing the maximum rate to 40 to 45 percent. The Italian Popular Party has not yet published its electoral program. The Left The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also devoted much space to its tax reform program. For personal income tax in particular, the proposal is to reduce the number of tax rate levels, setting the maximum level at approximately 40 percent. The reduction in income which this solution would involve could be offset by the elimination of a large part of the deductions, and reducing privileges and possibilities of evasion. The Democratic Alliance [AD] too denounces the excessive level of tax rates and suggests that they be reduced. However, its program becomes original when it suggests "converting personal income tax into a tax with a high degree of expense deductions, along the U.S. model. This -- as is written in the AD program -- would make it possible to introduce a generalized conflict of interests between taxpayers, with everyone having an interest in documenting the income of the other, in order to be able to deduct it as costs, thereby facilitating a widening of the tax base." The AD also proposes "shifting the burden of income tax from work to a tax on consumption, with particular emphasis on reducing the taxation on income from dependent employment." Communist Renewal finally, proposes "reducing income tax, with priority given to incomes equal to or below the average wage of an operator in the industrial sector and with the total recovery of fiscal "drag." In order to increase tax equity and recover income Communist Renewal proposes "including all income toward the personal income tax and thereby eliminating areas of erosion, elusion, and evasion, not to mention the many tax reductions."
