A resolution adopted unanimously at a Council meeting in Cape Town urged it to ensure that the people of Natal were freely able to exercise their right to vote. Supporting the motion, ANC [African National Congress] Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa said Natal posed the greatest challenge to the TEC's authority. He said people were being trained and armed by white conservative farmers in Northern Natal with the apparent aim of "serving the stated goal of certain parties" that no election would be held in the territory. "The TEC cannot pussy-foot around this issue. We have to act firmly and demonstrate that the TEC's powers are enforceable." Mr Ramaphosa said the TEC had to reaffirm its commitment to free and fair elections throughout the country on April 27 and no single province should be exempted. With the co-operation of the South African Government, a climate conducive to free and fair elections could be created in Natal. Chairman Zam Titus said important steps had already been taken to ensure that elections went ahead unhindered throughout the country. "We are now looking at reinforcing what is there already."
