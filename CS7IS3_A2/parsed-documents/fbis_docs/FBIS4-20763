If people are educated and save water at a rate between 10 and 20 percent, this would provide a large quantity of water to fill current and future water needs. He explained, in his lecture entitled "Water in the Arabian Peninsula: Opportunities and Challenges," which he delivered this month at the College of Engineering at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University in Jeddah, that rising consumption in the period 1980-1990 led to the depletion of groundwater in the shallow and deep strata. It caused a constant decline of the water level in valley sediments in most provinces of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates [UAE], Oman, and Yemen. The agricultural renaissance, especially in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman also led to the use of large quantities of groundwater, mostly from the deep strata. It is noteworthy that the quantities extracted from the deep strata, layered one over the other, and which cover vast areas of the Arabian peninsula, exceed many-times-over the quantities of (potable) water substituted for it. The extracted water was more than 10 times the amount of drinking water, which will lead to the large-scale depletion of water, if the small available quantity of surface water, ground water, desalinated water, and treated water is compared to the demand for water for various uses in all the countries of the Arabian peninsula. [sentence as published] This demand has increased from 6 billion cubic meters in 1980 to 22.5 billion cubic meters in 1990. It appears that the shortfall between available water and the demand for water was met with groundwater, especially from the deep strata. Additionally, in the same way, with the growth of agricultural activity in the countries of the Arabian peninsula, the improved standard of living and the increased population will lead to an increased demand for water, expected to reach 31.5 billion cubic meters in the year 2000, and 35.5 billion cubic meters by 2010, compared with the amount estimated for 1980, about 6 billion cubic meters. The agricultural sector's share of this water will be 26.5 billion cubic meters by the year 2000 and 29 billion cubic meters by 2010. In order to satisfy future water demand, additional desalination plants will have to be built and, to a large extent, groundwater will have to be depleted in all these countries, especially in the deep strata. Groundwater will reach 25 billion cubic meters in the year 2000 and 28 billion cubic meters by the year 2010. 'Abd-al-Razzaq explained that there is a need to study alternative options for water sources in the Arabian peninsula, while taking social and economic factors into consideration. These alternatives may include a large degree of reliance on increasing use of high-quality groundwater for drinking, even if this water is located far from large population centers, instead of its present use for agricultural purposes. There should be work on increasing substitute (potable) quantities from the flow of floodwater and rain to the water-bearing strata close to the surface by using various substitute means and increasing use of treated water (healthy runoff) in agriculture, tree planting, and industry, as well as work on increasing quantities of surface water by "emulsifying" and "seeding" the clouds. This can be done in the southwest provinces of Saudi Arabia, and most parts of Yemen and southeastern Oman, while enacting awareness and educational programs for agricultural, household, and industrial consumption. These programs would be one of the permanent and ongoing programs for affected institutions in the water sector. He pointed out that demand for desalinated water has grown by large degrees in the last 10 years, due to population growth, especially in the cities, and the improved standard of living for individuals. Production of desalinated water in 1990 was nearly 1.6 billion cubic meters from the stations located on the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts, and is expected to reach 2.9 billion cubic meters by the year 2000. This expensive water, without awareness, will serve to meet the water needs of the coastal cities, especially those on the Arabian Gulf coast, as the groundwater in this area is highly saline. The lecturer shed light on the role of dams in developing water resources, indicating that 227 dams exist, most of them small, in the Arabian peninsula, of which 190 are in Saudi Arabia. He said that a large number of these dams are in western and southwestern Saudi Arabia, and that there are future plans to construct 77 dams in various parts of the Arabian peninsula in the near future. He said that the implementation of a program of integrated maintenance includes the elimination of alluvial sediment behind dams, or getting rid of it with appropriate engineering designs. It is also necessary to have advanced operating plans on sound scientific bases for the stock of surface water in the valleys' sedimentary strata, for use as needed. This would be an alternative to storing it behind the dams for long periods and losing it to evaporation. He added that the development of dams must be emphasized, and, in particular, study of the use of expandable dams to solve sedimentary problems by detouring runoff to agricultural lands located near valley streams. 'Abd-al-Razzaq mentioned that the deep strata that extend below a large part of the Arabian peninsula contain large amounts of water, but not to the degree that some think, that it cannot be depleted. The water collected in these strata over long periods of time, between 20-40,000 years. He said that there was a big difference in the concept of water stock between these figures, which appeared in a study from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, and statistics from the previous five year plan, which illustrated studies carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water. The figures of the University of Petroleum and Minerals relies on an estimate of stored quantities in a total volume of strata at about 32 trillion cubic meters used a major factor in storage, which is open to doubt. This is apart from the variety of the water, while the quantities of stored water referred to in the previous plan were estimated at about 1.5 trillion cubic meters. This quantity can be pumped from these strata using available pumping technology. It would reduce the water level or water pressure to 300 meters below ground surface. It is difficult to pump water from great depths, given that some of the deep strata are located at depths of more than 1,500 meters below the ground surface; this water generally needs to be chilled and its quality improved. He said that he estimates the stock of technically recoverable deep-strata groundwater at about 2.5 billion cubic meters, and that this stock should be conserved for future generations, for the use of groundwater in agricultural activity for food self-sufficiency, and especially the production of wheat for all the countries of the region, which encouraged agricultural development. Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq added that there are scientific and technical factors playing a significant role in the pumping of groundwater from the bowels of the earth, especially from the deep strata layered one over the other in the eastern Arabian peninsula. Constant, ongoing pumping leads to disturbances in the balance of water pressure in the confined strata, and the water leaks from stratum to stratum through cracks in them. Good-quality water mixes with non-potable water. The pumping process is extremely sensitive in areas located near the sea, as ongoing pumping may lead to the mingling of saline seawater with sweet groundwater, especially in the eastern Arabian peninsula. He said that it is important to create a program to educate and make people aware of water consumption in order to deal with the primary bases of building foundations, to monitor the assembly of equipment systems that provide large quantities of water, and the system of irrigation. Specialized agencies dealing with standards and specifications have an important role to play, with standards for imported goods focused solely on water-supply appliances, and clarifying quantities supplied through these appliances and equipment. There was also the question of energy used to heat water. This was at a time when real estate loan funds, plentiful in most of the GCC states, could play an important role in this field. They could do this by giving financial incentives to borrowers who use water supply appliances in their homes. Dr. Muhammad Jamil 'Abd-al-Razzaq said that all the countries of the region should prepare and update their short- and long-term water plans. There is a need for water legislation for various uses, to delimit demand for water and available sources until the year 2030; and there was a need for ongoing training at all levels, from the laborer to the director-general. He spoke of the doubts that still exist about treated water and the possible presence of viruses. He said the possibility of using this water in agriculture and industry requires specific laws regarding the chemical and biological varieties of the water, in addition to specific laws for use, and ongoing monitoring to put an end to pollution of groundwater. He said that future water studies will require parallel studies on environmental impact and economic cost, as the wisest use of water in the future will require further detailed studies of groundwater, especially in the deep strata, to discover their hydraulic properties and the water type. Increased knowledge could aid in the development of an appropriate and comprehensive plan for the best use of water, especially in light of future growth. For his part, Mr. Mustafa Nuri 'Uthman, Director of the Western Province Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water, said, commenting on Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq's lecture, "There is natural water leakage between strata, and leakage that is the result of poor drilling. I would like to question the researcher about the figures he mentioned in his lecture. Are they estimates? On another front, we must choose between water security and food security. We want to drink, and we want to eat. Why are we thinking of the geologic aspects only, and ignoring society, which needs food, and the factories that require operation? Why doesn't he make a connection between soil and water and agriculture? As far as making people aware of consumption, why are we speaking of theoretical solutions? I am a practical man, and I want to listen to practical solutions that enable a man in his home or on his farm to use an awareness program spontaneously and quickly. The concept of awareness should be part of the school curriculum. We have a desert climate, and we must adapt ourselves and our children to the needs of this environment. I also find that trainers in the geological field join training programs only to get a promotion, and not to raise his scientific level." Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq said, in response to Mr. Mustafa Nuri's question, that the lack of water usage statistics illustrating consumption in every city is the thing that has prevented any researcher from obtaining accurate information. "For that reason," he said, "we find that information on individual consumption is contradictory. Monitoring of inter-strata leakage resulting from the random drilling of wells requires a great deal of manpower so one can implement present codes in order to seize wells that violate them. Many of the wells can be dug in one night." He explained that regarding the number he had mentioned for the consumption of treated water in 1992, 217 million cubic meters had been consumed in Saudi Arabia, and the rest in the other countries. On the awareness of consumption in line with a cultural program, he said that he supports that, just as he supports the need to consider food security by emphasizing agriculture in the water-rich provinces, or conserving this water for future generations. On another front, Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghaffar Ba-Zuhayr, as submitted Dean of Graduate Study and Scientific Research in the College of Earth Science at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University said, commenting on the lecture, said that treated water in Saudi Arabia has not been given a chance; nor have factories and hospitals been required to use it for their needs other than human consumption. Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq confirmed that there is a need for a detailed study of some of the strata that extend over large areas. In addition, all the wells that have been dug should be recorded. There is, he said, a suitable opportunity to obtain physical information from oil companies.
