Did he think that he should now ease the warlike atmosphere derived from the sudden regulations and stringent audits and inspections and the like? Last September 23, at the lunch table in the main building of the Blue House, YS talked with Chang Sang-tae, the head of the Dong Kuk Steel Industry group and the 17th person in a series of dialogues between YS and the various heads of financial cliques. It is said that the dialogue between the two men of about the same age was very peaceful. While they talked about the monetary real name system and an economy-stimulating plan, etc., YS suddenly digressed from the conversation, striking newsmen's ears, "From my childhood I was bred in luxury in the home of an operator of a big fishery. Frankly speaking, at that time I lived so happily that I would not envy Mr. So-and-so. Why should a man like me not be a supporter of capitalism?...." Mr. So-and-so in his speech refers to the late head of a financial clique and a famous person synonymous of a rich man. If reform opponents heard such a story, they might be displeased with him wondering why should he let the rich be denounced as moral offenders under his rule. But most ordinary people would think that from now on he might appease the rich who cowered before reform." This is the first time since YS took office that he spoke such gentle words. [passage omitted] He spoke especially to assemblymen Lee Sung-yun (the ex-Deputy Prime Minister) and Chung Ho-yong, among others, who had suffered from a slip of the tongue in the process of making public their personal assets. After a long time, the high-spirited assemblymen began to appeal for improvements in the monetary real name system and special attention to economic recovery, etc. Assemblyman Lee asked him to be more concerned about the economy, and assemblyman Chung appealed for the opportunity to talk with an open mind. He probably had much to tell as a person of the ruined TK group. This peaceful sight was also a first. Would the flustered assemblymen standing in awe of the Blue House have touched YS's heart? In the evening of the 23rd, YS invited all the assemblymen of the Democratic Liberal Party to the Blue House, holding a similar event as with the Executive Members of the Party two days prior. This event was not prepared in advance at all, but prepared on the spot, because YS was satisfied with the success of the meeting two days earlier. At the end of the talk, YS once again said such meaningful words that "thus far the rich might have been too criticized." In the first few months after taking office, YS intended to spread a new sense of value saying that "anyone in our country should not want to have both wealth and honor, and should now select one alternative." Six months later, contrary to his previous actions, in the process of making public the assets of ranking public officials, YS presented a new philosophy that "the mere possession of many assets should not prevent anyone from becoming a public official." Accordingly, as the assistant Public Prosecutor-General Kim Do-un becomes a prospective Public Prosecutor-General after Park Jong-chul resigned, YS heard from aides that "his only weakness was that he had too many assets" and asked how he got them. The aides answered that "there was not problem from a moral point of view because most of them were inherited." YS immediately promoted and appointed him, saying that "if this was so he was all right and this was no problem at all." Judging from such facts, YS seems to be surely changing his mind or temporarily using new ways to distinguish his supporters and opponents. Therefore those who have seen only the strict side of YS, they say, could not understand his present actions. Let's listen to a presidential aide. [passage omitted] According to him, YS may be understood as follows. "They were whipped into shape. Because they realize the consequences, they will behave well from now. I will ease up." Asked the same question, another aide commented in more simple terms. "The same audit and inspection methods as he ordered in the early days after taking office will be no more. While up to now he has raised or lowered the standard of audit and inspection according to the times and circumstances, he has gradually lowered the standard. In short, he seems to intend liquidate the past by the end of the year and start with a new hope next year. This could be regarded as a period of transition." If so, when would YS's appeasement policy have started? Last August 12 when the monetary real name system was put in operation, YS's harsh style began to ease, many people believe. Even at that time there were a number of busy activities such as making out the audit and inspection schedule for the latter half of the year and giving an impetus to the next reform and so on. But as the days went by, more and more people believed that the anti-reformers should soon be appeased. Such an opinion was originated in the belief that if increasing numbers of the rich and ranking public officials look on national policies with folded arms and object to the reforms, these reforms might fail. Accordingly, the aides recommended that YS should surely talk with heads of financial cliques and lower the standard of the audit and inspection. YS accepted his advisers' recommendations, because he had already blocked any possible evasion of the law by carrying out the monetary real name system blitz and making public ranking officials' personal assets. He frequently talked with heads of financial cliques. After he had said that the government investment enterprises and the employers of funds would extensively be audited and inspected in the latter half of the year, he only examined in detail the assets of the high-ranking officials of the related organizations. The talk about the tax investigation of the press companies also became disappeared. The Blue House also demanded that even the audit and inspection of local indigenous unrighteousness should be immediately terminated. The revision of the Fair Trade Commission Law and the inquiry into the internal transactions, both detrimental to financial cliques, were greatly lessened. The more crucial policy tolerating anti-reformers by YS is obvious by the fact that the Blue House dissuaded the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Opposition Parties from inquiring into the ex-Presidents Chon and No who were related to the Peace Dam and Yulgok Project, saying that "causing a sensation was not desired." [passage omitted] Although the malfeasance and corruption was not yet all exposed, YS has chosen to tolerate and forget the gloomy past rather than be indignant and instead decided to move forward to a brighter future. What would have led him to change so? Han Fei-zi's ruling techniques especially liked by YS are thought to have led him to do so. [passage omitted] Interpreted in a modern version, it may mean that when the leadership of a country such as statesmen, ministers and heads of financial cliques, etc. do not voluntarily cooperate, the ruler should yield and choose the next best policy. Recently YS said to Cardinal Kim Suh-wan who was accompanied by Cardinal Soka of the Vatican, "There is definitely resistance (in connection with the monetary real name system, etc.) in our society. But I think I could conquer such resistance." Once a financial institution repaid a deposit to a big creditor with forged documents, defying the import of the money real name system, YS angrily demanded that such an institution immediately be chastised as strictly as possible. Despite the proposed improvements of the monetary real name system, he demanded that "no additional complementary measures be taken." But his recent policies are more appeaseable than expected. He admitted the issue of long term low interest bonds that he was said to have so stubbornly opposed and included it in the September 24 measure. In taking off the thick overcoats of the resisters, he appears to have made use of the warmth of the sunlight instead of the strong wind. Therefore some do not think that "YS's policy change will be permanent." Such a view is originated in the story that YS does not yield in carrying out his affairs. That is why many are afraid of YS. But it is obvious that the resistants of the reforms made YS angry. Even judging from his words of "resister so-and-so" when receiving Cardinal Soka, he seems to have had no intention of forgiveness. If his recent acts are a temporary strategic retreat for the purpose of avoiding any head-on clashes with the resisters, he will watch for a chance to strike back. As many denounce YS at a meeting of the ordinary assemblymen of the Democratic Liberal Party, those of the Democratic Faction of the Party pointed out, "Don't kick up a row without knowing the truth." This story may mean such a situation.
