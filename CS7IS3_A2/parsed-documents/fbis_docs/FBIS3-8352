Cvetkovska: "Merchandise Worth $1 Billion Passes Through Thessaloniki"] [Text] The Greek embargo on transit of goods from and to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] forced Macedonian economists to obtain their first evaluations and reviews on current and future damages resulting from the unilateral blockade. The first general evaluation of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce assesses that, besides damages to some companies' already agreed import-export deals, the southern blockade will cause direct stoppages in the economy: in production in some economic sectors due to the impossibility of getting supplies, but also in disposing of the goods. Lowered productivity because of this situation threaten to put a complete halt to the energetic industry and production based on raw materials, particularly those that will be incapable of solving the problems caused by additional costs for alternative transportation routes. The economists were unanimous, at the last assembly of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, in their demand to the government to request urgent permission from the UN Sanctions Committee for a transport corridor through the rump Yugoslavia, because, as the economists said, other alternatives are only temporary solutions that will cause additional expenditures and damages. The annual balance of foreign trade goods delivered through Thessaloniki Harbor reveals that the value of export-import deals and transit amounts to around $1 billion, and separate analyses on damages to the economy, energy, metallurgy, metal, chemical, leather, and construction materials industries, as well as railway traffic, addresses the fact that, aside from the basic damages caused by the unilateral blockade, companies must also calculate damages generated from alternative routes that will have a final impact on their production process. In the energy sector, negative influences in petrol supplies and derivatives, coke, coal, and other raw materials, are expected. Based on the country's energy reserves for 1994, it was planned to provide 1,100 metric tons of petrol derivatives, and there are presently 52,000 tons of petrol being held in Thessaloniki Harbor, amounting to $7 million. The alternative direction crossing Albania is not the best choice because of the small storehouses, but also because of the limited transportation possibilities, thus the refinery will be able to keep up the process of production only if railway transportation across the territory of the rump Yugoslavia is opened, as this would facilitate petrol transportation from Bulgarian harbors. Increased transportation expenditures, this sector warned, will be reflected in petrol and derivative prices, which will be most directly felt in the economy and citizens through their consumer goods. In order to avoid these high prices, besides the transportation corridor across the rump Yugoslavia, it is indispensable to diminish expenditures in the derivatives production process. The sector most affected by the Greek blockade is the metal-working industry, which realizes 80 percent of its exports through Thessaloniki Harbor, and 60 percent of raw materials are supplied from that direction. The first evaluations of this sector's companies are that they will have to spend an additional $20 million if they are forced to transport their goods across other areas, such as Burgas and Drac. Only the Skopje Iron Factory has to import goods worth $84 million from Thessaloniki Harbor and export 340,000 tons of goods worth $106 million. The iron factory finds that transportation alternatives across Bulgaria and Albania are suitable only for small quantities, therefore it will not be able to keep up even a minimum level of production. Jugohrom has to import $5 million worth of goods, and import 14,500 tons of raw materials worth $2.3 million, in the first quarter of the year. Alternative transportation routes will add $1 million in extra costs for the first three months; therefore they are planning to reduce production to 50 percent in case the blockade remains. The 11 October Tractor company from Kumanovo had signed a deal with a Greek partner for $26 million (the water supply project for Greece), and since there is no other alternative than pipeline transport, the whole project might "fall into the water." The mines of Zletovo and Bucim are also expecting additional expenditures for the supply of raw materials, and the Alumina factory will be charged $3.4 million extra for alternative transportation routes. The metal and electrical industries will have to pay $3.1 million additional for alternative transportation across Burgas, Varna, Drac, and Istanbul, and the two "FAM" [not further specified] deals with a Japanese company and Korea, Egypt, and Iraq will cost them additional $140,000. The situation in EMO-Ohrid is similar, and by the end of the year damages will amount to $500,000. OHIS, which succeeded in finding new markets in Asian countries, will have to increase its costs by 50 percent, and this chemical giant has raw materials in the amount of $400,000 being held up in Thessaloniki Harbor, alongside 13 tons of goods worth $12,600. "Hemteks" was forced to stop production because it couldn't get hold of raw materials held hostage on a ship in Thessaloniki, worth 1 million German marks. No Alternative "Strumicanka" will face the most irreconcilible situation in the textile branch; its production and distribution is 90 percent oriented to Greek companies, which will engender damages of $12 million. "Makedonka" from Stip will experience damages of $2.7 million because it also has made import-export deals with Greek partners. Knitted fabric companies have 100 tons of knitting materials worth $600,000 held up in Thessaloniki Harbor, and "Prespateks" from Resen has 33 tons of knitting and other materials worth $200,000 being held up. The leather-working sector has been affected by a blockade from two sides, according to the chamber's observations. There are 18 containers of Australian leather for the needs of "Godel" and "Dimko Mitrev" valued at $300,000 and assembly firms that have made deals will have to pay 30 to 40 percent more for alternative transportation. Railway transportation, according to the findings of the Skopje Railway Transport company, will experience monthly losses of $8 million, and by the end of the year damages will amount to $80 million, while public cargo transportation losses are calculated at 14 million German marks. The transportation companies are multiplying their expenditures by three from the very start, and the opinion is that the alternative transport through Albania is almost impossible, because it is difficult to negotiate and cooperate with them. This problem has been stressed in particular by the Tehnomental-Vardar, Inteks, Gradinar Lozar, and Javor companies from Bitola, because, as they say, it will have negative repercussions not only on trade, but also on supplies for domestic producers. These circumstances have compelled economists to be unanimous in their request for opening the northern corridor (transit across the rump Yugoslavia), and they asked the government to persist in that. The Bulgarians have already fought for that, although only for humanitarian products. Although economists do not give up the idea of constructing an east-west corridor (Albania-Bulgaria-Turkey); still the most convenient solution for our economy is to open the transit to the north, regardless of how much more expensive it might be (its opening is expected to cause new transit prices) -- nevertheless, it does not have an alternative as a transit point for some products and sectors.
