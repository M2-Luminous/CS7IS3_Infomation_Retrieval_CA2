FR940505-1-00276 FR940505-1-00012 (B) Specific Requirements. The capture efficiency of a process shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error margin associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques are not suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an alternative capture efficiency protocol and obtain approval for it by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. (1) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The U.S. EPA specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE=G w /(G w +F w ) where CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction G w =mass of VOC captured and delivered to control device using a TTE F w =mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from a TTE Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain G w . Procedure F.1 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F w . (2) Liquid/gas method using TTE. The U.S. EPA specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE=(L^F w )/L where CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction L=mass of liquid VOC input to process F w =mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from a TTE Procedure L contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain L. Procedure F.1 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F w . (3) Gas/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which ``F'' and ``G'' are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE=G/(G+F B ) where CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction G=mass of VOC captured and delivered to control device F B =mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from building enclosure Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain G. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F B . (4) Liquid/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which ``F'' and ``L'' are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is: CE=(L^F B )/L where CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction L=mass of liquid VOC input to process F B =mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from building enclosure Procedure L contained in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain L. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741 is used to obtain F B . (C) Recordkeeping and Reporting. (1) All affected facilities must maintain a copy of the capture efficiency protocol submitted to EPA on file. All results of the appropriate test methods and capture efficiency protocols must be reported to EPA within sixty (60) days of the test date. A copy of the results must be kept on file with the source for a period of five (5) years.
