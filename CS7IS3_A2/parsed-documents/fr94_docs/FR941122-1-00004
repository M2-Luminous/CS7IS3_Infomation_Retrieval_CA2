FR941122-1-00004 FR941122-1-00001 The requirement under the Leland Act to eliminate enhanced funding levels for certain Program activities, resulted in the need for the Department to revise forms FNS&hyph;366A, Budget Projection, and SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report to include a column for reporting activities funded at the 50 percent funding rate. The SF&hyph;269 is a nationwide form required by OMB to be used by all government agencies to report financial status. The Department regulations at 7 CFR 3015.84 implemented this mandatory use of SF&hyph;269. The revisions have been sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been approved under OMB No. 0584&hyph;0083 for the FNS&hyph;366A and 0505&hyph;0008 for the SF&hyph;269. OMB also requires the use of form SF&hyph;270 when an agency wants to adjust the Program's financial status when the letter-of-credit is not used. The Department regulations at 7 CFR 3015.84(b) implemented this mandatory use of SF&hyph;270. A specific reference to the use of form SF&hyph;270 for Food Stamp Program purposes appears in ยง277.11 of this proposed action. While the form is approved for use by OMB under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008, the Department had inadvertently neglected to inform OMB of the burden hours associated with the use of this form for Food Stamp Program purposes. For Food Stamp Program purposes only, burden associated with SF&hyph;270 is estimated to average l hour per response. This estimated burden assumes that each respondent (53 State welfare agencies) would submit a SF&hyph;270 at least three times annually. Thus, burden associated with OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008 will increase an estimated 159 hours annually. Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the increased burden estimate will be forwarded to OMB for inclusion into the overall burden estimates approved under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008. The public reporting burden discussed in the previous paragraphs for OMB Nos. 0584&hyph;0083 and 0505&hyph;0008 includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of the information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the State Management Section, Program Accountability Division (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503, Attn: Wendy Taylor, Desk Officer for FNS. The remaining provisions of this proposed rulemaking do not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by OMB. Background The Leland Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), signed on August 10, 1993, made a number of changes to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (the Food Stamp Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to the administrative funding rate provisions established in Section 13961 of the Leland Act. These provisions are discussed in the following paragraphs. Most State agency food stamp administrative costs are reimbursed by the Department's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the Federal reimbursement rate of 50 percent. However, certain State agency activities are reimbursed at higher or ``enhanced'' rates, including fraud control, automated data processing (ADP) system development, and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement (SAVE). Under the current rules in 7 CFR 277.4, 277.15, 277.18, and 277.19 of Food Stamp Program Regulations, the Federal reimbursement rates for these activities were, until April 1, 1994, 75 percent for fraud control, 75 or 63 percent for ADP development, and 100 percent for SAVE. Section 13961 of the Leland Act reduces the Federal reimbursement rate for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs to the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement level. The new rate was effective April 1, 1994 and applies to costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994. Costs for a particular activity listed above for which a legal liability to pay existed at or before the close of business on March 31, 1994 may be claimed at the enhanced rate in effect at that time for the particular activity. Costs satisfying this condition are direct costs of goods and other property delivered to and accepted by the State or local agency; direct costs of services rendered to the State or local agency by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees; and associated indirect costs. All costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994, including costs for which obligations (encumbrances) but not liabilities to pay had been created before April 1, 1994, shall be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate unless written approval is subsequently received from FNS delaying the effective date, under certain specified circumstances, as explained below. If FNS grants such approval after the April 1, 1994 effective date, an appropriate adjustment in Federal funding will be made. Fraud Control Activity_Sections 277.4, 277.15, 272.2 On August 10, 1979, the Department published a final rule at 44 FR 47037 which allows enhanced Federal reimbursement at the 75 percent rate for food stamp investigations and prosecutions. Food Stamp Program regulations also refer to Federal reimbursement as Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The Department set out the procedures for State agencies to receive 75 percent FFP for fraud control activity in that rule. Section 13961 of the Leland Act amended Section 16 of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2025) to reduce the Federal reimbursement rate for fraud control activity from 75 percent to the regular 50 percent rate. The new rate is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. The new rate applies to food stamp investigations, prosecutions, administrative disqualification hearings, claims collections, and other allowable fraud control activity. It applies to all such costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994.
