[Begin recording] [Kravchuk] Black Sea Fleet problems were at the center of attention, but the meeting between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, in which the prime ministers, foreign affairs ministers, and defense ministers of both states took part, was of a broader nature. The meeting took the form of a discussion of large scale problems. In particular, we agreed and instructed the foreign affairs ministers to prepare a wide-ranging treaty on friendship and cooperation between Ukraine and Russia. I officially invited the president of Russia to pay a state visit to Ukraine and he accepted this invitation. Economic problems were discussed too, but the Black Sea Fleet issue was the central one. It has made our relations more acute and could make them more acute in the future. It seems to me that at this stage, we have adopted the only possible and sensible decision -- we acknowledged that we should divide in accordance with the Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra meetings. That is, Ukraine takes its share of the fleet, and that part which it does not take, it gives away, sells, or transfers to Russia according to its value, which will be determined by the competent experts. Toward the end, we clearly determined the parameters of what part of the fleet Ukraine is taking: as much as it can maintain and as much as its strategic concept and defense doctrine demand. We proceeded from our strategic aims -- how many fighting ships and personnel in service afloat [plavsklad] we need. An instruction was issued that all the parameters connected with basing the Russian fleet in Ukraine be elaborated within 10 days. The Russian fleet's base will be determined not in general terms, but on universally acknowledged international principles, and this base will be leased accordingly on certain conditions, which are universally acknowledged in the world. We came to the conclusion that we should clarify the Odessa incident, which could cause a chain reaction. The defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia were instructed to pass the directives of the two presidents to Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, and to Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of Ukraine's Navy, so that they take all the necessary measures so as not to let those processes develop, which complicate or could complicate the situation at the current points where the fleet is based. [Correspondent] Over 20 documents were signed at the Moscow sitting. Did Ukraine make any proposals or observations? [Kravchuk] We signed all of the documents pertaining to the economic situation without exception. Now the issue of an associate or actual member of the association means not only closer economic integration, but that political integration will necessarily occur following it. Others are to be found corresponding to our level -- an associate member. But now all are signing the same documents, and the same laws are in force for all. There is no need to make a tragedy of this. This is a process of formation. Europe was going towards a European union for 35 years. We cannot do in five years what Europe did in 35. The main thing is that the general tendency is going towards economic integration, and here Ukraine is not throwing anything out, but is going towards and will be going towards this integration, because this is an objective and natural process, which meets the interests of the people. [Correspondent] Does the fact that the fleet will be divided so 80 percent goes to Russia and 20 percent to Ukraine correspond to reality? Will Russia's naval bases be on our territory, and if so then on what conditions and what will their status be? [Kravchuk] I have already said that Ukraine will take for itself as many fighting ships and as much infrastructure as it needs to secure its military strategic aims in accordance with the military doctrine, which has been approved. According to our calculations, we need approximately 15-20 percent. We already have a part of our ships, and we have border guard vessels too. This is not about Russia's military bases, but about one military base for the Russian fleet. Ten days have been given so that the delegations, taking into account interests and possibilities, determine where this base will be located. This cannot be a subjective decision so that when we begin to implement it later, we see that it is not open to implementation. Everyone says that the Russian fleet's base should not be in Sevastopol. From patriotic considerations this does not cause any doubt. But let us look at the situation, which has now arisen. There is now a fleet, and the greater part of this fleet will belong to Russia. Tens of officers and their families live in Sevastopol, their children are in kindergarten. Now they suddenly say, let us make it so that the Russian fleet leaves Sevastopol. This is possible, but we should say, as for example Germany says, that the Russian troops should leave Germany, and for that we give you German marks, build accommodation for you, and you resettle. But we can say (this will be approximately 120,000 people): You leave Sevastopol, move somewhere, we will not offer you flats, schools, or kindergartens. So what answer will these people give? That is, one should not adopt a decision while being guided only by emotions and desires. All the more so when it is not being adopted forever -- a lease has a time-scale -- and there is no need to dramatize the situation. This is politics, and the masses take part in politics, and in this case thousands of people make up the masses. And no one can disregard the interests of thousands of people. [Correspondent] Information from various agencies exists that the CIS countries agreed to a special status for Russia regarding implementation of its peacemaking functions? [Kravchuk] This issue was not discussed. The issue was discussed and a corresponding statement made about ending the war in Azerbaijan. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia made such statements. Ukraine signed it, too. The point is that the CIS countries took into consideration the presidents' statements that they will stop or will do everything necessary to stop the armed conflicts. Then one can begin talks with the participation of CIS countries' peacemaking forces and in the presence of CSCE or UN observers. There was no talk about granting Russia some kind of powers. It is about the peacemaking forces of the CIS, or more precisely, those countries, which come under the collective treaty. [Correspondent] Your attitude to the person of Admiral Baltin, the Black Sea Fleet commander? Were issues of avoiding a possible conflict in the very near future discussed? [Kravchuk] My attitude to the Black Sea Fleet commander after his latest action is a negative one. If we, for example, saw that the process of resolving the Black Sea situation was being delayed, I would make a specific proposal on the part of Ukraine and would recall my signature. But as I am convinced that we do not have the right to delay, then it will not concern me as president who will be the commander of the Russian fleet. That will then be Russia's affair. Therefore, I have refrained from making a corresponding statement up to now and from recalling my signature. With regard to settling the situation, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine instructed the defense ministers of both countries to give orders for settling all of the acute problems at all base positions and to begin resolving the problems. [Correspondent] What amounts of compensation can Ukraine count on when the fleet is divided? When is the visit by Russia's president expected? [Kravchuk] It still has to be calculated on defined principles how much the ships, which will be handed over to Russia, and the Russian fleet's basing [bazuvannya] will be worth. How much it comes to all together depends on how much will be offered. The Russian president's visit will become real when we have prepared the wide-ranging treaty on friendship and cooperation between Ukraine and Russia. [Correspondent] As the economic union envisages that a fully-fledged member does not have the right to enter another economic union without permission, will it not be that permanent and fully-fledged members of the economic union will essentially be cut off from the European community? [Kravchuk] There is a certain problematic situation for (?the country), but there is also the reality that one is still a long way from fully-fledged membership of the European Union. In my opinion, a union as a phenomenon in world politics is a temporary phenomenon, which leads to the division of the world into blocs, political groupings, and military interests. If one is to speak from a broad aspect, the problem is in integrating unions' bases. I think that society will realize this itself, and the CIS is uniting into a union because of this too. At present, we are not reaching beyond the level of all of our possibilities, which are within the framework of the CIS. One should live according to one's means. With regard to dividing the Black Sea Fleet, 50 percent each way, -- this has already been divided, we agreed to this both in Yalta and in Zavidovo. Now they are 50 percent of ours. I am not going to name precise figures. We take 400 ships (200 of ours and 200 Russian ones). This has already been divided. Of our 200, we need 20 percent, and those which we do not need, we sell to Russia according to the value in the appraisal, which will have been made. [Correspondent] A political evaluation of the consequences of the elections in Ukraine has not been heard from you yet. A congress of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has taken place, where Leonid Kuchma was proposed as the candidate for president. Tomorrow Rukh will surely propose Vyacheslav Chornovil. What is your attitude to yourself as a future candidate for president? [Kravchuk] I proceed from the fact that there is a law "On Elections of a President" and that people propose their candidacies in accordance with this law. This is the right of everyone and of those people who have proposed a candidate for president. This is a normal process. It is important for me that the president's status be clearly defined. One can elect a president with the current status too, that is elect a president as head of state and head of executive authority, which is noted in the Constitution. I understand that if elections of a president take place and changes are not made to the constitution -- and I do not think that this will be very easy for 338 deputies to do -- that the president is only a head of state. Then the following collision will arise: At the same time as elections of a president, bodies of power are elected, the structure of which does not envisage a president with executive functions. That is, a president is elected as head of executive power, but the functions and possibilities for executing one's powers are taken away. As I understand it, the councils do not envisage a president with executive powers. A president could be elected who will not have anything or anyone to direct, but then in order to take away his executive powers again, the tug of war will begin again. He can ask for a referendum or the people will agree to leave him the functions of head of state and head of executive power, and if the people agree to this in a referendum, then it will be necessary to create presidential structures again. It will end where it began. The main problem in elections of a parliament is the winning over of non-party deputies, who are 51 or 52 percent of those elected. Who will manage to get them on their side? It is too soon to make predictions at the moment, as not all deputies have been elected yet. [end recording]
