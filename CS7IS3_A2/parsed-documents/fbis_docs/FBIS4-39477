Broadcasts are currently from 0700 through 2200, and in the near future they will be around the clock. A powerful autonomous transmitter makes it possible to cover a number of rural areas as well as the oblast center. "Although the bulk of the time is devoted to music programs," Aleksey Kuimov, general director of "Novaya Volna," says, "we are also devoting paramount attention to timely new reporting. There is a summary of the latest news every hour. Our correspondents phone in their reports from the scene. We will also be staging a kind of talk show, giving representatives of parties and entrepreneurs a chance to say their piece." It is worth noting that the co-owners of the new radio station -- apart from the well-known "Tsaritsyn Dvor" trading and industrial firm -- include professional media journalists whom Volgograders know well from broadcasts on the local "South of Russia" cable tv.
