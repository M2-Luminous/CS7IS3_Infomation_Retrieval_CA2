They have returned one after the other to Beijing in recent days. Reportedly, the Political Bureau will hold an enlarged meeting within the next few days to study the current political and economic situation and work out relevant countermeasures. During the politically sensitive period in May, General Secretary Jiang Zemin assumed personal command in Beijing while vice chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen of the Central Military Commission inspected group armies of the navy and the ground forces respectively. With two topics in mind, the other Political Bureau members left for inspection tours of other localities. Following his visit to Inner Mongolia in early May to find out about the unity situation among various nationalities and the circumstances of large and medium state enterprises, Premier Li Peng made a five-day inspection tour of Jiangsu from 17 to 22 May. In particular, he inspected local commodity production bases and large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the course of economic development, he urged them to maintain a balance between local interests and central needs. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji inspected grain production and the grain purchase and marketing system of the Hangjiahu plain from late April to early May. He handled the question of cultivated land lying idle in the coastal areas, called for settling the problem through legislation, and urged the local government to keep prices under control. Later, he summoned an economic work conference of seven central plain provinces in Wuhan and Zhengzhou from 13 to 22 May to settle the problems in grain and cotton production, purchase, and marketing and to check the deficits of the state enterprises in these provinces. Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee in charge of party affairs, inspected Henan's rural areas from 14 to 18 May to specially resolve the problems of party organizations at the basic levels. He called on the party organizations to unite the masses and maintain stability. Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, visited five northern European nations from 18 to 22 May. Following a private visit to Australia and New Zealand, Tian Jiyun returned to China via Hong Kong on 12 May and made a seven-day inspection tour of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Qian Qichen inspected Sichuan and Li Lanqing inspected Guangdong's Zhuhai while Wu Bangguo, Chen Xitong, and Jiang Chunyun made investigations and studies of their respective regions. Following their inspection tours of various localities, it is said that the Political Bureau members will hold meetings in Beijing to settle state enterprise deficits, suspension of production, and unemployment and petitions arising from these, as well as the problems of a standstill in agricultural production, peasants allowing their fields to lie idle, difficulties in purchasing and selling grain and cotton, the issuance of IOU's, and peasants' complaints. Viewed from the overall situation, the mainland's tightened economy has resulted in a drop in the scale of capital construction, investment, and other quotas. However, prices remain high. Despite the relaxation of contradictions, economists hold that there is little room to maneuver in macroeconomic regulation and control, and the situation is by no means optimistic. As a matter of fact, the current political situation is grimmer than the economic situation. Beijing looks relaxed externally but is tense internally and massive forces are stationed there to prevent trouble. However, people in Beijing believe that the municipality is tranquil and no trouble is likely to occur. If there should be trouble, it will probably take place in the heavy industrial bases, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, and the traditional grain production bases. According to common practice, important topics at the current enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau will include emergency measures adopted to deal with U.S. extension of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, partial extension, or sanctions imposed on certain products.
