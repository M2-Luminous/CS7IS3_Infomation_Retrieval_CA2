The letter was prompted by the fact that Interior Ministry officials made statements for some mass media, alleging that thefts of arms uranium, plutonium and even nuclear warheads from facilities of the military-industrial complex and the Atomic Energy ministry have become an ordinary thing. Mikhaylov claimed that there are no facts corroborating thefts of arms ploutonium and nuclear warheads from the ministry's facilities. If the Interior Ministry has such facts, they should be documented.
