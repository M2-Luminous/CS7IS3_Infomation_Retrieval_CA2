However, the current political upheaval has brought about great turmoil in the party which involved even a faction leader and caused the defection of as many as 12 Diet members, thus leaving behind a major crack in the LDP. Intraparty criticisms of LDP President Yohei Kono's leadership for not being able to take advantage of a golden opportunity to recapture political power are expected to increase. The LDP is still plagued by potential further defections as it enters a volatile state wherein it is unable to control its party factions. On the afternoon of 19 April, two policy groups were having heated exchanges at the LDP's headquarters, where the meeting between Kono and Watanabe was under way. One was a general meeting of the Sasshin no kai [Association for Change] (chaired by Taro Nakayama) consisting mostly of Diet members who had been reluctant to support electoral reforms. There was an outpouring of criticism against the LDP's leadership over the commotion in the party. Some members claimed that "it was possible to take back political power, but we failed to do so. The responsibility of the president, secretary general, and other leaders in this should be called into question." The meeting decided to demand a change of leadership. At the meeting of the Parliamentary League for the Promotion of Political Reform (chaired by former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu) held in the next room, participants expressed the following opinions: "If top priority is given only to avoiding the splitting of the party, the LDP will perish gradually; our ship will sink"; "If you talk only of solidarity, there can be no hope for the renewal of the party." The meeting adopted an emergency declaration asking the leadership to promote party reform. Ironically, these two groups, which were once rivals in the party which took opposing positions on the issue of political reform, are now partners in their criticism of the leadership. The Kono leadership, which was launched under a pledge to reform the party, has so far been forced to manage party affairs defensively by giving top priority to party solidarity. This was the first time that the LDP faced a situation in which it could take the offensive. While it succeeded in toppling the cabinet, it in turn allowed Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and others from the ruling parties to meddle in LDP affairs, which resulted in the attempted defection of Watanabe, a faction leader, and the actual defection of a number of Diet members. In the present case, a feeling of helplessness also permeated all the factions, which were unable to take unified action and to control faction members like in the past. At the LDP General Council meeting on 19 April, a veteran Diet member lamented: "At least, Mitchi [Michio Watanabe] was able to express his views on recapturing political power. The leadership was not able to say anything." Kono listened to this criticism with a grave expression. Together with party reform, Kono intends to step up preparations for the next general election under the new electoral system for the lower house, and for the upper house elections next year, by appealing to "recapture political power through elections" and by maintaining party unity. A majority in the party believe that "the coalition government is plagued with various contradictions in policy and in other areas; it will be a matter of time for the new administration to come to an impasse" (according to a senior LDP official). However, the LDP's prospects for recapturing the government also remain uncertain. A young Diet member belonging to the Obuchi faction says, "If another coup d'etat occurs, the LDP will certainly face the danger of a major breakup." A sense of crisis is already spreading in the party.
