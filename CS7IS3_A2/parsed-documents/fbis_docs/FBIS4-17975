Spring is in Moscow on an official visit. "I expect to see progress in two directions as a result of the present visit: on the political front and in the economy," Spring stressed. "For the first, a broad range of international problems -- among them, reform of the UN, disarmament, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and the latest events in Russia and the region -- are to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. On many of these issues, our positions are very close and we hope to strengthen the mutual understanding we have achieved and to map out prospects for future work." One important practical result of the visit should be the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on avoiding double taxation. "Today, I had meetings with representatives of Irish business circles in Moscow," Spring said, "and all of them drew my attention to the importance of adopting a document of this kind. "Generally speaking, we are very proud of the successes of Irish business in your country," Spring emphasized, "and are doing everything we can through diplomatic channels to assist it." Muscovites are well aware of Irish company Aer Rianta's joint ventures -- the Irish House on Arbat Street and the Duty Free shops at Sheremetyevo II and in a number of the capital's hotels. Other Irish companies are following Aer Rianta's lead. I note the expansion of the Garden Ring supermarket chain in Moscow. Ireland is also involved in projects to develop Russian management and rebuild the food sector, the municipal economy, and the services sector, including those being implemented within the European Union's programs. "But the main thing is that Irish businessmen are optimistic and are ready to expand their activities in Russia. I share their optimism," the deputy prime minister concluded.
