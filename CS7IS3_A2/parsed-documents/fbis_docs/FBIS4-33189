Nevertheless, facts indicate serious signs of deterioration in production investment, domestic sales, the inability to generate jobs, and a growing deficit in the foreign sector. According to the SHCP [Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit], Banco de Mexico, INEGI [National Institute of Geography, Statistics, and Data], IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute], and various private organizations, 130,000 paying jobs were lost between January and March. The development of various productive sectors is still heterogeneous, with an average unemployment rate of 70 percent. The trade balance deficit grew 18 percent, and businesses in general are facing heavy financial burdens resulting from an increase in interest rates. The following sectors, which collectively contribute 68 percent of the GNP in manufacturing, have remained in recession: food production, the textiles industry, lumber, printing, chemical production, and the nonmetallic minerals production. As if this were not enough, prevailing conditions are not ripe for a 5-percent inflation target by year's end, even though consumer prices have been the lowest in a long time. Up until the first half of May, 58 percent of the overall inflation goal had already been attained. Nevertheless, there is an assurance a firm monetary management will prevent the transition of public administration from incurring serious problems as in the past, particularly because no presidential candidate has advocated a modification of the structural indicators of the economic strategy. The 0.5-percent growth in the GNP between January and March does not guarantee the economy can overcome the prevailing recession or that it can reinitiate a sustained growth that could dampen any electoral expectation. Financial authorities have presented this position as a departure from the poor performance during the last quarter of 1993. There are signs suggesting the hoped-for economic reactivation possibly ran out of steam during the second quarter, and with great difficulty it could progress by more than one half of a percentage point. Under the best of circumstances, economic growth could be 1 percent during 1994. During most of the first quarter of the year, mild economic conditions prevailed, reflecting the overall results of official statistics, but that does not demonstrate the economy's real condition. Up until the end of March, inflation and interest rates were low; the exchange rate remained below the limit of the top floating ceiling; domestic and foreign demand was slightly reactivated, and the domino effect resulting from the increase in public spending boosted several economic sectors. Moreover, investment recovered in January. This is why the sectors that demonstrated the best performance were geared toward countries abroad while traditional economic activities are still in a recession or a structural crisis. As analysts of the TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS have indicated, the economic setback resulting from the sociopolitical situation at the end of March will be felt during the second quarter of the year, despite definite stability in the financial and exchange markets. The peso already suffered a 6-percent devaluation with regard to the dollar in May. The transfer of foreign capital passed from Treasury Certificates to Treasury Bonds. The flight of capital was checked, but it also revealed a mistrust in the exchange rate. The cost of credits rose almost 100 percent, and domestic and foreign investments were reduced. Many companies are suffering from a loss in demand and revenues due to the high cost of financing and losses in the exchange rate. The economic expectations for the third and fourth quarters are no better. Pre- and post electoral uncertainty could hinder the hoped-for economic recovery. Despite minor growth, the trade deficit accumulated a balance of $4.29 billion between January and March, 18.9 percent higher than the same period in 1993 when the economy expanded 2.4 percent. At this pace, the trade imbalance could close at the end of the year at approximately $16 billion. The SHCP, as stated in its Report on the Public Economic and Financial Situation, maintains that since November, "there have been continued signs coinciding with the first phase of the expansive stage in the economic cycles," meaning "we are on the right road, headed for the" programmed "goals." Official optimism is based on low prices and a 0.5-percent increase in the GNP, supported by an improvement in certain activities. This is particularly true of those activities oriented toward countries abroad and the construction industry, as well as the appropriate management of public finances, among other factors. Nevertheless, the private sector no longer presents carefree accounts. For Banamex [National Bank of Mexico], recovery is not clear, while there are factors that could delay and limit it. Investment projects could be postponed. Low consumption could lead to an increase in inventories and a decrease in production. Meanwhile, Bancomer [Bank of Commerce] has adjusted its GNP forecast to 1.8 percent with a 7.5-percent inflation rate. Bancomer believes growth will be tangible toward the third quarter, as long as economic stability and political assurance prevail. For the stock company Vector, coinciding with the stock company Probursa and with the Industrial Promotion Office, the panorama is not as favorable as it was in November. These investment firms suggest businesses plan strategies for the short and long term. For the investment company InverMexico, "political uncertainty, high interest rates, and the exchange rate will most likely influence a new slowdown in investment, productive activity, and consumption." Thus, slow growth is expected for the first six months and up to the fourth quarter when reactivation is confirmed. The annual GNP is presently 1.5 percent, half of what was originally forecast. Meanwhile, TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS forecasts a 1-percent GNP. INEGI and Bank of Mexico data justify a cautious position. Except for public and investment accounts, which increased 5.2 percent in January, supported by factors of the construction sector, equipment, and imported machinery, other indicators have deviated from their goals. Despite slow growth in domestic demand (consumption and investment), accumulated inflation has deviated from its fixed goal. Prices in May were recorded at 2.84 percent as opposed to a 2.1-percent variation required to attain an annual rate of 5 percent, indicative of a 56.8-percent increase and not the 42 percent required to close the year with a 5-percent rate. Inflationary deviation will be no greater than the established target thanks to its effect on money expenditures, investment, and production. The modest improvement in the GNP during the first quarter, much lower than the growth in population, cannot be considered as too encouraging, given it is highly uneven, unsuitable to encourage more employment, and spurred by a growing trade deficit. Growth was observed only in the transportation and financial sectors, as well as in other activities such as mining, construction, electricity, basic metals, machinery and equipment, manufacturing, and assembly plant industries. In February, there was a slight drop in annual accumulated production in the mining, construction, electricity, assembly plants, machinery, and other manufacturing sectors. A recession continued in the food, textiles, lumber, printing, chemicals and nonmetallic mining industries, which contribute nearly 68 percent to GNP manufacturing. Average unemployment in the manufacturing industry dropped significantly during the first quarter: 27.1 percent as opposed to 27.6 percent during the same period in 1993. Recovery in this sector was accompanied by a drop in employment in activities such as wholesale trade, assembly plant industries, and manufacturing. Thus, IMSS beneficiaries dropped 1.3 percent and the average unemployment rate during the month of March increased to 3.8 percent. Nearly 81,370 jobs were lost in the construction sector between December 1993 and February 1994. The drop in sales could become a serious obstacle to production. On average, wholesale activity fell 1.2 percent, while retail fell 5.9 percent. This drop in demand affects mostly activities such as food, textiles, paper and pulp, petrochemicals, and others.
