FR941007-1-00016 FR941007-1-00001 Within the United States, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore have both identified the threat of climate change as the environmental issue having the highest priority for the nation and the world. The President, on Earth Day 1993, announced our nation's commitment to return its emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. On October 19, 1993, the Administration released a Climate Change Action Plan outlining a set of specific programs to achieve that objective. However, unlike SO X and NO X emissions, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide are not presently subject to formal regulatory requirements that go beyond emissions monitoring and reporting. The Administration's action plan does not include proposals for any such requirements. Carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector are proportionally related to the level of use and type of fossil fuel. For electricity, the Department intends to estimate the effect of a change in electricity use on carbon dioxide by evaluating the ``average'' fuel mix used to supply marginal changes in electricity demand throughout the country. The Department welcomes comments and suggestions regarding these calculations. While the absence of existing regulatory programs and the simple relationships between primary energy use and emissions simplify the externality analysis compared to that applicable to SO X and NO X , the evaluation of marginal damages is far more challenging for CO 2 . The effect of domestic emissions levels on changes in the global emissions trends that determine atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 , the effect of these concentrations on the both the global climate and the U.S. climate, and the timing of any such effects are all highly uncertain. The effects of changes in climate on human activities and unmanaged ecosystems are even more uncertain. Given the difficulties in estimating the impacts of global climate change, which is a necessary preliminary step in estimating marginal damages from emissions changes, only the most rudimentary calculations have been made. Studies made by the EPA (1989), Nordhaus (1991 and 1992) and Cline (1992) are particularly noteworthy. These authors candidly admit the preliminary and often speculative nature of their calculations, and their inability to estimate impacts for important categories of damages, such as impacts on unmanaged ecosystems. Based on its present evaluation, the Department believes that the existing literature does not provide a sufficient basis for developing estimates of marginal damage. Therefore, the Department is considering using revealed willingness-to-pay for emissions reductions as a proxy to represent the social value of emissions reduction. The October 1993 Climate Change Action Plan represents the most aggressive national policy statement on emissions reductions to date. The major portion of energy-related actions in the plan aim to increase end-use efficiency. These programs are generally voluntary in nature, and rely on the attractive economics of the targeted energy-efficiency improvements to attract public participation. It is projected that reprogramming federal expenditures of $1.9 billion into these areas will encourage private investments of approximately $61 billion (undiscounted 1991 dollars) through the end of the decade. These investments are projected to reduce energy costs (undiscounted 1991 dollars) by $60 billion through the end of the decade, and by an additional $207 billion though 2010. Because the plan calls only for investments in efficiency projects that have a high rate of return, and generally does not mandate these investments in the event that private parties judge them to be unattractive, it should not impose any net costs on the private sector. The exclusion of measures that would impose net costs on the private sector could itself suggest that, at present, the willingness to pay for emission reductions is at or near zero. The Department notes, however, that the plan reflects only those actions taken to achieve a near-term objective. The President and Vice-President have noted that the plan is only a first step. Moreover, it is not clear what amendments or protocols may be made to the Climate Convention, and on what timescale. For these reasons, an evaluation of willingness-to-pay implicit in the action plan may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the longer term willingness-to-pay for sustained emissions reduction. The Department notes that estimates of the long-run cost of emissions reduction varies widely, with bottom-up engineering models generally providing much lower cost estimates than top-down economic models. The Department also notes that utility regulators in several states employ quantitative externality values for carbon dioxide in the resource planning process. The Department invites comments on the relevance of these values to the present rulemaking. Comments that provide a basis for determining how a national average ``effective'' value might be calculated, taking account of states with and without CO 2 externality values and varying offset provisions, would be especially helpful. The Department invites public comment on the most appropriate methods for estimating the monetary value of reducing CO 2 emissions, recognizing the many uncertainties involved. IV.
