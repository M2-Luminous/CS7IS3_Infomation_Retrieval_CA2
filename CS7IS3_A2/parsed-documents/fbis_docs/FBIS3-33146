Lleras is considered to be an independent politician removed from the influences of the party power brokers. Although most PL presidential hopefuls accepted Lleras' bid, David Turbay has threatened not to participate in the PL election if Lleras is given special treatment because he is the son of former President Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Turbay said: "We cannot be divided up as mortals and gods. The mortals would be those of us who obey the rules and respect the laws, and the gods would be those who seek their own rules whenever they need to." PL presidential hopefuls Ernesto Samper, Humberto de la Calle, and Carlos Lemos appeared to favor Lleras' presidential bid. De la Calle said it was a good proposal to fight "against the PL party machinery." Samper said Lleras' participation could give new dynamics to the campaign. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1834 GMT 15 Feb 94) Carlos Lleras de la Fuente has said his presidential bid was inspired by civic and private sector organizations that encouraged him to become a PL presidential hopeful. When Lleras was questioned whether he had discussed the decision with his father -- the former president -- Lleras said: "No I have not." Lleras said mechanisms are being set up to oppose his candidacy, such as the argument about new voting lists having to be printed. He noted: "It has even been suggested that I run under an independent movement, outside the elections. This does not appear to be the most convenient decision given the nation's current situation."

Samper said that one of his government's goals is to return life to the Magdalena River, indicating that he would not hesitate to help the peasants and that he would return the Agrarian Bank to the farmers. Meanwhile Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party hopeful, asked the government for necessary guarantees for the elections. Pastrana also sent a message of solidarity to the Boyaca political leaders who are being held hostage, and he expressed hopes for a speedy and safe release of the kidnap victims. In Santa Marta, PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos said that given that women in general are honest and therefore more difficult to bribe, one must take advantage of this virtue by appointing them to important posts in public administration to create a climate of honesty in the nation. Over the weekend, Humberto de la Calle, PL presidential hopeful, said that a large majority of Colombians should have access to education because a lack of education is the root of many problems in the nation.
