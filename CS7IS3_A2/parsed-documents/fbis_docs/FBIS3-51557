Sporadic clashes between the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] and remnant groups of the dismantled 3-80 Northern Front [NF 3-80] continue in the mountains Region 1. There have been seven encounters that left 21 casualties, including dead and wounded, during the first 20 days of 1994. Major Maximo Zeledon, commander of the EPS 1st Command, has reported that the recent confrontations took place in El Zungano, El Chipole, Jabalines in Quilali, San Jeronimo in Jicaro, and other areas in the mountains of Murra and San Juan del Rio Coco. He added that nine recontras had been killed and the same number wounded during those actions. Likewise, the military commander regretted that two EPS members had been killed in combat and one had been wounded. The latter is currently out of danger and improving satisfactorily, he added. Zeledon revealed that there had only been casualties in the clashes at San Jeronimo, Jicaro, and Chipote, Quilali. He said no rebel or EPS casualties resulted from the other clashes. Criminal Activities The military commander reported that there are currently approximately 150 rebels scattered in small groups. He added that the rebels are mainly engaged in criminal activities and that their actions negatively affect the civilians who live or travel in the rural areas, especially in the San Juan del Rio Coco, Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, and Ciudad Antigua regions. He pointed out that the chieftains of the remnant NF 3-80 groups are El Vengador, Magnum, Martin Negro, Franklin, Flecha, Carlos 19, Otoniel, Coyote, and others. Zeledon said those rebels are continuing their criminal activities and are causing uncertainty and instability in the rural areas. Thus, the EPS will continue to fight them until their criminal actions cease, Major Maximo Zeledon added. Due to the military presence in the area and the dismantlement of the rebel groups, five recontras have deserted in January and surrendered their weapons to the EPS. The soldiers have given them security, respected their lives, and turned them over to Catholic Church and Human Rights Commission representatives and to their respective relatives. The Surrender of Two Recontras Bishop Juan Abelardo Malta reported receiving former rebels Pablo Tercero Sanchez (a) "El Grifo," who is 27 years old and originally from Panali in Quilali, and Miguel Angel Rivera Rodriguez (a) "Solin," who is 18 years old and originally from Caulatu, from the EPS at its 1st Command headquarters in Esteli on 19 January. Bishop Malta said the former rebels had taken an important, positive step. He added that the rest of the rebels should also reenter regular civilian life and continue to fight for their country through civic means and not with weapons which only bring pain and death to Nicaraguan society.
