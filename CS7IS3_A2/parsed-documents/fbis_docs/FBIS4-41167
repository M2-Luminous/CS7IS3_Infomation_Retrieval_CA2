Churkin, who is accompanying Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, arrived on this Greek island from Brussels today. The two men are to attend the signing of the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union. It seems to me, he said in response to questions from ITAR-TASS, that during July the peoples of former Yugoslavia, especially Bosnia, have their last chance to reach agreement. If this chance is missed, a big war will result. V. Churkin suggested that this big war could start as soon as the summer ends. He disclosed that proposals for a settlement of the Bosnian crisis which were "unprecedentedly" resolute were about to be discussed. If these proposals are not accepted during July, a great calamity will result, he said.
