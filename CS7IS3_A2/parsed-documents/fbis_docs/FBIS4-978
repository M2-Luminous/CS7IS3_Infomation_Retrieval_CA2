General Viljoen said in Tzaneen he believed that an election, which included all the parties, was necessary. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen addressed a group of people consisting of community leaders, businessmen, and farmers in the town. He said the Afrikaner and the Zulu both believed in self-determination and that an alliance with the Zulus was a possibility after the election. [Viljoen] I am very happy that it will now be possible for us to join hands in the future when it comes to negotiating on principles such as self-determination, and also when it comes to the improvement of the constitution. [Theron] The Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to participate in the election will apparently have an effect on right-wing groups, which up to now did not want to take part in the election. The signing of an agreement later this week between the Freedom Front, the ANC, and the government concerning self-determination will also probably influence certain right-wing leaders to support participation in the election.
