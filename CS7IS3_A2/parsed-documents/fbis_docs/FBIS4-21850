To increase pressure on the government at a time when parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible this could lead to the dissolution of parliament. [passage omitted] Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts to pressure the government. Their use of criticism during parliamentary sessions is usually adequate. Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the suspicions of those investigating the bombings. Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of political power are the most deserving for the focus of suspicion as they have the most to gain. With the democracy system now firmly in place they are unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to seize power again. It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an impression of competence. The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a good place to begin investigations although some observers have said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks.
