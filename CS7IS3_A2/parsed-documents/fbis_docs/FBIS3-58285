That there is lot of catching up to be done is beyond any doubt. So, on his first stop, the Western alliance is to be attended to, it is to be rejuvenated internally, and there is to be at least some opening up eastward. In addition, there is the declared intention of bolstering the United States transatlantic commitment. The second stop, Prague, involves constructively pacifying the four states that would like to join NATO: Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. In Moscow, support for President Yeltsin and Russia's reform policies is at the forefront. Then, in Minsk, a "nuclear-free" Belarus -- and perhaps Ukraine's President Kravchuk at the very last moment -- will be rewarded with courteous recognition. After that, there is to be a final trip to Geneva, where Syria's President Assad is to be once again admitted to the community of international politicians with whom talks can be held. Clinton's first European trip since assuming office last January follows a period -- one recently heavily criticized in Washington -- of neglect and rapt disinterest. This has entailed a mixture of basic, but diffuse good intentions on the part on the new government (toward Germany for example) along with ominous statements such as those made by Foreign Minister Christopher on how the Americans' "Eurocentric" conduct was over and that Asia had now become "the most important region" for them. This was then modified in connection with Clinton's travel preparations and was most recently expressed by Vice President Gore in the terms: "If Europe is at war, we suffer. If Europe is secure and free, we prosper." However, something of an aftertaste has remained and has been strengthened even more by the escalation of the war in the Balkans. Frustrated by European disagreement and manacled by Congress, Clinton does not even want to touch this particular conflict with a barge pole. Every shell that hits Sarajevo can prompt questions in Brussels about the practical value of a Partnership for Peace with an Alliance that has done so little in Southeastern Europe over such a long time. As the WASHINGTON POST assessed the issue at the weekend, Bosnia is the "skunk at the garden party" NATO is staging. It is true that the French let the Americans know that they wanted the question to appear at the top of the agenda, but how little that has to do with the wishes of the Washington administration was apparent at the last joint press conference staged by Secretary of State Christopher and [former] Secretary of Defense Aspin before the visit. They themselves said nothing about the Balkans; when asked, they evaded the issue, using meaningless formulas. Apart from domestic policy, which interests him and led to his election, Clinton primarily concerned himself with international economic policy issues during his first year in office. The exception was the sudden "summit" with the beleaguered Yeltsin in Vancouver last February. There, he made personal and political support for the "security partner" in Moscow a constant element in his foreign policy. Then, in July, he traveled to the meeting of the "big seven" in Tokyo and afterward visited America's Asian ally, South Korea. In November, he hosted the first Asian-Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) in Seattle. He also campaigned successfully for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), attended to relations with neighboring Mexico and Canada, and helped bring about a worthy end to the GATT negotiations on an international agreement on tariffs and trade. This year, he wants to visit "the Old World" on four occasions. After the talks this week, he will visit Normandy in May on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the World War II allied invasion, and that will be followed by a visit to Great Britain. In July, following the "G-7" summit in Naples, he wants to go to Germany, and then in the fall he wants to take part in the CSCE conference in Hungary. In the meantime, there will be no end to the flow of visitors to Washington. Chancellor Kohl will be the first guest Clinton will receive in Washington at the end of the month, after he has returned from Geneva and has delivered his State of the Union address to Congress (25 January). It would seem that the leaders with whom Clinton has the closest contacts in Europe and the ones in which he places the greatest trust are Kohl and Yeltsin. In his dealings with them, he even appears to equal his predecessor, the tireless "telephone diplomat" Bush. By contrast, the "chemistry" between Clinton and British Prime Minister Major -- the White House has not forgotten that he assisted Bush in the elections -- leaves something to be desired. French President Mitterrand has, in Washington's eyes, lost importance, because of his weak position in domestic politics. In Brussels, Clinton will still be accompanied by outgoing Defense Secretary Aspin and then -- for the second time -- by Treasury Secretary Bentsen to a meeting with Yeltsin. He will be accompanied by Secretary of State Christopher as well as his newly appointed deputy, the "Russia czar" Talbott, who with new Defense Secretary Inman, will play a key role in the changed security policy team. It was above all on the advice of his friend from his days as a student that Clinton decided not to offer the Visegrad states full NATO membership, because of consideration for Russia and Ukraine. On Talbott's advice and because of consideration for Yeltsin, when Clinton is in Moscow he will avoid the Russian ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, who has told Clinton that it would be better for him to stay at home and "play the saxophone." Over the past few weeks, Clinton has devoted more time to foreign policy than ever before and diligently studied his colleagues' "scripts." With his natural American openness, he will not find it difficult to leave behind the impression of a well-meaning partner in Brussels, Prague, and Moscow. Regarding his role as the president of the "last world power," however, the question that remains is about his desire to provide leadership, about his "vision of the time after the Cold War," which has only been outlined so far, and the reliability of his commitment to security policy, which now only involves the presence of about 100,000 U.S. soldiers on the continent (compared to almost 400,000 in the past). Regarding the Europeans' "defense identity," Clinton takes a more relaxed approach than his predecessors Bush and Reagan. Without flinching, he can accept the Franco-German Eurocorps as well as a possible strengthening of the WEU, which some NATO purists see as a "rival" organization. What is still not that obvious, however, is whether this relaxed approach is based on respectful confidence in the Europeans or has more to do with a lack of interest. This week, Clinton has an opportunity to bolster his image, to strengthen America's claim to leadership, which is no longer seen that unfavorably in Europe, and in doing so, give the jubilant communists and cryptofascists from Belgrade to Moscow something to think about. If he has a plausible concept and can formulate a credible leitmotif out of it, he does not need to become bogged down in details. In 1973, Richard Nixon, the last president to declare a "European year," was also only concerned about general directions. Thanks to the Watergate tapes, one knows how little importance he attached to minor continental matters. Thus, at the time he said -- in a linguistically cleaned up form -- that "the lira is of no darned interest to me."
