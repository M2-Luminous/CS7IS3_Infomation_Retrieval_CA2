In.: "Fight Against International Drug Traffic: France and Morocco Adopt a Drug Cooperation Program"] [Text] The fourth leading exporter of cannabis resin worldwide, Morocco remains the main supplier of hashish imported into France. Faced with this unpleasant economic fact (unpleasant for King Hassan II's allies), late last week Paris and Rabat adopted a cooperation program to fight drugs. The joint action plan, which reflects the Moroccan authorities' change of attitude since the fall of 1992, aims to reduce the Moroccan production of cannabis resin, which the Drug Geopolitical Observation Council estimated at more than 1,500 tons in 1992, for about 30,000 hectares [ha] under cultivation.[.sup]1[/] The Moroccan king corrected that figure, mentioning 50,000 ha under cultivation. In traditional cannabis-growing areas, i.e., the Rif and the northern provinces, French-Moroccan cooperation will involve projects to develop tourism and mountain economy and create small- and mid-size businesses, as well as agronomic research and drinking-water supply projects. On the repressive side, the plan of action mentions the organization of seminars on police and customs methods, the exchange of information on trafficker networks, and improved judicial cooperation. Seventy years after the French state authorized cannabis growing in northern Morocco, under the control of the Moroccan Bureau of Kif and Tobacco, French-Moroccan cooperation comes up to the expectations of the European Council which, in December, adopted a specific program to fight drug in Morocco, and invited member states to sign bilateral agreements.
