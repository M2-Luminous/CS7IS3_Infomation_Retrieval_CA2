FBIS4-35429 "drnes105_c_94007" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Egypt Al-Alfi Defends Police Handling of Incidents Al-Alfi Defends Police Handling of Incidents NC3005204894 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1910 GMT 30 May 94 NC3005204894 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has emphasized that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani was a link between terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, who was killed in a confrontation with the police last month, and the sources abroad who finance terrorism. He noted that investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi, who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public Prosecution Office. Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health condition led to his death and thus we lost much information that we were supposed to obtain from him. Al-Alfi said that what the lawyer's colleagues did was attempt to exploit his death by instigating public opinion against the Interior Ministry and the police. They made mendacious claims for purposes of instigation. He pointed out that the law passed by the People's Assembly--the legislative power--bans marches, so the security men had to confront any acts of violence or riots. He said that anyone who wants to protest must do so inside their association, or a delegation can submit objections to the Presidency but must not stage marches or demonstrations. Responding to a question by a member of the American Chamber of Commerce about numerous complaints of maltreatment of the public at police posts, al-Alfi stressed that this issue is a great source of concern, noting that there is no doubt that there should be amity and mutual respect between the police and public, since it is their information that has greatly helped the security forces to detain terrorists. He noted that the Interior Ministry will appoint a public relations officer for every police post to serve as a link between individuals and the security agency. Responding to a question on the Muslim Brotherhood's stance, role, and its relations with the extremists, al-Alfi said that it is obvious that the incidents that occurred in the Lawyers Syndicate were perpetrated by people who with records and whose affiliations are known. In reply to a question about the security situation in Egypt and its effect on the volume of investment and businessmen's activities, al-Alfi said that all news agencies' reports on lack of security in Egypt are untrue. He said that Egypt is one of he safest places in the world and that everyone can safely walk Cairo's streets day or night, which is not common in many countries of the world. Answering a question on human rights violations in Egypt, al-Alfi affirmed that there are no violations, noting that Egypt, with its ancient civilization will not besmirch its noble civilization with such acts. He said that best proof that there are no violations is the group of prisoners who were recently released from Mazra'at Turrah prison after they declared their repentance. He said that had any of these detainees suffered any abuse, it would have become known. He stressed that if the ministry used violence with prisoners, no one would come to court alive. He said that human rights is one of the most important subjects taught at the police academy. He noted that every security man knows well what human rights are and how to treat a defendant.
