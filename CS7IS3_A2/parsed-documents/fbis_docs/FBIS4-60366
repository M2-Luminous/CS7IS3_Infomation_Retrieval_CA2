This warning was issued yesterday in the Knesset by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, although he added that Israel would continue the dialogue with the Palestinians. The minister was responding to several opposition motions of no confidence. They were all defeated, as we hear from our parliamentary reporter David Ze'ev: [Begin Ze'ev recording] Police Minister Moshe Shahal talked tough but held back in terms of taking action now against the statements of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Shahal told the Knesset plenum if the terrorist attacks continue, along with statements by 'Arafat and others contrary to the peace accord, Israel will continue to talk to the Palestinians but will not implement future stages until the PLO -- and here the police minister throws in a second issue -- proves its ability to rule over Gaza and Jericho in an effective manner. In other words, if the PLO does not prove it can control Gaza and Jericho, Israel will not hand over the remainder of the West Bank. Shahal called 'Arafat's explanations on what he meant when he called for a jihad holy war ridiculous, and the police minister said 'Arafat's statements run contrary to the exchange of letters that led to mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel. The toughest opposition speaker presenting a motion of no confidence was Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq Levi of the National Religious Party, who said 'Arafat is spitting in the government's face, and the government thinks it is raining. Levi said if the government does not stop the PLO chairman from entering Jericho, we will have to stop him. Moledet MK Rehav'am Ze'evi called from his seat: If he does enter, he will not come out alive. [end recording]
