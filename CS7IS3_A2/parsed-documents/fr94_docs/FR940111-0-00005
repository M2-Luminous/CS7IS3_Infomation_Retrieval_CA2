FR940111-0-00005 FR940111-0-00001 Current FDPIR regulations do not clearly state that non-Native American households living on the reservation who meet the program means test are eligible to receive program benefits, although this has always been the policy under which FDPIR has operated on all participating reservations. While the 1987 proposed rule did not specifically address this issue, this interim rule does so in order to formalize and clarify what has always been household eligibility policy and practice. Therefore, §253.6(b)(1) is revised to clarify that all households living on the reservation, and meeting the program means test, are eligible to receive program benefits, even if they do not contain a Native American. The 1987 proposed rule did not specifically propose to remove the FDPIR requirement that households living in a near area must include an adult Native American in order to be eligible for participation in FDPIR. However, in the preamble, the Department indicated that this suggestion had been made, summarized the reason for such a change, and solicited comments to determine how extensive this problem is and whether others believe that a change in the definition is necessary. Nineteen of the 20 comments received in response to this solicitation supported removal of the requirement. Accordingly, the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) in the interim rule reads as follows: ``a household in which at least one household member is recognized as a tribal member by any Indian tribe, as defined in this part.'' This same amendment is also made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 254.2(d). Since the requirement that the household include an adult Native American in order to be eligible also exists in FDPIHO, the change will have the same remedial effect in this program.
