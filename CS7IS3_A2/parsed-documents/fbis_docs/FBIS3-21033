The defect in question is located in the gene close to the receptor responsible for cholesterol elimination [ldl-receptor] and causes an hereditary form of hypercholesteremia. The test is a combination of pcr [polymerase chain reaction] and gelelectrophoresis. Dr. Paola Lombardi from the TNO Institute for Studies on Aging and Vascular Diseases, who obtained her Ph.D. with this research, claims the test is nearly flawless. According to her, the test is not yet being used, but will be introduced in hospitals in the long term. The patients' veins have been constricting since birth, hence the importance of knowing whether hypercholesteremia is hereditary.
