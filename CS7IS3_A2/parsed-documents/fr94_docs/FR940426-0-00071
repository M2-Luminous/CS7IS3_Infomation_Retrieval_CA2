FR940426-0-00071 FR940426-0-00016 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 1801, 1814, 1815, 1842, and 1852 [NASA FAR Supplement Directive 89&hyph;14] Acquisition Regulation; Additional Miscellaneous Amendments to NASA FAR Supplement AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NFS) to reflect a number of additional miscellaneous changes: Points of contact; solicitation cover pages; contracting officer technical representatives; Technical Direction clause; and editorial corrections. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation will be effective April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. David K. Beck, (202) 358&hyph;0482. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Availability of NASA FAR Supplement The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this rule is a part, is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, telephone number (202) 783&hyph;3238. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933&hyph;003&hyph;00000&hyph;1. It is not distributed to the public, either in whole or in part, directly by NASA. Points of Contact This rule revises the list of contacts in section 1801.370. Solicitation Cover Pages Sections 1814.201&hyph;70 and 1815.406&hyph;71 are added to standardize the content of solicitation cover pages. Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTR) Section 1801.670(b) is revised to increase from $2,500 to $25,000 the threshold below which delegations may be made for COTRs to sign emergency change orders under construction contracts. The procedures in section 1842.270 for appointing COTRs are revised. Technical Direction Clause The clause in section 1852.242&hyph;70 uses the term ``requirements'' in paragraph (a) and the term ``scope'' in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e). There is a concern that the term ``scope'' could be interpreted to mean something more than the term ``requirements.'' Therefore, the word ``requirements'' is being substituted for ``scope'' in both places. Editorial Corrections A typographical correction is made in section 1815.613&hyph;70(c). Section 1852.216&hyph;77 is amended to add a note that was inadvertently omitted. The note explains to NASA contracting officers that, as with the clause at section 1852.216&hyph;76, where the number ``6'' is marked by an asterisk, that a period of time greater or lesser than 6 months may be substituted. Impact NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .).
