Nevertheless, National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman described the situation as "extremely serious" and said that "if the law is applied the way I think it will be, the effects on the national economy will be devastating." The amendment, which still does not have the force of law, reads that all bilateral aid to the government will be suspended if 90 days after the law is enacted the expropriation claims made by U.S. citizens have not been resolved. The amendment also establishes ways to avoid economic sanctions: return the claimed properties; provide adequate and effective compensation for such a property in foreign currency or another mutually acceptable way; apply quick, adequate, and effective domestic compensation in accordance with international law; or, submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with international law. Yesterday, Engineer Ramiro Gurdian said in a television program that Senator Jesse Helms had managed to get bilateral and multilateral aid to Nicaragua frozen if Nicaragua does not resolve within 90 days -- which expires in June -- the cases of 125 U.S. citizens who have made claims on 258 properties. According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, Helms has tried to get the amendment approved without taking into account that the Confiscation Quantification Office (OCI) has been operating for nearly two years. "I do not accept pressure from anyone," Chamorro said upon her return from Costa Rica. "Of course, there are homes still to be returned, and I call on those who have them to return them," she added. It Will Affect Remittances A diplomatic source in Washington told BARRICADA that if this law comes into effect, "apparently it will affect the remittances that are about to be released covering 1994 and future ones in 1995." Deputy Danilo Aguirre said that the seriousness of this affair will in part be conditioned by the internal capacity the government shows to resolve the property issue. According to him, the Sandinist Front must propose to the Sandinist wing in the National Assembly an overall solution to these claims. Minister Leal said that the Helms amendment "is not applicable in the case of Nicaragua," because the Chamorro government is implementing a mechanism provided for in this U.S. law initiative. Helms insists Nicaragua has not shown any progress and cited as an example some 28 state properties that have not been returned to U.S. citizens. The foreign minister said that these are 22 properties, and he said that these will be dealt with as soon as possible by the OCI, created to deal with 5,200 expropriation claims. The U.S. Wants To See Steps According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, this total had a variable number of U.S. citizens between 112 and 120. He described the figure, which at one point surpassed 400, as "a moving target," because it included Nicaraguan citizens who became naturalized U.S. citizens after their property was confiscated. According to Minister Leal these new U.S. citizens count as Nicaraguans because this is what international law says. Furthermore "their properties were properly confiscated according to Decrees No. 3 and 38 and they will not be indemnified," Pereira said. The diplomatic source in Washington said that "what is most important for the majority in Congress is that the Nicaraguan Government take steps toward solving the cases of properties claimed by U.S. citizens." Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, spoke in similar terms during his visit to Nicaragua: "We hope Nicaragua continues to show progress, resolving every possible case, in the least amount of time." U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua John Maisto has accepted that the Chamorro government has made progress in the matter, but also insisted that Chamorro must "continue to show progress." The source stressed that the U.S. Congress would like to see solutions "especially dealing with properties still in the hands of the state and occupied by government officials or by the state itself." Regarding the possibility that the amendment to the Economic Power Act of 1956 be approved by the U.S. Congress, the source was of the opinion that "for most in Washington, Helms' standards are not reasonable. The overriding spirit here is that there has been progress (in Nicaragua)." Nicaragua, according to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, "is the only country in the world with problems of such magnitude with the United States."
