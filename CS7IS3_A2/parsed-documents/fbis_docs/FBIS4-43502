The cooperation between the two biggest providers of telecommunication services in Europe and the third-largest long-distance network provider in the United States will bring about an international market leader operating a worldwide network, Ricke pointed out. Provided they get the necessary approvals, the two companies are planning to take two equal shares in Sprint totaling 20 percent. Ricke said the entire share package is worth $4.2 billion. This means that each of the two European partners would hold a portion of some 3.5 billion German marks [DM]. Telekom and France Telecom will have a seat and a vote in the most important decisionmaking bodies of their new partner company. At a press conference held simultaneously in Paris, the chief of France Telecom, Marcel Roulet, stressed that in return for their investment in Sprint, the two partners will be given a say in strategic decisions. Asked about U.S. companies' access to the European market, Roulet said that all activities under the transatlantic partnership have been decontrolled. If the cooperation works well, Sprint might participate in France Telecom in the long run. The alliance is the "logical continuation" of the intensive cooperation between Telekom and France Telecom that was agreed upon at the end of 1993. Under this cooperation, a joint venture will offer services worldwide as of 1995. It will be operating from Brussels and is expected to achieve a turnover of more than DM3 billion during its first year.
