In an exclusive statement to MENA, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained the circumstances of the crisis, noting that in its legal aspect, several countries--the United States, Britain, and France--are asking another country, Libya, to hand over two of its citizens for trial by the authorities of those countries on charges attributed to them. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that in this case the dispute is over a well-known phenomenon in international law called "the extradition of criminals". He explained that international law places certain controls on extradition, including the stipulation that handing over criminals is a sovereign matter which cannot be imposed on any country. Also, he pointed out, there must be a treaty or agreement among the concerned countries according to which a country is committed to handing over its citizens to the country requesting the extradition. 'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the most recent international trend permits a country to refuse to extradite its nationals. He pointed out that the eighth UN conference on the prevention of crime and the treatment of criminals which was held in Havana in August 1991 approved a model draft agreement for the extradition of criminals, the fourth article of which stated that a country can refuse to extradite an individual who is one of its citizens. He added that although the Arab League fully condemns the blowing up of the plane in question and the death of innocent victims, yet it believes that, from a purely legal perspective, the United States, Britain, and France have transferred the issue from the legal and judicial sphere to the political sphere, something that is contrary to the original character of the case. He explained that the U.S. and British judicial systems stipulate that in order to extradite criminals there should be an extradition treaty between the country requesting the extradition and the country which is asked to hand over the wanted individuals. Also, these judicial systems require that a court verdict be issued permitting an act of extradition. He further explained that according to the system applied in France, the Libyan Government can legally hand over the wanted individuals but on condition of reciprocal treatment. 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that since there is no extradition treaty between Libya and the three concerned countries, it is difficult to force the Libyan Jamahiriyah to comply. He noted that Libya has condemned international terrorism and expressed willingness to cooperate in the trial of the suspects in a neutral country. Consequently, he said, it might be appropriate for those three countries to show responsiveness to this Libyan wish and to the good offices that several other parties are making to reach a solution that will maintain Libyan national sovereignty and be in agreement with Article 33 of the UN Charter's which calls for solving disputes among countries by peaceful dialogue. 'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary general for political affairs, announced that the League will continue its efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis in a manner that will preserve Libya's dignity and sovereignty. He added that the Western countries have exploited the UN Security Council for the purpose of issuing resolutions against Libya without fear from any party whatsoever. He said he believes these resolutions are contrary to the UN Charter and represent a dangerous precedent that will undermine the world's confidence in the United Nations. Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid recently met with Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's permanent representative at the Arab League, and reviewed with him the developments of the crisis, the Arab League's role in it, and the possibility of holding a meeting of the Arab seven-member committee on the sidelines of the next Arab League meeting in March.
