That prohibition against patents did not prohibit a drug's inventor from registering the intellectual property under his name, but it did prohibit exclusive commercial exploitation. This did not prevent, through the years, the installation in the country of many U.S. and European laboratories that included the main discoverers of new drugs. National laboratories appeared along with them that took advantage of or copied the formulas. The status quo was accepted through the years but pressure increased recently to change Argentina into a country of "patents." In this regard, former U.S. Ambassador Terence Todman and former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills warned Buenos Aires that it had to make drastic decisions in an area where there are many interests. In mid-1991, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella publicly admitted that "without a medical patents law" there would be reprisals from the United States. One year ago, early in 1993, the government sent a bill to Congress in support of patents. The bill did not succeed in the Chamber of Deputies' Industry Committee because it was conditioned on the United States making concessions on agricultural subsidies that hurt Argentina. The government withdrew the bill but it sent it back through the Senate. Meanwhile, the national industry began to change its position. It was no longer "100 percent against patents." It admitted patents based on negotiations and agreement. U.S. Ambassador James Cheek, who replaced Todman, said that when he arrived one of the main objectives of his diplomatic mission in Argentina was to get a patents law, and that he would not stop in this effort. The upcoming visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore will add heat to that boiler. Pressure U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor and President Carlos Menem met casually in Chile on 11 March, the day Eduardo Frei was inaugurated. It was a "heavy" meeting without much preamble. Kantor urged Menem for the approval of a patents law. Kantor was only careful with one detail: To maintain the difference in rank with the Argentine president, he said "Clinton told me ..." On 15 March, CLARIN had access to a note the U.S. pharmaceutical industry sent to Kantor demanding that sanctions be applied on Argentina for delaying the patents law. The note is dated 18 February. The Kantor-Menem meeting was on 12 March [date as published]. And the conclusion is obvious: The U.S. trade representative took into account the note sent by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Super 301 The sanctions requested by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry against Argentina have a background in 1989, when that U.S. industry demanded the application of Resolution No. 301. This regulation allows the White House, when its verifies "unfair competition" in countries that trade with the United States, to include them on the list of nations to be sanctioned. The mechanism, recently refloated by President Bill Clinton to threaten Japan, emerged from the 1988 trade law (after persistent lobbying by protectionist and free trade interest). Although former President Ronald Reagan accepted the decision it received a two-year grace period. In 1990, "Super 301" was shelved, but due to the dispute with Japan, Clinton revived it and the U.S. pharmaceutical industry wants it used against Argentina.
