They will visit the IMF to hold talks on economic cooperation and will provide detailed information to the Fund's directors on the latest political developments. Armenia has long been conducting talks with the IMF but the situation in the region means the IMF thinks it is inappropriate to allocate money to Armenia and Azerbaijan out of the stabilization fund for countries moving toward independence; the argument is that the resources could be directly or indirectly used for nonpeaceful purposes. To dispel such an opinion, the Armenian president recently wrote to IMF Managing Director Camdessus expressing the hope that the IMF will soften its stance since Armenia is not a warring side and the international community has not recognized it as such. Once in Washington, the Armenian delegation will reiterate our country's position, that is, to help in every way to establish peace in the region.
