This direction justified itself with the discovery in the 10th Five-Year Plan of very large gas and oil fields, which made it possible to create a powerful base for the country's oil and gas production. But the oil and gas condensates that emerged, unique in their reserves, and the fields contain a substantial concentration of aggressive components, which impeded their processing, because of the unresolved aspects of many technological and technical problems. It is enough to recall that the USSR lagged behind the West for almost 20 years in the level of development of production technologies. All of this made it compelling to sign an agreement with the Chevron Corporation. Difficult negotiations were conducted in the course of several years, and a contract was signed as a result within the framework of the USSR. According to the new contract (1992), the period of validity was set at 40 years. This transaction will be appropriate, although the contract has not been subject to expert ecological examination as yet. Analysis of the results of geological prospecting work in the 12th Five-Year Plan showed that their effectiveness in the Caspian gas and oil bearing province is one of the highest in the former Union. The five-year task for increasing the reserves of oil and condensate in the republic as a whole and in West Kazakhstan was fully implemented owing to the exploration of previously discovered productive sites (Karashagana, Zhanazhol, Tengiz, and Korolevskoye). Active prospecting in the subsalt deposits that was undertaken in the last 15 years was not crowned with success, at least at depths up to 5-5.5 kilometers in a number of areas that were studied in detail from a geophysical standpoint and drilled intensively, and with which a high promise of gas and oil presence was associated. And this will create a tense situation in increasing the raw materials base of the republic, although today, as never before, there is a need for highly profitable oil and gas fields that are accessible for quick and highly efficient development. The main reason for the difficult situation that has developed, in my opinion, is the elimination in 1982 of the Kazneftegazrazvedka administration, which was formed over the decades and which explored very large oil and gas condensate fields. Also having a negative influence is the disunity of the geophysical service in West Kazakhstan and its inadequate resolution capability in the preparation of deep drilling structures. The necessity for combining the geophysical organizations of the former Nefteprom and the Ministry of Geology, which will make it possible to reduce administrative expenditures, urgently suggests itself. Moreover, the demarcation of territories of West Kazakhstan between departmental organizations will be removed, which will make it possible to concentrate prospecting geophysical research in the most promising directions. In the meantime, the scientific organizations of the branch are not very concerned about the development of methods of qualitative evaluations of fields in the early stages of prospecting work. This leads to delays in the dates for prospecting and exploration and also to an unjustified increase in their costs. The oil and gas prospecting areas of Tortay, Elemes, and others, where several dozen subsalt deep wells were drilled almost without results serve as an example here. As for the academic scientific organizations, in my opinion, they are still engaged in unspecific research, such as: "The study of the sedimentary basin evolution to evaluate their oil and gas bearing potential and determine the priority directions in the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan fuel-energy complex," or the "compilation of a prediction map of gas and oil in the Caspian Depression." The main task of the geological prospectors always remained to shift predicted reserves to a proven reserve category; that is, industrial. All efforts should be directed at exactly this. There are no new discoveries, and the old ones have already been sold at a loss, including Kenbay (Moldabek-Kotyrtas), the largest super saline oil field, now named the Munay SP [joint enterprise]. Its reserves were successfully protected by KazNIGRI in 1990, and the field has been readied for exploitation. Unfortunately, it remains to this day a subject of discussion between Kh. Biderman, an American businessman, and the administration of Kazakhstan's Atyrau Oblast. The conservation of reserves, instead of their accelerated involvement in processing, is at the least an impermissible luxury, bordering on crime, for the economy of the state. It is paradoxical that no one bears any kind of responsibility for such mistakes. It would be proper, in accordance with the 5 April 1994 Kazakhstan presidential edict "On Additional Measures for Regulating the Use of Mineral Resources for Geological Study and the Mining of Minerals," to accelerate the conduct of strict order in the use of mineral resources." The situation is no better with the development of marginal [zabalansovy] or suspended oil fields. For example, Zholdybay and Akhmeshet were transferred with the approval of the oblast administration to the Atyrau trading house. The latter, having a vague idea about the oil business, is creating the Sanako firm, which plans to invite Western partners as contractors, in order to take their equipment and technology. Moreover, they want to settle with them with money, and they are again taking credit from the state. It turns out to be more profitable in such cases to rely on foreign investments than on credits and loans, inasmuch as they ensure direct access to modern technologies, etc. The main thing is that a heavy burden is not assumed by an already depleted budget and, to the contrary, this promotes its increase. It is not without reason that world practice recommends that investors should be involved primarily for the development of already explored fields. Kazakhstan is blindly imitating Russia in many aspects, forgetting that since 1992 it has been the law there that the one who finds and produces oil is the one who trades in it. But in our republic, as before, it does not serve the workers. As a result of which the oblast that is the richest in an industrial sense was transformed into an impoverished and backward kray. As is known, 94.3 percent of the explored reserves of oil and gas and more than 90 percent of the potential resources of hydrocarbons are located in West Kazakhstan, and its significance as the main region of the republic for producing oil and gas will not change even in the long run, which should be made the basis of the strategy for the development of the fuel-energy complex. All of these arguments are intensified many times over, if the unsold predicted resources on the land and especially in the water area of the Caspian Sea are taken into account. Kazakhstan unquestionably will become a second Kuwait to the extent that the Caspian shelf is developed while observing clean geological protection. It should be added to what has been said that 149 of the 160 oil and gas fields, and five of the six oil and gas producing associations, are situated in this kray, and the Yuzhkazneft PO [Production Association] acquires its development through the organization of the Caspian oil and gas-bearing complex. This connection must be maintained permanently. The total of the aforementioned facts dictates the need for moving the headquarters of the Kazakhstanmunaygaz to West Kazakhstan. With time it will be necessary to examine the question concerning the location of the Kazakhstankaspiy shelf. It must be assumed that the industrial development of the continental shelf will start in the northeast of the Caspian, and not on the "Trans-Il Alatau shelves." The degree of exploration of resources in Kazakhstan is relatively low. This means that a significant and stable increase in oil production in the republic depends not only on the development of known fields, but also on the results of prospecting-exploratory work. Their level in recent years is sharply lowered, while, given the existing geological potential, it should grow steadily. There is an extremely difficult situation in the geological industry today. At the present time, geological exploratory work has been stopped in many organizations. For example, in the former Atyrauneftegazgeologiya PGO [expansion not identified], now the Akbota holding company, 65 percent of the oil and gas exploration enterprises this year are functioning thanks to the Kazakhstanturkmunay, and out of the remaining staff, a majority has been cut, and the rest are on indefinite leave. In the advanced North-Emba oil and gas exploration expedition, out of 10 drilling brigades, three remain today that maintain themselves on state budgetary infusions of the Ministry of Geology. Field geologists do not receive their wages for months. Recently, after conversion to joint-stock companies, the Embaneft PO became the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company and the Tengizneftegaz PO in Kulsary became the Tengizmunaygaz Joint-Stock Company. The sum of their annual oil production totals not more than 2.3 million tonnes, of which 823,000 tonnes is the share of the latter. I think it would be advisable to combine them into one under the aegis of the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company. The common process in oil and gas production is artificially divided into indicators that are not related to each other, which consist of: an increase in reserves, preparation in linear kilometers, meters gone through or drilled wells, tonnes of produced raw materials, kilometers of laid pipelines, etc.
