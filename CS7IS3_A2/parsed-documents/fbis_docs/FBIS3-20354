If the opinion polls are right, Chancey Gardiner [fictional character] would say that the Right has won and the progressive forces have lost. And if they are wrong, that the progressive forces have won and the Right has lost. Well, I go along with that. And I would add that, whatever happens, it will be very tough for Silvio Berlusconi and his men to govern...." [passage omitted] It was immediately clear that, as far as the Democratic Alliance [AD] leaders were concerned, the exit polls must be taken with a pinch of salt: "The discrepancy between the maximum and minimum for the two sides," Giorgio Bogi pointed out sarcastically, "is the same as exists between life and death...." "I am almost certain," Ferdinando Adornato added, that this evening's newspaper headlines will announce a major victory for the Right and that by tomorrow it will have disappeared. Having said that, it is obvious that there has been a success on their part. But this shows that the AD was right about everything -- and from the outset. We were right to oppose the cartel including Communist Renewal, we were right to fight for a single symbol instead of our dividing behind so many little banners. And above all, we were right to argue that the progressive forces could not win without the center, that the agreement with Mario Segni, [Pact for Italy leader], was essential. We were not heeded, and this is what has happened; the center has disappeared and the Right has won. But we must go back to this -- with Mino Martinazzoli, [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] in Segni's place, perhaps. Be that as it may, to an understanding between the progressive forces and the center...." The same stance was adopted by Willer Bordon, who seemed astonished by the observation that he did not seem to be mourning the AD's failure in the proportional quota: "We never had in mind some minor party commanding 4 percent: We were formed with a greater ambition, and it is no coincidence that everyone now is talking in terms of a democratic party, a single parliamentary group for all the progressive forces. In this respect, we certainly have not been defeated. Of course, it would certainly have been better if we had succeeded in the proportional quotas, too; but if we really did gain 3 percent, it means that we have half as many votes as Bossi. And that is not bad for a party that was formed only a year ago." The fact remains that the Right is now preparing to govern, dispelling the illusion that the "ordinary society" on which Adornato pinned his hopes was progressive. But Adornato is not surrendering: "True, ordinary society did vote prevalently for the Right. But this confirms that ordinary society needed to be offered a less old, a less `political' image than that provided by the Left. Like it or not, the contest was more between `old and new' than between `Right and Left.' And Berlusconi seemed newer than Achille Occhetto [secretary of the aDemocratic Party of the Left, PDS]." Is anyone to blame for the Right's victory? "Many people," Adornato replied, "but two in particular -- Occhetto and Segni. They did not trust each other, each was afraid of being subordinate to the other. Then one of them thought that he could be prime minister or, at most, yield his position to Carlo Ciampi, while the other was reduced to playing the Mario Scelba. It is they that have brought us to this...."
