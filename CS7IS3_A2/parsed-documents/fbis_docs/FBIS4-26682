The pace of reform and opening up was quickened in a comprehensive way, and the national economy maintained a sound momentum of high growth, people's living standards continued to improve, and various social undertakings developed further. Initial statistics show that the annual GNP was 70.242 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent from the previous year, of which, the increased value of primary industry was 23.44 billion yuan, up 6 percent; the increased value of the secondary industry was 27.302 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent; and the increased value of tertiary industry was 19.5 billion yuan, up by 13 percent. Local financial revenue was 6.565 billion yuan, up 30.8 percent. The annual growth rate of the entire national economy was the fastest since reform and opening up, and the growth rate of major economic indexes continued to be higher than the average level across China. The main difficulties and problems in economic operations were, namely, that the pace of industrial restructuring needs to be further stepped up, the range of price rises was comparatively high, the contradictions caused by a tight money supply have not been eased, economic returns need to be improved further, and the number of enterprises suffering deficits and the sums involved remain comparatively great. I. Agriculture In 1993, party committees and governments at all levels across the province gave rural economic development top priority in economic work and implemented the party's various rural policies in a down-to-earth way, with increasing the peasants' income and further augmenting agricultural comprehensive production capability as the target, and nurturing the rural market, optimizing the industrial mix, developing "three-high" agriculture and enterprises in townships and towns, and increasing agricultural inputs as foci to earnestly protect the peasants' enthusiasm in developing agricultural production, thus maintaining the sound momentum of the sustained rural economic growth despite serious natural disasters attacking the province on several occasions consecutively. Agricultural production developed comparatively fast, with the structure continuing to be optimized. Gross agricultural output value (at constant 1990 prices, same in the following) was 34.499 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent from the previous year. Under conditions where a shrunken area was planted with grain crops and there were serious natural disasters, grain output dropped by 3.2 percent from the previous year; however, gross grain output was 15. 171 billion tonnes, exceeding the quota set by the state by 671,000 tones. Cash crops continued to develop, with an area of 1.171 million hectares sown, a drop of 3.4 percent from the previous year. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Output of Major Farm Produce | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Increase, tonne |Increase Over 1992 () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grain |14,381,000 |-4.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Soya bean |255,000 |29.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Potato |2,380,000 |20.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cotton |156,000 |5.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil-bearing crops |778,000 |4.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |of which: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peanuts |257,000 |19.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rape Seed |481,000 |-1.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sugarcane |2,311,000 |-9.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ambry hemp |18,000 |1.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jute |6,000 |-13.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flue-cured tobacco |46,000 |20.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sun-cured tobacco |8,000 |1.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Silkworm cocoons |16,000 |2.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tea |20,000 |11.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fruit |208,000 |47.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Of which: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orange |120,000 |70.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Forestry production developed vigorously.

Several major, key projects were completed and put into production one after the other, including a production line at the Huayi Electric Appliance General Company for turning out 1 million condensers; the 75/80 series production line at the Jiangxi Diesel Engine Plant, which boasts a manufacturing capacity of 20,000 engines; a production line at the Fuji Auto Manufacturing Plant, which has the capacity to produce 10,000 light, all-terrain vehicles; a production line at the Xinyu Cement Works which can produce 60,000 tonnes of portland cement; and a production line at the Jiangxi Silk Textile Factory with a capacity to dye 16 million m of silk. IV. Communications, Transportation, Posts, and Telecommunications Production in communications and transportation enjoyed steady growth; however, the restrictive contradiction of transportation "bottlenecks" remained conspicuous. In 1993, communications and transportation departments fulfilled a freight transport volume of of 27.623 billion tonne/km, up 4.7 percent from the previous year. Of this, railway transportation increased by 8.1 percent, highway transportation dropped by 33 percent, and water transportation dropped by 6.9 percent. The volume of passenger transportation fulfilled was 15.369 billion person/km, a drop of 2.4 percent from the previous year.

The volume of highway and water transportation in departments other than communications and transportation departments increased rapidly. Post and telecommunications undertakings enjoyed accelerated development, with a value of 714 million yuan, up by 41.1 percent on the previous year. By year end, the number of private telephone subscribers had reached 238,600, up 65,400 from the previous year. The number of new subscribers for pager and mobile telephone services was 58,900. V. Domestic Market and Consumer Prices The market was brisk and active. Retail sales of consumer goods in 1993 was 27.952 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent from the previous year (or real growth of 9.1 percent after price rises). Of this, the volume of consumer goods was 24.362 billion yuan, up 23.3 percent, of which sales to residents increased by 23.3 percent and to social groups 22.9 percent. Rural markets continued to warm up, the volume of retail sales of consumer goods at and below county levels was 14.429 billion yuan, up 20 percent, of which retail sales of agricultural production materials was 3.591 billion yuan, up by 8.9 percent. Comparing retail sales volumes for various economic categories with last year, state-owned economic entities increased by 18.6 percent, supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 10.7 percent, and other collectives increased by 9.7 percent; the joint-venture economy increased by 42 percent, the self-employed economy increased by 39.9 percent, and retail sales by peasants to nonagricultural residents increased by 21.8 percent.

In 1993, the state lifted restrictions on factory prices for bulk steel products and some coal prices under unified allocation, railway freight transportation and power prices were raised, restrictions on factory prices for cement under unified allocation were lifted, and crude oil prices were raised. These price readjustment measures played a very important role in changing price conditions for basic products, with standards for infrastructure charges having been on the low side for a long time, and they promoted the formation of market mechanisms. The general range of market price rises was comparatively great, and the general level of social retail prices went up by 11.1 percent from the previous year, with a price rise range 1.9 percentage points lower the national average. The range of price rises was 12.6 percent in urban areas and 10.1 percent in rural areas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Price Increases in 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Increase Over 1992 () | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.

Notes: 1. Figures in value terms on gross national product and value added by various sectors quoted in this communique are at current prices, while growth rates are calculated at comparable prices. 2. Gross domestic product and value added by various sectors mainly includes workers wage bills, profits, tax revenues, and depreciation, but does not include various intermediate consumption of energy resources and raw materials. They give expression to the total annual production value of material products and services used in society. The difference between gross domestic product and gross national product lies in the fact that the former does not include net (outside region) income from overseas.
