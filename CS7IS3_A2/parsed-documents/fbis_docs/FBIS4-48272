FESCI also announced to the media that five of its leaders, including deputy general secretary Ble Guirao, were picked up for interrogation yesterday. Some 200 people picked up for interrogation on 11 May during and after a demonstration dispersed by the police on the university campus were released, according to an official source. Yesterday evening, in a radio and television message, Semi Bi Zan, the rector of the university, called on the students "to go back to class" to avoid "irreversibly jeopardizing their university education." He stressed that the strike threatened "the validity of the current academic year" which belatedly began in February and is supposed to end in mid-August. The rector called on the students "to foil the attempt of the minority who want to paralyze the university" and assured them that their "protection" would be guaranteed. This morning several hundred policemen in uniform or plain clothes were on the Abidjan campus.
