Canadian Minister for International Trade Roy MacLaren voiced the concern in separate meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. MacLaren told Hosokawa and Hata that Canada considers it important to promote trade under multilateral rules, they said. He expressed appreciation for Hata's remarks that Japan intends to report the results of bilateral discussions to other nations, and added that Canada opposes U.S. calls on Japan for numerical targets or to introduce managed trade because such moves affect third parties, they said. Canada has repeatedly told Washington of its opposition, MacLaren was quoted as saying. Hata, during an hour-long meeting with MacLaren, said he has told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that agreements between the United States and Japan should not affect other nations, so Japan disagrees with numerical targets, the officials said. He also referred to the successful Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and said managed trade should be avoided. MacLaren voiced expectations that Japan continue to promote deregulation, they said, and Hosokawa and Hata told MacLaren that Japan is trying to do so. The trade minister, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday after visiting Fukuoka in western Japan, told the Japanese leaders that Canada wants to strengthen ties not only with the Tokyo area but also with local economies, they said. MacLaren invited Hosokawa and Hata to visit Canada, they said. MacLaren has been in Japan since Tuesday on the last leg of a three-nation Asian tour that also took him to China and South Korea. He is scheduled to leave Japan on Saturday.
