The two leaders spoke briefly to the press, expressing notably their deepest condolences to the Ivorian people on the death of the dean of African heads of state, His Excellency Felix Houphouet- Boigny. Concerning the franc zone summit in the Senegalese capital, Equatorial Guinea's president was categorical, affirming that his country is ready to accept other economic measures like structural adjustment, but not CFA devaluation. According to him, devaluation will not contribute anything concrete to the African economy, in particular to Equatorial Guinea, which joined the franc zone in 1983. The Central African head of state said that Africa needs a consensus and a spirit of unity to find an adequate solution to the problem of the franc zone and the corollary issue of GATT. According to President Patasse, Africa's economic, industrial, and social fabric has been sorely tested for a very long time and as a result it would be premature to talk of a CFA franc devaluation. The Central African Republic is against devaluation at this time when Africa is more than ever feeling its way, he stressed. [passage omitted]
