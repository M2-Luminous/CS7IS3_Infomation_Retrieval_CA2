On this occasion Presidents Ion Iliescu and Sali Berisha held toasts. In his toast, the head of the Romanian state said that "after the instatement of democratic regimes in our countries, favorable conditions were put in place for the Romanian-Albanian relations." In his opinion, the political treaty and the other cooperation documents to be signed during the Albanian president's visit express the political will of the sides for a fruitful long-term cooperation. Mentioning Romania and Albania's concern about the conflict tearing apart the former Yugoslav space, the head of the Romanian state said: "It is sad that momentary circumstances, generated by the dismemberment of former Yugoslavia, that certain resentments, some of them probably motivated, should lie at the root of a tragedy and be now the greatest hurdle in the way of a political settlement in the area." The Romanian president underlined that Romania pronounces for a rational and responsible attitude on the part of all the leading factors in the area so that confrontation is renounced. President Iliescu pleaded for further support to the efforts of the international community in achieving peace. "The alternative to peace, to dialogue is cannot be but the extension of the conflict with enormous suffering for the peoples of former Yugoslavia and the risk of involving other states," the president of Romania said, who also reiterated Romania's "firm support for the actions directed towards finding a political solution, for the reinstatement of trust and understanding." "We wish to give the Romanian-Albanian relations a new impetus, to act in such a way as to forge exemplary economic, political, cultural, and spiritual ties between our peoples," the president of Romania also said.
