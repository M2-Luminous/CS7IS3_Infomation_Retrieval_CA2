To implement the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and based on the current conditions and trend of our country's economic development, the "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties" is herein formulated as a guide and basis for making various industrial policies in the future. The following principles must be observed in formulating the state industrial policy. 1) The industrial policy must conform to objective laws of the industrialization and modernization process and must be in close touch with China's national conditions and the characteristics of the changes of its industrial structure; 2) It must accord with the requirement of establishing a socialist market economic structure and bring into full play the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation under the state's macroeconomic regulation and control; 3) It must give prominence to what is important and concentrate efforts on resolving major issues affecting the entire national economy; 4) It must be operable and must primarily use economic, legal, and necessary administrative measures to guarantee its implementation, and it must support the development of industries and products in short supply and restrain the development of industries and products in excessive supply. The major tasks to be tackled by the state's industrial policy in the nineties are: to continue strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation and develop the rural economy in an all-around way; vigorously strengthen basic industries and strive to ameliorate the situation in which infrastructures and basic industries lag behind to a serious degree; step up the development of pillar industries to promote all-around revitalization of the national economy; rationally adjust foreign economic and trade structures to enhance the international competitiveness of our industries; accelerate the pace of developing high- and new-technology industries and support the development of new industries and products; and continue the vigorous efforts to develop tertiary industries. At the same time, it should optimize the industrial organization and structure, raise industries' technological level, and make the industrial distribution more rational. I. Vigorously Develop Agriculture and the Rural Economy and Increase Peasants' Income Vigorously developing agriculture and the rural economy and increasing peasants' income are the primary task of our country's economic development in the nineties. We must firmly cultivate an awareness of farming as understood in the broader sense to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in an all-around way; vigorously develop the type of farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency capable of earning foreign exchanges; and bring the volume, variety, and quality of farm produce to a level that will meet the demands of a nation with a relatively comfortable standard of living and the demands of the international market. We must rationally adjust the rural industrial structure, actively develop secondary and tertiary industries in the countryside, gradually shift the surplus labor force in rural areas, and raise the overall rural production capacity and economic efficiency to a new level. In developing agriculture and the rural economy, it is essential to seriously implement the policies and measures which have already been laid down by the party Central Committee and the State Council, and to carry out the "agricultural development program of China for the nineties." It is necessary to extend the term for contracting cultivated land; and to stabilize and further improve the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output as the main form, as well as the dual management system which combines household with collective operations. It is necessary to rationally restructure agricultural production organizations and to promote new forms of production organization, such as integration of crop cultivation, aquaculture and processing, and integrated management of agriculture, trade and industry. It is necessary to cultivate the rural market and to establish sound systems of protective grain prices, of grain risk funds, and of grain reserves. It is necessary to establish and keep improving a socialized service system for agriculture and to form a three-tier service network of the state, the collective, and the local people. It is necessary to seriously protect cultivated land, gradually establish basic farmland reservations, and formulate relevant procedures for their management. Both the central and the local governments should increase agricultural investment year by year and support the industry for agricultural production. At the same time, the peasants should be guided to increase investment in production and encouraged to use foreign capital in agricultural development. It is necessary to actively use and popularize new, suitable agricultural techniques and to advance agriculture through the application of science and promotion of education. It is necessary to reduce peasants' burdens and protect their interests and legitimate rights. While agricultural productivity is being raised, making a rational relocation of the rural surplus labor force is an important measure for promoting agriculture and rural economic development and increasing peasants' income. A further step should be taken to accelerate the development of village and town enterprises, particularly those in the central and western regions. It is necessary to improve planning and provide policy guidance to bring about proper concentration of village and town enterprises. It is necessary to make full use of and transform existing small towns, and to build new small towns. It is necessary to implement seriously the plan set by the party Central Committee and the State Council for aiding the poor, and to basically solve the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in poor regions within seven years. II. Conscientiously Strengthen Infrastructure and Basic Industries While our infrastructure and basic industries are lagging far behind our economic development as a whole, efforts should be made to resolve such a contradiction and to gradually make the former catch up and keep pace with the latter. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of "making overall plans and a rational geographic distribution, giving prominence to what is important, doing our best according to our capability, and stressing economic efficiency" to accelerate infrastructural construction and the development of basic industries. In the transport industry, a higher priority should be given to enhancing the transport capability of railroads and efforts should be focused on the development of large transport passages. It is necessary to take full advantage of various conveyances, including highways, water transport, air transport, and pipes, and to accelerate the construction of a comprehensive transport system. The telecommunications industry should aim for high speed, good quality, and a large scale; actively introduce advanced world-class technology and equipment; strive to increase the proportion of equipment produced by our own country as soon as possible; and vigorously promote the phased-in construction of high-speed information networks covering selected regions. Energy industries should pursue the policy of stressing both exploitation and conservation and ensure a coordinated development of energy sources, the economy, and the environment. Of them, the coal industry should accelerate the construction of key state-owned coal mines and promote the transformation and improvement of local mines, including township and town mines. The petroleum industry should stabilize the eastern region, develop the western region, find more petroleum deposits, and make rational use of foreign resources. The electric power industry should adhere to the principle of considering local conditions, developing both hydro-electric and thermo-electric power generation, and properly developing nuclear power generation. It is necessary to strengthen and improve existing water conservancy facilities, make comprehensive efforts to harness selected major rivers and lakes, prevent soil erosion, protect and rationally allocate water resources, enhance the ability to combat floods and droughts, and gradually solve the water supply problem of regions and urban areas with water shortages. It is necessary to accelerate the development of urban public utilities in accordance with the principle of "unified planning, rational distribution, comprehensive development, and coordinated construction." To accelerate the infrastructural construction and the development of basic industries, the state will mainly adopt the following policies: to give full play to both central initiative and local initiative and establish a system under which the duties of the governments at various levels are clearly defined; to formulate specific plans for infrastructure and basic industries and promote their healthy development; to institute and keep improving a policy-oriented long-term investment system and a long-term policy-lending system and provide policy-oriented financial support to government-encouraged construction projects; to encourage and guide the use of private funds in the construction of infrastructure and basic industries, and consider first the need of infrastructural construction and the development of basic industries when issuing shares and bonds; to expand the scale and area of using foreign capital and encourage foreign businessmen to make direct investment in infrastructure and basic industries; to further harmonize the relations of prices, give play to the important regulatory role of the pricing mechanism, and continue and strengthen government control of the prices of monopolized goods and services; to continue the policy of low-priced land requisition for infrastructure and basic industries; to spend government income from the sale of land resources on the construction of infrastructure; and with approval, to let investors of transport facilities enjoy higher priority in obtaining the right to engage in real estate development and business along communications lines and in the vicinity of harbors and airports, as a comprehensive economic compensation. III. Take Active Efforts To Invigorate Pillar Industries We should strive to accelerate the development of the electronic, machinery, petrochemical, automobile, and construction industries and turn them into pillar industries for the national economy. The development of the machinery industry should focus on the manufacturing of basic machine-tools, basic spare parts, and whole-set equipment which requires key technologies in an effort to optimize product mix, improve its technical standard, and enhance its market competition. The electronic industry should speed up its modernization on the basis of manufacturing microelectronic components and telecommunications equipment, computers, and other newly emerging information products as the mainstay. The petrochemical industry should make active efforts to expand its production and enhance its technical level and processing ability. The automobile industry should act as quickly as possible to form a production system with fewer plants but high production, and to establish a market where competition is orderly, and it should increase its share of the domestic market and competitiveness on the international market. The construction industry should focus on housing projects in urban and rural areas, the state's key projects, and urban construction. It should actively build a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market and improve the quality of construction products. To accelerate the development of pillar industries, the state will adopt the following measures: The state will formulate and promulgate a unified industrial policy and guarantee its implementation by legal means. The state will gradually establish an investment and lending system which is beneficial to the development of pillar industries. The state will also set up a standardized mechanism enabling enterprises to have direct access to loans. In its annual plan for issuing stocks and bonds, the state will make priority arrangements for pillar industries. The government will support pillar industries in developing technologies in some important fields by providing financial and material assistance. With the approval of the State Council, a small number of large-scale enterprising groups will be endorsed with a right to directly borrow and underwrite overseas loans commensurate with their capital and income. In accordance with international practices and articles of relevant agreements, some products of pillar industries will be treated as products of infant industry and given suitable protection for a set period of time. Meanwhile, part of the domestic market will be conditionally opened to foreign products in exchange for key technologies and equipment. IV. Active Efforts Should Be Taken To Develop Foreign Economic Ties and Trade We should continue to expand our foreign trade, actively readjust the trade structure, bring our advantages into play, and greatly enhance the economic performance of our exports to facilitate and optimize the industrial structure, strengthen international competition, and maintain the international balance of payments. The state encourages increasing exports of the following products: farm and sideline products with fairly good advantages for competition in foreign markets, products of light industry and the textile industry, household electronic and electrical appliances manufactured with almost matured technologies, products with high added value and with the ability to compete on the international markets, and high-tech products. The state does not encourage exports in bulk of resource-type products which are in short supply domestically. The state will gradually reduce exports of primary products and products which require a large amount of energy to produce. Exports of some products will be limited or prohibited. The state encourages importing new technologies as well as relevant key equipments and key spare parts. It will suitably increase imports of some primary products which are in short supply domestically. It will assist infant industries to accelerate the pace of importing, assimilating, and absorbing new technologies as well as producing new equipments and key spare parts. The state does not encourage imports of high-price consumption products. As far as readjusting the structure of foreign economic ties and trade is concerned, the state will adopt the following measures: It will bring into play the important role of the Import and Export Bank of China and assist enterprises to increase their export of whole-set equipment as well as machine-tools and electrical equipment. For some products under quantitative import or export controls, a system of bidding, auction, and regulated distribution will be used in accordance with the principle of economic effectiveness, fairness, and openness. It will improve the policy which aims to promote export of intensively processed products and high value-added products. The state will endorse various qualified enterprises with a right to engage in foreign trade and encourage large-scale enterprises (groups) to set up direct sale channels in foreign countries. The state will rationally readjust tariff rates in accordance with its industrial policy. V. Industrial Organization, Industrial Technology, and Industrial Distribution 1. The policy governing industrial organizations aims at promoting rational competition among enterprises and establising economies of scale and cooperation between specialized departments so that an industrial organizational structure in line with the technological and economic characteristics of industry and China's economic development stages can be formed. A market structure with a small number of large enterprises (groups) acting as the main competitors shall be formed in industries which have pronounced effects on the development of economies of scale; a market structure of an appropriate size characterized by rational division of work and cooperation among large, medium-sized, and small enterprises shall be formed in industries which produce large quantities of spare parts and components; and in industries where results of the development of economies of scale are not pronounced, the development of small enterprises should be encouraged so that a competition-based market structure can be formed where a rather large number of large, medium-sized, and small enterprises coexist. To attain the above objective, it is necessary to take the following readjustment measures: To progressively introduce market mechanisms and encourage rational competition among naturally monopolistic regional industries; and to continuously draw up standards governing the minimum production scale for industrial enterprises and products which have pronounced effects on the development of economies of scale. At the same time, it is essential to break the barriers between different regions or departments and restrict or even prohibit the development of projects falling short of the standards set for economies of scale so as to promote the establishment of economies of scale. To encourage enterprises to act independently in reorganizing themselves or forming themselves into public- and private-owned transregional, transdepartmental, and even transnational business conglomerates, doing so through fair competition, merger, takeover, and holding each other's stocks. We should accelerate the formulation of laws and regulations governing market competition to create an external environment favorable to fair competition among enterprises and readjustment of enterprise organizational structure. 2. The industrial technology policy should give priority to promoting development of applied technology, encouraging the integration of scientific research and production, accelerating the popularization of scientific and technological achievements, promoting the introduction and assimilation of advanced foreign technology, markedly improving our products' quality and technical functions, significantly reducing energy and material consumption as well as production cost, and striving to upgrade the technology of Chinese industry. The state will take the following measures to promote technological advancement in industry: To increase all kinds of investment in scientific and technological research and development through various channels and gradually increase the proportion of investment in the gross national product; to draw up and implement technological research and development programs significant for the development of different industries so as to support and encourage them to assimilate and absorb advanced imported technology and to make innovations; to strengthen planning for high- and new-technology industries and do a good job in building high- and new-technology development zones approved by the state; to push forward the process of standardization and serialization and promote the use of international standards, advanced foreign standards, and even stricter in-house standards for enterprises; to enhance enterprises' ability to independently develop new products, encourage enterprises to strengthen ties with institutes of higher learning and scientific research, and speed up the commercialization of scientific and technological achievements; and to regularly publish, in the form of laws and regulations, backward production technology and equipment that must be phased out. 3. The main principle for the policy governing industrial distribution is: While continuing to give play to the economic strengths of relatively developed regions and accelerate their development, it is necessary to aid economic development in less developed regions and gradually narrow the gap between economically developed regions and less developed regions. The state supports the development of industrial belts which give play to their natural resources and economic strengths and in which specialized departments in various regions divide their work and cooperate. To gradually set up a rational pattern of industrial distribution along the coasts, rivers, railroads, and frontiers, large cities located along main lines of communications should act as centers to bring along the development of major economic regions. To achieve sustained, rapid, economic growth and better efficiency, the eastern coastal region should utilize more foreign capital and resources in vigorously developing an export-oriented economy, especially technology-intensive industries and products which have high added-value and foreign exchange earning capability and which can economize on the consumption of energy and raw and semifinished materials. The central and western regions should harness their resources and utilize the border regions' geographic proximity of opening to the outside world in striving to develop industries and products capitalizing on such advantages. The state will gradually shift preferential economic policies in investments, loans, project distribution, and foreign capital use from regions to industries, and will give necessary assistance to major projects for development and construction of the central and western regions. The state will support the central and western regions in developing village and township enterprises, and will encourage economically developed regions to engage in joint development, technological cooperation, regular cooperation in related departments, and personnel exchange with the central and western regions. We should make the best use of circumstances to guide the healthy development of urbanization, setting up an urban construction system with harmoniously structured and rationally distributed large, medium, and small cities. VI. The Procedures for Formulating Industrial Policies and Their Implementation Industrial policy is made up of policies on industrial structure, policies on industrial organization, policies on industrial technology, policies on industrial distribution, and other policies and regulations having an important bearing on industrial development. To ensure the industrial policy's scientific nature and authority as well as its effectiveness, the following provisions on the formulation and implementation of industrial policies are especially made: 1. State industrial policy must be decided by the State Council. The State Planning Commission is the comprehensive department specifically in charge of studying, formulating, and coordinating state industrial policy. The State Planning Commission will take the lead and coordinate with the relevant departments in formulating various industrial policies. Industrial policy will be implemented mainly by relevant leading departments of their trades at the central level, with the State Planning Commission making overall coordination. 2. A system for deliberating state industrial policy must be established. Industrial policy and policies having an important bearing on industrial development, which are drafted by the relevant departments, must be examined and coordinated by the State Planning Commission. They must go through scientific assessment and democratic deliberation organized by the State Planning Commission and participated in by the State Council's relevant departments, industrial and academic circles, and consumer organizations before they are submitted by the State Planning Commission together with the relevant departments to the State Council for approval, promulgation, and implementation. 3. A system for guaranteeing the implementation of the state industrial policy must be established. Planning, finance, banking, tax, domestic and foreign trade, tariff, security market supervision, industry and commerce administration, state asset management, and other economic management departments must earnestly implement state industrial policy and must coordinate with the State Planning Commission before formulating a major policy concerning industrial development. 4. A system for supervising, inspecting, and evaluating state industrial policy must be established. The State Planning Commission together with the relevant departments are responsible for supervising, inspecting, and analyzing the implementation of industrial policy; for making periodical reports to the State Council on the progress and results in the implementation; and for making suggestions for improvement based on changes in the economic situation and industrial structure. 5. Local people's governments at the provincial level must, on the basis of this outline's requirements and in the light of the realities in each locality, study and formulate specific rules for implementation and report them to the State Planning Commission for the record. 6. Based on this outline's requirements, the state will in the near future formulate a draft industrial policy governing the transportation, communication, construction, electronics, machinery, and petrochemical industries, as well as on foreign capital, foreign trade, technology, and restructuring of industrial organizations. The State Planning Commission will be in charge of organizing and coordinating the formulation of policies. 7. The State Planning Commission is responsible for interpreting this outline. This outline will be implemented on the day of promulgation. Appendix: Several Provisions Concerning the Enforcement of the Standard of Economic Scale on Fixed Asset Investment Projects (the First Batch) To help readjust the industrial structure and enterprise organizational setup, to bring into full play the advantage of economies of scale, to increase the investment returns of construction projects, and to make Chinese products more competitive on international markets, the following provisions are made concerning the enforcement of the standard of economic scale on fixed asset investment projects for a few fast-selling products in short market supply and having relatively conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale production: 1. The standard of economic scale for fixed asset investment projects is referred to the reasonable construction scale for projects that have been recently built or expanded, and have their technology upgraded in the 1990s. The standard of economic scale is a major component of the state industrial policy and an important basis for reviewing and approving fixed asset investment projects. People's governments at various levels and all relevant departments, as well as enterprises of all types (including foreign-funded enterprises), should comply with the standard. 2. Construction projects meeting the standard of economic scale still need to be submitted for examination and approval according to the existing procedures; projects below the standard of economic scale are, in principle, not approved. However, special consideration will be given to construction projects below the standard of economic scale in remote regions with poor transport facilities and economic backwardness. In such cases, units preparing for construction must first explain the reasons for the construction and report them to the relevant departments for examination and approval; and then, based on the division of work between capital construction and technical transformation, submit a construction project proposal and a feasibility report, respectively, to the State Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission for examination and approval. 3. The state encourages industrial departments, local governments, and enterprises to cooperate in setting up limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies to meet the standard of economic scale for construction projects. For projects meeting the standard of economic scale, banks should give preferential support in terms of loans and use of foreign exchange. With the approval of the State Council or its authorized agency, units in charge of such projects may issue stocks or shares to raise construction funds in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the state. 4. The State Council shall authorize the State Planning Commission to work together with the relevant departments in publishing successively the standard of economic scale of products with conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale production, and in making timely revisions of the scale according to the development of national economy.
