The Zambian head of state, whom his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro, invited to the island, will meet here with Zambian students majoring in many subjects. Some 43 students from the African nation are studying in Cuba at university centers in the Provinces of Camaguey, Santiago de Cuba, and Villa Clara, and in the nickel-producing Moa Municipality. In the last 10 years, about 79 Zambian students graduated from college, and six finished their technical studies. Chiluba has contemplated the possibility of strengthening bilateral cooperation in activities related to the sugar industry, agriculture, public health, and the pharmaceutical industry. One of the issues he analyzed during his stay in Santiago de Cuba is the ratification of an agreement on having Cuban technicians build a sugar mill in Zambia financed by Lusaka. The guest and his delegation visited such centers of economic and scientific interest as the Carlos J. Finlay Biotechnology Institute and the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, one of the most important hospitals on the island. They also visited an agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and the Mario Munoz Sugar Mill, located in Los Arabos Municipality, in Matanzas Province. President Chiluba, 51, is the leader of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), winner of the 31 October 1991 elections, and an heir of Kenneth Kaunda. Zambia, which has an area of 174,000 [figure as received] square km, is the world's third largest producer and largest exporter of copper. The country has other resources such as precious and semi-precious stones, ferrous and non-ferrous minerals, and tobacco.
