FR940207-2-00190 FR940207-2-00084 6. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the class of shares (``Target Class'') into which the class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The members of the governing board shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the members of the governing board to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the members of the governing board reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 5 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the Advisers and Smith Barney Advisors and the Distributors. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 7. The members of the governing boards of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements of distribution and shareholder servicing revenues and expenditures for each respective class of shares (``Statements'') complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the Statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to support the rule 12b&hyph;1 or servicing fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the members of the governing boards to support any fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. The Statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent board members in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, and on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plans relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each respective class and except that any Class Expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares. 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent Examiner''). The Independent Examiner has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon this review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to these reports, following a request by the Funds that the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission's staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``special purpose'' report on the ``design of a system,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
