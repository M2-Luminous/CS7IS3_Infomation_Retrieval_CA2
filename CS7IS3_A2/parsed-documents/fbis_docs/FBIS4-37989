"We have lots of oil tanks in Aden," said Muhammad Raji, secretary-general of the Oil Ministry of the self-proclaimed Yemen Democratic Republic. "The supplies can last several weeks." Oil reserves at the Little Aden oil refinery, 18 kilometres (12 miles) west of the southern stronghold, were moved to Aden after northern warplanes attacked the refinery, causing a major fire, Raji told AFP. Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were trying to advance on the refinery Sunday after cutting the coast road west of Aden. Electricity has been rationed in Aden for the past three days since the city's main power station at al-Hiswah, about 10 kilometres (six miles) away, was damaged by fire following a northern bombardment. Northern troops were occupying the power station Sunday. But Raji said the southern authorities were using two other power stations, in the northern suburb of al-Mansurah and Khur Maksar, near the airport. They had enough fuel for up to two weeks. Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations Saturday, but tanker trucks were unable to get through roadblocks barring the route to the refinery. Raji said the authorities could still bring oil into the city by sea from the al-Mukalla oil terminal in the Hadhramaut region, 700 kilometres (434 miles) east of Aden. "The situation is manageable," he said. Petrol stations had instructions only to fill up vehicles' tanks, not jerry cans. [passage omitted]
