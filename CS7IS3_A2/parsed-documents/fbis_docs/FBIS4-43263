The poll was carried out between Monday and Wednesday [6-8 June] and is based on 1,005 telephone interviews. The Center Party moved up 0.4 percentage points and now has support of 18.7 percent. This is the highest level of support for the Center Party Opinion has registered since its polls for AFTENPOSTEN began seven years ago. The June poll contains another "record": The Progress Party's 3.3 percent (a loss of 0.2 percent) is the lowest level of support Opinion has measured for this party. But the Progress Party has had major problems for a long time, and it does not look as if the party is able to rebuild voter confidence. The level of support for the Center Party is impressive when we analyze the background material to the poll. The party has the highest level of voter loyal, at the same time as the Center Party is no longer winning voters from the Christian People's Party and the Socialist Left Party. This means that the successes of the last few months are based on the party's own strengths and not on the problems of others, and this fact shows that the Center Party has a great mobilization potential. Many political commentators had their doubts about such a development after the party's sensational election result (18.7 percent) last year. It goes without saying that the improvement for the party is connected with the European Union [EU] issue, but there are good reasons to ask whether there are not other factors that are pulling in the Center Party's direction. The other clear no parties are also making gains. Both the Christian People's Party and the Socialist Left Party look to have stopped the voter leakage to the Center Party, and overall there can be little doubt that the no parties are strengthening their positions. But the Conservative Party too is able to note an increase in support. With gains of 1 percent, to 18.8 percent, the party can be happy that the Conservative Party overtakes the Center Party in the June poll. There are no major changes in the June poll. The only exception is the Labor Party, which with losses of 1.8 percent now has 36.4 percent support, a little below the election result. The party has lost just under 3 percent since March, but the Labor Party has been able to maintain the high level of voter support from the Storting election. Its loyalty percentage remains high (73.5), but its steady losses could be the first signal that the Labor Party is about to run into problems at the beginning of a hectic EU election campaign.
