On the national railroads, sharply reduced train runs continued for the third consecutive day as only 1,161 striking workers, or 16.3 percent of the roughly 7,000 strikers, had notified the government as of 10:00 A.M. Saturday of their intention to return to work. To normalize train operations, the Korean National Railroad will utilize some 100 novice locomotive engineers starting next Monday and train more engineers next month, depending on the number of returning strikers, Korean National Railroad Administrator Choe Hun told reporters. He added that his office has decided to sack 210 striking engineers for their roles in the walkout. In view of the strike's grave effect on exports, Choe said, the emergency railroad transportation program would put emphasis on hauling cement, oil and containers. He stressed that he has no intention of talking with Chongihyop, the private "unregistered" union of locomotive engineers which is leading the strike, to brush off the attempt by "some impure-minded engineers to resolve the problem illegally." Chongihyop has asked the Korean National Church Council to mediate between it and the Korean National Railroad, a request that the council has accepted. On the other hand, Seoul subway lines managed to maintain near-normal operations thanks to the utilization of 217 non-striking engineers. But on lines run by the Korean National Railroad, including Seoul-Inchon and Seoul-Suwon, train run intervals were between 30 and 40 minutes. As of 11:00 A.M., 2,704 striking workers, 34 percent of the 8,724 Seoul subway workers, had returned to their jobs, up some 1,000 from Friday. But only 30 engineers had returned, or 3 percent of the 1,300 engineers who joined in the strike.
