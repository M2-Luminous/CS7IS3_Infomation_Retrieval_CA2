Speaking at a press conference of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), of which he is a member, Belehradek was reacting to Zhirinovskiy's interview with the REUTER news agency of January 30. In it, Zhirinovskiy said that the Czech Republic would soon lose Moravia and that all that would be left of it would be Prague and several breweries were the beer was turning bitter. Belehradek said that "Stalin's spirit and Russia's great-power policy" were radiating from the opinions of Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party. He said that the KDU-CSL was sharply opposed to efforts to divide Europe into German and Russian spheres of interest, and added he did not understand at all why Moravia should become a political card in the game of great-power interests. Replying to journalists' questions, Belehradek admitted that Zhirinovskiy probably knew little rather than much about Moravia. There may exist "a certain card" which may have been discussed with some representatives from Slovakia, because Zhirinovskiy had mentioned Bratislava and Slovakia as well.
