Narasimha Rao of moves by certain vested interests to secure forest land for growing raw material for industries. The disclosure made during an international workshop on India's forest management and ecological revival, have spurred Dharia to write to the Prime Minister and seek his intervention in attempts to dilute the forest policy. "Raw material required for paper or wood industry should be produced on private lands and valuable forests reserved for permanent green cover and natural biosphere," Dharia says. Most of the wastelands in the country belong to individuals and with farm forestry, it is possible to make them productive. "In view of the great threat to our environment, I am sure you will not deviate from the earlier policy of the Government on forests. Environmentalists in the country are opposed to the move to hand over forest lands to industry," says Dharia.
