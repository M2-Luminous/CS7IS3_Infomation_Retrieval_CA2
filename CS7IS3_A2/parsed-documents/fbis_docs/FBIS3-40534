Drawing the initial configuation takes several minutes when designing products using CAD. This program will reduce that time to several seconds, thereby lessening the burden of design. Consumer electronics products, such as vacuum cleaners and rice cookers, get their basic shape on a screen when CAD brings together the parts necessary for the product to function and then adds design on top of that. This program automatically draws the initial configuration that is the basis for design. The program shows a solid representation using virtual reality. This makes it easier to see the product's image. This program uses a three-dimensional (3D) mouse to arrange the parts of the product shown using virtual reality. First it draws in space the right-angled parallelipeds that cover all the parts, then it divides those into tetrahedrons. The initial configuration is drawn through a process of successively erasing from right-angle parallelipeds to tetrahedrons. For example, for a camera the lens, body, and other parts necessary for functioning are arranged in space. Restrictions are set so that kirikomi won't be dull, rectangular parallelipeds won't be cut into two, etc. When the program is used under these conditions it is possible to display the initial configuration necessary for the camera to function. Usually a designer uses CAD to impose design on this initial configuration. Currently initial configurations are drawn using CAD. This is a problem because it takes several minutes and forces designers to do work outside their specialty. However, this program displays the initial configuration in about two seconds. It increases efficiency and allows designers to focus on creative activities. The group plans to disseminate this program because it is a very practical program which even allows for changing parts in the initial configuration. However, the group intends to revise the program so it can draw curved lines so the initial configuration needn't be made up mainly of straight lines.
