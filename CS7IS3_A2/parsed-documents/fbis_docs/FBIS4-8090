The Muslims said that the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] would not allow free movement of humanitarian aid convoys to the Muslim side. All this was caused by an incident in Kresevo where a Muslim sniper killed an HVO soldier. The road between Busovaca and Kiseljak was opened three days ago. [passage omitted]
