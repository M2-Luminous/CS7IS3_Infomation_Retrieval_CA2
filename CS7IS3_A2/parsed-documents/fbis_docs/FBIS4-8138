Would you still say that today? [Iliescu] Yes, generally speaking I would say that this is still valid today, despite the fact that new elements of tension have emerged in Bosnia and Yugoslavia and that we are faced with a tense moment in our domestic political life, linked to the ongoing negotiations among the parties. However, regarding the overall perception of Romania in Europe, I would say that my assessment still applies. [Reporter] What can you tell us about the internal atmosphere currently prevailing in Romania? [Iliescu] There are two elements. First, the difficult situation of the economy and the people's social and living conditions. There has been a general deterioration in the past four years, due to the dismantling of the internal structures of the former centralized economic system and the transition to the market economy, which is a most complicated and difficult process. Second, there is the international aspect of our economic relations, characterized by the disappearance of our traditional markets and of our traditional sources of energy and raw materials. All this has created a very difficult situation for our economy. To all this, one should add the external sources of tension -- such as Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, or the loss of the traditional markets in the Arab countries, in the wake of the Gulf crisis -- and the general world recession and economic crisis. All this has had a most unfavorable impact on our economy. Right now, our industry only works at half capacity, unemployment has become a widespread phenomenon, with more than 1 million people out of a job, and inflation is growing at an intensive pace. All this has led to the deterioration of the people's living standard and is a source of social tension and dissatisfaction for the population. The second aspect refers to the political situation. After the last elections, the Parliament has acquired a structure that does not allow any party to have a majority and form a stable government. [Reporter] Does that mean that the government does not have a majority in Parliament? [Iliescu] It does not. The party that supports the government only has 34 percent of the seats in Parliament. It is the largest number of Parliament seats obtained by a single party. Consequently, we tried to put together a coalition platform after the last elections held in the fall of 1992. I even suggested the creation of a national unity government, with the representation and involvement of all political parties. At that time, I thought that, in view of the difficult conditions of the country, that initiative would have been useful and might have constituted a political signal for the readiness of all political forces to make a common effort. However, the opposition parties did not accept my proposal. They wanted to join the government, provided that they held the "levers of power," as Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], said, that is, they wanted to hold all instruments that would enable them to control the power. But how can one control all levers if one does not have the majority in Parliament? One must achieve certain relations and understandings and even a coalition with other parties. Consequently, we did not manage to form a coalition and not even a political pact of all parties -- something that I suggested at the time -- as a foundation and framework for cooperation, as happened in Spain with the Moncloa Pact. Such round tables and talks took place even in Poland and Hungary, where a kind of political accord was struck among the political forces there. But all these proposals were rejected and we were obliged to form a minority government, which has always had to perform some balancing act in order to promote the legislative initiatives. In the past two-three months, I have tried to initiate new dialogues with all political parties in this respect. [Reporter] How do you assess these dialogues? [Iliescu] It was good, sincere, and open dialogue, and, what is more, it was my dialogue with all the political parties. A round table is now going on among the parties, since reaching an understanding should be the result of consultations among the parties. I am not a partner in political discussions among the parties. I have only mediated this dialogue. The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], which supports the government, is now engaged in such negotiations. We will see what the final result of these discussions is going to be. [Reporter] What can you tell us about the trade unions? [Iliescu] This is the second aspect of the problem. In this climate of social tensions, the trade unions are obviously very active and there have been movements, strikes, claims, and so forth. However, I believe that all this has also had a positive aspect. I have personally met with the representatives of the three most important trade union federations and we conducted a pretty civilized dialogue. They are now conducting talks with the government representatives to finalize the problem of the collective contracts for this year. There are many claims, of which quite a few are pretty unrealistic, in view of the real situation, but there are also certain positive elements. The trade unions have declared their endorsement for the Memorandum with the IMF, but at the same time they are asking for social compensations that are not realistic in view of our current possibilities. Therefore, all this should be discussed and negotiated and I believe that such talks could be held right now. [Reporter] Who, in your opinion, holds the true power in Romania? [Iliescu] It depends on what you mean by that, since our country is now organized on democratic bases and it has a democratic Constitution, which includes all elements characteristic of a democratic state. There are concrete provisions in connection with the role of each element of power: the Parliament, with its prerogatives, the government, as an executive body, the presidency, as a mediating element between the levers of power, and so forth. We have this scheme of our country's organization and there is no concentration of power in the hands of a single person or institution. [Reporter] What do you think about the discontent among Romania's population? [Iliescu] It is a normal reaction. When a country's economy collapses, you cannot improve living standards. It is obvious that people are not satisfied with explanations alone, since a popular revolt took place in Romania -- a social explosion which characterized the Romanian revolution of December 1989 -- and the most important reason for that revolt was the low level of the living standard. Of course, everybody accepts the idea that we have more freedom and democracy, but they are dissatisfied with the fact that the living standard has not gone up. This is obvious to everyone. However, we must take into consideration the objective situation and openly discuss it: There is no other way but to further consolidate the democratic organization of society and promote economic reforms and the transition to the market economy. But all this requires effort, work, and social discipline as well as the acceptance of this reality by everyone. [Reporter] Is this your perception of the new democracy? [Iliescu] I do not understand what you mean by that. [Reporter] There are new democracies in all our countries, in Poland, Romania, and the former Soviet Union. You said that this is the road toward the new democracy, am I right? [Iliescu] By new democracy -- since democracy has existed before, in history -- I mean the existence of the new reality of the state's democratic organizations, since we did not have democracy before, in our country. It was the monopoly of a single party, since we had a totalitarian regime here and a dictatorship of a single family and single man. Hence, one cannot talk of democracy in our country. Now, we have entered a new stage of our development -- a democratic stage for the Romanian society. [Reporter] You once said that Romania is isolated in Europe, but Romania is a member of the Council of Europe, it is the first country that signed the Partnership for Peace scheme, and so forth. Do you still maintain that your country is isolated in Europe? [Iliescu] I have never said Romania was isolated. This may be the interpretation of others. We may be more or less pleased with the level of our relations and links with other states of international political forces, but I do not think and never thought that Romania has been isolated in this period. There is, of course, the issue of the range of our relations. Now, this is another aspect, linked to the development of our relations and the degree of trust extant on the continent. I noted many similar expressions of discontent from many leaders or political forces from Eastern or Central Europe in connection with the support received from the West. Even Mr. Lech Walesa has often expressed his discontent with Western support and the West's real opening toward our countries, which are now going through such a very difficult period of changes. Mr. Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister of Czechoslovakia [as published] -- one of the countries with the best situations in this respect, which has not faced the same difficulties as Romania -- is still displeased with the climate of cooperation with the West. The Western countries have developed a kind of protection screen vis-a- vis our countries. I said that at a meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Crans-Montana, last year: I said that the last chance for the Western countries currently going through an economic recession as well as for us is to open economic relations between us and to grant each other mutual support for the economic recovery in our countries. This would be a chance for the West to overcome the present economic situation. We will thus be able to say that we all have the political strength to revise and inaugurate a new philosophy and perception as well as a new understanding of the economic relations among all the European countries. We have overcome the "iron curtain" in political, military, and ideological relations, but we are witnessing the raising of a new economic curtain. We must overcome this situation, too, so as to create better conditions for our economic relations, on the basis of equal partnership. I said that, if the West looks upon our countries only as a hinterland for the developed countries and a potential market for their products and not as equal partners, both of us will suffer. We must jointly build a new community of equal partnership on our continent. [Reporter] How do you see your integration in Europe's political and cultural life? [Iliescu] I believe that this will be achieved by life itself, since all our countries are European and European history and culture is the synthesis of all national cultures and histories of all European countries. After a long separation in two parts, we will have to build a new Europe, a new united Europe, which can make use of all these assets and all this patrimony of our culture. [Reporter] What is your opinion about the relations between Romania and Poland? [Iliescu] I believe that we have a very good tradition of relations throughout history and we can say that our countries have gone through some very troubled times. Our nations have had to suffer throughout history because of the great European powers. We are situated in this part of Europe, where the interests of three great European powers, which dominated this region, met: the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian one. For several centuries on end, we suffered because of this foreign domination. In its turn, Poland did not have a better situation either, since its geographical position placed it between two large empires, the Russian and German one. Therefore, there are many similarities between our destinies in this respect. At the same time, there have been mutual sentiments of solidarity between our countries during some very difficult moments of our history and I can say that the Romanian people have always nurtured sentiments of friendship, empathy, and solidarity for the Polish people. I believe we should use this tradition to the benefit of both countries. At this point, we are going through similar difficult moments in our history, since we are building the new structure of our democratic states and an economy that must be efficient, competitive, and useful for our nations. All this will be achieved with great efforts. In these circumstances, our cooperation can be useful for both our countries and I believe that we have a lot to do to improve the cooperation between us. I believe that there is room for us to make a greater contribution -- I am particularly referring to the political forces and leaders of our countries -- to building a network of cooperation in all respects, that is the political, economic, social, cultural, scientific, and human spheres. [Reporter] Who in Romania wants the return of King Mihai? [Iliescu] You know, at this time of change, when we are faced with great hardships, many people look back and think that it was better in the past. We have all sorts of people struck by nostalgia -- people longing for the near past, which is not considered as having been democratic, but which provided greater stability for the people and a kind of social protection; and people longing for our country's pre-war past. The latter see the monarchy as a solution for Romania, but I believe that we should be looking forward, not backward. The only way for us is to go toward the future, not the past. [Reporter] What is your opinion about the nostalgia -- or maybe we should call it empathy -- for Marshal Antonescu [Romanian dictator during World War II]? [Iliescu] Again, it has to do with people longing for the past. Of course, we must write an objective history of our country, since it has been deformed. Antonescu is a very controversial figure. For some people, he was a hero, because he led the country at a very critical moment, when our country was threatened from the outside, after the dictatorship of King Carol II was demolished and the fascist-Iron Guardist elements came to power, with Antonescu's help. Antonescu was the savior of the Romanian state at that time and he also took the decision to liberate the territories occupied by the Soviet Union. Therefore, he is considered a historical hero by some people, who nevertheless ignore the fact that Antonescu was also an ally of fascist Germany and of the Romanian fascists, with whose help he took over power. They also disregard the fact that he pushed Romania not only into the war against the Soviet Union, but also against the coalition of democratic states, and that he is responsible for that before history. However, there will still be many controversies on this subject. [Reporter] Is it possible to achieve unification between Moldova and Romania and when will this happen? [Iliescu] This is a matter of history. We have to take realities into consideration. Of course, from a historical and legal viewpoint, the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was an erroneous decision and measure that led to the domination of this part of Europe by both fascist Germany and the Soviet Union. At the same time, we must also take into account the circumstances of the post- war period and the existing international documents on the stability of borders and the integrity of the present states. These are also realities that we must accept. One should also take into consideration the emotional aspect, that is the subjective sentiments referring to our history and theories as well as the feelings referring to our fellow nationals living beyond the country's borders. However, in politics one should also take reality into consideration. The same applies to Poland: The problem of territories that have changed hands during history cannot be resolved only with sentiments, but must be examined with great realism. [Reporter] In your capacity as president of Romania, how do you see your country's future? [Iliescu] I see it in the only possible way one can see such things, that is optimistically. We must preserve our hope in a better evolution for our country and I believe that we have good reason to do so. We have a good human potential, which represents the basic element of the evolution of contemporary society. Despite the difficulties facing us, I have trust in our people's potential, creativity, and capacity to overcome all difficulties and integrate Romania in the civilized world. [Reporter] I wish you all the best. Thank you.
