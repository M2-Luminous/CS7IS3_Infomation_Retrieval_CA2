But Israeli defence ministry spokesman 'Oded Ben-'Ami denied the report. "Israel will free 3,500 detainees when the accord is signed and will release all the rest before July 13 provided those belonging to (anti-autonomy) factions pledge to stop the armed struggle," 'Arafat's Fatah said in a leaflet. General elections are supposed to take place in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on July 13, according to the self-rule accord signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Washington four months ago. But an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories has already been delayed one month. About 11,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli prisons according to international humanitarian organisations. Israel released 101 Palestinians on January 7.
