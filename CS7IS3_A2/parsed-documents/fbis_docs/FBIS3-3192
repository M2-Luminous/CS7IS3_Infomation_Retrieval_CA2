Personnel from the State Security Ministry, the National People's Congress Security Department, and the Family Dependents Commission keep a 24-hour watch in front of their house, and all who come to see them will be questioned and warned. This serious interference in her normal life has caused Ding Zilin to have a heart attack. Even when she went to the hospital for treatment, she was "accompanied" by some persons. Several of her students who are studying in the United States have called this newspaper or faxed messages to us saying they were concerned about Ding Zilin's condition. At the same time, the Humanitarian Rescue Work Committee of the Autonomous Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in America has urged the mainland authorities to lift the unlawful house arrest of Ding Zilin and her spouse immediately, on the grounds of humanitarianism, and to provide a good medical environment and treatment conditions for Ding Zilin.
