When this issue was prepared, the text was not yet in official distribution, but in the opinion of specialists, the amendments and additions made in the document should fill in the gaps left by the instructions which preceeded them (No 8), which have been in effect for the last year and a half, as well as bolster the TsBR's control over the issue of commercial bank stock. Beginning on 15 February, all Russian commercial banks must compile prospectuses for the issue of securities following a form which envisions inclusion of information on major stockholders who own more than 5 percent of the votes (as well as, in turn, the major stockholders of those stockholders). Furthermore, in the prospectus for the issue, bankers will have to indicate information on members of the council of directors, the size of their blocks of stock, and their participation in other organizations, indicating the posts (to avoid cross-holding of blocks of stock). The document must give the investor an idea of the procedure for forming the bank's capital stock and the managers of the structure in which he has decided to invest money. Until now such information has been offered only to the antimonopoly committee, which usually approves the prospectus of the banks' issue after the TsBR does. Moreover, now the Central Bank of Russia has made commercial banks provide any investor with an issue report containing, along with the traditional information, the information listed above upon the first demand. If the bank employees "do not have a prospectus available," the client has the right to present a complaint of improper treatment to the TsBR. If the violations do not prove to be isolated occurrences, the TsBR may suspend the commercial bank's subscription campaign. As the chief of the securities division of the TsBR, Andrey Kozlov, announced at a press conference devoted to putting the system for issuing and registering stock of commercial banks into effect, its creators tried to protect the investor's interests at least in the banking sector by providing him with maximum access to all the information needed to make the right decision in selecting an investment object. Andrey Kozlov noted that in the West all the moral and financial responsibility is on the investor himself when a particular financial structure goes bankrupt, since the investor always has the opportunity to obtain exhaustive information about the enterprise or the bank whose stock he is buying. But in Russia some of the moral responsibility to the ordinary citizen, who is being tempted by one ad for huge dividends after another, lies on state organs. Thus, the TsBR has decided to make a contribution to protecting the investor by suggesting that he demand from the banks a detailed issue prospectus certified by the bank manager, his chief accountant, and the auditing firm. The new instructions, in addition to provisions which toughen control, contain a nice surprise even for bankers. Until recently, during the subscription campaign, capital obtained while the bank stock was being placed was accumulated in a special frozen account in the TsBR. Since 15 February, this rule does not effect the issue of bonds, since they are the direct financial obligation of the bank. The instructions also took into account the desires of bankers who complained that the system for capitalizing the profits of the bank stockholders which were not distributed as dividends was unclear. The document contains a social section devoted to formal accounting for the refinancing of some of the bank's profits. The document contains certain restrictions related to the procedure for forming the bank's capital stock during the first placement of stock. A bank's founders used to be allowed to make their payments in motor vehicles, equipment, and other material assets. From now on, during the first issue of a bank's stock, contributions to the capital stock are permitted only in rubles, hard currency, or premises belonging to the founders with the right of ownership. In explaining the Bank of Russia's position regarding those commercial banks which before 15 February submitted issue prospectuses in the old form to the TsBR, Andrey Kozlov noted that "draconian measures will not follow," but each case will be examined separately. If the issue prospectus was already examined by the securities division of the TsBR and then got "bogged down," let us say, in the antimonopoly committee, the TsBR will make an inquiry of the committee and most likely declare the bank's prospectus compiled according to the old norms valid. In the next issue of KOMMERSANT, we will begin publication of the new document, which is important both to the issuing bodies and to investors.
