Kesteris said in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on Thursday [7 April] that Moscow's denial of Yeltsin's intention to establish military bases in Latvia is questionable. The denial only stated that Yeltsin's statements were quoted "in the wrong context." The ambassador pointed out, however, that he saw copies of Yeltsin's original "document." It also mentioned Latvia. The agreement on the continued limited operation of the Russian radar station Skrunda, negotiated between Russia and Latvia, cannot be interpreted as an agreement on establishing a military basis, Kesteris stressed. Latvia has allowed Russia to operate the radar bases for four more years and has granted Moscow an additional one and a half years to dismantle the station. Kesteris pointed out that Russia is now apparently trying to influence the internal situation in Latvia with initiatives like Yeltsin's "document." In Latvia, a "controversial debate" about the agreement with Moscow is going on: "It is difficult to achieve a consensus in the country on the continued existence of the base for another five and a half years." Kesteris cited another possible reason for Moscow's behavior: "The Russian Government is too weak to implement the agreement in Russia. For this reason, Latvia is being provoked not to sign the agreement." The signing is scheduled for the end of April. "If Russia does not withdraw the document unequivocally, it will be very difficult for the Latvian president to travel to Moscow to sign the agreement." The Foreign Ministry announced that Yeltsin's spokesman has denied statements about Latvia. The doubts concerning the negotiations between Russia and Estonia on the troop withdrawal, which arose during the 18th round of talks in Moscow on Wednesday and which have again questioned the withdrawal that was to be completed by 31 August, need not be the last word. Russia is facing pressure at home. Moscow's ultimatum that Estonia must issue residence permits for all 10,000 military pensioners and that, in addition to the money that has already been granted, it is to provide another $23 million for the construction of apartments for officers returning to Russia might be a tactical maneuver, it was pointed out. Another round of talks is likely to follow. Germany continues to demand that Russia should complete the troop withdrawal by 31 August. Yeltsin also announced the establishment of Russian military bases in several CIS republics. Bonn stated that Russia also maintains military bases in neighboring countries that used to belong to the Soviet Union. This normally takes place on a contractual basis.
