FBIS3-6380 "dreas052_q_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-052 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Spokesman Defends Joint Exercise BK1703105694 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0630 GMT 17 Mar 94 BK1703105694 Melbourne Radio Australia Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The Australian Defense Force is to train soldiers from an Indonesian Army unit that Amnesty International has linked with the torture of East Timorese. The program is part of the federal government's plan to develop closer links with the Indonesian military. Prime Minister Paul Keating says Australia's defense relationship with Indonesia is the key to establishing defense in and with Asia. David Pembrook asked Brigadier Adrian Danger to explain the training the Indonesians would undertake during their stay. [Begin recording] [Danger] Well, the Indonesian Special Forces will be operating with our Special Forces in the west in counter hijack training. We have arguably one of the best facilities in the world for teaching people how to deal with (?quick) counter terrorist operations, and specifically how to deal with hijacked aircraft. [Pembrook] Is that the only training they will be undertaking? [Danger] Oh, they will be undertaking some other basic training such as communications and the like. But that is the major emphasis here and that is very important to the public of Australia and to the general public of Indonesia. We need to have a mutual confidence, if you like, that if a Qantas airliner with a whole bunch of Australians is hijacked in Indonesia, in Jakarta, that those skills are there to safeguard the traveling public. Conversely, we need to have confidence that the Indonesians need to have confidence that if Garuda is hijacked, at say, Mascot, then they know that we have those skills, and that exchange is reasonably common among Special Forces around the world. [Pembrook] But do you as a spokesperson for the Defense Forces have any misgivings about training soldiers from a unit who were alleged to have been involved in the torture and suppression of minorities in their country. [Danger] Look, Amnesty International from time to time will make remarks as they do against the internal affairs of Indonesia, against human rights issues in other countries around the world, including Australia. That is not the concern of our task in terms of counter hijack. [Pembrook] But at the same time, do you have any misgivings that we are skilling these people up, even though it is to do with counter terrorism, that we are indeed improving the skills of these people, who according to Amnesty are involved in the suppression of minorities in Indonesia. [Danger] No, we are not skilling these people to deal with internal affairs of Indonesia or any other country. These are skills which are specific to protecting the traveling public. [end recording]
