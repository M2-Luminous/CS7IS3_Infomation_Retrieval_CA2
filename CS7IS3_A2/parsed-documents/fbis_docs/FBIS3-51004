[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mayor Alvarez, what have you learned about the presence of the Search Bloc here in Tulua? [Alvarez] I have no official information on that. Neither the national government authorities nor the police authorities have notified me that the Search Bloc members will be housed in the Simon Bolivar Academy. However, I heard that report in a Voice of America broadcast and I read it on the front page of today's edition of OCCIDENTE. [Reporter] What does the Search Bloc's arrival represent for the residents of Tulua? [Alvarez] As city mayor, I will accept it. However, as a resident of Valle del Cauca, I am truly sorry. I have said that the Search Bloc in Valle del Cauca is following the orders of the U.S. ambassador and State Department officials. Just two days after Pablo Escobar was killed, they said that a war had to be waged in Valle del Cauca. I think Valle del Cauca does not need a war, and I think it can follow the law through reasonable means, through a dialogue, and seek solutions so that there will be no war here. [end recording]
