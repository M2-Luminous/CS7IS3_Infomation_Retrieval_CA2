FR940926-1-00011 FR940926-1-00006 The petitioner also suggested locating the label for buses inside the vehicle and above the driver's side windshield or window. NHTSA has no objection to that. The agency's purpose in specifying the locations for the manufacturer's certification label was to provide an unobstructed view of the label, i.e., to ensure that the labels are easy to see and read in any vehicle. Since it is not practicable to inspect buses with passengers on board, buses are usually mounted on hoists or platforms for inspection either at the beginning or at the end of their runs. Therefore, the inspectors usually walk through buses during their inspections, making the label easily visible to the inspector if it is mounted on or above the driver's side windshield or window as the petitioner suggested. NHTSA recognizes the merit in the petitioner's suggestion that the location of the label should be standardized in only a limited number of places so that there would be greater predictability about precisely where law enforcement personnel can expect to find the label. Nevertheless, NHTSA solicits comments on whether the permissible locations of the permanent metal label, including those on buses, should be standardized as proposed by the petitioner, or whether the larger number of permissible locations should be maintained as currently allowed. NHTSA further solicits comments on the locations in which labels should be permitted, if not in the currently-permitted locations or in the locations suggested by the petitioner. Finally, Mr. Robinson suggested that the labels for trailers be located so as to provide reasonable protection from damage. NHTSA does not believe that this change is necessary at this time. NHTSA believes that specifying a permanent metal label with either raised or recessed letters and numbers, riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to the vehicle, would sufficiently enhance the durability of the label on trailers to make the data readable even after many years of use. Again, should actual experience in the future indicate that further action is appropriate to protect trailer labels, rulemaking can be initiated at that time. NHTSA made a preliminary cost analysis of the proposed requirements. The analysis suggests that the incremental cost range of metal labels as proposed would be between $0.25 and $2.50 per label, depending on size, thickness, and quantity ordered. NHTSA estimates that for those manufacturers that purchase labels in large quantities, the incremental cost could range between $0.25 and $0.75. For those manufacturers that would purchase labels in smaller quantities, the cost range could be between $2.00 and $2.50 per label. Label manufacturers typically put only certain information on labels. The vehicle manufacturer then applies the remainder of the required information at the plant, such as the GVWR, GAWR, VIN, etc. Thus, if letters and numbers are raised or recessed, vehicle manufacturers, as well as possibly some label manufacturers, may have to purchase the equipment to emboss the metal labels at a cost of between $300 and $1,500. Agency data shows that 263,580 motor vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) and 126,904 trailers were sold in 1992. Another 35,444 school buses, which would also be included in the vehicles covered by this notice, were sold in 1991, bringing the combined total affected vehicles to approximately 425,928. The agency has no data on how many vehicles, if any, already meet the proposed requirements. Assuming that none do, the agency calculates that the total range of incremental annual costs of this proposal would be $106,482 to $1,064,810. V. Issues for NHTSA Evaluation In order to obtain additional data for the agency's evaluation of the issues raised by this petition, NHTSA solicits comments on the following specific issues regarding certification labels: 1. Is there a problem with manufacturers' labels on motor vehicles with a GVWR of over 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) becoming obliterated, painted over, or otherwise rendered illegible during the service life of the vehicle? If so, in what percentage of those vehicles does this occur? Are particular types, brands, models, or model years of vehicles more susceptible to this problem than others? 2. What costs do manufacturers currently incur in the purchase, printing, and application of labels? 3. What sorts of materials are currently utilized for the labels on vehicles with GVWR more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb)? What percent of currently utilized labels are made of metal? 4. What sizes are the labels currently affixed to motor vehicles with GVWR of more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb)? How are they affixed? 5. What incremental costs would vehicle manufacturers incur to purchase, emboss, and affix permanent metal labels with raised or recessed letters and numbers as proposed? 6. What incremental costs, if any, would label manufacturers incur in producing metal labels with raised or recessed letters and numbers? 7. In what quantities do vehicle manufacturers currently order labels? 8. How much time is currently required for vehicle manufacturers to prepare and affix labels? 9. How much time would be required for vehicle manufacturers to rivet or otherwise permanently affix metal labels as proposed? 10. What special problems, if any, would vehicle manufacturers have in affixing permanent metal labels as proposed? 11. Should a particular metal, such as aluminum, stainless steel, etc., be specified for the labels? 12. Should a minimum thickness be prescribed for the labels?
