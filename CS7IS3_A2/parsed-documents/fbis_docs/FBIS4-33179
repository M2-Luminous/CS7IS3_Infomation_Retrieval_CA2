FBIS4-33179 "drlat107_a_94012" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 3 June 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Journalists Discuss Semantics of Economic Measures Journalists Discuss Semantics of Economic Measures FL0206233694 FL0206233694 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1600 GMT on 2 June features the "Straight Talk" Program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from BOHEMIA magazine and guest Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES newspaper. Rodriguez begins by asking: "Currently, what is being implemented? Is it or is it not a package of measures?" Recio explains that reporters have been using the term, "group of measures," rather than "package of measures," noting that the Miami EL NUEVO HERALD said that the measures being implemented in Cuba have a neoliberal character. Recio asks: "Why avoid using the phrase, package of measures, even if we are talking about a significant group of measures? I believe the reason is precisely to avoid giving the impression that the measures respond to neoliberal policies. The phrase, package of measures, has always been associated with the neoliberal formula which, as we all know, is implemented overnight, even without cabinet-level discussions, but rather, by two or three influential people in the government, with premeditation, and under cover of night." Rodriguez explains that it is more than just a matter of semantics; it is a matter of concepts. Recio adds that measures to correct economic problems are necessarily similar, no matter in what country they are taken, but that: "Cuba does not want to become a market economy." Recio observes that despite the similarity of the measures being taken in Cuba with those abroad, the difference lies in the goal of the measures. Rodriguez and Recio discuss aspects of market-economy measures, but emphasize that in Cuba, the measures were preceded by extensive consultation with the people. Recio continues: "In Cuba, economic reforms respond to the social base from which the political power of the Revolution emanates -- the workers, farmers, the people in general. This is why we do not have a struggle among social classes in Cuba." Recio adds that the issue is not what the measures are called, but what they seek to accomplish, and advises avoidance of the term, package of measures, because of the term's connotations. Regarding the way the people have received the measures and the increased sacrifice that they entail, Rodriguez states: "I believe the initial reaction has not been very positive among the people in general because I do not believe the measures have been explained very well." Recio calls on the media to further explain the measures to the people, explaining: "If these measures truly serve to increase production and food supplies, you will eventually increase your food intake and solve a number of current shortages. If we are to understand these measures as a sacrifice, we must see them as a welcome sacrifice because they will yield the results we seek." Rodriguez agrees that the sacrifices are obvious. Recio closes with the statment: "As excess currency diminishes, black market prices will do so as well."
