The prediction was the latest made by economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics Bureau. The economists said that, normally, the economy will not experience a setback abruptly after it has rushed at high speed for two consecutive years. The growth rate is also welcome as it prevents ups and downs in the economy and maintains a stable social order. "In addition, it benefits foreign investment and the income of the Chinese people," said economist Li Jingwen. An improved economic environment, increasing investments and an expanded infrastructure last year will continue to play a firm role in pushing the economy, he said. What the experts are anxious about is inflation, which has been rising for five months since the last quarter of 1993. According to the Statistics Bureau, prices in the first quarter of this year went up more than 20 percent nationwide over the same period of last year. In 1993 China's inflation rate was 13 percent. The economists attributed the driving up of prices to complicated factors, instead of the sole reason of imbalance in supply and demands. However, they expressed satisfaction with the various methods which the government has adopted to curb inflation. "If things go smoothly, the price hikes will be controlled; at the same time, the economy will avoid being stalled," Li said. Last year the Chinese Government imposed a macro-control policy to cool down the overheated economy. But both officials and scholars said they hoped that the economy would continue to rise at a moderately high speed. The economists noted that further GDP growth will be basically promoted by increased investment. Investment in fixed assets this year will stand at about 1,500 billion yuan, up 12 percent over 1993. "But we can bring fixed investment under control if we control new bank notes and loans," Li said. The experts advised the government to move actively but cautiously in the reform this year to avoid uncertainty among the masses of the people. They also predicted that the actual per capita income of urban residents will rise by 10 percent this year, and retail sales by 8.8 percent. Meanwhile, urban bank deposits are expected to increase by 26 percent.
