Yazov also admitted the unconstitutionality of the measures taken against Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev who was removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha. However, he stressed once again that these measures were necessary and aimed at preventing the Soviet Union from disintegration which, as he believes, would have been inevitable if a federal treaty had been signed by six instead of 15 republics. He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in the former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than was envisaged by the Law on the State of Emergency. The former defence minister regretted that the number of troops brought into the city on August 19, 1991 to help police ensure the state of emergency was too small. At the same time he added that no combat orders had been issued to the troops. Yazov stressed that he personally ordered the troops on high alert, but denied he had ordered Soviet air forces on full combat readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had been sent by the command of the airborne troops, who, apparently, have overstepped their powers. The court ruled that all materials of investigation obtained from Yazov in absence of his lawyer shall be excluded from court hearings.
