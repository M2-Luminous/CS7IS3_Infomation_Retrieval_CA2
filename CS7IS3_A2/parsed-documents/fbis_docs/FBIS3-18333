Milan assistant public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio said the forty-page affidavit Craxi delivered to the Rome public prosecutor's office in early February "is, for the most part, a collection of pieces of records gathered during the Milan investigations. This is a collage which, in some areas, is even wrong," he added and cited statements attributed to the wrong person as an example. The magistrate from Milan's Clean Hands team also reported, "This is a technical meeting to avoid an overlap of investigations of the same case. On the 13 points indicated in Craxi's affidavit, only five concern investigations which have not been opened in Milan." D'Ambrosio said jurisdiction "is not a matter of opinion and certainly is not based on the place in which the affidavit was submitted." He went on to note that the name of the administrative secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, and of the Communist Party before the name-change, Senator Marcello Stefanini, and those of others have been added to the log kept by the Rome public prosecutor's office listing persons under investigation. "But if it turns out that investigations of these facts have already been opened elsewhere, jurisdiction will clearly belong to the magistrates already at work on these cases," he added. The Milan judge then explained the five accusations not yet covered in more than two years of Milan political and business corruption investigations. The first, he said, is the "Rotiroti affair, on which Rome is already moving for libel." This case centers on Craxi's allegation of bribery to the tune of 600 million lire (356,000 dollars) surrounding real estate transactions in the Bufalotta area on the outskirts of Rome. The ex-Socialist leader named Primo Greganti, a former Italian Communist Party official in Turin, and Stefanini. Rome investigating magistrates Adelchi D'Ippolito and Gloria Attanasio, who found that the allegations could not be substantiated, questioned Craxi on February 18 with an eye to a possible libel charge against him and his source, an ex-administrative secretary for Craxi's party in Rome, Raffaele Rotiroti. In the meantime, Stefanini and Greganti have filed their own libel suits against their accuser. Another case among the five is alleged financing for the old Italian Communist Party from the secret police of the Soviet Union of the time, the KGB, and another is alleged ties between Naples crime boss Carmine Alfieri, in prison since September 1992, and cooperatives of the left. The assistant public prosecutor said Rome magistrates would presumably handle the end involving alleged kickbacks and Naples would be responsible for issues concerning the Camorra. These allegations are apparently based on testimony provided by Pasquale Galasso, a Camorra gangland figure who has turned state witness. Another accusation made by Craxi concerns exports of Sicilian wine to the Soviet Union of the time and another is that of placing a man on the board of a social services institute run by the Treasury. Turin magistrate Giuseppe Ferrando said he had travelled to Milan to meet the people he would be dealing with "because we in Turin were first in contact with Tiziana Parenti," the magistrate who abandoned the Clean Hands team last year in a dispute over her insistence on pursuing the investigation of the Democratic Party of the Left administrative secretary. She is now on a leave of absence to run for parliament in the March 27 elections on a rightist Forza Italia slate. Carlo Nordio from Venice said he intended to continue his investigation into possible Democratic Party of the Left misuse of 40 billion lire (23.74 million dollars) received by parliamentary aides. Over the past five years, the parliamentary aides attached to the MPs of all the parties represented have between 150 and 160 billion lire (up to 95 million dollars). Investigators suspect that some of the funds going to those for the Democratic Party of the Left may have wound up with the local party sections. A Rome assistant public prosecutor, Gianfranco Mantelli, said the investigations under study go beyond the 13 cases cited by Craxi in his affidavit. Asked by reporters about the prospect of a slowdown in the investigations in the run-up to the vote at the end of the month, D'Ambrosio said, "Don't even dream of it. We're not thinking like this at all." He also emphasized that the meeting held today was aimed merely at a better coordination of the investigations in course.
