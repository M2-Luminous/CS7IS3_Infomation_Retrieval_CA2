FR940803-2-00038 FR940803-2-00029 Southeastern Power Administration; Proposed Power Marketing Policy for Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina, System of Projects AGENCY: Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern), DOE. ACTION: Change of Public Comment Forum Dates and extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On July 11, 1994, a Proposed Power Marketing Policy for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 35332) which contained dates for public comment forums and a deadline of September 16, 1994, for comments on the policy. Due to a delay in the publication of the Proposed Policy, the procedural time frame of 60 days between publication and the comment forums was not met. Therefore, new dates for the forums had to be set and the period for comments on the policy extended. All other facets of the Proposed Policy remain the same. DATES: Written comments are now due on or before September 30, 1994. Public comment forums will be held in Columbia, South Carolina, on September 12, 1994, and in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 14, 1994. The public comment forums will each begin at 10:30 a.m. at the following locations: September 12, 1994, Sheraton Hotel & Conference Center, 2100 Bush River Road, Columbia, South Carolina 29210; September 14, 1994, Sheraton Gateway Hotel, 1900 Sullivan Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30337.
