Also contributing to the uptrend of rice prices is the fact that the pace of importing rice from such countries as China and Australia has been slower than initially expected, causing concern about the amount of rice available, they said. Rice dealers want to build up their stocks of domestic rice regardless of the rising prices, they added. In Japan, the government buys about 20 percent of the rice crop and oversees the independent distribution of a further 40 percent. There is also a grey market supported by rice growers and distributors outside the government's control. According to the sources, prices for popular domestic rice brands on the black market have shot up since the previous week by an average of 1,000 yen or more for 60 kilograms. Koshihikari rice, a product of Niigata Prefecture and one of the most popular brands, is now sold for about 41,000 yen per bag. Akita Komachi of Akita Prefecture is 38,000 yen and Sasanishiki of Miyagi Prefecture is 36,000 yen. The inflation in the grey market will inevitably affect retail prices of rice, they said. A supermarket in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward is selling Koshihikari for 11,900 yen per 10 kilograms. "It is selling all right at the price. I suppose consumers do not mind paying a little more for tasty rice," a clerk at the supermarket said.
