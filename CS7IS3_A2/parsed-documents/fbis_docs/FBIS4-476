FBIS4-476 "drafr070_c_94014" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC Statement on Campaign To Discredit Party ANC Statement on Campaign To Discredit Party MB0804163094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1503 GMT 8 Apr 94 MB0804163094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the ANC Department of Information and Publicity on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 8 April: "Dirty Tricks Campaign To Discredit ANC"] [Text] April 10th will be marked throughout South Africa as a tragic anniversary marking the brutal murder of Comrade Chris Thembisile Hani, general secretary of the South African Communist Party and member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC, at the hands of ultra-right conspirators. During the weeks preceding this dastardly act, a vicious disinformation campaign, orchestrated by forces intent on derailing the transition to democracy was set in motion. The objectives of those behind the campaign became clear only after the assassins had struck -- they were to besmirch the character of Comrade Chris Hani and thus lend legitimacy to his murder. The ANC has noted with grave concern the unfolding of a similar campaign as we approach April 10th. Entire communities are awash with wild rumours and irresponsible speculations about impending disaster. A malicious rumour, that was promptly denied by the British authorities, to the effect that preparations were in hand to evacuate British citizens in the event of unrest after April 27th was floated. Shoppers have been panicked into the stockpiling of non-perishable foods against the continency of shortages that will allegedly follow the first democratic elections. Spokepersons of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have brazenly proclaimed their intention to make the holding of elections impossible in a number of provinces including the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Natal. It is against this backdrop that the ANC wants to warn the South African public about a reckless conspiracy which its authors hope to operationalise over the next few days. The information at our disposal has already been placed before the South African authorities at the highest level. The ANC has been reliably informed that: (i) Presently large quantities of arms have been transported into the PWV region and stockpiled in at least 16 hostels, with a view to launching armed attacks in that province commencing Saturday 9th April. The flats and houses of ANC members resident in the Hillbrow-Berea-Yeoville area of Johannesburg have been targeted. (ii) The IFP has come into the possession of at least 2,000 ANC T-shirts and other paraphernalia, with a view to infiltrating the Chris Hani memorial rallies scheduled for this weekend so as to stage a provocation that will result in bloodshed, loss of life and consequently heighten the tensions in the PWV. As a bonus such a provocation would also serve to bring the ANC into disrepute by linking it and its supporters to acts of violence. (iii) Attempts will be made on the lives of a number of ANC leaders in order to deepen the atmosphere of instability and possibly provoke a backlash among ANC supporters. Comrades Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa have been mentioned in this regard. (iv) The ANC head offices on Plein Street in Johannesburg have been placed under surveillance by rotating reconnaissance teams in preparation for an armed assault. (v) A comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence is planned to coincide with the last three weeks before the elections in the hope of producing a low turn-out, especially among African voters. It is not our intention to cause alarm, but the information we have received is extremely disturbing and should be brought to public attention. There have been a number of clear indications that the gun running trail uncovered by the Goldstone Commission is still operational. Recent reports concerning the transfer of firearms between persons in the employ of Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] and members of hit squads confirm this. Specific ANC leaders have been subjected to surveillance by suspicious persons and at least one member of our security department has been shot and seriously injured by unknown assailants in the streets of Johannesburg. The ANC will not be intimidated by these tactics and we intend to pursue and implement every aspect of our programme and election campaign over the coming weeks. Any attempts to disrupt our activities commemorating the life and work of Comrade Chris Hani will be dealt with firmly. We shall not allow the spoilers and wreckers to destroy South Africa's chances for free and fair elections.
