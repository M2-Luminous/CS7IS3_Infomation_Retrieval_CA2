When Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk visited Paris last Thursday [3 March], the three states agreed to organize a joint exercise between chiefs of staff followed by ground maneuvers by army units from each country. Reliable sources say that these could take place next autumn, in all likelihood in Mourmelon [France]. The Polish Army will place one unit -- probably a company -- at the disposal of the French-German brigade and the Eurocorps. The principle has been agreed on, even if, as a matter of procedure, the other members of the Eurocorps (in particular Spain and Belgium) have yet to be consulted. These decisions were announced at the end of a working dinner -- the first of its kind -- at the Hotel de Brienne [Defense Ministry] last Thursday evening and attended by [Defense Ministers] Francois Leotard, Volker Ruehe, and Piotr Kolodziejczyk. During that meeting, an assessment was also made of the military cooperation between France and Poland over the past three years. [passage omitted]
