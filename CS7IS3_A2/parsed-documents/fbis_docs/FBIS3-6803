For North Korea to make such a strong remark proves that it does not have confidence at home nor abroad. [Yi So-hang] Such a remark by North Korea is intended to create confusion domestically by threatening South Korea by saying that "it will be ready for war." Another aspect is that North Korea achieved some results on several occasions through this "threatening policy," since it announced that it will withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993. [Kim] If North Korea receives inspection from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and realizes the exchange of special envoys even for the sake of formality, the road to improve relations will be opened for the possibility of holding the third round of talks with the United States. Nevertheless, North Korea rejected such measures. I believe that this is because North Korea has not yet provided itself with a blueprint on opening up. The way to dissolve difficult problems, such as an economic crisis and international isolation, is through "partial openness" by improving relations with the United States. [passage omitted] [Yi] North Korea's strong strategy is an attempt to make its nuclear development a fait accompli. North Korea is aware of the strategy carried out by India and Pakistan. Threatening that "Seoul will become a sea of fire," is intended to indirectly reveal that: "We have annihilating weapons." [Kim] The remark by the North Korean delegate, in a nutshell, is intended to discontinue dialogue with South Korea. As everybody knows, the reason North Korea is saying that it will improve relations with the United States is to introduce capital and technology from Western countries, including the United States, thus providing a breakthrough for its aggravated economy. [passage omitted] [Yi] The remark by the North Korean delegate can be regarded as part of a Brinkmanship, which North Korea has been promoting during the past few years. [passage omitted] [Kim] In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, I believe that a thorough analysis is necessary of how related countries, such as the United States and China, regard their national interest. [passage omitted] [Yi] The current government's strategy while dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue is the appropriate use of the "carrot" and "stick." Of course there were some results in using this strategy. However, there were also times when we emphasized the "carrot" when the "stick" was necessary. That is, there were times when we took too much consideration in holding dialogue. For example, when the United States tried to take strong measures, we put the brakes on the United States by sticking too much to the fact that "confusion must be prevented." However, we cannot say that our "North Korean nuclear diplomacy" has failed. [passage omitted] [Kim] If the IAEA refers the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council after convening a Board of Governors meeting, the situation will move toward sanctions against North Korea. Then, the issue of economic sanctions will be discussed first. However, even though economic sanctions are taken, it will take about two to three months before it is put into practice. Therefore, how North Korea will react during this period is drawing attention. I believe North Korea will take strong measures until "right before the deadline for applying sanctions" and then, when it becomes clear that sanctions will be applied, I believe North Korea will retreat. [Yi] If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council, China's attitude will be a variable. I believe that ultimately it will be inevitable for China to take part in the sanctions. [passage omitted] [Kim] I am of a different opinion. I believe that it will be awkward for China to take part in the sanctions when considering North Korea's role as a buffer zone of China and the fact that China and North Korea are the few remaining communist countries in the world. However, I think that China will persuade North Korea so that the situation will not move toward taking sanctions. Ultimately, it is expected that right before the sanctions take effect, North Korea will retreat. What is an important point in future policy on North Korea is to develop the passive ROK-U.S. cooperative system into a more active and voluntary system. I believe for ROK and the United States to share roles in dealing with North Korea will be one of the ways to establish an active cooperative system. For example, the United States should deal only with North Korea's nuclear issue and let the ROK deal with the issue of economic assistance to North Korea. Also, the United States should clearly inform North Korea of this. Then it will be difficult for North Korea to continue to reject South-North dialogue. [Yi] When the stick is definitely prepared, will the effectiveness of the carrot be enhanced? We must not completely eliminate the carrot, but now is the time to prepare the stick. Nevertheless, I believe that we do not need to fundamentally regulate our existing policy on North Korea. Our basic task is to realize the South-North basic agreement. [Kim] Completely suspending the South-North dialogue at the current stage will result in being entangled in North Korea's strategy. North Korea may be stimulating the South side aimed at such a measure. It may be intended to hold dialogue with the United States after rupturing South-North dialogue. Up until now, in North Korean relations, we established the nuclear issue as the main variable and economic cooperation as the subordinate variable. However, I think that it would be good if we switched positions. We must make the issue of economic cooperation a more certain weapon. To achieve this, as I said before, the ROK-U.S. cooperative system must be further strengthened. Along with this, we must clearly show the attitude of "superiority in strength in negotiations [himui uwi son hyopsang]." [passage omitted] [Yi] North Korea regards economic cooperation with the South side as a "poisonous carrot," which is recognized as a problem. As long as North Korea does not change such a thought, it seems that economic cooperation will be difficult, whatever attitude we take. If we are to change North Korea's attitude, we must all the more resolutely establish our negotiating strategy, and moreover, we must concentrate on uniting opinions domestically and the people must take vigilance. North Korea's violent remark, which is like a "declaration of war," at the meeting place can be a good incentive in awakening the people's vigilance.
