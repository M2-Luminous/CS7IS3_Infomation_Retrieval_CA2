It is estimated that this year, 569 million integrated circuits will be sold on the consumer market and 445 million investment type integrated circuits will be sold, for a total of 1.014 billion. The use of integrated circuits in home appliances has become more popular, opening up a vast area for the integrated circuit market. According to analysis, with television producing factories further improving the grades of products and increasing various functions, the use of integrated circuits in televisions can only increase. In 1994 it is estimated that 10 million color television sets and 11 million black-and-white sets will be sold, and the demand for television integrated circuits is expected to be 110 million to 120 million. In 1993, audio equipment factories quickly adjusted and upgraded their products as a result of improved technology and changing consumer demand. The products are pocket-sized and portable digital recorders with CDs and displays and remote-control stereos. So, they use such circuits as noise reduction circuits, Dolby circuits, and amplification circuits. By the same token, radios also require multiple bands and multiple functions. So, they need circuits such as time control circuits. This trend will not change in 1994. It is estimated that 138 million audio circuits will be required in 1994. Electronic departments that make video tape-recorders emphasize major administrative projects. Domestic production of complete sets of CKD forms will formally commence and sound cameras have been initially designated for test production domestically at six sites: Beijing JVC, Guangzhou JVC, Shanghai Sony, and Fuji Company, as well as Xiaxin and Shangguang. In 1994 batch products also could be promoted. Total estimated use will be 161 million. Camera circuits. Annual domestic production of cameras is 1.5 million, requiring such things as electronic focus and electronic shutters. As the world's third largest electronic clock and watch maker, circuits used in clocks and watches along with those processed in Hong Kong together come to approximately 35 million. The product types and the market for electronic games and electronic toys will still expand in 1994. Total use of circuits for such language circuits as electronic musical instruments to make up Christmas and New Year's cards, handicrafts, and electronic colored light control systems are 60 million to 65 million. In 1994 home appliance integrated circuits will take a big step. From January through October 1993, 4.69 million washing machines were sold, 48 percent of them fully automatic. Beijing's Longfu Building sold 1,094 washing machines in October, 935 of them fully automatic for an 85.5 percent share. A great many brands, such as Hefei's Rongshida [2837 0057 6671], one after another are promoting microcomputer controlled fully automatic models of washing machines. Shanghai's Shuixian [3055 0103] brand has a digital automatic checking system and Aide [1947 1795] AQB45-2D brand utilizes six patents and initiates six processes at once. It also can automatically arrange the washing process and has four electronic clocks to set the time. Jiangmen's Jinling Bawang [6855 6875 7218 3769] machine automatically dispenses washing detergent. The Xiaoya Shengji'ao [1420 7700 5110 0679 1159] fully automatic washing machine controls the water level and turns on the machine and adds its own washing detergent and even can add heat. Hangzhou's Jinsong [6855 2646] brand uses fuzzy logic controls and can automatically set the water level, automatically set the time, automatically adjust the water flow and the washing process, and automatically implement overheating protection. The Whirlpool extra-sensitive washing machine can sense the fiber type and automatically correct and can accelerate the speed. There currently are some firms supplying the domestically designed washing machine control circuits popular overseas. Southeastern University's Microelectronic Center is researching and developing all of this themselves from integrated circuits to control panels. Such things as wireless remote control air conditioners (with liquid crystal displays), highly sensitive gas sensors triggering exhaust fans, computer fire protected hot water heaters, microcomputer controlled dishwashers, safety videotelephone doorbells, and fully automatic vacuum cleaners are too numerous to mention. It is estimated that by the end of 1994, there will be as many as 50 million integrated circuits used to control home appliances. [7 Mar 94 p 7] According to information provided by the relevant department in the Ministry of Electronics Industry, the use of integrated circuits for such investment products as communications also will greatly increase this year. The development of high technology communications products is one of the basic conditions for an information national economy. The year 1994 is an important one for China's communications industry to form an economy of scale. 1. Programmable switchboards. It is estimated that 1994's annual production of programmable switchboards will be 12 million lines, with 100 million to 110 million complete sets of integrated circuits. 2. Telephones. China's current annual telephone production capability has reached 30 million and actual production for domestic and foreign sales is about 20 million. It is an area that is ripe for batch production of a scale relative to the market. Now ringing circuits, dialing circuits, voice circuits, circuits to avoid raising the voice, liquid crystal drive circuits, and recorded response circuits for use in telephones all are being developed. The scale of this market is approximately 67 million to 71 million. 3. Facsimile. According to a continuous line of planning thought, this type of cooperative stock company is being planned in the country. Facsimile integrated circuits have a high technology content and metal content, and are rather difficult. With each instrument calculated at 20 chips, a 300,000 instrument market can be figured at 8 million chips. 4. BP machines, dageda [1129 0766 1129], photoelectric terminals, fiber-optic connector meters and other communications instruments, and satellite earth stations will use 12 million to 16 million. 5. In addition there are automotive electronics, ship electronics, traffic control projects, and mining electronics, as well as electronics to control the electrical load to save energy, electronic scales, electric meter circuits, medical instruments, personal home computers, and textile electronics. The various things listed above are provisionally estimated at 240 million integrated circuits. From that it is forecast that 445 million integrated circuits will be used in investment type products and the share of investment type products will rise to 43 percent from 39 percent in 1992. This year, China's self-design of application specific integrated circuits will reach something of a breakthrough. China's integrated circuit microelectronics technology is now at a design breakthrough. Qinghua's 1 micrometer research and development line is developing the fax machine thermo-sensor head's LSI and the Qinghua Huahuan Electronics Company, Limited is striving to research parts for use in the fourth and fifth group of optical fiber equipment. The Southeast University National Asic System Engineering Technology Research Center is developing a Chinese BP machine circuit and the TP3040 and TP3057 customer coding board circuits for the programmable switchboard. The Shanghai National Microelectronic Engineering Research Center has developed the Santana automobile oil pressure warning circuit, the electronic speedometer circuit, bank and telephone magnetic strip circuits, and touch on and off circuits. The Central Research Institute of the Huajing Electronic Group has developed the four bit microcomputer circuit, the EWSD programmable switchboard circuit, the CTS-130W color television remote control integrated circuit, and the digital remote control tuning and sound circuits. The Beiling [6296 1545] Company is developing a color television remote control circuit and the 1240 programmable switchboard circuit. The Beijing Integrated Circuit Design Center has developed the world's highest grade 89C51 single chip processing circuit and a liquid crystal drive circuit. Beijing University's microelectronics department is working on a kilomega high speed ECL circuit. China is presently making a concentrated effort to research and test 2 micrometer, 1.65/1.2 micrometer, 1 micrometer, and even 0.8 micrometer product technology. Moreover, units are closely integrating design and application and linking them to domestic and foreign processing. In addition, in the large market and in the high technology set-up, competition in the area of integrated circuits will open up in all directions; science, industry, and trade. In 1994 foreign companies will take advantage of the integrated circuit market, relying on their superior technology and finances, and they will pay a great deal of attention to service, even opening up the market for door to door service. So, in 1994 integrated circuit market competition will not be with illegally imported goods, but with authentic foreign products and their agents, competition in science and technology, between state enterprise and joint venture production, in trade and information service, and in every direction; science, industry, and trade.
