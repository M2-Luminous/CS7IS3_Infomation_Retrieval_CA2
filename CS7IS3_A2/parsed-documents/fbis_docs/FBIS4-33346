"People are afraid of Lula's candidacy," he said. Here are some of Stedile's answers: [O ESTADO] How does the MST evaluate the SAE report? [Stedile] It is a shame. It is an action typical of retired military spies [araponga]. It must have been a vice acquired during the days of the military dictatorship. In the last few months, the MST National Coordinating Board met the president of the Republic. The president promised to begin a program to settle 100,000 families. The labor minister visited our encampment. Minister Mario Flores (of the SAE) does not need to pay the retired military to watch us. We invite them to visit. We will show them all of our very Brazilian weapons, such as hunger, unproductive farms, children without schools, and a great desire to work. [O ESTADO] What is the MST's ideological trend? [Stedile] The MST was born from the workers' need to ensure the implementation of the agrarian reform. The Constitution establishes that all unproductive land must be expropriated. No ideological motivation is required. [O ESTADO] What about guerrilla training at Ipojuca, which was mentioned in the SAE report, and the objectives of the armed fight at Bico do Papagaio [a region in the northern part of Tocantins State]? [Stedile] This is nonsense. The Ipojuca settlement was established by the Liberal Front Party government. In Tocantins State, the MST does not even exist. [O ESTADO] Does the MST have members from other countries? [Stedile] That is another myth. The SNI [National Intelligence Service] (the organization that preceded the SAE) should know about international politics. With all the misery reigning in the country, we do not need foreigners to explain our reality to us. [O ESTADO] What relation does the movement have with similar groups in South America, such as the Paraguayan MST? [Stedile] Latin America has the Peasant and Indigenous Popular Movement of the 500 Years of Resistance. The MST, CUT [Sole Workers Center], indigenous groups, and black groups participate in this movement on Brazil's behalf. [O ESTADO] What is role of CUT and the PT [Workers Party] in the movement? [Stedile] We identify ourselves with CUT, and some MST militants and leaders are affiliated to the PT. People, however, support all parties. Some deputies, such as Mauro Bragato of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], are Sao Paulo Governor Fleury's leaders in the Assembly. [O ESTADO] And the MST resources? [Stedile] They basically come from our own grassroots. It is an illusion to think that our resources come from abroad. In many cases we receive support from the Church, and most of our encampments receive food from the government.
