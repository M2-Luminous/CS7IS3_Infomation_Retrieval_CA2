Hence, the margin set by the payments agreement (130 million ECU's) has been overdrawn for the first time since this method of financing of the trade between the Czech and the Slovak Republics was introduced. Interest of 10 percent is due on the amount by which the margin was overdrawn, and, according to the payment agreement, the debtor must cover this amount in convertible currency within 15 days. Otherwise, the penalty interest is raised to 15 percent. The Czech National Bank has not planned talks with the Slovak side so far because the debtor should cover the margin excess practically automatically, Jan Vit, vice governor of the Czech National Bank told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday in this respect. The Czech National Bank is conducting a so-called annulment of the old lot and its transfer to the new lot at the end of each month. In December, the old lot shows a deficit in Slovak payments in the amount of 46.78 million ECU's, and, on the new lot, the Czech Republic had a surplus of 122.13 million ECU's. The old lot records in the 1 to 1 ratio all payments for trade prior to the currency separation; the new lot records payments for trading after this date.
