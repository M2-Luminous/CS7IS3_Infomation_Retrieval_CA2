Its statement says that more than 2,000 cubic meters of liquid nuclear waste was kept in fleet and factory-owned tankers moored in the Bolshoi Kamen bay, most of them unfit for durable storage. As a result, radiation levels in the region have risen, according to findings by an interdepartmental commission of inquiry. The commission said radiation levels had doubled in the engine department of a TNT-5 tanker which was written off two years ago and were several times in excess of background radiation in the bay itself. The regional authorities have given the fleet command and factory management until April 25 to comply with safety standards for nuclear waste storage. Earlier, the commission had agreed to the dumping of a load of liquid nuclear waste held in the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan.
