SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been contrary to the public interest. Immediate action is needed to prevent possible loss of life and damage to vessels in the area and to the structure itself.

Accordingly, persons wishing to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under ADDRESSES in this preamble. Commenters should include their names and addresses, identify the docket number for the regulations, and give reasons for their comments. Based upon comments received, the regulations may be changed.
