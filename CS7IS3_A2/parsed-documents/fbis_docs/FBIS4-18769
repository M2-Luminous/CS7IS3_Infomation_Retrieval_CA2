Admittedly, Scharping is linking his demand more clearly and precisely to Ankara respecting human rights than does Kohl, but this is not the way to do it! Presenting oneself as tough for the sake of right-wing voters and dangling human rights guarantees in front of liberal and thoughtful people at the same time is dangerous. It is dangerous, because it creates the impression that it only requires a few talks with Ankara to remove the obstacles to deportations that have quite rightly been built up by the law on foreigners and the Geneva Convention on Refugees. Reality looks quite different. Turkey has violated every human rights agreement it has ever signed. Turkey is using the fight against the Workers Party of Kurdistan to complete its political, cultural, and social oppression of the Kurds. And, in Turkey, promises of the civilian government do not carry much weight. In the Kurdish areas -- and not only there -- the Army has the final say. Politicians should be careful not to create the impression that the problem is easy to solve. Otherwise they might pressure themselves into having to violate international obligations in order to keep their promises. No, there must be an end to suggestions that Turkey is a country to which people can be deported. Anyone committing an offense in Germany must be tried in Germany and put in German prisons.
