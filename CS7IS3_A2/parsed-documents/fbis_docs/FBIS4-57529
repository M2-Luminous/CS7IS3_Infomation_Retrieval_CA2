FBIS4-57529 "drlat098_j_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Panama Roundup of Economic Developments Roundup of Economic Developments PA1805004094 PA1805004094 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. Harmodio Arias, commerce and industry vice minister, announced yesterday that the Mexican Government decided not to accept Panama's latest offer for paying off this country's crude oil debt, which has been pending for the past five years. Despite the fact that an agreement was made, negotiations will continue, and it is expected that an understanding satisfactory to both parties will be reached shortly. Vice Minister Arias refrained from disclosing the details of Panama's offer but did say that the current administration would like to reach to an agreement before the new government is sworn in. Panama currently maintains a $120 million debt to Mexico for crude oil purchased within the framework of the San Jose Pact. This debt, which has been outstanding since before 1989, accumulates monthly interest totalling $800,000.

Tax exemptions and customs rights for imports totalled $135.9 million, of which $124.1 million corresponds to the manufacturing sector. Exemptions within this sector represent 91.4 percent of total exemptions and are related to machinery, heavy equipment, spare parts, raw material, semi-processed goods, containers, and imported bearings. The Comptroller General indicated that, although the 1993 figures are evidence of an 8.3 percent drop from the 1992 level, "Panama still continues to be basically an exempt country." He believes that the practice should be amended in order to use these additional revenues in other government sectors. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 10 May 94 p B1)
