Virtually all heavy weapons of the Bosnian Serbs have been removed from the 20-km zone or placed under UN supervision, he said on Deutschlandradio. Since this is only a small step on the road ahead, political talks must begin immediately, Kinkel said. It cannot be right that the weapons that have been withdrawn appear in other combat zones, for example, Tuzla and Bihac. Kinkel evaluated the solution achieved in and around Sarajevo as a beginning that will "hopefully" be translated into an "overall solution," because there are "many Sarajevos." The cease-fire has to be consolidated and the siege of the Bosnian capital has to be called off. There is no reason for euphoria, the minister said. The main work is starting now. Here the Germans could offer their "mediating good offices." Croats and Muslims also have to be brought together, in order to achieve a political solution. Kinkel said that Russia's role is important.
