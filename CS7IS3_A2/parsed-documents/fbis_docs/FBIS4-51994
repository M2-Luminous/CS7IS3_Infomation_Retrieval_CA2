The film was seen by Choe Kwang, Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and other senior party and government officials. "The Nation and Destiny" Part 18 which was completed as a masterpiece under the guidance of the party deals with the life of the heroine Ho Chong-sun who covered an eventful road because she failed to meet a wise leader after setting out on the communist movement in the 1920s for the independence of Korea. The film deeply anatomizes the tragic communist movement in those days when it was divided into various factions by their disgusting fighting and vividly proves the truth that only when the whole nation is united around the wise leader, guided by him, is it possible to restore the lost country and win victory in revolution.
