Several days ago, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government and the Yunnan Provincial Health Department held an emergency telephone meeting on preventing the spread of epidemic diseases. The meeting instructed all levels of governments and health administrative departments to take measures and strengthen epidemic preventive work. According to a JIANKANG BAO [Health Newspaper] report, there have been emergency occurrences of many epidemic diseases, with a very high death rate. The main reason is that preventive work is not effective and there are no methods to promptly control the spread of epidemics. The Yunnan Provincial Government has asked governments at all levels to speedily ensure funding for epidemic preventive work, to promptly collect information on epidemics, and to ensure the supply of preventive medicine, remedial medicine, emergency biological products, disinfectants, insecticides, and all kinds of relief goods, so that measures can be immediately taken to control the spread of epidemics at the first signs of an outbreak.
