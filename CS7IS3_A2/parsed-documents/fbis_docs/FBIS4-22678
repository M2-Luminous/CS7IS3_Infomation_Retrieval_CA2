Savin: "Elections Nemtsov-Style"] [Text] Arkhangelskoye Village, Nizhegorod Oblast--Elections to the local authorities in Nizhegorod Oblast are scheduled for 27 March. The support of no less than 3 percent of the district's electorate is required for registration as a candidate for deputy of the oblast legislative assembly. Such are the requirements of the statute on elections in the oblast. It was in accordance with this published law that I began to collect signatures. Our District No. 31 has an electorate of 52,700, consequently, I needed the support of 1,581 persons. I managed this task, but all of a sudden there comes news (via the newspaper once again) just a few days before the end of the signature-collection and candidate-registration campaign that no fewer than 2,000 voters of the district have to support the candidate for deputy. In other words, the rules of the game have been changed during the game. Only with us, perhaps, is such a thing possible. Also interesting is the fact that Governor Nemtsov has lowered the minimum turnout for the elections to be deemed valid to 25 percent of the electoral roll eligible "to vote and to run for office." Let us now try to understand all that is going on at our elections. First, they will produce no changes in the organs of power. The administration heads will remain in place, possessing the real power. The village elders will be wholly dependent on the rayon mayors, having no command authority and receiving purely symbolic wages. Second, the elections to the oblast organs of power have been planned such that at the first stage even, that is, at the time of registration of the candidates, a realistic chance of being elected was cut off for the ordinary mortal. Whoever adopted this law was either entirely ignorant of the territorial disconnectedness of the inhabitants in a rural locality or was in fact counting precisely on this. I can say from my own experience that it is no easy thing to collect the electorate's ID data in such a quantity in the countryside. It is considerably easier for whoever either has the money or occupies a directive position. In this case they operate not simply but very simply--they dispatch their subordinates to the meetings or they go to the personnel departments and the councils, where they write down all the data of interest to them. Third, in a democratic (that is, power-of-the-people) state, it seems to me, the nomination of candidates for deputy by representatives of the ordinary working people should be made as easy as possible. But the governor of Nizhegorod Oblast has his own view of the organization of "democratic" elections. To consolidate his power he is prepared to sacrifice the interests of 75 percent of the electorate, which, evidently, is contrary to the rules of public law in a truly democratic country. I know once again from personal experience that even if the requisite number of people do not show up at the polls on 27 March, the missing votes will be added at the polling stations so that they may report and please the authorities. The question arises in this connection: Who needs these elections?
