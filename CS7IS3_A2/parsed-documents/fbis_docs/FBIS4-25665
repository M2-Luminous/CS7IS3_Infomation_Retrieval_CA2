"We have taken note of the relevant report, but have not got official information," a foreign ministry spokesman said. "We will follow closely the development of the situation." North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday that Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog organisation, three days after the IAEA adopted sanctions against it. China, the closest major ally to the isolated Stalinist state, abstained in the vote and reiterated that it would not join moves to approve economic sanctions at UN level. It insists on dialogue with Pyongyang as a means of resolving the 13-month-long crisis. Meanwhile, KCNA, monitored in Tokyo, said a North Korean military delegation returned home Monday after visiting China. The delegation was headed by Choe Kwang, a member of the Politburo and chief of staff of the North Korean armed forces. The dispatch gave prominence to Chinese pledges of continuing support and loyalty to North Korea. It quoted General Liu Huaqing, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese communist party's Politburo and deputy chairman of the central military commission, as saying "friendly relations between the two countries ... have reached a higher phase and been consolidated today." "The people of China treasure Sino-Korean friendship and will pass it on from generation to generation," he was quoted by KCNA as saying.
