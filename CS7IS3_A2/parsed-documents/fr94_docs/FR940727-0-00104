FR940727-0-00104 FR940727-0-00025 Figure G&hyph;2. Sample Fact Witness Approval Letter Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 Dear Mr. Taylor: This letter responds to your request to interview and depose Captain Buzz Sawyer as a witness in Morgan v. Jones. Subject to the following conditions, your request is approved. This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness. This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. See 32 CFR §516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure. The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States. See 32 CFR §516.48. If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500. ␣␣Sincerely, Robert V. Jackansi, Major, JA, Chief, Administrative Law Figure G&hyph;3. Sample Expert Witness Denial Letter Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation: Smithers v. ABC Video. For the following reasons, the request is denied. Army Regulation 27&hyph;40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR §§97.6(e), 516.42. Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances. The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest, or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies, a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers to the contrary. The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal taxpayer. Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government. This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony. You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception to the Army's policy. If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500. ␣␣Sincerely, Robert V. Jackansi, Major, JA, Chief, Administrative Law.
