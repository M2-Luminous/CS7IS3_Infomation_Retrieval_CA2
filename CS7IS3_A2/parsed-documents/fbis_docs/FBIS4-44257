But the effort could easily fail and does, in any case, still fall far short of true stabilisation. If Mr Chernomyrdin is indeed a man with whom the West can do business, it makes sense to do the decisive business now. To wait may be to lose the opportunity. As former head of a large Soviet gas enterprise, Gasprom, Mr Chernomyrdin has the political clout lacked by the younger reformers, Mr Yegor Gaydar and Mr Boris Fedorov. What he lacked was their understanding. But he does seem to have come a long way, particularly for someone who proclaimed early this year that the era of "market romanticism" was over. It was he, after all, who wrote in the FT [FINANCIAl TIMES] last month that "it is vitally important that every member of the Russian Government fully understands that a strong ruble is the indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy, and the Russian state as a whole." So far has the government come that Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was persuaded in March to advance the $1.5bn second tranche of the systemic transformation facility. Negligible in itself, this sum was an important sign of confidence in the Russian Government. Nor has that confidence appeared misplaced. Monetary policy has been tight, while inflation has been kept down -- to just 6.8 per cent in May, following 10 per cent a month between February and April. Unfortunately, partly because of a 25 per cent decline in industrial output since last year, government figures show tax collection 15 per cent below budget in the first quarter. The deficit has been kept under control mainly by non-payment of spending obligations, measures that are neither desirable nor sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, there are strong pressures for more spending from lobbies for the military, the military- industrial complex, agricultural interests (strongly represented in the Duma) and the northern territories. The limited success so far may well not last. But it would not be good enough, even if it were to. Output has already fallen so far that successful stabilisation might bring a strong turnround in the economy next year. But first there needs to be not just a prolongation of the present long drawn out squeeze, but a serious effort to break inflationary expectations. What is needed, in fact, is true stabilisation. That could be achieved through a programme to peg the exchange rate, combined with elimination of inflationary financing of the budget deficit. More funding would be needed than is now available. Much of it could be raised domestically, some in higher domestic revenue and some in domestic borrowing, but a precondition would be more Western finance. Some 4-5 per cent of Russian gross domestic product in external assistance, for two or three years, might do the trick. The bill for the West would be perhaps $14bn a year. Judged by aid budgets this is a large sum. Judged by the more relevant standard of military spending, it is small. What needs to be understood is that Russia is not merely an aid problem. Stabilising its economy offers probably the most significant current opportunity to make the world a better place. Mr Chernomyrdin's determination offers the West yet another chance to help, but it may not last. While such an opportunity may come again, it would be sheer folly for Western leaders to act on that assumption.
