"It has been a difficult decision because we already know today that the budget law will not be fully implemented. President Walesa hopes that modifications will be introduced during the course of the budget year. This need is probably also perceived by the authors of the law," Drzycimski pointed out. He added that the president does not rule out the possibility of filing a complaint with regard to the budget with the Constitutional Tribunal. However, he will acquaint himself with experts' opinions and legal analyses beforehand. One of the reasons the president wants to veto the parish local government law is that this law comes into force during the course of the election campaign, Drzycimski said. "This law does not resolve many problems; generally, it does not resolve anything, and, in fact, it introduces more chaos," he said. The president wants to talk to the coalition but not about the past, Drzycimski said. "The issue involving Rosati belongs to the past, in the president's opinion. This matter has been closed, and there is no need to return to it. If the coalition puts forward a new candidate, a meeting will certainly take place," Drzycimski added.
