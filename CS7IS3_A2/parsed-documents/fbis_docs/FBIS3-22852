Das: "Indian Nuclear Establishments Get Clean Chit From IAEA"] [Text] The recent statement of Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that nuclear establishments in India are safe is a rebuff to Columbia Broadcasting Service Network. In a 60-Minutes report a few days back, CBS had charged that India's nuclear plants are safety hazards. The CBS charge seems to be a planted story by the vested interests in the U.S. Administration to create anti-India opinion in international community to put pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. Dr. R. Chidambaram, chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, has described the American TV story as malicious, mischievous, and a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts. Dr. (Maurice Russel), assistant director general for nuclear safety of IAEA, on Tuesday rightly said that safety or the lack of it cannot be judged merely by televising or publishing a few of the good or bad points. According to IAEA, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board of India is making substantial progress in implementing the required safety standards, which are comparable to internationally acceptable norms and levels. According to international regulation, the same ultimate safety goods can be achieved by different countries in different ways through systems or procedures differently adopted to suit the specific national conditions. Safety is based on an overall safety consciousness and safety culture, which have their roots not only in technical capability but also in the sociocultural makeup of a country and the openness with which safety-related issues are discussed with the media as well as national specialists and international counterparts. Dr. (Maurice), who visited various Indian nuclear installations last week, was greatly impressed by the team spirit of Indian qualified personnel in manning the activities of the plants, which contribute as essential elements toward building a healthy safety culture. Dr. (Maurice) has offered to cooperate with India in emergency safety regulations at its nuclear power plants. In fact, the Clinton administration has of late shifted from its earlier policy and undertones of its policy are biased against India. Various officials of U.S. Administration have been issuing irresponsible statements on various aspects of Indian life, be it trade, human rights, environment, management, defense, or India's national integration. Based on half-baked truths, they have been issuing statements on India and have been trying to pose as if they are the best world preachers. Despite the vows of interest in participating in India's economic resurgence, America has been misleading the world community about India's nuclear policy. By its report on the safety conditions in the Indian nuclear installations, CBS was trying to frighten the world when it said that India's nuclear installations pose safety hazards. The U.S. Administration has also been insisting on pursuing the proposal of keeping South Asia a nuclear-free zone in the face of India's discernible reluctance. The USA is least bothered with the existence of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in Central Asia. It is also not bothered by the continuing transfer of missile- related technology from China to Pakistan, including the shipment of Chinese M-11 missile parts to Islamabad. The USA deliberately kept its eyes and ears closed when nuclear technology was being clandestinely stolen from USA by Pakistan. The double standard of the USA on Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has prevented India from signing the NPT so far. On the part of India, it is prudent to ignore pinpricks and statements from the U.S. officials and should not materially change its nuclear policy of utilizing atomic energy for peaceful purposes only, necessary for development requirements of the nation. [sentence as heard] The USA must realize that preventing others from acquiring nuclear capability will prove ineffective as long as it perpetuates retention of its own and others' nuclear arsenals. If the U.S. is really interested in South Asia to pull back from nuclear threshold, it should promote such a dialogue rather than exacerbate tensions by encouraging Kashmiri militancy. India's perseverance and firmness on the nuclear issue could bring this home.
