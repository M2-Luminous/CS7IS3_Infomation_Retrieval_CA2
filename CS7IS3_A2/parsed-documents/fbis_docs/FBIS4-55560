In an interview granted to our Washington correspondent Peter Susko, they assessed their agenda of yesterday, which was their first full working day, and the results of talks they had with U.S. representatives. [Begin recording] [Weiss] We met Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, who has great affinity for Slovakia. After the liberation, he was the first U.S. consul to Slovakia. He has a reputation of being both a defender and an advocate of Slovak interests. [passage omitted] Pell's interest centered first and foremost on the position of minorities and on their representation in the Slovak parliament. [passage omitted] [Ftacnik] The fact that Senator Pell received our delegation testifies to the importance the U.S. side attaches to our working trip to the United States of America. Of the other meetings we have had, I would like to mention the meeting with Department of State representatives in charge of the Slovak Republic and our discussion with experts on Central and East Europe on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has transpired that the representatives of the U.S. Administration realize the role the Party of the Democratic Left is playing and could be playing in Slovak politics even after the early parliamentary elections. That is why they showed interest in our policies and positions on the key issues of Slovak domestic and foreign policy. [end recording] [passage omitted]
