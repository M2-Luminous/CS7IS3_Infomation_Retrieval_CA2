But a limit that ensured nobody was exposed to hazardous amounts could not be achieved overnight, scientific advisers said. Yesterday they called for an interim level on benzene concentrations in the air of five parts per billion (ppb) averaged over the year but urged the Government to plan a limit soon of one part per billion. At the moment, somebody breathing London's air is inhaling amounts of benzene equivalent to smoking about 15 cigarettes a day. Professor Anthony Seaton, chairman of the independent panel on air quality standards, which has recommended the limits, said they had taken a pragmatic approach because some people might be more at risk from benzene than others. "Because of the uncertainties and because it is a genotoxic carcinogen, one which hits the DNA, it was felt the less benzene in the air the better," he said. The decision to act over benzene follows growing public alarm over car-related air pollution. Studies in animals and humans have shown that benzene, 78 percent of which comes from car fumes in Britain, accumulates in bone marrow and brain tissue and causes leukaemias. In very high doses it is lethal. Robert Atkins, the environment minister, said yesterday that daily bulletins on benzene levels would be issued from 12 new monitoring stations. Environment Department officials said yesterday they would also be publishing a consultation document on how they planned to meet the panel's targets. They said meeting the interim, 5 ppb limit should be possible but admitted that some parts of Britain might still exceed the guidelines. Better engine designs, tougher MoT emission tests and the phasing in of catalytic converters should achieve reductions in benzene levels. However, meeting the tougher level would be harder as the number of cars on the roads overwhelmed technological improvements. They said a variety of measures would be necessary. Professor Seaton, of the University of Aberdeen's medical school, said diesel cars were not the answer. Although they produce less benzene, they produce more of a range of pollutants also linked with cancer including particulates and 1.3 butadiene. The recommendations on benzene levels are the first of a series to be produced by the panel, covering up to 100 air pollutants, many of which are linked with car fumes. Figures in the report show that London's air occasionally breaks the interim limit and often breaks the stricter one of 1 ppb. During 1991 and 1992, for example, measurements in Knightsbridge showed an average annual concentration of 6 parts per billion; in December 1991 concentrations peaked at around 13 ppb. Rural levels at Harwell, Oxfordshire, fluctuated between 1.7 and 0.4 ppb. Other research has indicated that benzene levels inside cars are higher than outside. Professor Seaton said: "If you are in a traffic jam with the heater sucking in the exhaust of the car in front, it is quite plausible you can get higher levels of all sorts of things."
