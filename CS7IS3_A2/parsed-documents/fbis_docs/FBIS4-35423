The House supported the stand of its judicial committee, which insisted on preserving amendments introduced by the Lower House to the Law. A heated debate took place at the meeting over Clause C of the law's Article 2, which was added by the Lower House, stipulating that the Ministry of Youth shall segregate sexes at swimming pools. The clause was deleted by the Upper House. The House's Judiciary Committee insisted on maintaining the clause in the law, saying sexual segregation in public swimming pools "conforms with our Islamic values and the deeply-rooted morals of our society." With some deputies saying it was difficult to segregate the sexes in private swimming pools or on the al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea beaches, others called for specifying which pools would fall under the provisions of the law. They said that it was possible to apply the article to the ministry's swimming pools, while it was difficult to apply it to those of hotels, touristic facilities and the al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea beaches. They said the law should not include swimming pools at touristic areas since this might affect the tourism industry. The House then approved the amended 1994 Civil Courts Law after its Judiciary Committee introduced several amendments to it. It commenced its debate of the amended Municipalities law, which was sent back to it by the Senate, which introduced several amendments to it. The House approved some of these amendments but insisted on preserving others as they were passed by it.
