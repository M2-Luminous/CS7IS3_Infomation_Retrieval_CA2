Office location and telephone number: Special Review Branch, Crystal Station #1, 3rd Floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, (703)-308-8033. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document announces the revocation of tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the pesticide Perthane in or on raw agricultural commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.139. EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the Federal Register of June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28326), which proposed the revocation of tolerances for residues of Perthane in or on various raw agricultural commodities. The Agency's decision to revoke these tolerances was based on the fact that all registered uses of Perthane have been canceled. The Agency believes that sufficient time has passed for legally treated agricultural commodities to have gone through the channels of trade. Since it is unlikely that Perthane would persist in soil, there is no expectation of a residue problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently, no action levels are being recommended to replace these revoked tolerances. No public comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule. Therefore, based on the information considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the June 1, 1994 proposal and in this final rule, the Agency is hereby revoking the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.139 for residues of 1,1-dichloro-2,2- bis ( p -ethylphenyl)ethane (Perthane). Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in the June 1, 1994 proposed rule.
