They will not be allowed to deviate a single inch from the determined route or take a closer look at an earth mound or a tree at the giant plant. The strictly communist North Korea will not allow any inspections of the site where the IAEA expects underground secret nuclear plants to be located. "We know that the two plants exist," IAEA spokesman David Kyd told KURIER. "They are clearly recognized on satellite pictures. They are located right in the center of the Yongbon site. " However, North Korea denies everything categorically. The plants in question are merely "military facilities." In the seven declared nuclear plants to which the IAEA will be granted access, North Korea cannot build an "atomic bomb" but rather fissile material. "North Korea started its nuclear program 20 years ago. We are absolutely certain that it possesses more plutonium than Pyongyang admits," Kyd stressed. Only 5-8 kg are needed to produce a single atomic bomb. According to Kyd, the required pressure to ensure the inspection of the two secret plants can only be exerted by the United States. "The IAEA does not have any instruments; only Washington has something to offer" -- that is economic aid for the extremely poor North Korea or the U.S. promise to renounce the large-scale maneuver, planned together with South Korea.
