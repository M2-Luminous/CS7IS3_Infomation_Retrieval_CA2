The loan or lease does not necessarily have to be with the institution providing the insurance. Term-life insurance coverage may continue after the loan has been repaid or the lease terminated, provided the member can reasonably be expected to borrow again within 2 years, and provided the continuation of insurance is not contrary to state law. (2) A debtor-creditor relationship is not required for the sale of other insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as purchasers are members or borrowers of a System bank or association. For the purposes of this section, ``member'' means a stockholder or participation certificate holder who acquired stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for investment purposes, or to qualify for other services of the association or bank. * * * * * (6) Bank or association personnel shall not benefit from insurance sales by receipt of commissions or gifts from underwriting insurance companies. However, an employee may participate in an institution's incentive plan under which incentive compensation is provided for the sale of insurance. In any single year, such compensation shall not exceed an amount equivalent to more than 5 percent of the recipient's annual base salary. * * * * * PART 620_DISCLOSURE TO SHAREHOLDERS 1.
