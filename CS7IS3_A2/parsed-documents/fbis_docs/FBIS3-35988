Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze are to sign them 3 February. On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi Shevardnadze has advocated launching new relations with Russia designed to help settle the Abkhazian and South Ossetian crises and overcome economic difficulties. The Georgian leader stressed that the documents which will be signed meet Russia's strategic interests. On the subject of the imminent return 10 February of the Georgian refugees to Abkhazia, Shevardnadze announced the prospect of a Russian peacekeeping mission in the conflict zone in collaboration with the UN endeavors. Rumors are rife about Georgia's also joining the ruble zone. Parliamentary discussion of issues which have generated the inflation of the coupon has been put back to 10 February. The Cabinet of Ministers said it was not ready to issue an analysis of the problem. This situation was assessed thus: Yeltsin will come, Georgia will enter the ruble zone, and there will be no need to discuss the coupon problem, since the coupon itself will no longer exist. "The question of the possibility of Georgia's joining the ruble zone may really be on the agenda at the talks," Tengiz Sigua, retired head of the Cabinet of Ministers and one of the leaders of the opposition, agreed. "But I doubt that we will return to the ruble. We have not asked Russia whether it needs such a burden. Those who claim that if Georgia joins the ruble zone it will receive products and energy sources at the wave of a magic wand are bluffing. We will not see those so easily. But the fact that we need to build good-neighborly relations both politically and economically -- that I agree with." Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence Party, wants to gain an advantage for himself from Yeltsin's visit -- to restore the prestige of the street platform. He came to the parliament from street rallies, and he wants to go back to them. This young radical is promising to gather an audience on the days of Yeltsin's visit and hold a rally outside the Russian Embassy building. "Russia should know that not everyone in Georgia is satisfied with its imperial attitude toward us," Tsereteli told journalists. Tsereteli will hold a rally if he can assemble an audience, which people here doubt. But B. Kakubava, head of the Abkhazia liberation organization and a deputy in the Georgian parliament, does not have to go out of his way to gain an audience. There are thousands of refugees from Abkhazia in Tbilisi today. In the next few days Kakubava is planning to bring them out onto the streets, and these will be the first "meeting groups" the Russian president will see, he stated; they will sit down at the airport and the Russian Embassy and declare a hunger strike, demanding a meeting with Yeltsin. "Yeltsin will hear us," Kakubava said. "We will tell him how guilty Russia and Russian citizens are for the fact that 250,000 refugees now find themselves displaced from their homes." Another person who comes from Abkhazia is more pragmatic -- Vice Premier Tomaz Nadareishvili, who once headed the government of the autonomous formation. Nadareishvili believes that rallies are not compulsory. You simply have to ask the specific questions. And as for the official authorities, they are waiting impatiently for the Russian president's first visit. A commission to meet B. Yeltsin has been set up. Georgia, which suffered during the years of ersatz independence, thirsts first and foremost for serious political and economic cooperation.
