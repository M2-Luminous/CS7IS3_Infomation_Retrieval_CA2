This loss, according to Kozyrev, will be made up with uranium fuel, which Russia will obtain after recycling the weapon-grade uranium in collaboration with the United States. Part of the profit gained from the sale of uranium on the world market belongs to Ukraine, Kozyrev noted. The uranium after all is the property of the former Soviet Union, which is why the profit from its sale will be divided, he said. "We ourselves will obtain weapon-grade uranium, recycle it and sell to America, and the share belonging to Ukraine will be paid in the form of uranium fuel," he clarified. According to the Russian foreign minister, there is no provision for any additional payments by Russia, and also of writing off a part of Ukraine's debts. Andrey Kozyrev said that the United States will provide additional resources so that Moscow and Kiev can both ensure safety during the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal, its transportation and other necessary procedures. Naturally, the dismantling of the arsenal - the nuclear contents and the warhead - will be carried out in Russia only. Not because, Kozyrev emphasised, Moscow wants to humiliate or offend Ukraine, but because the appropriate plants are located in Russia and a warhead can only be dismantled where it was made, otherwise there would be a real danger of monstrous environmental consequences. The signed agreements really are historical. A political decision has been made and the political will has been displayed, now only "purely technical work" is needed to go ahead, Kozyrev said. First of all we should determine the share belonging to Ukraine, deduct from it Russia's expenses on recycling it and other works and repay this part "in whatever form the Ukrainians want and the Russians can manage," he said. But it is a purely technical question, the Russian minister said. Speaking of security guarantees given to Ukraine, Andrey Kozyrev emphasised that they are basically standard ones. These are the same guarantees which the three countries, the United States, England and Russia, give to all the participants in the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty. It is quite natural that the signed documents will come into force only after Ukraine joins the nuclear weapon non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state, the Russian minister said.
