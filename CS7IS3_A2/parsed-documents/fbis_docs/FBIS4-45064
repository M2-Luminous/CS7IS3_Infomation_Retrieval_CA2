This is why one finds them devising a strange terminology to water down the issue. If, for example, they are compelled to denounce radical groups, they rush to denounce what they allege to be government terrorism and police methods that create a climate of violence, as they say. This card shuffling leads them to say strange things with the sole purpose of inciting the masses in the wrong direction. Instead of declaring their rejection of any acts that are capable of terrorizing citizens and awakening sedition, you find them twisting words in order to give people impressions that are in total contrast with the truth. One of the strangest forms of criticism and opposition in Egyptian political life is the kind that criticizes the government and the security agencies for confronting terrorism. It is as if this kind of criticism and opposition wants the government to stand idle in the face of terrorists until the fire spreads to the straw and until they turn Egypt into another Iran. Do the security agencies initiate violence and terrorism in the streets? Do they hit peaceful tourists and strike banks? Are these agencies expected to stand and watch criminals who pose a threat to public security and who spread fright among people? Do these critics consider the security agencies' confrontation of this evil tendency a form of repression and terrorism? The terrorists have recently developed their strategy in Egypt and have moved to adopt the idea of destroying anything and everything indiscriminately. Their terrorism is blind and mindless. This is why all agencies concerned have had to confront this bloody terrorism firmly and with all means and methods and to uproot it in order to protect this country's security and safety. It is normal to arrest the plannners and leaders of terrorist groups. Without these arrests, terrorist activities and incidents in Egypt would have multiplied and sedition would have spread everywhere. Despite the delicate and sensitive situation, the decisive and effective confrontation that we witness today is conducted in accordance with the law which empowers the Ministry of Interior to detain suspects for a one-month period. After this period, the detainee is entitled to resort to the judiciary. If a court orders the detainee's release, the ministry is entitled to appeal the decision in two weeks. If the court orders his release again, then he is released immediately. But if the court orders continued detention because of the detainee's danger to society, then the detainee is entitled to appeal anew to the court once every month, as stipulated by the aforementioned law. This means that arrests of the leaders of sedition are made under the judiciary's control for the sole purpose of ensuring society's security and safety. If those who follow the misguided path had God's fear in their hearts for their country and kinsmen, they would have dropped the weapons with which they threaten the peaceable workers of this country, and they would have proceeded to express themselves peacefully through parties, newspapers, unions, and other channels of peaceful political action and opinion-expression podiums. They would not have subjected themselves to arrest, appeal, and other similar procedures, especially within the democratic system under which our country lives and that guarantees free political action and a free press. In Egypt, there are 13 political parties and more than 100 newspapers. Egypt also has trade unions and workers federations, and all of these are legitimate outlets for whoever wishes to participate in political action. As for those who intentionally and purposefully abandon and reject all this and take up the rifle to kill peaceable people, then they have only themselves to blame. The government's eyes are vigilant and the national security agencies are performing their role in the best manner, and may God protect Egypt from all harm.
