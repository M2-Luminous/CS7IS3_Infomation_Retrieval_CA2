'Abd-al-Karim Salih al-Jihmi was the second YSP official to be killed in 10 days and the 152nd party member to fall victim to gunmen since North and South Yemen merged in May 1990. Party officials said three gunmen fired several shots at al-Jihmi late Friday when he drew up in his car before his home in the Bi'r 'Ubayd district in east Sanaa. The killing comes as a committee seeking to reconcile Yemen's divided government called for the dismantling of illegal military groups in urban areas and proposed a national reconciliation conference. The committee, grouping representatives from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's General Popular Congress (GPC), Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's YSP and opposition movements has been meeting since the beginning of January in a bid to resolve the country's five-month political crisis. Al-Bid has been holed up in the southern port of Aden since August 19 and has said he will not return to Sanaa until reforms providing for sweeping political and economic decentralization have been adopted.
