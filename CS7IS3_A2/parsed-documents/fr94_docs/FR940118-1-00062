FR940118-1-00062 FR940118-1-00008 There Are Five Types of Personal Flotation Devices This is a Type [ insert approved Type ] Hybrid Inflatable PFD. Note: The following types of PFDs are designed to perform as described in calm water and when the wearer is not wearing any other flotation material (such as a wetsuit). Type I _A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face down position to a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore, greatly increasing one's chances of survival. The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where there is a probability of delayed rescue, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that a significant number of boats will be in close proximity. This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes_Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb.)) which are universal sizes (designed to for all persons in the appropriate category). [Insert Illustration of Type I PFD] Type II _A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly backward position in the water. The turning action is not as pronounced as with a Type I and the device will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type I. The Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. This type PFD is normally sized for ease of emergency donning and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb)), and two categories of Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb)). Additionally, some models are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to use the Type II where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing and other water activities. [Insert Illustration of Type II PFD] Type III _The Type III PFD allows the wearer to assume a back of vertical position, and the device will maintain the wearer in that position and have no tendency to turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the wearer face up. A Type III is generally more comfortable than Type II, comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use, and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This type PFD normally comes in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are available. You may also prefer to use the Type III where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. [Insert Illustration of Type III PFD] Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III _A Type I, II, or III Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimal amount of buoyancy when deflated and significantly increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual buoyancy for your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label. This type of PFD provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will accept the responsibility for care of the device and in-water trials to check its performance. The buoyancy provided by this PFD when not inflated will float approximately 90 percent of the boating public. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending on the performance type marked on it. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, while Type II and III are good only when there is a chance of fast rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb); and small child, for persons weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I hybrids but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult and youth sizes but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type IV _A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who has fallen overboard and is intended to be grasped and held by the person until rescued. While the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in certain instances, this type is suitable only where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children. [Insert Illustration of Type IV PFD] Type V (General) _A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses or activities such as board sailing, or commercial white water rafting. These PFDs are not usually suitable for other boating activities. The label on the PFD indicates whether a particular design of Type V PFD can be used in a specific application, what restrictions or limitations apply, and its performance type. Type V Hybrid _A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimum of [ insert the applicable minimum deflated and inflated values from Table 160.077&hyph;15(b)(14) for adult and youth sizes ]. In order for the device to be acceptable for use on recreational boats, it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will wear a PFD by having a reduced amount of inherent buoyancy. However, the user must accept the responsibility for care of the device and inwater trials to check its performance. The buoyancy provided by this PFD when it is not inflated will float approximately 70 percent of the boating public. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending on the performance type marked on it. This type of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb), and may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.
