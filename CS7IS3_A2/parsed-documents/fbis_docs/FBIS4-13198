The talks, part of the multilateral track of the peace process, were winding up Tuesday after bringing together representatives from 43 countries and organisations, including Israel and Arab states. "It is the most successful round of talks by the water committee", an Arab delegate told AFP. "Several useful studies were presented and the meeting yielded the first fruit of the negotiations: a desalination research centre in Oman". Oman proposed setting up the centre at Sunday's opening session following a five month study with the help of international experts. The centre would study ways of cutting the high cost of desalination which is sapping the resources of water-starved Gulf states. Omani minister of state for foreign affairs, Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, said it would benefit Arabs, Israel and other parties as some states outside the Gulf could opt for desalination in future to face growing water consumption. Other projects being discussed are a meteorological centre, a water data bank and a regional water authority proposed by the United States and other Western countries. Delegates said Japan and other industrial nations renewed pledges to support such projects and provide expertise and technical training. The training would benefit Palestinians most as they are on the verge of managing their own water resources but lack the technology and experience, the delegates said. "The United States, France, Japan, Germany and other industrial countries have assured us they will extend assistance in all fields pertaining to water", Palestinian chief delegate Riyad al-Khudayri told AFP on Tuesday. He said the talks were gaining momentum now that Palestinians were creating their own water authority in line with the September 13 autonomy accord signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Western delegates described the Muscat disccusions as more constructive than previous meetings but admitted final agreement on water sharing needed time. "Water is a vital and complicated issue and it has to do with politics" one delegate said. "All parties involved agree on the need for water cooperation but there are some differences on the extent and shape of this cooperation". Bin-'Alawi opened the talks, the water committee's first in a Gulf state, with a call for cooperation to prevent potential conflict and bring regional states closer together. Turkey, the only country in the region to enjoy a large water surplus, was actively involved in the Muscat discussions but it did not push its five-year-old proposal to supply Gulf states with sweet water through a multi-billion-dollar pipeline. "We have made the proposal before and it is still in force because it was found feasible" a Turkish delegate said. "It's up to the Arabs now to decide if they want the project". Gulf governments have turned down the offer on the grounds it is expensive and poses security risks. Conference sources said the Omani desalination research project implied the region wanted to remain dependent on the more secure desalination facilities, which provide them with nearly 70 percent of their sweet water needs. Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin is heading a team of nearly 20 officials and experts, the first time the Jewish state has sent an official delegation to a Gulf Arab country. Jordan is taking part in the talks as an observer after boycotting negotiations in protest at naval interceptions off its coast by Western forces enforcing a United Nations embargo against neighboring Iraq. Iran, another key regional country, stayed away because it is opposed to negotiations with Israel. Syria and Lebanon are boycotting all multilateral talks. Delegates said Lebanon could be a key player in water activity in the region given its large but unexploited water resources.
