Reception is fair. The Bosnia-Herzegovina 3d Corps Information Center reports that "the peace agreement between the Croatian and the Bosnia-Herzegovina sides which, to judge by yesterday's air raids by the chetnik air force and the shelling of Zavidovici and Bugojno, is a thorn in the side of Karadzic's Serbs, has generally been holding. The ustasha who do not want peace yesterday violated the cease-fire in the Busovaca region, where they fired one explosive device from the direction of Zega at Duboki Potok. They fired with a portable rocket launcher at the Gornji Vakuf defense lines. The ustasha snipers opened fire from Relej in the Novi Travnik area at the fire brigade that was putting out the fire caused by the chetnik air raid. The fire was eventually put out and there were no casualties. The ustasha violated the peace in the Vitez region with sporadic small arms fire at the defense lines. By the way, as part of the gradual implementation of the peace agreement, yesterday the experts from the UN Protection Force entered Stari Vitez and started clearing the mine fields around the access points to this town. The next move should be the erecting of checkpoints between Stari Vitez and Zenica. There were no ustasha attacks in the area of Zepca, but they have been cooperating with the chetniks in their own way. They have simply turned over most of the dominant and strategically important facilities around Zavidovici to the chetnik aggressor." Reporting from Kalesija, Abdulah Ridjanovic says that "fierce aggressor's artillery attacks against the defense lines and the free territory continued yesterday. Over 200 shells were fired. The Tuzla airport was also targeted with tanks and howitzers, as was the village of Donje Vukovije, where large material damage was inflicted." In his report from Zvornik, Nijaz Banjanovic says that "yesterday afternoon the chetniks from Klisa, Kitovnice, and Parloge launched a heavy artillery attack on the free Zvornik territory. Tanks, howitzers, and mortars landed on the civilians of Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kobilice. One woman was killed in the shelling. The night passed in provocative fire with antiaircraft weapons and small arms at the defense lines, while this morning the sniper activity from the surrounding hills has intensified against civilians."
