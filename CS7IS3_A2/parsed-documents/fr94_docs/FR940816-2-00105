Description of the Proposal Short Sale Rule Currently, as a matter of just and equitable principles of trade, members must believe at the time they enter into a contract to sell stock that they will be able to perform the contract. The Exchange is adopting Rule 17 under Article IX of the Exchange's Rules to require that prior to effecting a short sale, members make arrangements to borrow the security or obtain other assurances that delivery can be made on settlement. 10 The new rule provides an exception for bona fide market making activities. To use the exception, specialists, market makers, and odd-lot dealers must show that the sale was part of their bona fide market making activities. The rule also requires specialists, market makers, and odd-lot dealers to notify the Exchange whenever they accumulate a position in a security that is greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding public float of the security. 10 This rule is similar to New York Stock Exchange Rule 440C.10, interpretation 01 (Short Sales). Summary Suspension The Exchange is modifying Article VII of its Rules concerning summary suspension and reinstatement of members and member organizations (collectively ``members''). 11 Currently, Rule 2 of Article VII permits the emergency suspension of a member if it has failed to perform its contracts or is insolvent or is in such financial or operational condition or otherwise conducting its business in such a manner that it cannot be permitted to continue in business with safety to its customers, creditors, or the Exchange. The rule change codifies in Rule 2 the language of Section 6(d)(3) of the Act which allows national securities exchanges to summarily suspend members, or limit members' or non-members' access to exchange services. Specifically, the Exchange is adding to Rule 2 of Article VII that the president may suspend a member if the member has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, or barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any self-regulatory organization. 12 In addition, the rule change adds to Rule 2 that the President may limit or prohibit access to services offered by the Exchange whenever it appears that persons who are not members fail to meet the qualification requirements or other prerequisites for access to such services and cannot be permitted to continue to have access with safety to creditors, investors, members or the Exchange. 13 The rule change also clarifies that the CHX may find that the member cannot continue to do business as a member with safety to investors, creditors, other members, or the Exchange if there is a reasonable belief that a member is violating and will continue to violate any material provision of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws. 14 11 The rule change does not affect Article VII, Rule 1 of the Exchange's Rules regarding the automatic suspension of a member who fails to perform its contracts or is insolvent. 12 See Section 6(d)(3)(A) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 8f(d)(3)(A) (1988). 13 See Section 6(d)(3)(C) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 8f(d)(3)(C) (1988). 14 See Section 6(d)(3)(C) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 8f(d)(3)(B) (1988).
