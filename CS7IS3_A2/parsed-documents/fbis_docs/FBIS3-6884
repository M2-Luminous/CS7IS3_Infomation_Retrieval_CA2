FBIS3-6884 "dreas056__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-056-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Kenichi Ohmae Views Economic Restructuring OW2203143694 Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU in Japanese Mar 94 pp 116-128--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2203143694 Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by Kenichi Ohmae, director of McKinsey & Company Inc.: "The Inventory of a Zero Fighter-Like Nation -- Japan"] [Text] "No amount of negotiations will reach a favorable conclusion when we are forced to deal with Japanese bureaucrats. They will never abandon their vested rights unless they are hit by an atomic bomb," an American trade negotiator said angrily when I met with him recently. I do not totally agree with him. However, the truth is that what Japanese bureaucrats are doing now is similar to what their predecessors, including the military authorities, were doing toward the end of World War II when Japan's defeat was already evident. What did the military authorities do at that time? Until the curtain came down, they did not admit that Japan had lost its power. As a result, Japan continuously fought a bitter retreat, and let itself in for the Imphal action. The Japanese authorities were finally made aware of their defeat only after the nation was hit by two atomic bombs. Moreover, they had the audacity to use the expression "the end of the war" instead "defeat in war." Meanwhile, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States conducted what is referred to as operations research: It conducted scientific research on warfare, using statistics and the law of probability. The United States placed greater emphasis on aircraft carriers, while the large guns of the battleship remained the key weapon of the Japanese. In other words, the United States learned many things while waging war. Once again, Japanese bureaucrats have fallen into the same logic as used during World War II. The current war between Japan and the United States differs from the previous one only in means. The two countries now use economic might instead of armed force. Meanwhile, Japanese bureaucrats continue to take exactly the same attitude their predecessors did 50 years ago. Although the outcome of the war is already evident, they do not want to admit it. The public also shows a similar attitude as it did 50 years ago; people continue to watch the development of events in silence. Major newspapers play up the information released by the government, as they used to do with the official announcements made by the Imperial Headquarters 50 years ago. In December 1993, NEWSWEEK did a cover story on the end of the Japanese system. It explained the collapse of Japan by using the present perfect tense. It clearly said: "The system has crashed." In November 1993, before the NEWSWEEK cover story appeared, I also mentioned in my book The Ohmae Report--Toward a Fundamental Restructuring of Japan (published by Kodansha Ltd.) that the Japanese economic system had crashed. What are the factors that brought about the end of the Japanese centralist system? One of the main factors is the strong departmentalism of Japanese administrative agencies. The defect of departmentalism is the nonexistence of a responsible person capable of studying a question in its broader aspects. For instance, the Ministry of Finance is composed of several divisions such as the Budget Bureau, the Tax Bureau, the Banking Bureau, the Securities Bureau, and the Financial Bureau. Top-ranking officials feel the entire situation automatically comes out correctly if every bureau works well. That is the same mentality the General Staff had during the Greater East Asia War. At that time, the General Staff could not help adopting an optimistic view regarding the outcome of the war, since every general reported the war was going in his favor on his battle front. The industrial world has the same problem: the nonexistence of a business leader capable of looking at the main points. For instance, let us study the auto industry. After years of complicated negotiations, Japan and the United States agreed to raise Japan's self-imposed export quota from 1.68 million to 2.3 million vehicles. In order to sell more cars, Japanese automakers had to establish their manufacturing plants in the United States, and now their U.S. subsidiaries are obliged to procure 50 percent or more of a vehicle's parts in the United States because, under U.S. local-content legislation, a locally made car cannot be considered American if 50 percent of its value does not come from parts and labor originating in the United States. A total of 125 manufacturers, including auto parts manufacturers, have moved to the United States to produce 2 million vehicles. Japanese manufacturers want to export 2.3 million cars from Japan and manufacture 2 million more vehicles in the United States. If that is the case, the U.S. market would be flooded with 4.3 million Japanese cars. Since the U.S. market is estimated at 10 million cars, it would mean more than 40 percent of the market would be dominated by Japanese cars. "Politically speaking, is such a situation acceptable?" Unfortunately, no one considers the matter. When I asked this question to the top executive of each auto manufacturer, each replied in the same way. "I do not know what the other companies are doing, but there is no problem with us because we are planning to sell only 1 million cars." Their attitude proves that in the auto industry, no one can see the problem in perspective. Japan Is Just Like a Zero Fighter ("Flying Fuel Tank") In the first chapter of my book Borderless World (published in English by Harper & Row, and published in Japanese by President Inc.), I had already raised the question in anticipation of the current situation. I said the glut of Japanese cars in the U.S. market would become serious in the near future. The United States feels Japan has two choices: export 2.3 million cars from Japan, or produce 2 million cars in the United States. It is not a question of exporting 2.3 million cars from Japan and producing 2 million more in the United States simultaneously. Therefore, in my book I explained that once Japanese plants begin to produce 2 million cars in the United States, the U.S. Government might ban exports of those 2.3 million cars from Japan. I added that what is certain at the very least is the U.S. Government will never accept over 4 million Japanese cars in the U.S. market. U.S. automakers can now buy Japanese-made high-quality auto parts at a low price; consequently, Japanese manufacturers have lost their competitive superiority. Cars manufactured by U.S. automakers in Detroit are cheaper than those made by Japanese manufacturers. Detroit is now completely restored to its former state, and is able to produce a car 30 percent cheaper than a Japanese car of similar quality. Under the pressure of necessity, Japanese automakers have abandoned the mass market to place greater emphasis on luxury cars. The U.S. automobile industry, which had been suffering severely in the recession as if it had continuously been exposed to heavy rain, now enjoys fine weather. Recently, Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor Company recorded their highest sales and profits. The change in the situation reminds me of the Pacific war. It may safely be said the Japan of today is the exact image of a Zero fighter. At the sacrifice of safety, the Zero fighter was designed to be faster and more maneuverable and to carry more bombs. Thus, when it was attacked by the enemy, its fuselage could be easily pierced by bullets, proving fatal to the crew members. Japanese cars of today are the exact incarnation of Zero fighters. The Zero fighter was nicknamed the "Flying Fuel Tank" because of its thin armor plating. Not only the auto industry but all of Japanese society can be symbolized as such. Japan made many sacrifices to reach its ultimate goal of building a national economy based on exports. Such being the case, Japanese companies were able to defeat their competitors. However, their victory was superficial and ephemeral, for it was not long before they saw their infrastructure being destroyed because of its fragility. Now they are confronted with a disastrous situation. This is exactly what happened to the Zero fighter during World War II. Five years ago people frequently spoke about the collapse of the U.S. manufacturing industry. At that time, U.S. manufacturers were actually in the midst of restructuring. Five years ago, the weakness of the U.S. manufacturing industry was conspicuous, with many companies declaring bankruptcy or having to lay off workers and close down. Thanks to fundamental restructuring, once-strong companies have made a comeback, becoming more powerful than ever. They have reduced their working staffs by half thanks to reengineering (a total rethinking of business processes and practices) and to a substantial rationalization of indirect labor, which was supported by the introduction of information technology systems. The United States owes what it is today to these drastic measures aimed at changing the management system. Far from holding a 40-percent share in the auto U.S. market, Japanese automakers are not even able to maintain a 25-percent market share under the present state of affairs. They cannot sell more than 2.3 million vehicles in total, inclusive of those imported from Japan and manufactured locally. This sales volume is equivalent to the self-imposed export quota (Japanese auto exports to the United States have currently decreased to 1.65 million vehicles). Therefore, they want to shut down their U.S. plants, which have a total capacity of 2 million vehicles. However, they cannot take such a measure since their U.S. plants went into operation only recently. Moreover, politically speaking, the closing down of plants would considerably affect the Japan-U.S. relationship. Japan-bashers would certainly criticize Japan, saying: "Once again Japanese companies created employment destabilization in the United States by shutting down their plants." The only solution left to them is to reduce their exports from Japan. Unfortunately, no corporate executives are ready to give up exports and tackle the employment issue at home. They have a glib tongue; all they can do is stress the need for originality and ingenuity, while their companies continue to lose strength. Japanese companies are now heading toward a dead end. Moment by moment, things are becoming serious, approaching the day when Japan will be hit by another atomic bomb. What has the Ministry of International Trade and Industry been doing until now? All it has done is back up Japan's overseas production. In other words, MITI did nothing other than participate along with the United States in hastening the death of Japanese companies by encouraging them to establish their plants in the United States. Another problem is that Japanese products are driven out of the market because of foreign-made "Japanese products." The parts manufacturing industry is equipment-intensive. Therefore, without mass production, a parts manufacturer cannot pay its way. Domestically, Japanese parts manufacturers have been suffering from sluggish sales due to a prolonged recession. They must export their products to Southeast Asia at low prices. In the case of office automation and audiovisual products, both of which are the forte of Japanese companies, the result was it became possible to reduce costs by 30 percent by assembling these products in Southeast Asia. Singapore, for instance, is flooded with all kinds of Japanese-made parts. Some of them are exported to the United States from there. Domestically, Japanese manufacturers do not feel the need to reduce prices. They continue to impose their expensive office automation products, as well as their expensive audiovisual products, on Japanese users. Under the circumstances, it is quite normal that "Japanese-made Japanese products" cannot compete with "Asian-made Japanese products" in the U.S. market. Moreover, some of these "Asian-made Japanese products" are reimported to Japan. There is no help for Japanese manufacturers. What one has sown, one will have to reap. Japanese companies have rapidly lost their competitive power in this manner. The transfer to Southeast Asia was not limited to the parts manufacturing industry. Other manufacturers completely switched to overseas production by establishing their production hub in Southeast Asia or China, causing the so-called deindustrialization of Japan. As a temporary measure to cope with the situation, hard-hit companies are content to ask the government for "employment adjustment subsidies" to retrain and relocate their excess workers. In Japan, large companies cannot easily dismiss their employees because, if they create unemployment, they will be summoned by the Ministry of Labor and be chastised for engaging in such an inadmissible act. This is why an excellent company like Hitachi Ltd. applies for subsidies when it finds itself with a large number of excess workers. In 1993, the total amount of such subsidies exceeded 100 billion yen. Steel products, automobiles, audiovisual products, and semiconductors--all these industries were doing fine until five years ago. Now most of them are unable to make profits in the export market. With the current dollar-yen exchange rate at the level of 110 yen to the dollar, no Japanese companies are able to bring their export business out of the red. They will probably not reach the break-even point as long as the dollar remains below the 130 yen level. The long and short of it is that Japanese companies are merely pushing themselves into a tight corner. The logic is simple, but unfortunately business leaders are unaware of it. Or they might be conscious of it, but think they have gone too far to retreat. None of them wants to announce a curtailment of output because none of them is sure if other companies will follow their example, so everyone says: "Our company will continue to produce this much for the present term." In any case, Japan is now at death's door, just as it was towards the end of World War II. The Economic Stimulus Package Will Have No Impact "What in the world is the government doing? What it must do is urgently adopt a new economic stimulus package." Japanese business executives repeat this sentence unceasingly. The adoption of pump-priming measures will be charged to the national treasury. That is to say, the government will have to spend tax money collected from the public. This means that, by demanding implementation of a new economic stimulus package, Japanese business leaders are trying to saddle taxpayers with their debts which are the result of their over-optimistic way of doing business. As corporate managers, they should have many other things to do before complaining to the government. However, the fact is they are unable to wrestle with adverse circumstances because everything went so smoothly for them for many years. During the period when Reaganomics and Thatcherism were in full swing, no U.S. or British corporate executives asked their government for help. Rather, they did their best to carry out restructuring for the survival of their companies. In the United States and Great Britain, a timid executive would be immediately ousted from the board meeting. As for Japanese labor unions, they have neither the competency nor moral energy to go on strike. Most have not gone on strike during the past 35 years. They just continue to accumulate union dues. It is not unusual for a Japanese labor union to organize a one-day trip for all its members for a karaoke party at a bath resort. However, no one goes on strike to call management's responsibility into question. Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions] is pleased it has come into power [a parliamentary group composed of Rengo-affiliated councilors is currently a coalition member]. However, the coalition government did nothing but raise public utility charges such as postal rates, the transaction tax on gas, oil, subway fares, and tuition fees for public universities. Is this in line with the doctrine advocated by Rengo that sovereignty resides in the consumers? Moreover, the ordinary postage of domestic mail is now 80 yen; it is cheaper to send a letter by air to Japan from the United States or Australia. What is going on in Japan? With a labor union in power, I expected a less objectionable situation. As for management, it continues to marshal all sorts of flowery words without taking any action. "No one will be dismissed so long as I hold power." Corporate executives hold such feelings because they have always set great value on labor-capital harmonization. While Japanese corporate executives remain idle, Japan's international competitiveness continues to fade away. To begin with, it is overly optimistic to think the implementation of a new pump-priming package will somehow help improve the economic situation. An economic stimulus package, no matter how large, cannot pull the national economy out of recession. The Wage Level Will Stabilize in the United States and China Let us suppose the national economy recovered, or the dollar again reached the 130 yen level. Even under such circumstances, Japan will be unable to beat the United States, the reason being the U.S. manufacturing industry has regained its competitive power in the true sense of the term. Its recuperative power is sustained by labor costs. The average salary of an American worker has not increased for 13 years, since the Reagan era. In fact, in the case of white-collar workers, who account for 25 percent of the working class, their wages have increased by 28 percent. As for the 25 percent at the bottom of the working class, their wages have decreased by 10 percent. On average, the wage level has remained almost unchanged for many years in the United States. For instance, in Japan the average salary of a Rengo-affiliated worker is about 7.2 million yen; meanwhile, in the United States the average salary of a comparable worker is about 4 million yen. This is a little less than 60 percent of the Japanese worker's salary. The recovery of the U.S. industry is supported by such competitive labor costs. Moreover, in addition to labor costs, the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] should be also taken into consideration. NAFTA aims at transforming North America into one huge, single market by 1999. In Canada, where the population totals 25 million, the salary of a white-collar worker is about 30 percent lower than that of a U.S. worker. Meanwhile, in Mexico, where the population totals 80 million, the salary of a blue-collar worker is one-eighth that of a U.S. worker's. What does this mean for U.S. industry? It means U.S. companies might move to Canada or Mexico for low-wage labor if U.S. workers request higher wages. In other words, U.S. business executives have obtained a new option which is extremely favorable for them. NAFTA has this important significance. In the United States, wage levels will probably not increase over the next 10 years as they did during the past 10. Let us now turn our eyes to Japan. We see China is just behind Japan. China has completely changed since March 1992. Many say China is a nation with two systems. In my own opinion, China completely follows the capitalist line, or the mammonist line. In China, the average salary of a blue-collar worker is no more than 60,000 yen a year. Even for a work leader or a foreman or a white-collar worker, the annual salary is about 90,000 yen. A Chinese worker at the Baoshan Iron & Steel Complex or Maanshan Iron and Steel Corporation makes no more than 90,000 yen, while a Japanese worker employed by Nippon Steel Corporation earns more than 10 million yen annually. Although both workers make the same product--crude steel--the labor cost is 100 times higher in Japan. To me, the advent of a reborn China is the same as if 28 new nations like Singapore were formed simultaneously. For instance, when we look at Dalian or Tianjin, we realize there are already many factories assembling such products as the main memory unit for laptop computers, or factories manufacturing cylinder heads for video recorders. In the past, even North America could barely produce cylinder heads. In other words, apart from a few high-tech products such as liquid crystal displays, and apart from some capital- intensive industries, almost everything can be manufactured in China, where it requires only 1 percent of the Japanese labor cost. Moreover, with a population of 1.2 billion, China has an unlimited supply of labor. The most important point is that, like in the United States, wage levels will remain unchanged in China. In South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore the labor market is quite homogeneous. When the economy takes a favorable turn, the labor market tightens rapidly, bringing about an increase in wages. However, in China the labor market is very diversified. For instance, if the wage is $12,000 in Hong Kong, it might be $6,000 in the adjacent area of Shenzhen; in Guangzhou it might be one-third of that in Shenzhen, while in Yunnan it might be one-third of the amount in Guangzhou. More and more people work for lower wages the farther you go inland. China has an "unlimited storage reservoir of labor." In other words, the colonialization of the inland areas by the coastal areas is expected to continue, so the wages of Chinese workers in labor-intensive industries will not increase over the next 10 years. Unfortunately, Japanese corporate managers are not threatened by the fact that wage levels will remain unchanged both in the United States and China. Moreover, there is no risk of their losing their position, unlike in the United States where there was a time when corporate executives were toppled one after another. At the beginning of the year, when I attended New Year's parties organized by major economic organizations in Tokyo and Osaka, I got the impression that Japanese corporate executives were still enjoying a period of peace and tranquillity; their only concern was who will be the next chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]? They quarreled over this question. At a different gathering held to wish one another a happy New Year, corporate executives all joined in chanting against the government: "That's enough with political reform! Hurry with the economic stimulus package!" In this article I am trying to present several problems that affect the basic competitive strength of Japanese industry. These are not the kind of problems that can be settled easily by initiating a new pump-priming program. Let us suppose the national economy recovers due to the effects of an economic stimulus package. If such were the case, U.S. and Chinese products would immediately invade the Japanese market. Japanese manufacturers, who have been deceiving Japanese consumers by imposing expensive products on them, would suffer from a sharp decrease in prices. Therefore, even if the economy picks up, there is no possibility of them doubling their business. The government is at its wit's end. It has already implemented every imaginable macroeconomic measure: emergency public investment worth 30 trillion yen, an all-time low interest rate, and a continuous increase in the money supply. Unfortunately, these measures have not induced people to spend more money. Companies have received no new orders. To stimulate the economy, Japanese business leaders are calling for income tax reductions and fiscal investment. They are merely trying to resort to an old method that worked 10 years ago. This method was correct when Japan's major industries were improving their competitive power. Moreover, at that time the United States had no intention of seriously quarreling with Japan due to the Cold War. This was why the United States did not launch an offensive to induce a sharp appreciation of the yen against the dollar as it is doing now. However, in the United States today there is a theory that when the dollar is quoted at 100 yen, it will have the same effect as dropping another atomic bomb on Japan. Quite a few people seriously think continued appreciation of the yen against the dollar would serve the best interests of Japan in the long run. With respect to the yen-dollar exchange rate, I have already written several times in this magazine that both the United States and Japan are adopting a wrong view of the matter. Trying to correct the trade imbalance by manipulating the exchange rate is a gross error. It is clear the real intention of the United States is to debilitate Japanese companies, and particularly to weaken the competitive strength of Japan's export-intensive industries. Japanese bureaucrats are tolerating the high appreciation of the yen against the dollar, saying it will help rectify the trade imbalance, because they cannot grasp the main point. What they have been doing in concert with the business world is nothing less than wrecking Japan's export industry, the only means for Japan to accumulate wealth. In the United States, a certain Dr. Jack Kevorkian recently invented a suicide machine. It is as if the Japanese Government had prepared a similar device on its own initiative, and is now experimenting on Japanese industry with it. No Japanese industry can survive in a world where the dollar is quoted at 100 yen. However, even if the dollar returns to the 130 yen level, the problem will not be settled. Rather, the competitive power of the United States would become more conspicuous. It is no exaggeration to say the United States has regained its competitiveness to that extent. The United States Is the Sole Winner of the Intelligence War The other problem is that the large guns of the battleship--namely automobiles and household electric appliances--no longer serve as key weapons in the current war. In the long run, the production of such products will be completely transferred to low wage-labor areas such as Asia and Mexico. The 21st century will see the outbreak of an intelligence war. In this war, white-collar workers in tertiary industries will be the main soldiers. From now on, the wealth of a nation will be built by these people. Lucrative fields or products with brilliant prospects are multimedia, the information superhighway advocated by Vice President Al Gore, Microsoft's operating system, IBM's operating system, Novell's network integration system, Oracle's network integration system, power PC', and microprocessors developed by Intel Corporation. Unfortunately, in Japan no company is capable of competing with the United States in these fields, nor are there any competitors in Europe. The United States stands unchallenged in these fields. Moreover, although it is an industry worth tens of trillions of yen, it does not appear on trade statistics because of its specificity: it makes its profit by transmitting information data, even though the protection of intellectual property was included in the Uruguay Round agreements recently signed by the GATT nations, including Japan. The area in which the United States is planning to make money in the 21st century was definitely secured by GATT. Meanwhile, Japan made a huge mistake by considering the agricultural issue as the most important area of the multilateral trade negotiations. Japan cannot rid itself of the mental attitudes of the 19th century. What Japan did regarding the Uruguay Round is beyond criticism. Why is it impossible for Japan to beat the United States in this area? It is because the Ministry of Education still maintains the same education system it had a few decades ago. Japanese children are still educated and trained to become the type of "corporate warrior" that has existed for many years. The Japanese education system is aimed at training people so they can mass-produce products under strict quality control. This is why Japanese children are forced to memorize what their teachers say and act accordingly to what they have stored in their memories. This educational method was once successful. However, people educated in this manner are not suited to be warriors in the intelligence war. The United States has produced many successful businessmen such as Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation, Mitch Kapor and Jim Manzi of Lotus Development Corporation, and Steven P. Jobs of Next Computer Corporation (the founder of Apple Computer Inc.). If these people were born in Japan, they would have constantly flunked the Japanese education system. Even a man like Ross Perot falls into this category. Such network integrators as Electronic Data System Corporation (EDS) and Perot System Corporation were founded by him. We will soon live in an age when only people like these will be able to amass vast fortunes. Unfortunately, such people do not exist in Japan or Europe. There are many other areas in which the United States can make money in the 21st century. For instance, there is the credit card. American Express, Visa, and Mastercard are all American. The fields of hospital management, rental-car services, cable TV networks, and hotel-chain management are mostly dominated by Americans. For instance, such U.S. companies as Tele-Communications Inc. and Viacom Inc. have the edge in the field of cable TV. With plenty of money on hand, Japan and Germany have bought several U.S. companies in these fields. Nevertheless, the United States continues to take full control of its knowledge. Concerning the application of artificial intelligence on Wall Street, many expert analysts, the so-called "rocket scientists," have participated in the development project. The long and short of it is that the United States stands unchallenged in these fields of the 21st century, fields that require creativity and originality. In One Sense, Japan Is Quite a Museum Piece Both the U.S. and Japanese Governments resort to trade statistics when they hold negotiations on reducing Japan's trade surplus. The problem is that statistical figures only indicate the past. As a management consultant, I am thinking about the future competitive power of Japan and the United States. In my view, the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States no longer exists. It is now Japan's turn to supplicate the U.S. Government for help, saying, "Please do us a favor, because U.S. companies are now too powerful." Based on the realities of five years ago, both governments are still negotiating on how to reduce the $100 billion trade surplus. The day trade negotiations are concluded, Japan will probably have to immediately open another round of negotiations to ask the United States for assistance. Japan will beg on its knees, saying, "We are now powerless against U.S. companies, so please give us odds." Twenty years ago, Japan negotiated with the United States over the textile trade; no more than a year after the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. textile agreement, the U.S. textile industry lost its ability to export to Japan, being threatened by Taiwanese as well as Korean imports. After all, that is how governmental negotiations are, and we cannot expect more from them. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton should bear these facts in mind when they meet in Washington on 11 February. However, when I checked the contents of the economic framework talks now under way at the working level, I realized both governments are totally ignorant of the new tendency of the times. I would like to make a proposition to the Japanese Government. "Please face up to the reality that the United States already stands unchallenged. It is not too late, so take stock of the situation immediately." If we make a thorough investigation, we will immediately notice that one-half of the $100 billion trade surplus was yielded by no more than 20 companies, and more precisely by only two industries--the auto and electronics industries (machine tools were once a major export item, but not anymore). Thus, when these 20 companies are ruined, it will be the end of Japan. As a matter of fact, all these companies are done for now. Moreover, what is worse is only 13 percent of the Japanese working population, which totals 67 million people, is employed by these two industries and their allied industries. The remaining 87 percent are employed by other secondary industries such as woodworking, food processing, nonferrous metal manufacturing, and construction; by primary industries such as farming and fishing; and by tertiary industries such as merchandising, including wholesale and retail businesses. Let us now look into these low-productivity industries that employ 87 percent of the working population. We can see their competitive power is almost nothing, or at best it is less than half of that of the united States. For instance, in the case of the food processing industry, its competitive strength is one-third of the U.S. industry's. As regards the retail business, it is no more than one-quarter. I am really impressed that Japan has survived until now despite 87 percent of its working population being "inefficient." Japan has survived because the "efficient" population who represent no more than 13 percent of the working total have shouldered a heavier tax burden and have tolerated increased costs of living in the form of invisible taxes in order to recover the loss caused by these "inefficient" people. The low-productivity industries, which employ 87 percent of the working population, used to exert strong pressure on the government. They merely had to present petitions to receive huge subsidies. Therefore, they had no need to improve their productivity. For 20 years, starting with the Kakuei Tanaka cabinet, the government has adopted a policy based on the principle of distributing wealth rather than creating wealth. "Inefficient" people employed by low-productivity industries were suddenly fear-stricken with losing their employment. Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round they realized they were suddenly exposed to international competition. Imagine nine people hanging off a single-seat airplane. Despite this, the flight proceeded smoothly until now. However, one day the pilot was suddenly struck with fear and lost control of his plane. The result was no one escaped from the crash. This is exactly what happened to those working in the low-productivity industries. There is no doubt the central bureaucracy is the main cause of this catastrophic situation. By taking advantage of their departmentalism, every administrative agency has been maintaining close contacts with a specific industry. "Inefficient" people have been protected thanks to the so-called "iron triangle"--the cozy relationship between politicians, bureaucrats, and business leaders which is seen as the breeder of graft. In the past, silk-raising farmers, food-processing companies specializing in konnyaku [paste made from starch of the devil's tongue], and many other businesses have been protected. For each category of business, it is possible to cite the name of a politician acting as its protector. The government has long cherished these old-fashioned industries of the 19th century, so they remain unchanged. In this sense, Japan is a museum piece. There is no other modern nation like it. Even in France, industries other than agriculture have been eliminated. This is because European industries went through such an ordeal on the occasion of the creation of a single European market. To tell the truth, the high appreciation of the yen against the dollar and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round are respectively like the two atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, many have still not awakened to the situation. They have the same mentality as those who urged a decisive battle on the Japanese homeland at the end of World War II. Once again, Japan has been hit by two atomic bombs. Sooner or later Japan will face a serious employment crisis. The unemployment rate recently reached 2.7 percent, and people are making a fuss about it. However, the actual condition is much more serious. I spoke about the advent of massive unemployment a few years ago while appearing on "Point of View/Point at Issue," a TV program televised by NHK. During the program, I used a chart to explain that an unemployment ratio of nearly 14 percent, which had already become a reality in Europe, is within the bounds of possibility in Japan. I added that unemployment would increase as follows: an increase of 1 percent caused by the lifting of the rice ban; another increase of 3 percent caused by the promotion of market liberalization; another increase of 6 percent caused by liberalization of the distribution system; and another increase of 1 percent caused by the restructuring of medium enterprises and large businesses. Meanwhile, the government continues to provide "employment adjustment subsidies" to hard-hit companies so they can continue to employ excess workers. In other words, the government continues to spend precious money collected from taxpayers in order to preserve uncompetitive companies. Such subsidies are like narcotics. The government has already spent 100 billion yen in a short period of time. If it does not change its policy, the final expense will total trillions of yen. "The Aoyama Trading Phenomenon" Consumers have been cheated under a system based on the so-called "iron triangle." The only lucky circumstance is the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" which presented itself over the past few years. The "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" is a revolt by companies in the service industry in collusion with consumers. Aoyama Trading Company and Aoki International Company are two famous chain-store operators specializing in men's clothing. They are typical discount retailers. In the United States, such companies are called category-killers. What kind of strategy does a category-killer have? It specializes in a very specific item. This item belongs to a category of consumer's durable goods which are purchased infrequently. For instance, with a price ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 yen or more, ready-made men's suits are a category-killer item. Once the item is fixed, the category-killer tries to force out retailers that deal in similar items. Some of the major Japanese category-killers are: Victoria, well-known for selling ski equipment at low prices; Yodobashi Camera, well-known for selling camera equipment at low prices; and Kawachiya, known for selling cosmetics and liquor at low prices. MK Taxi, which became the first taxi company to reduce fares following the government announcement allowing operators to freely set taxi fares, also falls into this category. In the United States, this strategy has become the central idea of the distribution revolution. A category-killer like Aoyama Trading needs no more than three years to achieve victory over other companies which are still trying to somehow impose expensive products on consumers by resorting to the "iron triangle." Japanese category-killers are gradually boring holes through the existing system. In the near future, the entire distribution industry will follow the example of Aoyama Trading. In the long run, even the housing industry will be affected by the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon." For instance, some companies might begin importing tract homes from Australia to sell at the reasonable price of 100,000 yen per tsubo [3.954 sq yds]. After World War II, there was a period when many great challengers appeared one after another: Konosuke Matsushita (founder of Matsushita Group); Soichiro Honda (founder of Honda Motor Company); Toshio Iue (founder of Sanyo Electric Company); Masaru Ibuka (chief founder of Sony Corporation); and Genichi Kawakami (founder of Yamaha Corporation). Category-killers are similar to them. They made their own opportunities for new businesses because the establishment had become too conservative to devote itself to the defense of its stronghold. Seen from the consumer viewpoint, the spread of the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" should be welcomed. However, in terms of employment it is contestable. In the United States, most of the mom-and-pop toy stores folded following the invasion by Toys `R' Us, a famous toy store chain. This is why many Americans criticized the company as follows: "It is not right to treat Chairman Charles Lazarus of Toys `R' Us like a hero because he created employment destabilization." There is some truth in that. However, when we consider the problem, we come to the conclusion that category-killers would not have appeared on the scene if those who had been engaged in tedious business had restructured or rationalized. In any case, even if the industrial world does not change its stance to create a more consumer-oriented economy, or even if it continues to put pressure on the government for the implementation of economic stimulus measures as well as measures to protect domestic industries, the restructuring of old-fashioned sectors cannot be avoided. Moreover, companies unable to restructure themselves will not survive in the future. Restructuring is the only way left for Japan. The Deregulation of Controls on 94 Items Is a Childish Trick The only problem is whether the current government has the courage to carry out a fundamental restructuring of Japan. Prime Minister Hosokawa recently announced the deregulation of controls on 94 items. However, when we look at the deregulation carried out by Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, Hosokawa's plan seems quite out of the question. In a country like Japan where 10,900 items are already subject to government control, and where 500 new items are added to the control list every year, there is little point in easing controls on 94 items. Moreover, when we look at the deregulation list presented by the government, we realize all these deregulatory measures are harmless and inoffensive. Hosokawa's plan is quite puerile; this is not deregulation at all. True deregulation has a strong negative effect. Both U.S. and British economies which suffered from deregulation in the 1980's are now recovering; it is the turn of other countries to feel the pain. Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Switzerland, which were blessed by high economic growth in the 1980's and which have steered clear of deregulation, will suffer from here on. Deregulation means a change in the existing rules of competition. As a result, the actual winner will become the loser, while the actual loser and newcomer will become the winner. It is certain the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" will spread across the nation, though the government is pretending not to notice. It is no longer possible to stop the movement because Japanese consumers have been cheated and overcharged for too long. According to OECD and the World Bank, the purchasing power parity of the dollar to the yen is 1:190. When we take this figure into consideration, we can see how high commodity prices are in Japan. Purchasing power parity represents the mean value of the cost of living. It means Japanese consumers are cheated of 80 yen by the government since the dollar is now quoted at around 110 yen. So what we need is a politician who can make desperate efforts to reduce the disparity as much as possible. We need a government capable of increasing the dollar from the 110 yen to the 140 yen level, while simultaneously making purchasing power parity fall from the 190 yen to the 140 yen level. Once these two goals are achieved, the Japanese market society will become open and lucid. It will also be possible for Japan to play fair without facing hesitation from the international community within the framework of the Uruguay Round. As I said previously, the spread of the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" will create unemployment. Meanwhile, the reduction of differences between the exchange rate and purchasing power parity will probably cause employment destabilization as well. It might even lead to a dreadful consequence: an unemployment rate of 10 percent. However, if things work out that way, it will be possible to build homes at a reasonable price, and land prices will also decrease. This will create new demands for various products. For instance, if you buy a new home located 45 minutes from your office by train, and if the home is two or three times as spacious as the apartment you currently have, and if the price is only five times as much as your annual income, you will inevitably need more utensils because you will have a bigger kitchen. You will also spend more money on furniture, and will probably need two cars. As a matter of course, some industrial sectors will be eliminated during this process. If unemployment does not increase to a certain degree, industrial structural reform cannot be achieved. Conversely, when the economy is in a virtual state of full employment, the transfer of people from inefficient to highly competitive sectors is not possible because people prefer to stay in the same company instead of moving around. In this sense, it may safely be said that the modernization of the Japanese economy has been impeded by the Japanese policy of securing full employment. The government's duty is not to enable hard-hit companies to preserve excess workers by providing subsidies. Nor is it to spend taxes collected from workers in competitive industries for the sake of inefficient industries. Instead, the government should provide vocational training so unemployed workers can acquire new skills and have an opportunity to move to newly created competitive industries. What the government must do is not adopt a new economic stimulus package or implement claptrap measures, namely the reduction of income taxes. In Japan, personal financial assets total 600 trillion yen. This is twice as much as the GNP. What the government must do is mobilize these huge financial resources. This will certainly stimulate the economy. Although our financial assets total 600 trillion yen, unlike in other countries we cannot buy what we wish in Japan because of the high prices. Articles sold at low price are generally items we do not want. As we generally live in small houses, our closets are already filled to the breaking point with various things. Once the huge financial resources are mobilized, the economy will recover without fail. We should create a situation under which people will be able to buy what they want at a price seen as reasonable from an international viewpoint. In other words, a recovery of the market mechanism will be sufficient to help revive the economy, a market so devised that sellers can always deal with buyers. I Beg Off Fighting a Decisive Battle With the United States on the Japanese Homeland The government pays lip service to implementing a package of measures designed to pull the economy out of its recession. In fact, the government is bent on halting the decrease in land prices and maintaining share prices at the current level in order to relieve the industrial world. During World War II, the Imperial Headquarters used this same tactic. By the irony of fate, the government's trick has helped weaken the people's will to buy; in other words, it has aggravated the recession. The purchase of stocks, land, and other immovables will spontaneously become brisk once prices decrease to a reasonable level and once there is an abundant supply. In the 1980's, the government used to set forth the shortage of labor, or the shortage of land, as a premise. It should no longer do this; instead it should face up to the reality--that is, the existence of surplus labor and surplus land. It should revise the taxation system, which is strangely punitive, and abolish the complicated procedures needed for approbation and licensing. The government has as its primary object the improvement of social infrastructure in consumer-oriented areas. Therefore, it should channel more public funds into investment aimed at achieving this object once the mobilization of private funds is realized. If there is a sharp decline in land prices, the construction costs of public facilities will be reduced as well. This will considerably lighten the taxpayers' burden. In general, people become frugal when they have a smaller income. In the case of the Japanese Government, the strange thing is that, although a revenue shortfall of 10 trillion yen is predicted for this fiscal year, no one proposes curtailing spending by 10 trillion yen. The bureaucracy has no intention to reduce it, while the business world is crying loudly for income tax reductions and a further issuance of government bonds to finance construction projects. The government thinks it should meet these two requests in some form. This is the weakness of a coalition government. Every year each ministry struggles to secure a larger piece of the budgetary pie. The ruling coalition, which is a scratch team of seven parties and one parliamentary group, has no authority over the bureaucracy, so the government cannot but accept a bureaucracy-driven draft budget. Here again there is no one who can see the situation in perspective and decide to undertake a drastic retrenchment in the budget. As long as the Japanese have 600 trillion yen in personal financial assets, and as long as they desire a better standard of living, hope is not yet dead that Japan will succeed. The desire for a better standard of living and a more comfortable life leads to the creation of new products. On the contrary, the more the government tries to carry out its New Deal--the economic stimulus package--by arbitrarily taking money out of taxpayers' purse, the more the situation will worsen. In the 1980's, Japan used to be qualified as follows: "Economic strength of the first order; administrative ability and diplomatic skill of the second order; political technique of the third order." Now it seems Japan has become a third-rate country in all aspects. The degeneration was mainly caused by third-rate politicians who are too intent on political reform to think of anything else. I do not want Japan to take the same course the Imperial Headquarters followed at the end of World War II. The Imperial Headquarters tried to fight a decisive battle on the Japanese homeland without seeing the situation in perspective, without devising any strategy, and without facing up to the reality that Japan's defeat was already evident. I do not want the current government to do the same--that is, to try to implement a series of pump-priming measures that will only help maintain the cozy relationship between politicians, bureaucrats, and business leaders.
