Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, in remarks quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, added that if Serb observers were not present, "the airport could be used as a channel for arms deliveries to Moslems." He welcomed Russia's proposal to send observers to the airport but added that "the presence of Serb observers" was "vital." It appeared unlikely the Moslems would agree to such conditions, observers said. It also seemed surprising that the rump Yugoslavia's army should announce the Bosnian Serbs' conditions on reopening the airport. Although Serbia openly backs Bosnia's Serbs, it does not officially have authority over them. Until now, Bosnian Serbs have steadfastly refused to yield on the airport issue. Their leader Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday [1 February] it was up to the Bosnian Serb "parliament" to decide what to do on the issue. While Tuzla itself is controlled by Moslems, the airport zone is within firing distance of Serb forces, whose positions are a few kilometers (miles) from the town. The United Nations is considering authorising air strikes against besieging Serb forces to obtain the reopening of Tuzla, which is considered an essential channel for humanitarian aid.
