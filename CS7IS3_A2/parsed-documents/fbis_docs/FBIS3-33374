Santillo said he is not planning to leave the government because he is not against approval of the Social Emergency Fund, FSE. He asserted that he did his best to convince congressmen to increase health allocations in 1994, but did not speak against the FSE. He added that as soon as the FSE is approved, he will again talk to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and President Itamar Franco and try to obtain more budget resources: first, for the hospital assistance program and then for other Health Ministry programs. Santillo refuted rumors that he was planning to leave his position, and added that he will remain at the head of the Health Ministry until the end of his mandate. [passage omitted] Education Minister Murilio Hingel said he does not oppose the FSE, and he does not plan to leave his position because he believes in the plan proposed by the government.
