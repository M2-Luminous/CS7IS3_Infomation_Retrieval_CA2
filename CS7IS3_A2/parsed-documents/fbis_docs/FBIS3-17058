He said the situation was being dramatized to divert public attention. Rutskoy spoke of the Soviet Communist Party being used as bogey three years ago and the Soviets in the second half of 1992. Searches are now under way for someone to take the blame after the bombing of the previous parliament, he said adding that no one had ever plotted a coup because one had already been pulled off. Rutskoy, who shaved off a beard he had grown while in prison on charges of organizing last October's rioting in Moscow, was speaking to reporters while attending an agricultural fair in Moscow. Although he described the current situation as unpredictable, Rutskoy said he did not want any repeat of what happened last October. "I had enough time for a rethink and to come to some conclusions", he said. Rutskoy believes the situation can still be redressed if the control of reforms is regained, priorities and incentives are set and laws strictly observed. "That must be the basis of today's policies", he said. Although he agreed that "any solution to vital problems depends on internal stability", Rutskoy said it was important to know who exactly would be party to a proposed civil peace pact. "Should there be any compromise with those who plundered and ruined the country and bombed the parliament? If so, what sort of compromise and for which purpose?", he asked. Asked which of the three he considered himself to be - president vice president or former vice president, Rutskoy said he had always believed himself to be citizen first. "If the coup was lawful, then I am former vice president. If it was unlawful which it was because of being unconstitutional, then I am vice president", he said. Rutskoy described Acting Prosecutor General Alexey Ilyushenko as "a swindler who forged documents and filed a false report" about his involvement in financial irregularities. He said Ilyushenko must be put behind bars. On his own political future, Rutskoy said it was early days yet to speak about it. Asked if he would run for presidency, he said "let us wait until presidential elections if there are any". And he added "after all, there must be someone to nominate my candidacy".
