It was during his last speech for 'Id al- Fitr, the feast which marks the end of Ramadan, that people really noticed it. "I have never seen him like this before", said a high ranking adviser of his, who recently defected to "liberated" Kurdistan and the Iraqi National Congress, the opposition alliance which has established itself there. Saddam spoke, and looked, like a man near the end of his tether. The coarse features were bloated and haggard, his speech slurred and his gestures, always uncouth, now weary and slovenly too. His only topic was the UN sanctions, and the certainty that they would be renewed. Five times he slapped his thigh in unbecoming exasperation at the prospect. His ministers, as usual, sat reverently through this grim performance; but Iraqis watching it on television found it deeply revealing, and no one more than his former adviser. "I do believe", he said, "that before long he will do something crazy." It is almost axiomatic among Iraqis that Saddam, the inveterate gambler, will eventually do something truly crazy; they cite his invasions of Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1991 as precedents for the climactic gamble to come, the one he will embark on when he feels that his end is nigh. That feeling could come upon him any time. It has already come upon many Iraqis. For them, the fate which has befallen one of his hench men, Kamal Husayn al-Majid, is a metaphor for the whole system, for the retribution surely closing in on it. Kamal was the architect of Saddam's unconventional weapons programme. He is also a monstrous blasphemer. During the great Shiite Uprising of 1991, he led the army's assault on the holy city of Karbala. Addressing the shrine of Husayn, he said: "your name is Husayn, and so is mine. Let us see who is stronger now." He commanded his troops to open fire on this most sacred of Shiite sites. He visited Karbala again this month -- but in an ambulance and to beg the saint's forgiveness. He has a tumour on the brain. The feeling that Saddam's whole system is doomed is rooted in more than signs or superstition. No one -- thanks to its awesome apparatus of repression -- has been able to destroy it from without, but, like its former minister of military industry, it is sickening, rotting, dying from within. Indeed, if Saddam himself has yet to commit the final act of madness his people expect of him, a Kafkaesque insanity already fatally infects his system, which simply cannot cope with the sheer, accumulating weight of problems that beset it; it is going haywire under the strain. At last the UN sanctions are biting. Nothing Saddam can do will stop the rot. This really set in last summer. Its chief yardstick is the value of the Iraqi dinar which in turn is the chief yardstick of Saddam's plummeting prestige. Officially, one dinar is still worth $3. But so weird are the workings of Saddam's economy that the only place where real banknotes remain in circulation is the place where his writ no longer runs, here in "liberated" Kurdistan. Last summer $1 fetched 20 dinars here; now it is 80 dinars. But in Saddam-controlled territory itself the rate is 350 "Saddam dinars" to the dollar, and falling fast. He repeatedly slips into the despot's delusion that terror can control market forces. In 1992, long before the rot set in, he had already executed 42 merchants as a warning to others. It only made matters worse. The dead men even enjoyed a sort of posthumous rehabilitation; they were called "martyrs of an angry hour". Saddam's son Udayy, kingpin of the ruling family's immense business interests, tried other tactics. In January he put on what was supposed to be a confidence-raising show. He emptied all the coffers of one of his companies in front of its employees; they counted $50 million. It failed to impress the market. Two days later, the secret police tried their way; they shot two dealers and wounded 29. Then, with Saddam's latest speech, the dinar took its latest, greatest tumble. An order has gone out to the banks: nobody can with draw more than 2,500 dinars -- $7 -- at a time. The situation is virtually out of control. Even Udayy's newspaper, Babel -- for he is an editor too -- admits it; within a few days, it said this week, the dinar would be down to 500 to the dollar. Those who suffer most from the dinar's collapse are the great majority who do not in some way benefit from the system. They are kept from starvation by the basic rations on which Saddam manages to spend some $750 million a year -- most of the rest of his meagre export earnings, perhaps $1,250 million, going on illegally imported, hiqh-quality weaponry. The middle classes are being wiped out; garbage collectors are now deemed to fulfil a more important basic function than teachers, and are paid more. Some get by on dollars from relatives abroad. But others sell off furniture, carpets, fridges, even doors and window frames. Impoverishment fuels a moral and social breakdown directly attributable to Saddam's misrule. Ten, 20 people now die every day in robberies with violence in what used to be a law-abiding society. Typically, the criminals come from the ranks of young men who were drafted into the army first to fight a murderous, but wholly pointless, eight-year war with Iran, then, two years later, the even more pointless Mother of Battles. They have lost their youth; demobilised without compensation, often without education or training, without jobs or the prospect of them, inured to the cruelty and harsh, survivalist lessons of war, they turn to violence of another kind. The law encourages them: in a bid to stem the contagion, Saddam has decreed that theft is a capital offence, so thieves kill, the better to ensure they are not caught. The people openly grumble and curse him as they never did before. But more worrying for Saddam is the fact that the sanctions are now having a political and bureaucratic, not just an economic and social, impact. An extraordinary proportion of the population -- in the army, the police, the mukhabaraat (intelligence services), the Ba'th party -- are employed in the apparatus of control and repression. They are so numerous that the regime can no longer afford to raise them through better pay and perks, above the mass of the people. So for most, economic gain now takes clear precedence over political loyalty. This is a cancer in the body politic, whose atrophied limbs are less and less responsive to commands from the centre. It is a great help to the opposition. "A year ago", said a visitor from Saddam territory "it could be dangerous to cross the lines. But now even wanted men, whose pictures have appeared in the newspapers, do not hesitate. With a few thousand Saddam dinars you can buy anyone. It is guaranteed." That is hardly surprising when one considers that the general who used to earn $10,000 a year is now on a hundred, and the wretched conscript on less than 10. A loaf of bread, never mind money, will buy him; his thrice-daily crust looks -- and tastes -- like sawdust. Within this vast apparatus, Saddam has alway relied on three concentric circles of regional and sectarian solidarity: the country's traditionally dominant Sunni Muslim minority as a whole, people from his hometown of Takrit, and, at the top, the members of his own immediate family. But disaffection is manifest in all three spheres. Of the four Sunni provinces of central Iraq -- Mosul, Takrit, Baghdad (now overwhelmingly Shiite) and Ramadi -- the last is pivotal. Extending from near Baghdad to the Syrian and Jordanian border, it has always been a stronghold of the type of pan-Arabist doctrines that spawned Baath, a principal provider of officers and bureaucrats. In the 1991 Uprising, Saddam, already dubious of its loyalty, made sure of it. "The mukhabaraat", said a Ramadi defector from that fearsome organisation, "themselves murdered Ramadis and brought their bodies to Ramadi city. The people were told that the Shiite rebels had killed them simply because they were Ramadis. They believed it. But now they know the truth." Two weeks ago there was a football match between the local team and al-Zawraq from Baghdad, patronised by Arshad Yasin, a Saddam bodyguard and big businessman. After Ramadi scored two goals in the first half, Yassin ordered a change of referees. Al-Zawraq scored three goals in the second. The crowd protested. Yassin's men opened fire on it. Some were shot in the feet and legs. The riot spread to the town; they cursed Saddam. The fact is that Saddam has incurred the secret enmity of virtually every clan and tribe in the central Sunni "triangle". One by one his his purges have afflicted them all, even those of Takrit itself. In the old days he used to treat the Takritis, mindful of his dependence on them, with greater restraint than the rest. No more. After the latest attempted coup, real or imagined, he executed 11 Takriti officers, as well as the son of the most revered figure in the town's modern history. One can imagine, when such things happen, what conflicts of emotions torment such high Takriti commanders as remain, particularly the one whose cousin, Omar Haza'a, the former mayor of Baghdad, had his tongue cut out for insulting Saddam's mother before being hacked to death with an axe. Then there is the ruling family itself. In the end it may well be here, in the obscure, incestuous, microscopic universe of the Saddam ruling house, rather than in the more easily observable macrocosm of social, political and economic forces at work in the country at large, that Iraq's destiny will be decided. They must all hate him as much as they fear him, and the only thing that stays their hand is the knowledge that if he goes, they go with him. Saddam has traditionally held himself aloof from family conflicts, playing one party against another. Yet there are indications that he now deeply distrusts the most infamous of the Majids, defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid -- Chemical Ali to the Kurds -- and possibly even suspects that he was behind a recent assassination attempt. It looks as though the versatile young Udayy is now being groomed for the defence ministry in his place. Saddam still clings to the hope that the sanctions will be lifted. At first he thought that might come about through the Clinton administration, which, initially at least, seemed less hostile than George Bush. He now seems to have despaired of Clinton -- but found new encouragement in signs of Russian, Chinese and French eagerness to do business with a rehabilitated Iraq. He has been unusually quiescent for 15 months, but, unless his slender hopes take more substantial form. he cannot remain quiescent for ever. "He is not", said his former adviser, "the man to wait until the knife is on his very neck." Confronted with a growing peril, he believes in the pre-emptive strike, especially one that he can turn to strategic advantage; that was the impulse, heavily rooted in his paranoid view of the world, that drove him to invade both Iran and Kuwait. He thinks the western "conspiracy" is still going on, that he is still fighting the Mother of Battles in other forms. But this slow and wearisome "war of attrition" is one in which his whole position, his grip on his apparatus, is steadily eroding. On paper he may have rebuilt much of his army to as much as 80 per cent of its pre-Kuwait capability. But there must already be a serious risk that if he orders it to attack, its commanders -- known to be appalled at the prospect of yet another great debacle -- simply will not obey, or, if they do, that the demoralised troops will simply refuse to fight. So the impulse to act sooner rather than later, and with maximum surprise, must be growing very strong. The question on everyone's mind is not whether but when Saddam, sensing the end, will "do something crazy". He is certainly in his terminal phase, but how long that will actually last depends mainly on one key factor. Will the West -- which so blatantly, and, it is now clear, so disastrously betrayed the great Uprising -- make amends by helping the Iraqi opposition, in a truly serious way, to bring the despot down? Will it do more than merely preserve the sanctions, which, however effective in the long run, cause the Iraqi people increasingly unjustifiable suffering in the meantime? If, for example, the West declared al-Basrah a "safe haven" like the Kurdish north, the end would not only come more quickly but there would be less danger of this most strategic of Middle Eastern countries being plunged into the chaos and civil war which regional and international powers so greatly fear -- but which their current inertia and indifference is making more likely. The question is also how. Saddam has two basic choices. The people of "liberated" Kurdistan fear they will be the primary target of the despot at bay. Both official rhetoric and new troop concentrations point strongly in that direction. In January Saddam all but announced he would be spending the 'Id al-Fitr in Kurdistan. Then, in addition to the three army corps permanently stationed on the front line, three divisions of the elite Republican Guards reinforced two others in the sensitive Kirkuk and Mosul areas. But despite this -- and other signs, like the arming of ostensibly loyalist Arab and Kurdish tribes, of preparation for battle -- nothing happened perhaps developments at the Security Council persuaded Saddam to call it off. Yet the intent remains clear. Any attack on Kurdistan could take various forms -- terror bombardments the occupation of Suleimaniyah Province, the Kurds' only access, through Turkey or Syria, to the outside world -- but a purpose common to them all would be to tell the West committed to the Kurds' protection "Look, I am still here, I can still make plenty of trouble for you, and unless you accommodate me, I shall." Saddam has also moved Republican Guards to the south. Why, no one quite knows. But it is certaunly southwards that his other option lies. "When the knife gets close" said the former adviser, "that is where he will strike. Occupying a piece of Kurdistan risks western reprisals, but offers no great strategic prize in return. Kuwait does offer it. The Gulf, with its oilfields and shipping, is where he has always felt his opportunities lie. He now hates the Saudis, champions of the continued sanctions. Vengeance is part of his Bedouin psychology. I think that, next time, he will do what he didn't do last time, both take Kuwait and send his tanks down to the Saudi oilfields." That would surely be his end. For with western and Saudi aircraft in Dhahran, the tanks would never make it across the open desert. It would mean that the logic of Samson had finally taken possession of him. For he has never made much secret of it: if and when he goes down, he will take the world with him, or as much of it as he can.
