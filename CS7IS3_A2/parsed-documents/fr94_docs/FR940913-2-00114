ACTION: Notice for proposed decision. SUMMARY: On February 11, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final labeling regulations implementing section 611 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The regulations include a section which permits a manufacturer to petition EPA to temporarily exempt a product manufactured with a class I substance from the labeling requirements. The company must prove that there are no substitutes that: do not rely on the use of a class I substance; reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment; and, are currently or potentially available. Through this action, EPA proposes to grant petitions for such exemptions for the two specific applications of products manufactured with class I substances described below, because substitutes that do not rely on the use of class I substances and reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment are neither potentially nor currently available. The effect of this action will be to provide the extensions necessary for these two petitioners to develop potentially available substitutes.
