According to Mora y Araujo Noguera y Asociados, this figure is based on voter surveys conducted since August 1993. Some 1,200 people were surveyed in each poll with a margin of error of 3 percent. The latest poll shows 52 percent of those polled expect to vote for Calderon Sol and 22 percent for Zamora. Over the past three weeks, support for the government of President Alfredo Cristiani, which has a positive support rating of 68 percent, has risen. In the first round of the elections held on 20 March, Calderon received 49 percent of the vote, while Zamora garnered 25 percent. Zamora lost a great deal of support from December to January and has not been able to regain it, the report added. It also estimated voter participation will drop 10 percent compared to the first round in which 68 percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls, and another 6 percent were unable to vote, even though they tried to.
