It is being increasingly blamed for the ongoing rise in unemployment not only within the framework of the debate on the country as a center for industry but in a manner that extends well beyond that. Excessive wage increases are said to have led to a situation in which there is an insufficient demand for labor on the part of companies and in which there is a threat of another sharp rise in unemployment. However, this approach does not concentrate on the relevant subject matter to an adequate degree. It is another instance of narrow-minded economic thinking, which sees the labor market compared with markets for goods. By contrast, monetary policy is to a large extent excluded from discussion. Wage Policy It is obvious that both sides have made mistakes with respect to wage policy. In its January 1992 report, the DIW [German Institute for Economic Research] wrote that wage policy should not take things too far in the conflict with monetary policy; otherwise, a recession and unemployment would be inevitable. Last year's wage increases already indicated that corrections were under way, corrections that would permit a high degree of price stability and competitiveness in the medium term. This year, the first wage agreements and union demands in key sectors indicate that the wage increases will be closer to 2 percent rather than 3 percent. In public debate on the subject, wage cuts are being frequently called for with a view to making Germany more competitive and providing openings for the unemployed. However, anyone who calls for wage cuts today must take into consideration the fact that overall economic development in the 1980's was marked by extremely moderate wage growth. Nominal wage increases hardly exceeded the progress that was made in the production field. That was also in no small part due to moderate wage hikes under collective agreements and reductions in working hours. This behavior on the part of the parties to collective agreements led to a high degree of price stability on the one hand and to very substantial increases in profits on the other hand. Accordingly, there was a boom in investment as a result of the low cost of capital and low money market interest rates. The poor level of investment, which was complained about at the beginning of the 1980's, became entirely a thing of the past. Until 1991, western Germany recorded a constant rise in the level of investment, one that was also high in international terms. There is no doubt that such a development would have been impossible if if German labor costs had been "too high" internationally. The opposite is true. Until 1991, the rate at which west German unit labor costs were rising, in German marks, was always below the average rate of increase among Germany's trading partners. It was not until 1992, when the German labor market situation at the beginning of the year was still influenced by the preceding boom and the rest of the world had already been experiencing the effects of a recession on labor markets for a long time, that German unit labor costs began to grow more rapidly in comparison to those among its trading partners for the first time since 1970. The fact that at the end of the boom, and at a time when the labor market situation was good, unit labor costs grew more rapidly than before and markedly more sharply than prices in industry is simply the product of a "normal" economic reaction on the part of unions and employers to a preceding period of significant increases in profits. One may take exception to that. However, it is not a convincing basis for expressing concern about a fundamental change in power structure on the labor market or constant mistakes on the part of trade unions. Thus, labor in Germany has not become "too expensive," neither in international terms -- if one excludes exchange rate fluctuations -- nor in relation to domestic productivity and price trends. There is also no proof to support the assertion that labor has become too expensive in relation to capital. Labor can only become too expensive in relation to capital if not only nominal but also real wages grow "too much," so that in the manufacturing process, the production of a certain quantity of goods involves "too little" labor and "too much" capital. The rate at which real wages increase is not determined by the parties to collective wage agreements, however, but by the market or markets, where the prices of all goods are determined. In addition, the overall rate of economic development would be an obstacle to a strategy of reducing real wages. One cannot draw a straightforward comparison between the labor market and the market for consumer goods. For example, if there is an oversupply in the automobile market, a reduction in prices can rapidly lead to an increase in demand: That does not, mean, however, that the volume of automakers sales and the demand that they generate will rise. The situation in the labor market is different. Even if prices remain constant in the wake of a reduction in nominal wages, which would entail a reduction in real wages, an increase in company demand for labor in the short term cannot be expected. Even if companies consider the reduction in real wages to be lasting, their first reaction will only be to gradually start to reorganize the production process with a view to making it more labor intensive. However, what would have an immediate impact is a drop in demand, which would probably entail a further increase in unemployment. That would in turn lead to another reduction in real wages. Even if a strategy for reducing wages were considered possible and economically safe, it would pose problems for a country such as the Federal Republic. A reduction in real wages and the change in the ratio of labor to capital that this entails, one tending toward greater labor intensiveness, also means a decline or at least a lower rate of growth in productivity. It is also questionable whether Germany would then still be able to manufacture the products that are manufactured by the leading group of technologically advanced countries. Wage cuts -- irrespective of how they are justified in each individual case -- constitute a defensive strategy that does not promise success. However, a modern wage policy -- as the institutes jointly recommended in the fall of 1993 -- is warranted. As a fundamental adjustment to distribution is not required, wage negotiations over the next two years will be solely about making a adjustment to those increases in 1991 and 1992 that have exceeded the medium-term rate. If wage agreements were of the order of 2 percent, that would be guaranteed for the entire economy. If this course were to be followed, then it would be possible to make the adjustments that are appropriate for each branch of industry without abandoning the principle of overall collective agreements. After two "adjustment years," wage policy can return to a reasonable medium-term rate of about 4 percent. The normal and necessary economic adjustments to distribution that benefit profits will entail increases in productivity, increases that will significantly exceed the medium-term course in the short term. All demands that tend downward regarding such a course, including those that follow one or several rounds of zero wage increases, are economically harmful and also harm company profits. Zero wage increases are also inappropriate in an international context because -- especially in Europe -- they only lead to increased pressure on wage settlements in partner countries. This is also an area in which there is a fundamental inconsistency in the present discussion: A devaluation of the German mark vis-a-vis European currencies is categorically rejected, a freeze on wage increases or reductions in nominal wages, which would have the same effect -- namely a devaluation of the German mark in real terms -- internationally, are being discussed and promoted as possible solution. Reductions in Working Hours In view of the rapid increase in the number of unemployed to an annual average of 4 million this year and the possibility of a high level of unemployment in the medium term, further reductions in working hours are being discussed. Volkswagen has come up with a radical option in this respect. The Volkswagen proposal of a drastic reduction in working hours is only a model for companies that expect a significant reduction in personnel to be necessary in the medium term. Because the loss of income that personnel will experience could be marked, the state can offer some compensation in this regard. What would, for example, be appropriate is a temporary and degressive reduction in unemployment insurance contributions for those concerned. This would also compensate for the lower benefits provided by unemployment insurance under the Volkswagen model. However, in terms of the economy as a whole, such a large step as the reduction in working hours at Volkswagen is barely acceptable. Thus, individual steps aimed at reducing working hours should, as has been the case until now, take place within a framework of higher productivity. This permits settlements to be found that have a neutral impact on costs and maintain the real income levels of those affected by such moves. At the same time, shorter working hours should be accompanied by a further separation of working hours and machine operating hours. Optimal plant operating hours are necessary for a country like the Federal Republic of Germany with its relatively high wage and high capital costs if it is to compete internationally. Internal company agreements on annual working hours can better harmonize company and personal interests than has been the case so far. Thus, overall, a significant contribution can be made to reducing unemployment. Fiscal Policy So far, fiscal policy has prevented more serious harm from occurring to overall economic development. In 1993, the contribution of the state amounted to as much as 1 percent of the GDP. To a large extent, this was the result of stabilizing factors that are built into taxation and transfer systems. This year, the effect of these elements will be much weaker. In addition, there are also the negative effects of discretionary components -- that is, reductions in social welfare provisions, as well as increases in taxes and contributions so that in 1994, the state will have a restrictive influence on the overall economy. There is no doubt that fiscal policy is in a precarious situation. The possibilities for it are more limited than before with regard to offsetting a reduction in private demand and providing a positive stimulus to the economy. The rapid increase in the level of state debt reduces whatever room for maneuvering there is. In 1995, there will be a further increase in the state debt when the state takes over the debts of the Trust Agency. The state will then have debts totaling almost 2.2 trillion German marks [DM], which will require annual interest payments totaling DM150 billion -- almost a fifth of all tax receipts. The difficult state budget situation is primarily due to the fact that costs of German unification were largely financed with loans. However, it is also a reaction to the fact that, for a long time, monetary and fiscal policy have had conflicting effects in the economy. The costs that adjustments entailed and had to be borne by fiscal policy as a result of a restrictive monetary policy and its effects on the economy were significant. If monetary policy now becomes more expansive, it would be disastrous if fiscal policy were then to counteract a more relaxed monetary policy. Used correctly, monetary and fiscal policy are the key automatic stabilizing elements in a free market system. In times of recession, monetary policy becomes more stable through a rapid normalization of the interest rate structure and fiscal policy does so through the acceptance of growing deficits. If one of these stabilizing factors is absent, the other policy area has a greater burden to bear. A strategy from which both these stabilizing elements are absent prolongs a recession. However, this year, monetary policy will only gradually be equal to its responsibility. Thus, 1994 is an exceptionally inappropriate time for attempting to consolidate public budgets. Reductions in expenditure mean reduced demand and lower incomes in the economy as a whole and lower taxes and social insurance contributions. For this reason, the government cannot be sure that its austerity program, which amounts to DM20 billion, will result in a reduction in the deficit of the same order. In the best case, the shortfall that has to be financed will be reduced by DM10 billion. Finally, the state will only regain the ability to act if there is a lasting upturn, because only then will revenues rise and the need for funds to finance unemployment will diminish, and only then can the contributions made to other social insurance systems be reduced. In the discussion on the causes of the recession, it leads to confusion to repeatedly mention dues that are "too high" and "too high" a level of social benefits. These assertions do not tally with the fact that the enormous expansion of employment in the late 1980's and the 1990's took place within such a social framework. It makes just as little sense at a time of declining demand for labor to make the seemingly inflexible range of jobs offered ("excessively high benefits") responsible for unemployment. No one "suddenly" decided to become unemployed in 1992 to take advantage of the high level of unemployment benefits. To redefine the current level of unemployment, which is due to economic factors, as "voluntary" unemployment rules out finding a solution that tackles causes. Of course, in a recession, the social insurance burden on companies is much higher than in an economic upturn. The social welfare system must be maintained in a crisis. It will now become apparent whether the system operates efficiently -- that is, is it in a position to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis on those who have been affected involuntarily and, thus, contribute to stabilizing the entire system. Like wage costs, in a recession, social insurance payments -- and taxes -- cannot be low enough for companies. However, what might appear right for a businessman in a given situation is not necessarily advantageous for the economy as a whole. What economic policy requires at the present time is not a limit on employment market instrument but the expansion of such instruments. This particularly applies to eastern Germany, where the state will bear a responsibility for developments on the labor market for a long time to come. Today -- and this discussion also has a cyclical character -- the social welfare system is seen as being too costly to finance. It should not be forgotten that the current low level of public funds is the product of taxation (redistribution) measures in the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's. The declared aim of the policy was to increase incentives in order to make the economy more competitive internationally. This policy not only failed to prevent the recession but could not succeed because the international race to lower taxation has resulted in all economies having a high level of state debt. When there is an economic upswing, the condition of public finance almost "automatically" improves, just as its condition worsens when there is a downturn. However, it remains an open issue whether the improvement will result in attaining what is considered a normal level. Much depends on the extent to which politicians are prepared to check the content and scope of state tasks and create more efficient administrative structures. It is rightly conjectured that there is considerable potential for economies in public administration. In the short term, however, this potential can barely be used. Monetary Policy Wage policy has performed its role in a reasonable way in that it has responded to the recessionary increases in unemployment with declining nominal wage increases. This also means it has been the most important element in combating inflation in Germany. A provision has been made for ensuring that the shocks that the German economy has experienced in the wake of unification can be dealt with with in the medium term without inflation. The mechanism that has produced this result can be easily understood: As a result of the reduction in the availability of money that is prompted by an economic upturn, monetary policy causes interest rates to rise, which leads to lower investment activity and unemployment, and because unemployment means that fewer wages are being paid out, this in turn leads to a new upturn, which is prompted by a reduction in interest rates above all. Whether the inflation rate rises or falls at the same time has no bearing on whether the operation of the mechanism is successful, because only an increase in prices that leads to higher wages on a constant basis leads to inflation. The restrictive effect of monetary policy will immediately prevent demand-related inflation, as well as a cost-related secondary inflation through the wage adjustment process that has been described. What monetary policy cannot in itself prevent is an increase in the rate at which prices grow as a result of a real decrease in supply -- the effects of the explosion in oil prices provided a textbook illustration of this. Ultimately, such price increases have an important function: They alter relative prices and create an incentive for substitution, for increasing the supply of the scarce commodity and for restricting demand until a higher level of supply is available. However, it is also conceivable that to the extent that one particular price rises, others will fall, so that despite a real shock, the inflation rate will remain stable. The reduced supply of one particular commodity does not automatically lead to a decline in the demand for other goods, because as a rule, a reduction in supply is accompanied by the redistribution of income, which does not have to affect effective demand. As a result, a reduction in demand for other goods must be achieved through monetary policy. However, that can only occur by way of rising interest rates and rising unemployment, as described above. Nevertheless, monetary policy does not have to prevent an increase in price levels that stems from a real shock, because after a certain period of time, the rate at which prices grow returns to its previous level if waged-induced secondary inflation does not occur. This cannot be expected under the conditions that exist in western Germany if unemployment increases. In the case of the FRG, the real shock was unification at the beginning of the 1990's. It entailed an enormous redistribution of state resources that was to a large extent financed through raising indirect taxes. Such measures have a direct impact on prices. The housing shortage in western Germany has also become more acute through migration. In view of the liberalization of the housing market, this has resulted in rapid increase in rents. At its highest point, the increase in rents amounted to over 6 percent (at the end of 1992). Rents and administrative prices have had a big impact on the rate of inflation. They kept the rate at which prices were rising high well into the recession. A monetary policy that is oriented toward the inflation rate is led of course by this effect. That is precisely what happened in Germany. German monetary policy has not followed a medium-term oriented strategy, but starting in the middle of 1992, sought to limit the risk of inflation, which no longer existed, with an approach based on small steps. Once the recession had started, the Bundesbank, following a medium-term course, should have sought to reduce its key interest rates quickly and by substantial amounts to support and accelerate the fall in long-term interest rates stemming from the worldwide recession. The Bundesbank did not do that and the consequences are grave. To express things clearly, the German Bundesbank's policies are forcing industry into a crisis in terms of costs and earnings, because more housing is needed in Germany. This policy means that jobs are being lost, because it is a policy that prolongs and intensifies the crisis. Anyone who complains about a new increase in unemployment must take account of the following: Over the past 20 years, monetary policy has steadily become more restrictive. In the 1950's and 1960's, interest rates never assumed an inverse character. At the beginning of the 1970's it amounted to five quarterly periods for the first time. In the middle of the 1970's, following the highest inflation rate that the FRG had experienced since the beginning of the 1950's, it amounted to four quarterly periods. At the beginning of the 1980's, it was already 11 quarterly periods. Since the beginning of 1991, it has already amounted to 12 quarterly periods. Monetary policy that is geared toward continual expansion must always allow for a slowing down of economic growth. If one wants to stabilize prices, one must be in a position to check investment activity and accept unemployment temporarily in the belief that in the medium term, the inflation rate will come closer to the goal that has been set because wage policy has responded accordingly. That has always been the case in western Germany. Thus, there is no reason for monetary policy to become extraordinarily restrictive. Since the summer of 1992, doubts have always been voiced about a rapid reduction in central bank interest rates. At a time when the German mark was largely under pressure to rise in value and subsequently became an overvalued currency after being an undervalued one, it can be assumed that the argument has little to do with reality: A rapid reduction in German money market interest rates would have led to a devaluation of the German mark and an increase in German capital market interest rates, because it has boosted expectations that inflation will rise and the difference in interest rates between Germany and other countries has grown. As has been pointed out several times in this article, since the summer of 1992, there was no basis for fearing inflation and -- as the rather premature behavior of several central banks showed in the first half of 1993 -- other European countries responded to a reduction in German interest rates with appropriate reductions. However, even if there was a certain devaluation of the German mark in relation to, for example, the U.S. dollar, it would counteract the tendency to overvalue the German mark -- that is, a situation that is as undesirable in the long term as that trend toward undervaluing the German mark that lasted many years. A rapid relaxation of monetary policy has been and is rejected with the argument that this would lead to an expansion of the M3 money supply. This argument is questionable for two reasons: First, over the past one and a half years, the expansion was justified in terms of potential: As has been indicated on many occasions, the Bundesbank set far too low a money supply target for 1992. Second, a rapid reduction in interest rates on short-term deposits -- despite a significant increase in the M1 money supply -- has not led to an acceleration, but to a slowing down of the M3 money supply, as many depositors have reduced short-term savings -- an important component of the M3 money supply -- by converting such savings into long-term forms of investment. Trends toward checking monetary expansion are already apparent. The slowing down of monetary expansion should continue this year, especially as money market interest rates continue to fall. In this respect, the Bundesbank goal of between 4 and 6 percent for 1994 is completely realistic. However, the Bundesbank's money supply goal contains an element that responds to economic developments in a way that cannot be reconciled with a medium-term strategy. The Bundesbank is not guided by whatever rate of growth is possible in the medium term but by the actual current rate of growth. The potential medium-term rate of growth amounts to 3 percent, whereas the actual rate amounts to 2.5 percent. This relatively low rate is attributable to the decline in west German investment activity. The decline is not entirely but largely due to a restrictive monetary policy. To allow that to influence the future monetary supply goal simply amounts to a partial abandonment of the concept of a medium-term monetary policy and the inclusion of a cyclical factor.
