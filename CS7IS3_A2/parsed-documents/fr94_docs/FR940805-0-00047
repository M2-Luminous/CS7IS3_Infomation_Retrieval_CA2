ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Oregon has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Oregon's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Oregon's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Oregon's hazardous waste program revisions. Oregon's application for program revision is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for Oregon shall be effective on October 4, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Oregon's program revision application must be received by the close of business on September 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Oregon's program revision application are available during the business hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Waste Management and Clean-up Division, Eighth Floor, 811 S.W.

Background States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;266, 268, 124 and 270. B. Oregon Oregon initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program on January 30, 1986. Oregon received authorization for revisions to its program on May 29, 1990. On July 1, 1994, Oregon submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Oregon is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(4).
