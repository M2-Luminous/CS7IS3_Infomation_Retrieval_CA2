FR941011-0-00010 FR941011-0-00003 Seventeen of the 22 letters concern cotton fees, delaying the effective date of USWA fee charges, and a maximum limit on fees. The 17 cotton entities are comprised of nine cotton compressors/ginners, four warehousemen, and four Associations. One of the letters from an association states that its members support maintaining the integrity of the USWA warehouse receipt system, but association policy will not allow for constructive comment on the proposal at this time. Five of the 22 letters concern grain fee increases and future fee announcements. The five entities are comprised of three associations and two warehousemen. A total of 41 comments were received. Thirty-two of these comments concerned cotton, and 9 concerned grain. Discussion of Comments Most of the commenters were supportive of the continued need for the USWA and of the concepts behind the proposal. However, many of the comments suggest that a different approach would be more desirable to finance the costs of the program. The final rule adopts the proposed fees for grain, tobacco, wool, dry bean, nut, syrup, and cottonseed warehouses without change. One minor change to the fee proposal regarding cotton has been made. The amount of fees collected in warehouses where the capacity exceeds 160,000 bales, will be subject to incremental increases. Summary of Comments Cotton Fees Some degree of confusion exists among the commenters as they refer to the federal and State regulation programs and warehouses with a Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Cotton Storage Agreement as being one and the same. Specifically, they believe that all regulatory and contractual fees should be announced at the same time. However, these three agencies operate under different legislation with different authorities. Therefore, these comments are not discussed below in detail. A total of 11 comments were received regarding fees. One comment opposes the warehouse and service license fee increase, as well as the annual and inspection fee increases. One comment states that it is assumed that warehousemen who are currently licensed would be grandfathered into this fee structure and would be opposed to any new assessment of fees to cover the cost of existing licensed space. One comment strongly opposes the implementation of user fees for cotton, stating that it is a new taxation. One comment understands the need for fees; but believes fees should be based on an hourly rate of actual time spent. The commenter feels that if the main purpose is to cover an inspector's expenses, that it would be more appropriate than using the bale capacity as the basis. One comment states that the proposed fees are far greater than any suggested at recent meetings. The commenter feels that omission of any inspection fees for State licensed warehouses is discriminatory. One comment states that the proposed fees are much too high, and that ASCS should lock in any fee for at least five years. One comment states that user fees are not opposed, but that the fee schedule in the Federal Register discriminates against small warehouses. One comment states that the importance of the examination system is questioned. When examiners logged in each bale and knew what was missing, the audit provided valuable information. The commenter feels that if a bale by bale check was still done it would be useful and that he would be glad to pay the fees for the service. One comment supports the need for inspection fees, but believes we should consider a freeze on the level of fees for a specific time, say five years, on the basis that escalations should not be needed in the near term. One comment opposes the proposed fees. The commenter feels that the fees are too much, too soon, and if fees are a must, they should be phased in over not less than a 3-year period. One comment states that there is reluctant concurrence with the imposition of fees, but that they fully support the need for inspection fees to be imposed for cotton.
