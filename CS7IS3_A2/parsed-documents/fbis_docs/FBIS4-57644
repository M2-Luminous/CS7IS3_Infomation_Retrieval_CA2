The measures adopted more than a month ago are resulting in slower growth of the loan portfolios of credit institutions and an increase in interest rates for the loans. While the portfolios (financial sector loans) had been growing by 3.3 percent between 12 March and 10 April 1993, the increase was 2.5 percent during the same period of this year. According to EL TIEMPO's estimates the system would have loaned approximately 100 billion pesos more if credit were increasing at the same rate as last year. The impact is expected to be greater in the coming weeks because, by means of the measures, the Central Bank's Board of Directors seeks to achieve a rate of growth in credit of only 2.2 percent per month. In addition, Decree 673, which was issued by the government and requires the financial system to increase its net assets [patrimonio], is expected to have a noticeable impact in May. The Impact The growth in bank portfolios [between 12 March and 10 April] decreased from 3.5 to 2.4 percent. However, the impact has been most evident in the portfolios of commercial financing companies. The growth rate dropped from 6.6 percent in April of last year to only 2.1 percent [for the period 12 March-10 April, 1994]. The president of the National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF), Javier Fernandez, said the lower rate of increase could be attributed, in large part, to the drop in the volume of loans granted by the commercial financing companies for automobile purchases. Despite the measures to restrict internal and external credit, the means of payment (money in circulation and current accounts) continue to grow at a rate of 40 percent, considerably above the target fixed by the Central Bank which is between 21 and 28 percent. An excessive increase is detrimental for achieving the inflation goal. This explains monetary authorities' concern with controlling the increase in money in public circulation. Interest Rates Increase Another consequence of the credit restrictions is the increase in the investment (colocacion) interest rates. While loans were granted at an average interest rate of 36.09 percent in March 11 of this year (prior to the measures), by 15 April the rate had increased to 38.08 percent. The credit system had foreseen an increase of two or three points as a result of the measures. The highest interest rates are found in the banks and commercial financing companies which charge, on average, 38 and 39 percent, respectively. The difference between what is being charged for loans and what savers are receiving averages 13 percent. However, contrary to what was expected, interest rates for savers have not dropped noticeably. Prior to the measures, earnings of 25.60 percent were being received. Today earnings average 25.35 percent.
