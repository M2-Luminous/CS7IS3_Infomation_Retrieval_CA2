Abacha's government will soon meet the same ends as those of General Ibrahim Babangida and Ernest Shonekan, his predecessors, Abiola was reported as saying by the independent Lagos daily GUARDIAN on Monday. Abacha came to power in November last year following the collapse of Babangida's eight-year regime in August and the short-lived government of Shonekan, an unelected civilian former premier. "Any nation that does not have the chance of choosing those who lead them is a slave nation," Abiola added. Abiola, a millionaire Muslim who headed the Social Democratic Party's presidential bid for power, explained why he had not led an open rebellion against the cancelling of the presidential election result. "I am not mad enough to fight with the sword. To be president you have to be alive. I want to stay alive to govern Nigeria and solve its mounting problems," Abiola said. Abiola branded Abacha's regime "anti-democratic and illegitimate" when he returned to Nigeria at the end of December after leaving for a "rest" in Britain.
