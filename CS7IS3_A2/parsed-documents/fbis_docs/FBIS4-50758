These include proprietary technology, technical know-how, trademarks and computer software, he said. Addressing the '94 Beijing International Symposium on Intellectual Property Protection, Zhao Chunhua, deputy director of department of science and technology, said that the measures include allowing each foreign software owner to register of his own will his software with the China computer software registration agency to safeguard his property interests. Meanwhile, the quantity of imports of certain foreign computer software that is stipulated in the software license contract constitutes the base for China to exercise its administration of the domestic market, in order to prohibit and punish any acts of imitation or illegal copying of the relevant software. According to incomplete statistics, China's trade volume of computer software by now has exceeded several hundred million U.S. dollars. Zhao Chunhua noted that China has promulgated the patent law, the law against unfair competition, the trademark law and the copyright law, which provide the legal basis to protect intellectual property rights involved in technology imports. "Moreover," Zhao said, "regulations on technology imports are now being deliberated and will soon be formulated." He told the 130-plus participants of the symposium that China also allows the recipients of technical know-how to conclude, before importation, a "secrecy-divulging agreement" with the foreign suppliers, to pay necessary expenses and to undertake necessary responsibility for keeping secrets. Zhao added that foreign suppliers are also allowed to impose necessary and reasonable restrictions on people who have access to the know-how, and to place reasonable restrictions on areas where the products manufactured with the know-how are sold. In using foreign suppliers' trademarks to produce or market products, Chinese recipients are ordered to vindicate the reputation of the trademark, while the quality and property of the products that are manufactured by the recipient and bear the supplier's trademark must conform to the quality and property of the products bearing the original trademark. Foreign suppliers also have the right to exercise necessary supervision and guidance over the production and marketing of the products bearing the suppliers' trademark through proper and reasonable means. Zhao pointed out that in the process of importing foreign patented technology, the patented technology whose supplier fails to provide sufficient proof or guarantee for the validity of the right of the patented technology is not permitted to be imported into China. Meanwhile, it is stipulated in the contract of patent technology imports that recipients of the technology in China and foreign technology supplier should conclude contracts specifying the scope and duration of the use of the proper patent in order to prevent proliferative use of the technology. China also ordered that in the contract of patent technology imports, there should be an explicit authorization clause. Zhao Chunhua said that if disputes over intellectual property involved in technology imports arise, the two parties concerned should first negotiate to avoid any hindrance to the smooth implementation of the imported technology. "If negotiations or mediation fail," Zhao added, "the two sides may request arbitration or start legal proceedings in the intellectual property divisions of China's courts." China has so far set up such courts in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan. Zhao said that it has been proved that China's courts and administrative authorities at various levels have pledged continued efforts to enforce the law to the letter and bring to justice violators of the intellectual property rights. Moreover, a Sino-U.S. bilateral negotiation agency on intellectual property has been set up under the Sino-U.S. joint committee on commerce and trade. "It provides a place where some disputes relevant to intellectual property of the two countries are exchanged and mediated regularly, thus playing a role in mediating and settling disputes over intellectual property of the two countries," Zhao concluded.
