FR941028-0-00046 FR941028-0-00009 Again, OSM disagrees with commenter's views. The definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in the regulations did not identify the types of violations of the Act or other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny a permit under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). A fuller definition of the term which would encompass these types of violations as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act was necessary for incorporation by reference into a proposed amended version of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). While commenter has asserted that there is a need for a general definition of the term ``violation notice'' across OSM's regulations, commenter has identified no urgent need for a universal definition of the term that would outweigh the need to clarify the provisions of 30 CFR part 773. Further, in the event that it becomes apparent that the implementation of other regulations have been somehow significantly compromised by the deletion of the general definition of ``violation notice'' contained in 30 CFR 701.5, OSM can address these issues as necessary. Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenter's position. Further, a commenter urged that any violations be in a final, unappealable posture before they can be the basis for permit denial. OSM disagrees with the commenter's characterization of the current state of the law and with what the commenter believes ought to prevail. First, Federal regulations which predate the proposed rules and today's final rules already provide that permits may be conditionally issued based upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal testing the validity of the underlying violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2). Thus, contrary to commenter's implication, permits are not necessarily denied while violations are under appeal. The burden, however, is on a violator to assert appeal rights in good faith and in a timely manner. There is no legitimate reason to afford additional appeal rights to people who have squandered their opportunity to appeal. In the absence of a timely appeal, a violation should be the basis for denial of a permit, in accordance with the provisions of section 510(c). In this preamble under the topic captioned ``Due Process,'' OSM has responded in detail to commenters who have asserted that permits should be conditioned upon the appeals of ownership or control links or upon the appeals of the existence of the violation asserted by owners or controllers of violations after standard appeal times for the violations have run. As stated in this preamble, OSM rejects these assertions. To the extent that the commenter implied that permits should be issued unconditionally during the pendency of an appeal of a violation, OSM also rejects this proposal. Under this proposal, a violator could commit a violation at his or her surface coal mining operation; take a timely appeal; and then be approved unconditionally for permit issuance at another site. Following the failure of his or her appeal, he or she could continue to mine on the new site with no interruption or termination of his or her rights on the new site. This course of events violates the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act which mandate that regulatory authorities deny permits when applicants have current violations of the Act or other laws. Also, the commenter's proposal is inconsistent with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2) cited above which allow only conditional issuance, rather than unconditional issuance, for permits issued to applicants who have appealed outstanding violations. In that final rule, OSM has adopted the definitions of ``Federal violation notice'' and ``violation notice'' as proposed and without any of the changes requested by commenters.
