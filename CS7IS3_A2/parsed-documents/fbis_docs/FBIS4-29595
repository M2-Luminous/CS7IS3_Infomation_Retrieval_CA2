FBIS4-29595 "dreas118_a_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Panel Proposes Abolition of Oil Import Law Panel Proposes Abolition of Oil Import Law OW2006060494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0542 GMT 20 Jun 94 OW2006060494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- A Japanese Government advisory body Monday [20 June] proposed scrapping a law that limits imports of petroleum products for use by oil refiners. In an interim report presented to the trade minister, the Petroleum Council said the provisional measures law on the importation of specific kinds of petroleum refined products has helped perpetuate substantial price gaps between the domestic and overseas purchase prices of gasoline and other petroleum products. If the law is abolished as recommended, businesses such as trading houses will be able to import petroleum products after March 1996, when the law expires. The report also proposed revision of petroleum storage regulations, in order that new entrants, such as trading houses, will be required to make provision for a certain level of petroleum stockpiling when launching an import business. The report also recommended formulation of a new law designed to ensure high quality standards for imported petroleum. At present, Japanese consumers pay roughly four times as much for gasoline as, for example, their U.S. counterparts. The council said the latest proposal is intended to introduce a market mechanism into the Japanese petroleum industry by promoting competition with foreign products. The step would put downward pressure on prices of petroleum products, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a press conference. In order to compete with cheaper foreign products, refiners would be forced to make further cost-cutting efforts, which would in the long run reinforce their financial standing, the official said. The proposed reform of the petroleum storage law does not mean that prospective importers must have a capability to stockpile petroleum products, he said. If such a requirement is attached under the proposed import liberalization, it would be virtually impossible for trading houses to enter the oil import business, and the status quo would not change, the official said. As one way of ensuring stockpiling as required under the new proposal, prospective importers could rent storage tanks from refiners, he suggested. During Monday's Petroleum Council meeting, some council members voiced concern that scrapping the provisional petroleum import law could have negative effects on Japan's energy security, the MITI official said. But others supported the step as "most appropriate" for deregulating Japan's petroleum market and the industry, he said. The council report also recommended that Japan's petroleum distribution system be reformed to make it more efficient. Specifically, the report called for more competition to be introduced in operation of gas stations by gradually abolishing a designation system for building such stations. Expected restructuring of gas stations, most of them financially fragile, under competition policy may erode their profits further, but the interest of consumers should also be considered, the report said. Operators of gas stations should listen to public criticism that they are providing "excessive services" at the expense of price attractiveness, it said. The report refrained from addressing whether or not self-service gas stations should be allowed, saying the issue should be studied by the Fire Defense Agency. Asked if MITI would accept an expected request by the refinery industry for increasing prices of kerosene, gas oil and other daily necessities, the official said the ministry has no intention to "intervene in pricing of such products during the era of free competition." If gasoline prices fall under the proposed policy, the refinery industry is expected to call for raising prices of kerosene and gas oil, which have been set at relatively low levels by MITI to balance high gasoline prices in the wake of the oil crisis during the 1970s. The petroleum council will create two working panels in August to study various problems involved in abolition of the petroleum law, including how to secure a stable amount of stockpiling by new entrants and to ensure high product quality, the MITI official said. The council will work out a final report in December, the official said.
