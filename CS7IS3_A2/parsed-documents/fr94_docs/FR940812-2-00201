FR940812-2-00201 FR940812-2-00073 [Release No. 34&hyph;34500; International Series Release No. 397; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;20] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 2 and 3, and Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 4 to the Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options on the Mexico Index August 8, 1994. On June 3, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to list and trade options on the Mexico Index (``Mexico Index'' or ``Index''). On June 27, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, the subject matter of which was superseded with the filing of Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2''), which was filed on July 7, 1994. 3 Amendment No. 1 was formally withdrawn on July 8, 1994. 4 On July 11, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 3 (``Amendment No. 3'') to the proposed rule change to provide for certain standards to be used in conjunction with the maintenance of the Index, as described below. 5 On July 12, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 4 (``Amendment No 4'') to the proposed rule change to amend the applicable position limits from 10,500 contracts to 7,500. 6 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR ยง249.19b-4 (1991). 3 See Letter from Howard Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated July 7, 1994. In the original proposal, the Amex sought approval for the listing of options based upon a Mexico Index that was capitalization-weighted and based upon shares of twenty Mexican stocks or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Amex or that were National Market securities. The Amex proposed that the Index be classified as a broad-based index. Amendment No. 2 supersedes the original proposal and Amendment No. 1. 4 See Letter from Howard A. Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated July 8, 1994. 5 See Letter from Howard A. Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated July 11, 1994. 6 See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated July 12, 1994. Notice of the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 was published for comment and appeared in the Federal Register on July 15, 1994. 7 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal and Amendment Nos. 2, 3 and 4. 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34356 (July 12, 1994), 59 FR 36235. I. Description of the Proposal The Amex has developed a new index called the Mexico Index, based entirely on the value of shares or related American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') of widely held Mexican companies traded on the NYSE, Amex, or that are National Market (``NM'') securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). The Index contains securities of highly-capitalized companies with major business interests in Mexico. The Exchange states that these companies have been drawn from a variety of industries, including construction, telecommunications, banking, shipping, tobacco, media, and food and beverage, to reflect the diversity of the Mexican market. Index Calculation and Maintenance The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. In an attempt to more closely approximate the industry weightings within the Mexico stock market, the two highest capitalized components within the Index are given higher weightings, 24% and 12%, respectively, while the eight remaining Index components are weighted equally at 8%. Accordingly, as of the market close on June 17, 1994, a portfolio of ten Mexican component securities was established representing a hypothetical investment (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $24,000 in the largest capitalized component in the Index, $12,000 in the second largest, and $8,000 in each of the remaining Index components. The value of the Index equals the current market value ( i.e., based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided by the Index divisor. The Index divisor has been established to yield the benchmark value of 175.00 at the close of trading on July 22, 1994. 8 8 See Letter from Howard A. Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1994. The Amex initially proposed to utilize a divisor calculated to yield the value of 231.00 at the close of trading on June 17, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June, September and December, the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index portfolio adjusted by changing the number of whole shares of each component so that the largest capitalized Index component once again represents 24% of the Index value, the second largest component represents 12%, and each of the remaining components represent 8%. If the number of components in the Index increases to greater than ten, the Amex will continue to weight the two components with the highest market capitalizations 24% and 12%, respectively. The remaining components will then be weighted equally. 9 For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the two securities with the highest market capitalizations will be assigned a 24% and 12% weighting, respectively, while the remaining ten Index components will be assigned a 6.4% weighting. 9 See Amendment No. 3. If it becomes necessary to remove an Index component, the exchange will either add an Index component having characteristics that will permit the Index to remain within the maintenance criteria specified in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order (and also contained in exchange Rule 901C), 10 or will permit the Index to be calculated based upon the remaining components (but no fewer than nine) until the next quarterly rebalancing, at which time the Exchange will replace the component so that the Index will continue to have at least ten components. 11 The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment. 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (``Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order''). 11 See Amendment No. 3. The Amex states that it has routine experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and has not encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely, proper, and adequate notice is given to market participants. Particularly, an information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology.
