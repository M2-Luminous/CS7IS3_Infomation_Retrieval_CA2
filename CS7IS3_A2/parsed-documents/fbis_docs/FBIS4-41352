In a televised address Wednesday [29 June] night, he denounced what he described as madness in Ukraine and called for efforts in support of democracy in the Republic. He also warned that the struggle for power in Ukraine could lead to disaster and called for an end to extremism. He emphasized that Ukraine was pursuing the course, chosen at the referendum of 1 December 1991, when more than 90 pct of Ukraine's citizens favored independence. Kravchuk said he believes there is nothing more important than to create an incentive for production and development. At the same time, he regretted that no effort was currently being spared to set the top bodies of power at loggerheads and find contradictions between the president, the premier, and the parliament's speaker.
