The official said Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski had informed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation secretary-general Manfred Woerner by letter of Skopje's intention to join the partnership and participate in it actively. The partnership, announced by NATO last month, provides for military cooperation and aid especially for former communist countries in eastern Europe, with the possibility of full membership later. Observers here said the partnership could lead to Macedonia providing U.S. and NATO bases on its soil.
