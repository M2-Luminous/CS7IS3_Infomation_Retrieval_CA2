The National Bank informs on a 1.5 percent January increase of the primary emission of cash, and predicts a possible 18 percent further increase in the first quarter of the year. The Bank will remain strictly on the planned projection, and this month's inflation rate is expected to be under the level planned with the stabilization program. Owing to the restrictive policies and the increased supply of hard currency on the market, the denar can be expected to keep its stable course in reference to foreign currencies.
