President Kim made the remark while delivering a speech at the commencement ceremony of the Korea Naval Academy's 48th class in Chinhae, South Kyongsang Province. "The people who exploited the sea have prospered and, in the economic war era of `survival of the fittest,' it is even more important to exploit the sea," Kim said. The central stage of world history is moving to the Pacific Ocean, Kim added, and exchanges and cooperation in the Pacific region are increasing rapidly. "Your mission of protecting the sea is becoming more and more important," Kim said. Kim noted that the military has been able to fulfill its mission as a military of the people and as their final fortress. "I hope that you will lead change and reform in the military as the new generation, and I ask you to make personal sacrifices to build a credible Navy." "I myself will make strong efforts for better treatment and promotion of your prosperity, so that you can concentrate on your mission. I will see to it that professional soldiers feel they are performing an honorable job for the state and the nation."
