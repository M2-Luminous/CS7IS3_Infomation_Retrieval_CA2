"It's nice to see you again," Kim said to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, recounting their first meeting in Seattle last November during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. "You came a long way," Jiang answered, taking Kim's hand. Kim shook hands with everyone in the welcoming line as Jiang provided introductions. Kim obviously found some familiar faces and didn't forget to say, "it's been a while." The South Korean leader then followed suit, introducing everyone accompanying him on his trip to China. The welcoming ceremony lasted 15 minutes including the performance of national anthems and the walk down the red carpet between honor guards. -- Kim jogged around Daiyoutai, the guest house where he is staying, before leaving for the welcoming ceremony and remembered to praise the beauty of the trees and the ponds in talks with Jiang. Chatting before the summit opened amid a burst of camera flashes, Kim said he had spent a very comfortable night at the guest house and especially appreciated the beautiful scenery. The summit room, unlike when Kim met with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with only one aide present, was filled with officials from both sides. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae, Senior Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong Chong-uk and the Foreign Ministry's Director-General for Asian Affairs, Yu Pyong-u, sat in for the Seoul side. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan and the Director-general for Asian Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Wang Yingfan, represented Beijing. -- The Kim-Jiang summit was followed by an expanded summit attended by 13 officials including the trade, science and technology and communication ministers as well as military leaders. The two countries capped their summit with the signing of agreements on cultural cooperation and avoidance of double taxation.
