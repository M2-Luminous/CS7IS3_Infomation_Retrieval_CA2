Yang, 49, from Shanghai, was arrested in Beijing on November 15, the day after the signing by nine dissidents of a document calling for multi-party politics and democracy in China. He was initially placed in a detention centre in Beijing but was transferred December 5 to one in Shanghai, he told AFP by telephone. "After I have recuperated a bit, because my health deteriorated in prison, I plan to resume my activities with the Peace Charter and also with the human rights movement set up last year in Shanghai and which we want to get officially registered," he said, following his release on Friday. Yang, who has always been in the forefront of the struggle to defend human rights in China, spent two years in jail for his role during the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. He was also the author of a letter written in 1990 to Communist Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin calling for the liberation of all political prisoners. Yang said he had no news of another Peace Charter signatory, Qin Yongmin, from Wuhan, central China, who was also arrested on November 15. Ma Shaohua and Zheng Xuguang, two human rights activists and members of a monitoring group in Xian, central China, were questioned two weeks later for holding a meeting in Beijing with Charter dissidents. During that meeting the two movements decided to coordinate their efforts to promote democracy by legal and non- violent means. Their initiatives on these issues were the most significant since the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement in Beijing.
