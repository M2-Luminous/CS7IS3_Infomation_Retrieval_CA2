To this end, the actual nutrition was examined in the Plavsk rayon of Tula oblast in the framework of the 1990-1992 State Union-Republican Program of Urgent Measures in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. A contingent of children was divided into two groups of 1-3 and 4-6 year old kids enrolled in a preschool institution. The preschool institution nutrition was examined by analyzing 100 menus using an analytical method with the help of tables. The characteristics of child nutrition rations based on the food intake (M+/-m) for proteins, fats, carbohydrates, caloric value, and protein:fat (animal vs. vegetable) ratio and the characteristics of daily rations of actual child nutrition for the content of principal nutrients and energy are summarized. This comprehensive hygienic assessment shows a lack of balance and a vitamin and mineral (especially calcium and iodine) deficiency. Based on the findings, balanced seven-day four-times-a-day rations for 1-3 and 4-6 year olds are specially developed for the areas affected by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.
