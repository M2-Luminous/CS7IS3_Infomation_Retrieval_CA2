FR941207-0-00029 FR941207-0-00003 After considering the public comments received and further deliberating the issues involved, the Board is adopting a final rule recognizing, for capital purposes, qualifying bilateral netting contracts. This final rule is substantially the same as proposed. Legal Opinions Form. The final rule requires that institutions obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) concluding that the netting contract is enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. This requirement is aimed at ensuring there is a substantial legal basis supporting the legal enforceability of a netting contract before reducing a banking organization's capital requirement based on that netting contract. A legal opinion, as generally recognized by the legal community in the United States, can provide such a legal basis. A memorandum of law may be an acceptable alternative as long as it addresses all of the relevant issues in a credible manner. As discussed in the proposal, the legal opinions may be prepared by either an outside law firm or an institution's in-house counsel. The salient requirements for an acceptable legal opinion are that it: (i) Addresses all relevant jurisdictions; and (ii) concludes with a high degree of certainty that in the event of a legal challenge the banking organization's claim or obligation would be determined by the relevant court or administrative authority to be the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of all individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract. The subject matter and complexity of required legal opinions will vary. To some extent, institutions may use general, standardized opinions to help support the legal enforceability of their bilateral netting contracts. For example, a banking organization may have obtained a memorandum of law addressing the enforceability of netting provisions in a particular foreign jurisdiction. This opinion may be used as the basis for recognizing netting generally in that jurisdiction. However, with regard to an individual master netting contract, the general opinion would need to be supplemented by an opinion that addresses issues such as the enforceability of the underlying contracts, choice of law, and severability. For example, the Board does not believe that a generic opinion prepared for a trade association with respect to the effectiveness of netting under the standard form agreement issued by the trade association, by itself, is adequate to support a netting contract. Banking organizations using such general opinions would need to supplement them with a review of the terms of the specific netting contract that the institution is executing. Scope. With regard to the scope of the legal opinions, that is, what areas of analysis must be covered, the Board is of the opinion that legal opinions must address the validity and enforceability of the entire netting contract. The opinion must conclude that under the applicable state or other jurisdictional law the netting contract is a legal, valid, and binding contract, enforceable in accordance with its terms, even in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceedings. Opinions provided on the law of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. should include a discussion and conclusion that netting provisions do not violate the public policy or the law of that jurisdiction. The Board has further determined that one of the most critical aspects of a qualifying netting contract is the contract's enforceability in any jurisdiction whose law would likely be applied in an enforcement action, as well as the jurisdiction where the counterparty's assets reside. In this regard, and in light of the policy in some countries to liquidate branches of foreign banking organizations independent of the head office, the Board is retaining its proposed requirement that legal opinions address the netting contract's enforceability under: (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered, or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract. Severability. The Board recognizes that for some multibranch netting contracts an organization may not be able to obtain a legal opinion(s) concluding that netting would be enforceable in every jurisdiction where branches covered under the master netting contract are located. The Board concurs with commenters that in such situations it may be inefficient to require institutions to renegotiate netting contracts to ensure they cover only those jurisdictions where netting is clearly enforceable. The Board has determined that, in certain circumstances for capital purposes, banking institutions may use master bilateral netting contracts that include contracts with branches across all jurisdictions. Banking institutions should calculate their net current exposure for the contracts in those jurisdictions where netting clearly is enforceable as supported by legal opinion(s). The remaining contracts subject to the netting contract should be severed from the netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract for capital and credit purposes. This approach of essentially dividing contracts subject to the netting contact into two categories_those that clearly may be netted and those that may not_is acceptable provided that the banking organization's legal opinions conclude that the contracts that do not qualify for netting treatment are legally severable from the master netting contract and that such severance will not undermine the enforceability of the netting contract for the remaining qualifying contracts. Conclusions. The Board has retained the proposed language that legal opinions must represent that netting would be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. In response to commenters' assertions that the standard for this type of legal opinion is too high, the Board notes that use of the word ``would'' in the capital rules does not necessarily mean that the legal opinions must also use the word ``would'' or that enforceability must be determined to be an absolute certainty. The intent, rather, is for banking organizations to secure a legal opinion concluding that there is a high degree of certainty that the netting contract will survive a legal challenge in any applicable jurisdiction. The degree of certainty should be apparent from the reasoning set out in the opinion. The Board notes that the requirement for legal opinions to conclude that netting contracts must create a single legal obligation applies only to those individual contracts that are covered by, and included under, the netting contract for capital purposes. As discussed above, a netting contract may include individual contracts that do not qualify for netting treatment, provided that these individual contracts are legally severable from the contracts to be netted for capital purposes. Institutions generally must include all contracts covered by a qualifying netting contract in calculating the current exposure of that netting contract. In the event a netting contract covers transactions that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution may choose to either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure, but this choice must be followed consistently.
