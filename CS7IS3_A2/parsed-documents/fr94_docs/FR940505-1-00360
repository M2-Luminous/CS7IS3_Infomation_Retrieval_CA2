FR940505-1-00360 FR940505-1-00012 (iii) EPA will multiply the VOC contents (as determined by paragraph (c)(1) of this section) by the inventory (as determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) to determine ``individual base-year VOC emissions'' for each individual pesticide. (iv) EPA will add the individual base-year VOC emissions for all pesticides to determine the ``total base-year VOC emissions'' from all pesticides combined. (v) Starting with the pesticide or pesticides ranked ``1'' according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, EPA will add the individual base-year VOC emissions for pesticides ranked 2, 3, 4 *␣*␣* etc, until the sum equals forty to seventy percent (40%&hyph;70%) 31 of the total base-year VOC emissions. The VOC content of the last pesticide needed to achieve 40%&hyph;70% of the total base-year VOC emissions becomes the ``VOC limit.'' 31 As discussed further in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the range of 40% to 70% reflects the target range of 20%&hyph;45% reductions in emissions from pesticide application. This range was selected for consistency with the VOC cap rules proposed as 40 CFR 52.2952 through 52.2954. Based on planned modeling and inventory analysis and comments received during the comment period, EPA hopes to select a specific reduction target from within this range for use in the final rule. (vi) EPA will promulgate the VOC limit with a summary of the assumptions and results from paragraphs (c)(2) (i) through (v) of this section. (3) Restrictions on pesticides. (i) On and after 1 (one) year after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from distribution within the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit. (ii) On and after 2 (two) years after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from application and/or storage within the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit. (4) Revisions to the VOC limit. (i) EPA may, at any time, require producer(s) to reanalyze their pesticides according to the methodology described in paragraph (f) of this section and to submit the new data according to paragraph (d) of this section. (ii) EPA may, at any time, revise the VOC limit consistent with the methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and based on information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or elsewhere. (d) Reporting. (1) Producers. Reports submitted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section must include: (i) Name, address, name of contact person, and telephone number of producer. (ii) Name and description of pesticide product, including a copy of the pesticide product label. (iii) Name, address and telephone number of the laboratory performing analysis; name of analyst; and date and time of analysis. (iv) All raw data collected during analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. If, for example, TGA analysis is performed as described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, all thermograms produced must be submitted, as well as justification for rejecting any unacceptable thermogram. (v) Summary and results of analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. If, for example, TGA analysis is performed, the summary of analysis shall include uncorrected weight percent VOC content (i.e., kg VOC per kg pesticide), weight percent water content, weight percent exempt solvents content, and weight percent VOC content corrected for water and exempt solvents, as applied. (vi) Certification signed and dated by a responsible official of the producer stating the following: I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. (2) Distributors. Any person who distributes pesticides within the affected area must report the following information to EPA: (i) Distributor notification. The distributor notification shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the distributor, and the name of a responsible official of the distributor. The report shall be postmarked not later than the date the VOC limit becomes effective (see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) or 30 days after the distributor first begins distribution of pesticides, whichever is later. (ii) Annual report. The annual report shall specify the type and amount of each pesticide sold, shipped, or otherwise distributed in the affected area. The annual report shall be submitted by January 30 of each year for the preceding year's data beginning with the year in which the effective date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section occurs. (3) Applicators. All applicators within the affected areas shall submit a copy of all PURs to EPA at the same time the PUR is submitted to DPR once the effective date specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section occurs. (e) Recordkeeping. All producers, distributors, and applicators must maintain all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this section for a period of five (5) years. This information includes, but is not limited to, copies of all reports required in paragraph (d) of this section, and any technical support to those reports. Copies of this information must be provided to EPA upon request.
