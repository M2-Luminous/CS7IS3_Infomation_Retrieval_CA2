Due to the indifference of the U.N., said the daily, the situation has aggravated in the area to the extent that the Bosnian prime minister says what else the Serbs should commit to make them liable to punishment? This statement will be recorded as a black point in the history of the U.N. as an organiztion that claims to support the rights of the nations and protect peace and security in the world, the paper said. Turning to the hard conditions imposed on Bosnian Muslims and the fact that the Serbs do not abide by any rules and regulations, the daily criticized the U.N. for imposing an arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims whereby reducing them to defenceless victims of the criminal Serbs. The bitter reality that the world witnesses today is the death of humanity in the West on the one hand, and the double-standard role of the U.N. on the other, the paper said, adding that the world nations should, therefore, protest against the U.N. which has been reduced to a protector of `the law of jungle'.
