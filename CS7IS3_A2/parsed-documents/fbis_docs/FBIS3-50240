Good evening. [Granic] Good evening. [Announcer] We were told that hot, topical issues were discussed. What was your impression of today's talks, will Croatian-Slovene relations finally begin registering an upward trend? [Granic] The atmosphere was very good and I believe that an important step forward was made today. I am convinced that eight to 10 agreements will be ready for signing on 7 February, as agreed. I am particularly convinced that considerable progress had been made regarding the resolution of the Krsko [Slovene nuclear power plant supplying electricity to Croatia] problem, the resolution of the problem concerning the agreement on property, and the agreement on the Ljubljana Bank. We presented our proposals in these cases and I believe that we now have a proximity of views. We will continue the talks and try to solve this problem -- one of the major problems -- by 7 February. Agreements on cultural and educational cooperation, trade, regular air traffic, the water industry, employment, social security, long-term cooperation in the use of the Slovene transit gas pipeline, and fishing rights -- all these are ready and should be concluded by 7 February. [Announcer] Do the Slovenes reproach us in any way and why have there not been such top-level meetings in the past? [Granic] I believe that conditions have now become ripe, that both sides have realized that to sign all these agreements would be extremely beneficial to both countries, and that compromise solutions must found in certain areas. [Announcer] Slovenia has much better relations with its other neighbors than with Croatia, and we have heard recently that they fear the Croats the most. What is the reason for this, and how do you think this will evolve in future? [Granic] I believe that matters will begin moving in a different direction after the signing of these agreements on 7 February, and that one cannot expect only one side to make compromises. Anyway, most of the problems are a consequence of the disintegration of former Yugoslavia, and these problems can only be resolved through compromise solutions. [Announcer] Today, you also addressed the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Today, you took part in two important events. What happened in Strasbourg? [Granic] In Strasbourg I had meetings with all officials of the Council of Europe, from Mrs. Lalumiere, the secretary general, Parliamentary Assembly President [Miguel Anjel] Martinez, to [Gerhard] Reddemann, the Political Affairs Committee president, and all other top officials including the special envoy for Croatia, Baron Finsberg. I would like to tell you in a few sentences about the gist of all these meetings: As the main obstacle for the speedy admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe they singled out the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and obviously problems in connection with halting the war and reaching an agreement. I think this is the main obstacle, both when it comes to public opinion, Europe, and all the problems proceeding from there. They positively assessed Croatia's efforts in the course of the latest meetings in Geneva and Brussels, but, in any case, they said an agreement between the Muslims and Croats was desirable. On the other hand, I can also say that all positively assessed the beginning of normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the signing of the joint declaration as the first step in the normalization of the relations, and in this connection they expressed their support in very clear terms. They had increasingly fewer remarks for the development of democracy in the Republic of Croatia, even though there were some remarks in connection with the media, to which I believe they received satisfactory replies. [Announcer] I am sorry to interrupt you. Can you tell us in more detail what their concrete remarks to this were? [Granic] They were concretely interested to know about the issue of Mr. Ivancic [FERAL TRIBUNE editor in chief who was called up on 31 December], for whom we said was mobilized as all other able-bodied men of his age. On the other hand, if we receive an application for compulsory work orders [for him], we will in every case support it, and he will be treated as all other press editors in the Republic of Croatia. There were some remarks in connection with television without any particular specifications of problems. I would like to say that there have been no major criticisms. [Announcer] So you said that they supported all Croatian moves. Then how can you explain that Croatia's guest status to the Council of Europe was frozen. [Granic] We should note that some parliamentarians initiated a process for the expulsion of Croatia, or for it to be denied special guest status. However, the special guest status remained; at the level of our bureau it has been frozen for a certain period of time, but envoys for Croatia have been appointed. I believe, that if we achieve some progress in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the process of admitting Croatia as a permanent member to the Council of Europe will be immediately resumed. [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for being a guest of the Slikom na Sliku program.
