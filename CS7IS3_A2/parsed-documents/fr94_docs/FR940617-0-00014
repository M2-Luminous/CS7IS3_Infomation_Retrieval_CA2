FR940617-0-00014 FR940617-0-00003 The Department has also incorporated in the definition of ``Federal program'' interpretive clarification that loan guarantees or loan insurance of the construction of buildings or other structures is covered by the phrase ``undertaking, financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' contained in the definition of ``Federal program.'' This interpretation was previously provided in the preamble of the final rule that promulgated the current regulations. See 49 FR 27720, July 5, 1984. Further in this regard, the Department has clarified that the acquisition, management, and disposal of land or facilities that a federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other actions taken under a loan, loan guarantee, or other financial assistance proved by the agency directly and specifically for that property or facility is likewise within the definition of ``Federal program.'' A federal agency may develop and use procedures to implement the FPPA for its loan, loan guarantee, or other financial assistance programs on either a specific project/loan basis or on the basis of an entire program. Further, if an agency has conducted a FPPA review of a loan or other financial assistance for the conversion of farmland and the agency or any other federal agency subsequently acquires the property related to that assistance, the previously conducted FPPA review will be sufficient to constitute compliance with the FPPA for the management an eventual disposal of the property. More importantly, an agency may develop and use specific policies and procedures for the management and disposal of property acquired through foreclosure, forfeiture, or other such means that taken into consideration its primary statutory authorities regarding such properties. Clearly, these determinations can be best made by the particular agencies involved through their respective FPPA policies and procedures, in consideration of the statutory requirements under which they operate. The Department will consult with agencies, pursuant to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203, to address these concerns. Some federal agencies would like to exempt certain sites related to the expansion of existing linear projects that would convert only a few acres of farmland but would avoid the conversion of a large number of acres. Some statewide LESA systems currently include exemptions of 10 acres per bridge and 3 acres per mile on existing highways. The construction of bridges and widening of existing highways is a farmland protection method. USDA will consult with Federal Highway Administration, on actions that are designed to improve existing linear projects so as to avoid the conversion of land that would occur if a new linear project were to be constructed. This rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in accordance with provisions of Departmental Regulations 1512&hyph;1 and has been designated ``non-major.'' It has been determined that this action will not have an economic impact on the economy of $100 million or more; result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or result in significant adverse effects on competition; employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign, based enterprises in domestic or export markets. This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This document has been prepared in the Office of the Secretary, USDA, with the assistance of the Basin and Area Planning Division of the Soil Conservation Service.
