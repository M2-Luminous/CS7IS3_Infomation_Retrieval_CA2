It has become known from reliable sources that the decision was taken "on the basis of the president's recommendation pending the consideration of an item to this effect at a Federation Council meeting in accordance with Article 102 of the Russian Constitution". The need to appoint an acting prosecutor-general arose in view of the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik from the post on Saturday. Kazannik disagrees with the release, by a State Duma decision, of those guilty of the October 3-4, 1993, bloodshed in Moscow, and regards it as unlawful and uncoordinated with law enforcement agencies.
