This is one issue in which all enterprises are interested. Director Zhao [Zhao Huaitan, director of the State General Administration of Taxation Department of Income Taxes], would you please comment on the differences between the new and former systems on enterprises' consolidated taxes? [Zhao] Generally speaking, the two systems are different in five respects. First, the new system has consolidated the tax rate at 33 percent, replacing the former three tax rates. Second, the new system has standardized the tax base. The tax law has standardized the pre-tax deductibles. [passage omitted] Third, under the new system, state enterprises do not have to pay regulatory taxes and the two types of funds, namely the fund for key energy and communications development projects and the fund for budgetary regulation. Fourth, after the tax base has been consolidated, a new system governing enterprises' loan repayment will be established. [passage omitted] While an enterprise may consider loan interests as a production cost after the new system has been instituted, it must use its disposable capital to pay the loan itself. Fifth, under the new system, state enterprises will no longer have to deliver contractual income taxes to the state. [passage omitted] [Chen Shuqi, chief of the Beijing No. 4 Pharmaceutical Factory Financial Section] Director Zhao, according to the new tax law, which became effective on 1 January this year, the categories of deductible income taxes are different from those of the past. What are the major differences? [Zhao] The new tax system is different from the Interim Regulations Governing Enterprises' Income Tax in the following areas: The first difference is about enterprises' loan interests. If an enterprise borrows money from a financial institution, the interest it pays to the institution is deductible; and if it borrows money from a nonbanking financial institution, the interest is deductible provided the interest rate does not exceed that for the same kind of loan borrowed from a banking institution during the same period. [passage omitted] Second, a worker may deduct his wages if the wages he receives from an enterprise does not exceed the standards set for taxable wages [ji shui gong zi]. [passage omitted] This measure is adopted to control the excessive growth of consumption funds when enterprises have yet to establish all their self-restraint mechanisms. [passage omitted] Third, the basic amounts of money that an enterprise retains for workers' welfare services, trade union budgets, and workers' education budgets should be calculated the same way as taxable wages. The fourth difference is about donations. [passage omitted] According to the new tax law, donations should be governed by several conditions. 1) They should be made through intermediaries, such as youth foundations, Hope Projects, [word indistinct] committees, and other nonprofit social and nongovernment groups. 2) They should be used for education, public welfare services, disaster- or poverty-stricken areas. 3) As commonly practiced in foreign countries, there are limits for deductions. [passage omitted] [Yun Qinghua, director of Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Plant] Director Zhao, enterprises are now very interested in tax deductions and exemptions. Before tax reform, enterprises could enjoy certain preferential treatment in terms of tax deductions and exemptions. What preferential measures will continue and what will be removed following the establishment of the new tax system? [Zhao] Enterprises today enjoy too many tax deductions and exemptions and preferential tax treatment. [passage omitted] After enterprises' income taxes have been consolidated, the current tax deductions and exemptions have been screened. Most of the deductions and exemptions will be removed. This is because tax rates have been reduced under the new tax system. [passage omitted] But certain reasonable deductions and exemptions with a fairly great impact will be retained. After study, we consider continuing giving preferential tax treatment for high-tech enterprises in high-tech industrial development zones, newly established tertiary industries, school-operated enterprises, nongovernment welfare enterprises, enterprises providing employment services, enterprises engaged in controlling industrial wastes and protecting the environment, and enterprises in need of assistance after being hit hard by natural disasters. [passage omitted] [Yun] Director Zhao, comrades of local economic commissions have asked whether local governments still can authorize tax deductions and exemptions after the new tax system has been implemented. [Zhao] Enterprises' income tax is a tax that came into being through national legislation. This means that the same tax law and tax collection policy should be applied nationwide. After the system of separating central and local taxes has been established, income taxes paid by local enterprises are considered part of the local authorities' regular incomes, and local authorities can handle certain issues according to actual local situations with the authority prescribed in the tax law and other relevant regulations. Local authorities may not exceed the bounds of this authority and do what they want in deducting or exempting taxes. [passage omitted]
