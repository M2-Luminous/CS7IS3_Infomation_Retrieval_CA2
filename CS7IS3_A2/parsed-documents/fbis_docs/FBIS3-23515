Morozov, chief of the cosmodrome space units from 1986 through 1990, under the rubric "Cosmodromes: Missiles and People": "Plesetsk"] [Text] July 15, 1957 is considered to be the official date of the creation of the northern cosmodrome. Built initially by military construction personnel as a scientific-research test range for missile technology, it gradually came to be one of the principal domestic cosmodromes. About 1,500 spacecraft (60 percent of the total number) have been put into orbit from here. They include satellites for military, scientific and national-economic purposes. Located 800 km [kilometers] from Moscow among forests, lakes and peat bogs, the cosmodrome occupies an area of about 10,000 km[.sup]2[/] (120 km from north to south and 80 km from east to west), and is a complicated technical complex for the preparation and launching of artificial Earth satellites. The choice of the location for the cosmodrome was no accident. Many scientific, national-economic and military programs require the placement of spacecraft into low polar and near-polar orbits. The use of launch complexes that are located in the higher latitudes is expedient for this purpose. The active portion of the flight of launch vehicles also passes over the lightly settled terrain of Arkhangelsk Oblast, which makes it simpler to provide for safety along the flight path of the rockets and choose the areas where the spend stages fall (northern Tyumen Oblast and Taymyr Peninsula). The proximity of the cosmodrome to the country's scientific and production centers was also taken into account. The city of Mirnyy, not shown on many maps, is located seven kilometers from the Plesetsk station on the Northern Railroad. The test personnel live there. The population of the city and the residential compounds of the centers for the preparation of launch vehicles and spacecraft for launch varies from 40,000 to 60,000 people. The infrastructure of Mirnyy meets all contemporary requirements. The city is provided with heat, water, electric power, foodstuffs and industrial goods mainly by servicemen. The sights, aside from monuments to prominent figures in space science, include memorials to the tragic events that have occurred at the cosmodrome and memorable dates on the occasion of the launches of the Kosmos-500, Kosmos-1000 and Kosmos-2000 satellites, among others. There is an instrument-building technical school, a branch of the Novator VNII [All-Union Scientific-Research Institute] of Electronic Machine Building and the Pero airfield. There is an engineering site next to the city for the launch preparation of light (from 800 to 3,000 kg [kilograms]) spacecraft and their launch vehicles. Testing of satellites (aside from military ones) in the Kosmos, Interkosmos, Okean and Nadezhda series, among others--about 20 types of spacecraft in all--is conducted in the installation and testing wings. The stages of the Kosmos launch vehicle are also joined and tested here before being brought out to the launch complex. There are servicing areas for each craft and launch vehicle with sets of ground testing equipment. The check-out processes are highly automated. Some spacecraft, such as the Meteor, can be delivered by aircraft to the Baykonur cosmodrome for launch into heliosynchronous orbits after they are checked out. Rockets for space purposes (the rocket and spacecraft covered by a cowling) that are prepared for launch are delivered on transport and placement units to the launch pad located 50 km from Mirnyy, where they are placed on the launcher and are located inside a movable service tower during pre-launch preparations. This structure is 100 meters high, with an area of 2,000 m[.sup]2[/] at the base and a weight of 450 tonnes. The tower is retracted from the rocket before launch on railroad tracks 12 meters apart. A spacecraft can be changed on a vertically positioned rocket using it, as opposed to other launch complexes. It also supports the normal functioning of the service personnel under any weather conditions and at any time of day. Deep enclosures are located near the launch complex, housing storage areas for the rocket fuel components and the engineering and technological preparation systems. Graphic Spacecraft checked out and ready for launch by the Tsiklon launch vehicle are delivered from the engineering site in the installation and testing wing, located 40 km from the city, where they are joined with the rocket and transported to the launch complex. The mounting, hook-up of all service lines and pre-launch checks for these rockets are entirely automated. The operation of on-board and ground technological systems and units is monitored using an automated control system, with the depiction of the technological schedule on the display of the main operator. Manual control of the launch can be used when necessary. The pre-launch structures (storage areas for the rocket fuel components, accommodations for the ground testing equipment, panels and the like) provide for the complete safety of the personnel in launch. The engineering and launch sites where medium-class launch vehicles and spacecraft are prepared and launched are located 40--45 km from Mirnyy. They include four standardized launch complexes 10--15 km apart located on the steep bank of the small taiga river Yemtsa. This makes it possible to perform not only simultaneous pre-launch preparation, but also timely technical servicing and upgrading. One of their specific features is the fact that the gas diversion lines of the launch structures have been run out to the river floodlands in the interests of fire safety, which made their construction considerably cheaper. All the launch pads may be used for manned spacecraft. The Soyuz and Molniya launch vehicles and the spacecraft (military, Kosmos, Bion and Resurs series and the like) are tested in four installation and testing wings. Each rocket and craft has its own equipped servicing areas, some of which are standardized and suitable for the testing of both military and civilian craft. More than ten types of satellites may be tested in all. The telemetry complex includes the Vega system of external trajectory measurements, two telemetry stations on the grounds of the cosmodrome and four along the flight path of the launch vehicles in the area of Vorkuta, Norilsk and Syktyvkar and on Novaya Zemlya. The information coming in from them is processed at the computer center in Mirnyy. Its capacity is such that it could satisfy the requirements of all of Arkhangelsk Oblast in the resolution of national-economic tasks. The oxygen and nitrogen plant provides all the launches with the necessary liquefied gases. The cosmodrome continues to develop. Launch and engineering complexes for the Zenit launch vehicle and the spacecraft launched by that rocket will enter service in the next few years. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
