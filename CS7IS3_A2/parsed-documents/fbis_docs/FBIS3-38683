Will the massacre, the climax of the horror so far, change the world and its policy? It is by no means certain, because baseness has again and again been weighed in the balance and found to be not enough to make the West intervene militarily. At the 31st Security Conference in Munich, the traditional semiofficial meeting of NATO strategists, U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry expressed "horror and outrage," but then the new Pentagon chief reverted to the old kind of language. A "solution by negotiations" is more urgent than ever and, therefore, the international community must exert "maximum pressure" on all parties. On whom and how -- he left that open. None of the foreign and defense ministers, senators, and parliamentarians had a better answer. The answer has not become easier after the debacle in Somalia. Whoever wants to intervene in this war of everybody against everybody else, must know from the beginning: Against whom? Then: What is the goal? Just balancing powers --or enforcing a political order, which can never satisfy everyone? Finally: Democracies are not reliable providers of order. Somalia has shown what democracies can do -- and where they fail. As long as the objective was just to feed the hungry, the international community did wonderful things. But when it prescribed a more ambitions vision for itself -- to disarm and punish the fighters -- the debacle took its course. The enormous moral stimulus waned, when suddenly the price had to be paid in the coin of one's own casualties. And thus, the Americans and the Germans will once again look one when the Somalis again make "order" in their own way as of April. Of course, it would not be difficult for the highly developed air forces of the West at least to loosen the grip of the siege around Sarajevo and, in addition, change the Serbs' calculation of risks. Over 22 months the Serbs have learned that the West inflates itself every time, but then collapses like a balloon with a hole. Surgical air strikes on vulnerable Serbian positions and lines would not make peace, but they would restore the credibility that any kind of diplomacy needs as urgently as a lever needs power. However, it hardly looks as if the massacre in the marketplace will provide the will to use the power. The United States hesitates as long as its partners hesitate. Belgium is calling for air strikes, but London first wants to find out what its blue helmets on site say. In Paris, they sometimes want to attack the Serbs and sometimes the Muslims. And the German foreign minister passionately calls for what is obvious: "With the United States, we must find a way to end the war." It is equally obvious that the Germans can exert pressure only very cautiously. At the Munich conference, both Chancellor Kohl and his rival Scharping once again presented the all-party consensus that the Bundeswehr has no business in the Balkans. Even though, in contrast to his position at the 30th conference, Kohl does not want to stick categorically to the principle that the troops of democratic Germany must never again operate in those places where the Wehrmacht once marched in. "Historical sensitivities," however, must be respected. Whoever remembers past "military defense" meetings will, while still hearing the echo of the mortar grenades, note with pleasure that at least two other internal wars have been canceled. Germans and Americans demonstrated complete agreement on all other issues of "big policy" -- be it Russia, Eastern Europe, or the future of NATO. Even more dramatic was the change in the course of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] in the election year of 1994, which Scharping outlined and which reminds one of the change in direction (yes to a link with the West) of the early 1960's. "Embrace" was the slogan and Scharping's not so secret signal was: "We are amenable to any kind of coalition." The SPD chairman only avoided the key question about combat operations by the Bundeswehr. However, the Constitutional Court will probably give the answer for him in spring. Reportedly, Karlsruhe has indicated to Scharping (at least that is what his party colleagues are putting about) that the supreme court will announce an extremely generous interpretation of those Basic Law articles that have been interpreted -- also by the Union in the past -- as a ban on out-of-area operations. This would be the most practical of all solutions for Scharping, since he could then keep the party's leftists quiet by paraphrasing an old proverb: Karlsruhe locuta, causa finita -- the court has spoken, the matter is closed. The matter of the war in Bosnia will not have been closed by then, however. But what will the Germans do when the judges have freed them from their self-inflicted ties? Perhaps they will look back wistfully to the time when they were still able to sit in a quiet corner and leave the decision "to intervene or not to intervene" to the others.
