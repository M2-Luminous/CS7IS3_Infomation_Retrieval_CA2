The government is currently making continuous efforts to ship the containers back to the Netherlands -- their country of origin. Minister of State for Environment, Ir. [academic title] Sarwono Kusumaatmaja stated this to the press in Bandung on Wednesday 15 June. According to the minister, the government is facing difficulties in trying to ship back the plastic waste because the containers were smuggled into the country. The Netherlands Government considered that it was not responsible for the existence of the plastic waste in Indonesia. Continuing, Minister Sarwono said the Netherlands Government will accept the waste only if an official decision was endorsed by the Netherlands Supreme Court. The court is currently attending to the case in question. He said,"We hope that the Netherlands Supreme Court makes an endorsement to take back the plastic waste to the country." The minister went on to say that should the Netherlands Supreme Court refuse to accept the plastic waste, then Indonesia will take alternative measures for the waste to be returned to the country. Minister Sarwono said,"We will make our move through political, diplomatic, and legal channels in the International Court." The minister also stated that the imported plastic waste had probably entered the country through certain Dutch exporters who had exploited the facilities afforded to them by the authorities. However, the plastic waste could not have entered Indonesia without the involvement of some local importers. Sarwono said, "As a result of this, the North Jakarta High Court is pursuing the case against two local industries that imported the plastic waste." He said, moreover, the continuing presence of the 90 containers of plastic waste at Tanjungpriok Port effected a loss in income by the port because the area could not be leased out to other companies. Apart from this, the whole location and environment is subjected to the danger of being exposed to the poisonous toxic substance. Minister Sarwono explained, "Therefore, the loss in income suffered by the port authorities will be included in the claim when it is served on the Dutch and Indonesian industries." [passage omitted]
