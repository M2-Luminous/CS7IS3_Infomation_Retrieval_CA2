Disciplinary sanctions were taken against 17,000-odd government employees, of which 32 were department-level officials, 378 county- level officials, said Cao Qingze, minister of supervision. Exactly 1,031 of them were handed to the judicial sector for further investigation and prosecution, Cao said as he was reporting his work today at the annual inspection conference of delegates to the National People's Congress, China's supreme legislative body. He said the supervisory bodies have been focusing in 1993 on corruption cases -- involving officials and other employees in Communist Party organizations, government bodies, executive law- enforcing branches and economic management sectors. The corruption cases usually embraced the abuse of power, taking bribes, graft, smuggling and moral degeneration. He said that after a year of hard work, corruptive practices had been kept "within certain limits", which he believed should "play an important role" in maintaining China's political stability and safeguarding its reform and opening to the world. China's anti-corruption drive is going the right way, he said. "Better results will be achieved provided that it is persistent," he added. The central government cancelled 143 illegal fees and charges imposed on citizens last year, said the minister, adding that "active measures" have been enforced to ban officials from making personal trips abroad at government expense. Moreover, Cao said, government officials above county-level have been asked to collectively check their own corruptive practices, if any. Most of the problems checked out have been handled according to the state laws and decrees; others are being investigated under the supervision of the ministry, Cao said. The minister promised that all supervisory bodies in the country will continue to further the anti-corruption drive, in line with decisions made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
