Chairing the first working session with the commissioner, general directors, and area directors of the National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], Valades Rios remarked: "Present here are many of the leaders who will make a victory in this area really happen." Speaking before Raul Campos Rabago, commissioner of the National Institute To Combat Drugs, the head of the institution of federal justice declared that the public servants working for it are the initiators of a new institutional project in the country. "Many doubted that the creation of an institute of this type was possible, and many are now admitting their mistake in doubting the chances for success of an agency such as this. Our achievements are being demonstrated every day." Addressing the personnel comprising the aforementioned institute's top-level administration, the attorney general indicated that the programs already established will be continued, and that none of what has already been gained will be left unfinished. The official asserted: "The commitment is not one for changing, but rather for intensifying and carrying even further what has been done with enormous effort. Expanding the results accrued is a commitment to the nation, the president, and ourselves." Diego Valades claimed that it was now necessary to spur the efforts already expended, "not only to halt the large volumes of drugs circulating in the country and contribute to the health sector's activities, but also to restore to our society the confidence that others are attempting to deny it." [passage omitted] Diego Valades added: "At times, we must exert great patience in surmounting the limitations on such fundamental resources as our physical facilities. However, I know not only your problems, but also your capacities and potential. We shall solve your problems, because that is our responsibility. And you will be assigned to solve the country's problems insofar as drugs are concerned." The official stressed that the training and refresher courses for both agents of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office and those of the Federal Judicial Police have made it possible to form a professional group to investigate this type of crime. He commented: "We have a great professional capacity, and a great individual and collective will. I am sure that, day by day, intense efforts will be expended on work as well as collective intelligence exercises, that will make it possible to provide solutions for the problems arising every day."
