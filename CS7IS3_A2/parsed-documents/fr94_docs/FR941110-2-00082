Abstract: This ICR extends the collection of information for the current monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), and other monitoring reports EPA's National Pollutant Discharge System (NPDES) program. This ICR has incorporated the ICR for the ``Standards for the Use and Disposal of Sewage Sludge at 40 CFR Part 503'' (OMB control no. 2040&hyph;0157) and recent OMB-approved amendments for ``Storm Water Implementation'' (EPA ICR 229.07) and the ``State Sludge Management for NPDES/State Sludge Monitoring'' (EPA ICR 229.08).

In general, with the exception of certain sludge records that must be kept indefinitely, respondents must maintain records for five years. Reporting information received by the permitting authority is entered into the Permit Compliance System (PCS) national computer database. The permitting authority will use the reporting information stored on PCS to assess permittee compliance, modifying/and new permit requirements and revise effluent guidelines. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 17 hours per response, including time for reviewing the institutions, searching existing data sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the information. Public recordkeeping burden is estimated to average 19 hours per recordkeeper, including time for gathering and maintaining monitoring data and other records, as appropriate.
