Once admitted, these observers shall have the right to participate but not to vote.'' Persons wishing to be observers representing national non-governmental organizations in the United States must receive prior approval of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Requests for such approval should include evidence of technical qualification in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna or flora, on the part of both the organization and the individual representative. Such requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority (see ADDRESSES, above). Copies of the letters of approval from the Office of Management Authority should be used by these organizations to inform the CITES Secretariat of their wish to send observers to the meeting. The Secretariat requires such information to be received at least one month prior to the meeting (October 6, 1994). Approved observers should send copies of their letters of approval to the following address: CITES Secretariat, 15 chemin des Anemones, Case postale 456, CH&hyph;1219 Chatelaine-Geneve, Switzerland.
