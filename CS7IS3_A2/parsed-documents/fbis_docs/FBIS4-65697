However, the man himself is certainly a new discovery as far as the Left is concerned: former Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa, Silvio Berlusconi's defeated challenger in Rome's leading constituency in the March election. The idea, which was launched by Venice progressive mayor -- philosopher and left-wing critic -- Massimo Cacciari, consists of organizing a shadow cabinet, to be headed, in fact, by Spaventa, a nonpartisan man with liberal democratic ideas. An old structure, therefore, and a new man to revive an opposition which, according to Cacciari, must become an alternative force to the government as soon as possible. An immediate "yes" -- also on behalf of the other progressive mayors -- came from Catania's leading citizen Enzo Bianco: "Spaventa suits me fine, and I also agree with the idea of an `opposition government' acting as an interface." The progressive intelligentsia, however, did not find the proposal all that appealing. Luciano Canfora said: "This is an attempt to find a shortcut, a mechanism to win. Setting up a government led by Spaventa -- whom I very much appreciate but who nevertheless lost the contest with Berlusconi -- means setting up a government which would be very similar to the right-wing government, albeit without all those nasty mugs around. What is the point of building such a Left?" The same question was being asked by Pietro Barcellona, chairman of the Center for Research on the State: "Spaventa does not convince me in the least. I appreciate him, but I do not think we can convince the left-wing grassroots to keep Lent eternally." The example given was clear enough: "During the election campaign, the Left asked for continuous sacrifices, whereas Berlusconi was offering lottery tickets to his voters." In any case, "the first step is social opposition at grassroots level." Political expert and former Socialist European deputy Gianni Baget Bozzo agreed with this view: "For a shadow cabinet to work, real unity would be needed among the Left with a view to forming the government, but no such unity exists with Communist Renewal and Rete. Particularly if led by Spaventa -- who represents continuity with [Former Prime Minister] Ciampi -- a shadow cabinet would confirm the split within the Left by forcing it to confront the real issues faced by a government." This is why "the Left should remain an opposition force, in order to stay united." "A shadow cabinet makes sense if it includes the whole opposition, otherwise it is weak," constitutional expert and former PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy Augusto Barbera asserted. "It only makes sense if it includes the democratic Catholics. This is why we must wait for the PPI [Italian Popular Party] congress in July, in order to understand whether they want to conduct opposition based on party agreements, that is to say, with the aim of replacing the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in the government, or an alternative-type of opposition, joining forces with the Left." However, a shadow cabinet with the PPI would mean losing "two of the First Republic's myths, namely the Left's unity, and the Catholics' political unity," because Communist Renewal would be lost on the way, and the PPI would certainly split. Who could lead the shadow cabinet? "Spaventa might do," Barbera said, "but then, in such a context, so could Prodi [chairman of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]." "Prodi? An interesting name, as indeed is Spaventa's," Social Christian leader Ermanno Gorrieri said. However, he appeared to entertain some doubts: "I am not entirely convinced by the idea of a shadow cabinet. In short, the search for unity must be based on a common ethos, and this requires time. Besides, will Communist Renewal be included or not?" He also had doubts about making overtures to the PPI: "It must be done, but I wonder whether a shadow cabinet would be the ideal means of doing so. Putting pressure on the PPI by calling for a united front may have the effect of pushing the PPI further away from us." A flat "no" came from former PCI [Italian Communist Party] exponent Napoleone Colajanni: "The Left's crisis cannot be solved by means of shadow cabinets, even more so considering that, according to Cacciari, such a government would have to be led by Spaventa because the latter challenged Berlusconi. Well, seeing the result of the contest, it seems a rather ill-omened choice to me."
