The LSWYK noted with appreciation that the TYU has played an important role and conducted brisk activities to build a new independent society and consolidate the unity of the nation and the country under the leadership of the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, maintaining the line of socialism and self-reliance. The TYU highly estimated the fact that the LSWYK, united in one mind around the great leader of the Korean people Comrade Kim Il- song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, has successfully discharged its mission and role in the struggle for defending the Workers' Party of Korea and confidently safeguarding and advancing the cause of socialism in the hard time when the imperialists continue anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves. The TYU bitterly denounced the United States and its satellites for deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea and rendering the situation of the Korean peninsula extremely strained, while threatening sanctions against the DPRK through the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations under the pretext of "the nuclear issue," and urged them to promptly stop such moves. The sides emphasized the need to support and closely cooperate with each other in the common struggle for the development of the world youth movement for solidarity against imperialism and for peace and friendship and the cause of socialism.
