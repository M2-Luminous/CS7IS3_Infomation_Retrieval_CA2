The statement said that "the U.S. projected deployment of Patriot missiles may make difficult the negotiations between the North and the International Atomic Energy Agency on nuclear inspection and lead to a war." It said that "the plan is entirely contradictory to the universal trend toward peace and reconciliation" and urged its immediate withdrawal. The organisation strongly demanded that the South Korean puppet authorities refuse introducing missiles which will bring the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.
