In the accompany of mainland legal experts invited by the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the group, including Taiwan's legal experts and relatives of the victims of the incident, went to see the "Hairui" boat and instruments used by suspects in the murder case. The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chun'an County on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and the robbery and murder of 32 victims from Taiwan and the mainland. Of the dead, 24 were tourists from Taiwan. After the inspection, Shi Hwei-yow, SEF's deputy secretary-general, said it is helpful to understand the whole incident and to see the scene of the crime. During the two-hour inspection, the SEF group went onto the "Hairui", which is docked in the boat-building yard of Chun'an County. They reviewed the entire structure of the boat and fire damage on the upper, middle and lower cabins. They also asked questions about the cause of the fire and how it spread, the position of the explosives and the fittings of the boat. The legal experts from the mainland answered the questions in detail. The SEF group also went to a small house not far away from the "Hairui" where the tools of the suspects in the incident and their booty were kept, including two hunting rifles, a bag of explosives for civilian use, a pail for gasoline, cameras, gold and jade trinkets, watches, video tapes, and pictures developed from the film in the cameras. The SEF group also inspected the motorboat used by the suspects.
