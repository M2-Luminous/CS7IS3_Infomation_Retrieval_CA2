For weeks, bitter fighting has been going on between Krahn and Mandingo factions within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]. There have also been clashes between the Liberian Peace Council and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. And reports are now emerging of fresh incidents involving what appears to be groups of indisciplined NPFL fighters, impatient at the long delays in the demobilization process. (Jonathan Payleily) has been traveling around the Nimba County in north-eastern Liberia and he telexed us this report from the NPFL capital, Gbarnga: In one incident two weeks ago, a group of 15 heavily-armed men, under the command of an NPFL general, entered Zaou, a township 15 miles north of Ganta, at night. According to eyewitnesses, they held residents, including pregnant women, at gunpoint, then they beat them and stole their money, cattle, and a large quantity of rice. The NPFL commander who headed the group was said to be taking revenge for a relative who was involved in a local property dispute. While visiting the area last week, I spoke to a victim of the assault, an elderly man who told me he was flogged, tortured, and detained for one week in the town of Sakripie, where the soldiers are said to have come from. NPFL soldiers in Ganta told me that the commander of the raiding team was later arrested by NPFL forces and is now under investigation. In another district, Tapeta, 53 miles north of Ganta, harassment cases are being brought every day before the district commissioner. In an incident two weeks ago, armed soldiers went into a nearby village, firing into the air and taking people's belongings as they fled away.
