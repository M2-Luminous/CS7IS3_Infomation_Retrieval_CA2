The Israelis jammed the telecommunications networks in the area during the operation. An agent guided the two helicopters to their landing place on the al-Furzul-Niha hills at night. The Israeli soldiers doped Mustafa al-Dirani's family members so that they couldn't move or resist. Needle marks were found on their hands, legs, and necks. Traces of blood were found a few meters from al-Dirani's house. It is believed an Israeli soldier was wounded during an exchange of fire. Israel has admitted that one Israeli officer was hurt during the operation. The Israelis opened fire from weapons equipped with silencers. The Israeli military jeeps stopped at a place called Wadi Shararah outside Qasr Naba. The first to open fire on the Israeli force was 'Abd-al-Karim al-Dirani (brother of captive Mustafa), who used a hunting rifle to fire on the Israeli soldiers. The Israelis used infrared night vision equipment. The telephone line at al-Dirani's house was out of order for three days. The Israelis appear to have known about this because they did not cut the line. Marks left by an axe were seen on a wooden door and there were three bullet marks on the outside wall of the second floor of the house. It seems the Israelis fired on the house to cover their withdrawal. The israelis left behind a door-opening device, cassettes, al-Dirani's worry beads, and bandages, which, it seems, they dropped in the confusion after fire was opened on them. Al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani returned to his house in Qasr Naba on the evening of Friday [20 May] to spend the 'Id al-Adha holiday with his family, relatives, and friends. This proves that his house was under surveillance by agents. Thus the circle of suspicion might narrow, possibly leading to the identification of the participants in the operation. [passage omitted covered in previously filed material] Former Hizballah Secretary General Subhi al-Tufayli held a news conference at which he accused the Lebanese authorities of having prior knowledge of the operation and contributing to the handover of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani to Israel. He said: The state is held responsible because it is responsible for the people's security and because it storms houses, arrests people, and sets up gallows. He declared that the state, which cannot protect its citizens from the Zionist enemy, who came by helicopters and stayed five hours on the ground, has no right to knock on doors and storm citizens' homes. It has no right to say it is responsible for the country's security. He called on citizens to use weapons against anyone who knocks on their door and storms their home, regardless of his alleged identity or uniform, because we are facing a situation in which we cannot differentiate between the Zionist enemy and others. Every citizen must defend himself. Al-Tufayil said the Israeli operation was within the framework of the negotiations and part of the security normalization process between Lebanon and the Zionist entity. He said the issue of Israeli pilot Ron Arad is a riddle [uhjiyyah]. He pointed out: According to my confirmed information, Iran has no connection with this issue. And Hizballah--of which I was secretary general--has no connection with this issue. I have heard that the other parties that might be holding the pilot have denied any connection with or knowledge of the issue. If the denial is correct, as is the case with Hizballah and Iran, the chances are that the Israeli pilot has died or was killed. Based on this premise, the issue is now a riddle. Zakariya Hamzah, also known as Abu-Yahya, one of the leaders of the Believers Resistance, said: We have an account to settle with Israel. As Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was taken, he will return. Our concern now is to search for the threads that led the Israelis to brother Mustafa al-Dirani. We will cooperate to confront the ferocious Israeli enemy. After the assassination of 'Abbas al- Musawi, the quality operations against Israel increased. After the abduction of Abu-'Ali, we will confront Israel with quality operations. This is our style. We have an account outstanding with the Jews, outstanding since the time of Khaybar. The biggest account we will settle will be with the agents of the enemy. [passage omitted]
