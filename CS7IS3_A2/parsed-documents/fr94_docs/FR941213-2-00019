FR941213-2-00019 FR941213-2-00011 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Financial Assistance Award: Custom Electronics Incorporated AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award under grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;95EE15617 to Custom Electronics, Incorporated. The proposed grant will provide funding in the amount of $99,945 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of a gas broiler control to automatically limit gas flow to cooking equipment when it is not in use. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by Custom Electronics, Incorporated is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The co-inventor, William Garceau, who will be assisted by Thomas Speakman, has many years of experience performing advanced research work in the fields of electronics and material sciences. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Placement and Administration, Attn: Rose Mason, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 18 months from the date of award. Issued in Washington, D.C. on December 5, 1994. Richard G. Lewis, Contracting Officer, Office of Placement and Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30576 Filed 12&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
