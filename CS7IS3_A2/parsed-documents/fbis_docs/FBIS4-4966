On April 3 during his stay in Japan, he requested Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to "take phased economic sanctions". This solicitation diplomacy is a dastardly act of the special-class flunkeyist traitor who does not have an iota of the spirit of national independence and is hell bent on harming fellow countrymen by clinging to the coattails of the U.S. and Japanese masters. "Additional inspection" claimed by Han Sung-chu during his tour of the United States and Japan is a nonsense which cannot work with anyone. The DPRK which is in a special position after temporarily suspending the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is not obliged to undergo the agency's full inspection pursuant to the safeguards agreement and it has never agreed on this with the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Han Sung-chu's vociferation about "additional inspection" cannot be contrued otherwise than a deliberate act motivated by a sinister purpose to expand the scope of partiality of the agency and thus render the situation more complicated. The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, clearly knowing that their criminal attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK will eventually lead them to destruction.
