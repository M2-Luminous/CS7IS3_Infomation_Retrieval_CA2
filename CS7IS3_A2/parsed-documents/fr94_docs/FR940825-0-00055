FR940825-0-00055 FR940825-0-00013 Other Considerations This final rule change is in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. There are no information collection requirements relating to these patent fee rules. This final rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. The PTO has determined that this final rule change has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the final rule change would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The final rule change increases fees by changes in the CPI as authorized by 35 U.S.C. 41(f). The principal impact of the major patent fees has already been taken into account in 35 U.S.C. 41(h), which provides small entities with a 50-percent reduction in the major patent fees.
