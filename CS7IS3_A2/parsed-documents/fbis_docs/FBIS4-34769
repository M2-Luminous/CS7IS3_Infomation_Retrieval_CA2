While its predecessor operated exclusively with British and U.S. airplanes, under Fidel Castro's regime the Cuban airline became the Soviet airline industry's best client in the Western Hemisphere. But with its once impressive fleet, today the airline cannot win any laurels. Because of this, Cubana has purchased from Aviaco, a subsidiary of Spain's Iberia Airlines, eight used Fokker F-27's for $6 million, and it has allocated $1.5 million to train the crews to continue servicing national and Caribbean flights. The twin-motor Dutch airplanes are certainly not the most recent models, but they are still reliable, and despite their age they are easier to maintain than the rest of the old Cubana fleet which includes three An-24's, nine An-26's, 12 Il-62's, nine Tu-154's, five YAK-40's, and two YAK-42's. Seven Il-62's -- four-turboprop long-range airliners that are extremely expensive to operate but are able to carry 200 passengers -- will be refurbished and updated to comply with U.S. safety standards, since they will also fly over U.S. territory. Of the nine three-turboprop Russian Tu-154's, short- and medium-range airliners once preferred by the former GDR airline Iterflug, only two are in any condition to fly. The Cuban airline industry is in a deep crisis. The old jet airliners are expensive, and there is a shortage of foreign exchange and consequently fuel, not to mention the scarcity of spare parts for the obsolete Russian airliners. Notwithstanding, Cubana continues flying to Europe, Latin America, and Canada to bring tourists to Cuba. The country raising the most objections is the United States. In 1991, when Cubana agreed to a joint venture with the Brazilian airline company VARIG to modernize its fleet and receive a strong injection of capital, the U.S. veto was more powerful. VARIG, in pursuit of its own interests in the United States, had to capitulate. Another example: International law allows Cuban long-range airplanes that fly to Europe the use of a corridor passing over the United States which must be strictly observed. But, as soon as the airliners reach New York they have to turn right and head toward the Atlantic. Even on all flights to Canada, a country with which, much to U.S. annoyance, Cuba has had good relations for many years, Cuban airliners have to take a huge detour. Heriberto Prieto, general manager of Cubana Airlines, laments: "This is equivalent to one additional hour in flight time between Havana and Canada, with its corresponding fuel expense." Cuba is looking for a way out of this crisis through practical emergency solutions. Its stated aim is to survive. The best way is through tourist flights which the company does not want to leave entirely in the hands of airlines from Europe and Canada, regions that provide the majority of tourists visiting Cuba. Therefore, they need airplanes. The first step was taken by leasing a DC-10. Recently, Aero-Varadero, a subsidiary of Cubana Airlines, is flying an Airbus A-310, also leased, from Havana to Frankfurt and Milan on a regular basis, and in the future will fly to Madrid and Paris.
