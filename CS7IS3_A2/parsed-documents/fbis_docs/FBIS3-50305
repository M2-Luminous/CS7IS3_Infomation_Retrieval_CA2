According to STANDART NEWS, the prime minister predicted early elections. A comment in STANDART NEWS says the prime minister played a risky game. "The prime minister forebodes a national tragedy if the budget fails to pass by mid-February," says KONTINENT. "The ball is now with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists) who command a majority in parliament and determine the cabinet's fate," says the paper. According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the unrealistic deadline for passing the budget is most likely a prime minister move seeking to leave government losing as less respect as possible. The socialist DUMA says the BSP will make a political decision on the budget at a special plenum. A comment in the paper says the prime minister's statement sounded like an ultimatum and the political forces made it clear this was not a constructive tone. "This, however, does not mean the nation is approaching elections, as in that case it may end the year without a budget," says DUMA. The daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) DEMOKRATSIYA emphasizes Berov called the Socialists traitors. "BSP declined to consider the financial programme of its own government," says the daily. [passage omitted]
