FBIS4-14837 "drsov065_r_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Azerbaijan Official on Intention To Dismiss Bank Chief Official on Intention To Dismiss Bank Chief LD0404122994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1056 GMT 4 Apr 94 LD0404122994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Government of Azerbaijan intends to sack the National Bank chairman, Galib Agayev, "because of his failure to conduct monetary and crediting policy satisfactorily and observe the existing banking legislation." As Interfax learned from the chairman of the standing governmental commission for economic policy, Tofik Azizov, the issue of Agayev's resignation has been submitted to Azerbaijan's president. In March a special governmental commission checked up the work of the National Bank, as a result of which gross violations of legislation on banking activity were revealed, he said. For instance, Azizov stressed, throughout last year the National Bank issued credits totalling 292 billion rubles, and subsequently sold those funds as credit resources, notwithstanding the fact that they had not returned from circulation yet. This brought about unfounded credit emission, which, in its turn, caused higher inflation, Azizov concluded. Last year the level of inflation made up 1080 percent, and in the first two months of the current year 200 percent. The national monetary unit, manat, was put into circulation in August of 1992, however in 1993 the National Bank made settlements only in Russian rubles. The chairman of the governmental commission also said that last September, on instructions from Agayev, the National Bank closed all the correspondent accounts of local commercial banks. Such an action, Azizov pointed out, considerably complicated interbank settlements as well as settlements with foreign countries, CIS members among them. According to Azizov, the ill-advised policy pursued by the National Bank chairman brought about debt claims presented to Azerbaijan by a number of countries, including Russia -- for 81.5 million dollars, Kazakhstan -- for 6 million dollars and Turkmenistan -- for 9 million dollars, and resulted in "unprecedented bribery on the part of commercial banks during the receiving of cash, as well as in the forming of another circle of monetary circulation which is beyond the National Bank's control."
