Hata said in a written message to Chinese Premier Li Peng and a telephone call to S. Korean President Kim Yong-sam that Nagano's statement caused pain and anger to the peoples of Japan's Asian neighboring countries, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. The government instructed Japanese embassies in member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, to explain that Tokyo's policy is to build future-oriented ties, while squarely facing history, said the officials. In his messages, Hata referred to his policy speech delivered in the Diet (parliament) earlier in the day in which he renewed the government recognition that Japan's past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people. "Communicating this to future generations, the path which Japan must take, based on its deep remorse, is to do its utmost toward the creation of peace and toward the construction of a bright future for the Asia-Pacific region," he said. Nagano, 71, resigned Saturday [7 May] to take responsibility for his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication and that Japan was not a nation of aggression during World War II.
