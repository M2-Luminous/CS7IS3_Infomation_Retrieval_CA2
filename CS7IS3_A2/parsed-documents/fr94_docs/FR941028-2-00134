FR941028-2-00134 FR941028-2-00094 [Release No. 34&hyph;34879; File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Modifying the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service October 21, 1994. On July 20, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;13) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 Notice of the proposal was published on August 25, 1994, in the Federal Register to solicit comments on the proposed rule change. 2 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34550 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43876. I. Description NSCC is modifying its Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATS'') to accelerate the time in which customer cash or margin accounts are transferred. NSCC's rule change is made in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') recently approved rule change amending NYSE Rule 412 3 and the National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') recently filed proposal to amend Section 65 of the NASD's Uniform Practice Code, 4 both of which set forth guidelines for their members' transfers of customer accounts. 3 For a complete description of the NYSE rule change, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34633 (September 2, 1994), 59 FR 46872 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21] (order approving proposed rule change relating to NYSE's customer account transfers). 4 For a complete description of the NYSE proposed rule change, refer to File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;56. NSCC is amending its Rule 50, Section 9 to allow an NSCC member to whom a customer's securities account is being transferred (``receiving member'') one business day after receipt of the customer account asset data report from NSCC to determine whether to accept the account, to reject the account, or to request that the NSCC member who currently maintains the account (``delivering member'') make adjustments to the account. Currently, receiving members have two business days to respond after receiving the customer account asset data report. Where Mutual Fund Services eligible book share mutual fund assets are to be transferred, a receiving member again will have one business day instead of two business days after receipt of the customer account asset data report to submit detailed transfer instructions to NSCC. During the one day review period, a delivering member is able to add, to delete, or to change an item in the securities account being transferred. Each business day that the delivering member causes an adjustment to be made to an account will give the receiving member one additional business day after each adjustment to accept, to reject, or to request adjustments or in the case of mutual funds to submit transfer instructions. Currently, receiving member have two business days after each adjustment. Additionally, the proposed rule change deletes language that treats account transfers containing option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option positions. II. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F). 5 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that NSCC's rule change shortening the time period for transferring accounts should result in benefits to both customers and members by increasing efficiency in the transfer of accounts. NSCC's proposed rule change is made in conjunction with the NYSE's and the NASD's rule changes governing their members' transfers of customer accounts; therefore, the Commission believes the proposal fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance and settlement of securities transactions. In addition, reducing the time for account transfers is consistent with Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1 mandating a three business day settlement cycle effective June 1, 1995. 6 5 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F) (1988). 6 For a complete description of Rule 15c6&hyph;1, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (adopting Rule 15c6&hyph;1). III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;13) be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
