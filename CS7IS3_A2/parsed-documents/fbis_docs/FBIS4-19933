Even though the labor market remains "a big problem" with an average of 3.9 million unemployed this year, economic growth of 1.5 percent or even more in real terms all over Germany can now be assumed, Rexrodt told journalists on Friday [22 April]. Before the presentation of the spring report by the six leading economic research institutes, which is expected to take place next Tuesday, he said that this means a growth of at least 1 percent for the old laender and of 8 percent of the new laender. As a result, in the west an inflation rate with a "two in front of the decimal point" is within reach. There he expects an average of 3 percent, in the east 3.5 percent. Rexrodt sees his assessment of the end of January confirmed -- in particular since industry and the associations expressed far more optimistic at the Hannover Fair than a few weeks ago during the wage negotiations. [passage omitted] Of the 3.9 million unemployed, 2.67 million will be in the west and 1.2 million in the east. The companies' regained competitiveness "does not have any effect for the reduction of basic unemployment," Rexrodt admitted. However, together with the Bonn action program, the current signals of the economic development -- orders received, business expectations, as well as capacity utilization of industry (79 percent in view of a longstanding average of 85 percent), a strong construction sector, as well as first improvements in the steel and chemical industry -- provide prospects for employment in 1995. In the new laender, too, the economic development is considerably improving, not only in the construction sector but also regarding other investments. The Federal Government was harshly criticized by Social Democratic Party economic spokesman Oskar Lafontaine. Since the economic development is mainly based on exports, this shows that the Federal Government "is unable to bring about a real upswing for everyone." In order to avoid further weaknesses in consumption, he once again called for a supplementary tax on incomes of more than 60,000 German marks [DM] per year for singles and DM120,000 marks for couples. In his view, the purchasing power of the masses is not weakened -- in contrast to the effect of the solidarity surcharge -- because more than 80 percent of all taxpayers will be exempt.
