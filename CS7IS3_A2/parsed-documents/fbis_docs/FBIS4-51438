Beijing had a total area of 16,807 sq km, including 6,100 sq km of arable land, in 1952. But this dropped to 4,100 sq km of arable land in 1993. Now the city has an average of 393 sq m of arable land per capita, which is the lowest in China. The shrinking of arable land is due largely to construction, according to Chen Shudong, director of the Beijing Bureau of Land Administration. He said the amount of land used for construction has been increasing in recent years. Last year it was a record 40 sq km. The land resources of Beijing are not only worsening in quantity but also in quality. Despite the decrease of arable land, Beijing's annual grain consumption is around 5.20 million tons, half of which is transported in from other cities or provinces. Beijing has a population of 10,511,800, as well as a 1.5 million floating population. At a recent meeting, the standing committee of the tenth municipal people's congress has adopted regulations on protection of farmland in Beijing. The 30-article regulations stipulate the principles on classification of farmland, the compensation system for the land occupied by the state construction projects and legal duties in this field.
