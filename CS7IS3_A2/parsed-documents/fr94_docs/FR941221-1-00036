FR941221-1-00036 FR941221-1-00012 RSPA agrees with those commenters who suggested that discarded cultures and stocks, because of their concentration, pose a greater degree of risk than other medical waste and should be treated as infectious substances rather than RMW. Therefore, RSPA is proposing to exclude untreated waste cultures and stocks from the definition of RMW and subject them to the more rigorous packaging provisions applicable to infectious substances other than RMW. RSPA does not believe that this proposal will impose additional burdens on industry because, based on comments, these materials are largely treated on-site prior to disposal. RSPA received comments stating that contaminated laundry and other recyclable/reusable materials, such as used surgical instruments that are cleaned and sterilized off-site, should be handled in accordance with OSHA regulations. The OSHA regulations in 29 CFR 1910.1030 provide that contaminated laundry shall be placed and transported in bags or containers labeled or color-coded in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the OSHA regulations or, if utilizing universal precautions, alternative labeling is permitted if it is recognizable to all employees as requiring compliance with universal precautions. In addition, OSHA requires contaminated laundry that is wet and presents a reasonable likelihood of soak-through of or leakage from the bag or container to be placed in bags or containers which prevent soak-through and/or leakage of fluids to the exterior. One commenter stated that since these waste materials are not considered hazardous wastes under EPA regulations, they should not be RMW under DOT regulations. The American Type Culture Collection suggested that laundry and surgical instruments should only be regulated in transportation if they are known to be infectious. To relieve the burden of dual compliance with the HMR and OSHA regulations, RSPA is proposing to except contaminated laundry and other reusable materials from the HMR if they are handled in accordance with the OSHA requirements in 29 CFR 1910.1030. In the ANPRM, RSPA reopened the issue of regulating infectious substances affecting animals only. Several commenters objected to regulating substances ``infectious to animals only.'' Commenters suggested that RSPA include only those substances infectious to humans and those infectious to humans and animals (zoonotic), but not those infectious to animals only. Some commenters stated that the regulations of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture adequately covers substances infectious to animals. One commenter suggested that if RSPA defers to other regulations for these materials, the HMR should cross-reference those Federal regulations. Under the Federal hazardous material transportation law, RSPA must regulate the transportation of materials that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property. Animal pathogens may pose an unreasonable risk to animals. Furthermore, RSPA has examined the APHIS regulations contained in 9 CFR parts 1&hyph;199 and determined that they do not address transportation concerns with regard to communication of hazard, provision of emergency response information, and adequacy of packaging. Therefore, in this notice, RSPA is proposing to regulate Division 6.2 materials affecting animals only. Although the requirements that were scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1994, included ``animals'' in the definition of ``infectious substance,'' RSPA has delayed the compliance date for these materials until October 1, 1995. See Section II for more information concerning the extension of compliance dates. RSPA is requesting more comments on this issue. RSPA received several requests to clarify that the terms ``biological product'' and ``diagnostic specimen'' do not include materials that do not contain infectious substances. As previously stated, RSPA does not intend to regulate materials that do not pose a hazard in transportation. Therefore, for clarity, RSPA is proposing to revise the definitions of ``biological product'' and ``diagnostic specimen'' to include only those materials that contain an infectious substance. RSPA also would clarify that the terms ``biological product,'' ``diagnostic specimen,'' and ``regulated medical waste'' are all subcategories of Division 6.2 materials.
