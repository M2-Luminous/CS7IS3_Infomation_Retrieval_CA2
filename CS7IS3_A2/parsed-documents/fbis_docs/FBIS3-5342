In response to a question, he clarified that the United States will advice [chongyong] South Korea to repeal the NSL, even though it is a touchy issue. He added that the reason for such a U.S. demand is the possibility that the law might be abused. The final confirmation by the U.S. secretary of state came after the puppet Foreign Ministry's announcement that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard's comment was his own personal view, not a U.S. official position.
