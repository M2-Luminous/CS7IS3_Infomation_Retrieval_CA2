FR941222-0-00123 FR941222-0-00019 This notice extends the revised ICR formula and its benefits, including the reduced level of capitalization, to borrowers whose loans enter repayment in the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. This notice also reduces the level of capitalization of interest on loans repaid under the alternative repayment plan for borrowers whose loans enter repayment in the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. Finally, this notice establishes a 30-year maximum repayment period for the alternative repayment plan. The Secretary believes that it is desirable for all Direct Loan borrowers who choose the ICR plan to be subject to the same formula during the first years of this new program. As of this date, no Direct Loan borrowers have entered repayment under the ICR formula published on July 1, 1994, but some Direct Loan borrowers will enter income contingent repayment before the 1994&hyph;95 academic year is over. This notice provides that the revised ICR plan will apply to those borrowers. The Secretary believes that applying one formula to all borrowers allows the Secretary to publish materials that clearly explain the repayment options to borrowers without having to discuss multiple formulas. Furthermore, having a single formula during the initial years of this program simplifies the administration of the program for schools and promotes a clear understanding of the repayment provisions. II. Summary of Contents Section 685.208␣Repayment Plans The Secretary has established the maximum repayment period allowable under the alternative repayment plan at 30 years. Further, under the alternative plan, interest that accrues and is not paid will be capitalized annually until the outstanding principal is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. Section 685.209␣Income Contingent Repayment Plan The Secretary has significantly modified the income contingent repayment (ICR) plan provisions. The Secretary is lowering the limit on interest capitalization that may occur when interest accrues, but is not paid, from 50 percent greater than the original principal amount to 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. Also, monthly payments will be limited to 20 percent of discretionary income (AGI minus the poverty level appropriate to the family size). This change eliminates the need for the previous family size offset of $7 and provides a new cap on the amount of income assessed. The Secretary is including years of repayment under the 10-year standard repayment plan and the 12-year extended repayment plan as years eligible for determining the 25-year period for loan forgiveness. The monthly repayment amount below which no payment is required under the formula calculation is $15. Under the 12-year standard amortization cap, the minimum payment is $15 (that is, a borrower must pay at least $15 each month). The 12-year standard amortization cap calculation has been modified to provide for the recalculation of the cap following periods of negative amortization because these periods result in an increase in the outstanding loan balance. The payback rate for married borrowers paying jointly under ICR will be calculated on the outstanding debt at the time the borrowers are approved for joint repayment. For borrowers repaying jointly, payments will be applied to interest on both accounts prior to principal reduction in either. Section 685.209 (ICR plan) contains provisions governing the two monthly payment calculations, namely the formula amount and the capped amount, available for repayment of Direct Loans under the ICR plan. Borrowers may choose to repay either the formula amount or the capped amount. (See Appendix A for detailed examples illustrating, for single borrowers and for married borrowers who are repaying under the ICR plan, the calculations of the formula and capped monthly repayment amounts.) Formula Amount Calculation of the ICR formula monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (b) of this section. In general, the borrower's annual repayment obligation is the borrower's AGI multiplied by a ``payback rate'' that is based on the borrower's debt. The monthly payment is the annual repayment obligation divided by 12. The ``payback rate'' varies from four to 15 percent, calculated as described in paragraph (b)(2). The payment amount cannot exceed 20 percent of discretionary income (AGI minus the annual poverty level appropriate to the family size) divided by 12. If the calculated monthly payment is less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. When a borrower is not required to make a payment, interest on the principal accrues and will be capitalized until the limitation on capitalization is reached. Capped Amount Calculation of the capped monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (c), and equals the monthly amount the borrower would repay over 12 years using standard amortization schedules. If the formula amount exceeds the capped amount, the borrower may choose to pay the capped amount. If the borrower chooses to pay the capped amount, the borrower's repayment period may be longer than if the borrower chooses to pay the higher formula amount. Joint Repayment By Married Borrowers This section includes provisions for joint income contingent repayment of Direct Loans by married borrowers. Negative amortization is minimized by attributing joint repayments first to the interest due on each spouse's account and then to principal. A step-by-step calculation of a combined repayment amount is included as Example 2 in Appendix A. Repayment Period Provisions governing the repayment period under ICR are contained in paragraph (d)(2). The maximum period is 25 years, excluding periods of authorized deferment and forbearance under §§685.204 and 685.205, respectively, and periods in which the borrower made payments under a repayment plan other than the 10-year standard or 12-year extended plans. The Secretary believes the exclusion of repayment periods under all other extended and graduated plans is needed to prevent potential borrower repayment abuses.
