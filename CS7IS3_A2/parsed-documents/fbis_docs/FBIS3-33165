The Presidential Press Secretariat announced that Bustamante would be replaced by Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg. Bustamante, who had been appointed president of the Council of Ministers in August, tendered his resignation six days after the promulgation of a law that granted military courts jurisdiction over the "La Cantuta" case, an incident in which human rights were seriously violated and in which members of the Peruvian Armed Forces have been charged. The Presidential Palace communique indicated that new Prime Minister Goldenberg will assume his post this Thursday while continuing to hold his post as foreign minister. President Fujimori also accepted Education Minister Raul Victor Alfaro's resignation, who just two days ago denied any disagreement in the government regarding the La Cantuta case. The new education minister will be Jorge Reyes. [passage omitted]
