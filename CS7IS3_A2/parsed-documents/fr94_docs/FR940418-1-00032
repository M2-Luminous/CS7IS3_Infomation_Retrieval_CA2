ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the comment period for a proposed rule published on March 1, 1994 [59 FR 9808] which proposed to amend the regulations for hazardous waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by proposing to list as hazardous certain wastes from the production of carbamate chemicals. The original deadline for comments is being extended, and comments must now be submitted by May 16, 1994. The Agency recognizes that the docket for this proposed listing contains many technical documents. In addition, several members of the public have specifically requested additional time to submit comments to properly address areas of concern. In light of these circumstances, the Agency is extending the comment period on the proposed rule by two weeks. Because the Agency has committed to make its final listing determination for the wastes proposed in the notice of March 1, 1994 on or before January 31, 1995, this two week extension is the maximum that the Agency can reasonably grant. DATES: Comments for this proposed rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before May 16, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of the final rule.
