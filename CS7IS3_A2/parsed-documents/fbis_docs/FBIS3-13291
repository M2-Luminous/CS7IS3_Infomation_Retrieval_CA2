The king was not satisfied with this, so he decided -- as he stressed in his address to the deputies recently -- to return democracy to the country. Within a few years, democratic institutions were set up, the National Charter was adopted by the influential political forces in Jordan, democratic laws were enacted, martial laws were abolished, and public liberties were launched. All this was accompanied by intensive royal calls for safeguarding the human rights of the Jordanians as a prelude to setting up a Jordanian democratic example in the entire Arab region. The objective of King Husayn is -- as he himself reiterated in his address to the most important democratic institution in the country, the Parliament -- to make the Jordanians in particular, and the Arabs in general, feel that they are no less great than the other free peoples of the world. It would be fair to say that the citizens in Jordan have enjoyed an atmosphere of openness, frankness, and freedom the likes of which do not exist in the entire Arab region. However, we also must be fair and say that some officials are still incapable of democratizing their mind, behavior, and way of practicing their powers. We are now witnessing a kind of retreat on the issue of human rights in Jordan. Deputies, writers, and officials have admitted that the whole democratization process will be endangered if the decisionmakers do not take the initiative and adopt immediate measures to safeguard the king's decision, to save it from the tampering of those who are committing undemocratic violations, whether with good or bad intentions. We, as journalists, are aware of the long list of these violations. The masses, who know some of these violations, sometimes file complaints, while other times leaving the matter to God. The strange thing is that most of the violations of human rights in Jordan are committed in the name of the law under the pretext of maintaining security. In other words, the citizen's security is undermined and his dignity is rubbed in the dirt to maintain security, as happened a few days ago in al-Baq'ah Camp, where innocent citizens were forced to lay down on the ground and were insulted and treated badly. When the deputies of the Islamic Action Front [IAF] brought the matter to the prime minister, in his capacity the head of the executive branch, he said that this incident is an individual and separate one, expressed his regret at such incidents, and promised to follow it up. In another incident, Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Dayyah, secretary of the IAF branch in Suwaylih, was arrested under strange circumstances. The people who carried out the arrests presented a memorandum signed by the public prosecutor but with no names in it. When Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah, who was present during the arrest, expressed his astonishment at such behavior, the person in charge of the arrest filled in the form in front of the deputy. In another incident, a youth was arrested because he was carrying leaflets issued by the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a legal group as we know, and was placed in custody with suspects in immoral cases and criminals. This youth was released after spending a terrible night with those people, who insulted him. And the list of such examples is long. Certain citizens are still banned from employment in accordance with the instructions of the security forces. We also still hear about the confiscation of passports, unfounded arrests, investigations, and other practices that prevailed under the martial law. Such incidents -- even if they are few compared with what took place under the martial law -- should sound the alarm. The royal decision is very clear, and the executive and judicial branches are charged by the king's designation letter to carry out all of the king's instructions. If these branches are incapable of carrying out these instructions, then they must step down immediately and resign because they are not faithful to the interests of the people and are incapable of carrying out the leadership's decisions. And if they do not want to carry out the king's instructions, this is even more serious because they will be declaring their rebellion and mutiny, God forbid. This has never occurred in the history of Jordan. Our contemporary history has never registered a government that refused to implement the throne's instructions. The citizens seek to entrench free democratic life and to live under laws that ensure fair trials for suspects. However, the citizens are now living in a state of confusion and anxiety. This state can only end if we remove the gap between the desires and instructions of King Husayn on one hand and the practices of the executive branch on the other. If laws are not implemented in a legal way our democratic march will be threatened. No honest citizen will call for freeing criminals from the penalty stipulated by law, but the trials of those people must be fair and their arrests must be under humane circumstances. King Husayn does not accept fabricated accusations or that injustice and insults can be practiced against his people.
