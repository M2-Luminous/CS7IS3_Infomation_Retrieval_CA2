The death of the former prime minister, who almost personified the LDP's best days, seems to symbolize the LDP's decline and the current transitional stage. Shigeru Ishiba, who was present at the plenary session on 15 December to vote for extending the Diet session in defiance of the LDP decision, said: "I decided to leave the party because I thought I would have to be responsible for bringing about political reform." Masamitsu Oishi revealed his inner thoughts at a news conference this way: "I had never imagined until yesterday that what happened today could actually take place." Takashi Sasagawa said: "I have a very pleasant feeling." It is said that phone calls of encouragement from supporters poured in to the office of former LDP General Council Chairman Takeo Nishioka, who took action similar to that of the aforementioned trio and quit the party on 17 December. The foursome are considering forming a new group with independent members of the House of Representatives who previously leapt out of the LDP. Even Noriaki Watase, who was absent from the plenary session as directed by the party, resolutely said: "Political realignment is at the threshold, and there will be plenty of chances to put my life on the line." A certain businessman was reported to have personally censured LDP President Yohei Kono face to face regarding its harassing tactics against the Hosokawa cabinet on the rice problem, asking: "What has become of the LDP?" Is the predicament not the same as that of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which repeatedly resorted to such tactics as boycotting deliberations and ox-walks during its days as an opposition party? Where has the determination of the LDP, which had professed that it would become a responsible opposition party, gone? That sort of sense of despair is spreading in economic circles. Liabilities From the Days of LDP-Controlled Government "Mr. Hosokawa is an amateur, and it is about time for him to give up." "The time has come for professionals to work out emergency economic measures. The LDP has to go out to take charge." These are the recent words of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Political reform, rice problems, and sluggish business conditions are liabilities left over from the days of the LDP-led governments. The majority of people are undoubtedly aware of this fact, and say that such posturing is too indulgent on the part of the LDP. For the time being, the LDP is determined to refuse to respond to deliberations on political reform bills at the House of Councillors, in opposition to the extension of the Diet session. Should such a situation continue, however, there is a strong possibility that the public desertion from the LDP will accelerate. Not only will the LDP face a predicament, but cracks in the SDPJ position will further widen. SDPJ Diet members opposing electoral reform, a crucial element of political reform, were conspicuous in demanding their party's secession from the coalition regime by adamantly opposing opening markets when problems concerning the rice issue arose. They seemed to have intended to kill the political reform bills by using the rice problem as leverage. Against this background, reform-minded young Diet members were reported to have seriously debated leaving the SDPJ if it ever broke away from the coalition. One such young Diet member said: "Because of the complications involving rice, it became clear to me that I can no longer stay with the SDPJ. If a chance ever arises, I will leave the party." About the party convention the SDPJ is to hold on 11 and 12 January, a rumor similar to the following has been circulating: "At the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama will retire, and for that position, Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi is expected to be recommended." It seems most unlikely that Mr. Yokoyama will want to go along with the proposal, since he is said to be attempting to organize a new political party. Such a rumor reflects the fact that Murayama and his executives have lost their unifying force. Recovery of Reliance Sought by Materializing Reform By deciding to extend its session for 45 days until 29 January, calm temporarily returned to the Diet, where the matter of opening markets to rice imports and whether or not to extend the session were simultaneously discussed. With the extension of the Diet session, the LDP and the SDPJ both survived fears that they would disintegrate during the past year. But this amounts to nothing more than putting off finding solutions to problems to a later day. Cracks spreading in the positions of both parties are likely to bring about splitting the parties in connection with whether or not to adopt political reform bills to be voted on at the end of January. Komeito's Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa said: "After many twists and turns, the bills will be passed after all." Against the LDP's heightened insistence on emphasizing measures to deal with business conditions, Shinseito's chief secretary Ichiro Ozawa noted that he thinks early realization of political reform is indispensable to overcoming recession, saying: "It is like putting the cart before the horse to say the recession problem must be settled prior to political reform." At an "emergency general meeting with both coalition and opposition Diet members" held on 14 December by a private ad hoc commission on administrative reform, a young Diet member said: "As a precondition for implementing policies that will be accompanied by sufferings of the people, it is necessary to gain popular support. For that purpose, the materialization of political reform is a duty of Diet members." On 16 December, the day after the decision to extend the Diet session was reached, the average stock price of the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose from the previous day by 300 yen. This seems to indicate market expectation of political stability. There is no guarantee, however, of a smooth deliberation at the House of Councillors, which is said "to maintain intact the 1955 order." Different from the House of Representatives, the upper house is controlled by both the LDP and the SDPJ, and quite a few SDPJ members oppose the bills currently being proposed. Frontal Breakthrough Eyed in Accordance With Article 59 Close associates of Mr. Ozawa said: "All means imaginable are being prepared to cope with all kinds of situations in the upper house." One is a frontal breakthrough, in accordance with Article 59 of the Constitution, which says that a failure of the House of Councillors to take final action within sixty days after receipt of a bill passed by the House of Representatives "may be determined by the House of Representatives to constitute a rejection of the said bill by the House of Councillors." In that case, the bill can become law by passing it a second time in the lower house by a two-thirds majority or more of the members present or by calling for a joint committee meeting comprising both Houses. Although it is difficult to obtain a two-thirds majority in the lower house, the possibility of a bill being passed will be high if the bill is referred to a joint committee of both Houses, because it can then become law by obtaining a simple majority of both Houses. Since the political reform bills passed through the lower house on 18 November, the 60th day falls on 16 January. On and after the next day, 17 January, such "surprise moves" can be used. The magic of this move is to refer the bill to the lower house for a second deliberation. It is based on the calculation that once the bill is returned to the lower house, the House can be easily dissolved when the bill is threatened to be shelved, although it is difficult to dissolve the lower house on grounds that the upper house is delaying the deliberation. But actions relying on Article 59 may invite criticism that "the House of Councillors are robbed of the right to deliberate on bills, thus neglecting the upper house." In the postwar history of the Diet, only one precedent can be found, in 1952, when the wage bill for Maritime Safety Agency employees was passed by a joint committee of both Houses. The coalition ruling parties are considering these plans because they want to expedite upper house deliberations by threatening that they may take such firm actions. Simultaneous secret maneuvers to undermine the solidarity of the upper house LDP members are underway. Those close to Mr. Ozawa are confident that "the LDP members of the House of Councillors will incline toward the ruling parties if the Hosokawa regime maintains high support ratings and increases its stability, because many of the LDP members are former bureaucrats." Former Minister of Labor Masakuni Murakami, a LDP member of the House of Councillors, pointed out that the upper house deliberation may be difficult for the time being because the Diet session was extended high-handedly. He added: "It must not maintain inertial continuation of the 1955 order." "Since the upper house is intended to control as well as compliment the lower one, ways may be found to amend the bills." As for amendments, it is suggested that the distribution of seats in both single-member election districts and proportional representation districts be reviewed and that proportional districts from the national district be changed to several blocks. Problems Converge Again at the End of January The Hosokawa regime plans to launch measures to boost economic conditions by large-scale tax cuts and the third supplementary budget bill, simultaneously expediting deliberation of the bills. On the other hand, it embraces the problem of raising consumption tax rates as possible sources of revenue to fill the gap created by tax cuts. The SDPJ strongly opposes the consumption tax raise. Therefore, it intends to put off the formation of next year's budget bill until next year in order not to be entangled with deliberations on political reform. "The Hosokawa regime is on the brink of falling, without chance of recovery, because it is obsessed with three falsehoods." The LDP's former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Junichiro Koizumi points out that the present regime will reach an impasse after all because of the three difficulties: the partial opening of the market to rice imports; failure to legislate political reform bills before the year end; and the 100 million-yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin to the prime minister himself. The LDP currently clings to a hope of regaining power, which remains nothing more than a wish. However, Prime Minister Hosokawa cannot evade taking responsibility if the bills fail to pass, because the Diet session was extended on grounds of materializing political reform. It is unmistakably clear that the political situation will become tense in late January, when a number of problems converge at a time when deliberation of the bills reaches a climax.
