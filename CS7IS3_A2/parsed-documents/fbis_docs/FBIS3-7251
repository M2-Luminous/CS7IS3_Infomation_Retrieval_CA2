After castigating countries in Asia and other regions for their suppression of political freedom and dissent, Washington is now prodding the rest of the world to crack down on sexual abuses of women and children. The latest US campaign mounted by Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck should touch some raw nerves here in Thailand. This is not so much because Thailand is placed on Washington's list of violators where 800,000 young people are allegedly subject to sexual abuses -- a figure already disputed by Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa as grossly exaggerated. Rather, the targetting of attack on the under-aged flesh trade touches on a sensitive issue known to be close to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's heart. It may be recalled that the elimination of "rampant" child prostitution was one of the cornerstones of the Government's social-policy platform. But although this policy objective was personally advocated by the prime minister, the Government appears to have achieved little tangible progress after having served 18 months. An initial series of police blitz on brothels catering children for sex was said to have resulted in some temporary improvement but industry experts say child prostitution in general has since resumed by taking on new guises. In the meantime, new legislation promising tough penalties on procurers and clients has been slowcoming. So at the very least, Washington's new campaign should serve to re-focus the Thai Government's attention and efforts to tackle this pervasive social problem once again. After all, it is hardly an enviable position for this country to be placed on top of the list of violators -- India, Taiwan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka are also accused as the less severe offenders -- and this piece of uncharitable news has been broadcast around the world. Scathing accusations by American rights groups and legislators on the alleged complicity of Thai officials in the increasing smuggling of Burmese and Chinese women to serve the flesh trade here should, hopefully, also prompt some corrective government action. While it is unfair to make generalised accusations against the integrity of the Thai police force, corrupt police elements extracting gains from illegal gambling dens and brothels around the country are a well-known systemic trend. Likewise, the wholesale smuggling of females from across the northern borders would not have been possible without the collaboration of corrupt officials stationed there. In retrospect, it is unfortunate and unnecessary that government actions to deal with these glaring social ills should have to be prompted by foreign pressures like the sort now emanating from Washington. Child prostitution and the smuggling of Burmese and Chinese women here are very much Thailand's domestic problems that must be dealt with by our own authorities without other countries having to tell us what to do or what not to do. From Thailand's national standpoint, this also raises the larger question of how far this country -- or, for that matter, the other Asian countries targetted for the same fault -- should tolerate foreign pressures like the Shattuck campaign. First it was several years of threatened sanctions under Section 301 of the US Trade Act over allegedly inadequate property rights protection. Then there were more threats over alleged child labour abuses and the ban on state-enterprise labour unions here. After the current attack on under-aged prostitution, what will Washington come up with next? When do we -- Thailand and other Asian countries which have all along been on the receiving end of these pressures -- begin to fight back? Whereas governments in the region have the moral and political obligation to rid their societies of sexual abuses on women and children, it is also time they stand up to question Washington's right and legitimacy to set human-rights standards for the rest of the world. Should the average Americans be entitled to their basic rights to have decent housing and food through employment -- something of which a large section of its populace has been deprived owing to years of economic policy mismanagement? Or should the average New Yorkers be entitled to the rights to walk around safely in their city which is notorious for being plagued with one of the highest crime rates in the world? The self-appointed world champion of human rights should clean up its own house before telling others what to do.
