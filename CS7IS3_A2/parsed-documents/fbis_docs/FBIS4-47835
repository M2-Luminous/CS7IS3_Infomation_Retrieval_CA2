The commission said it was disturbing that the commissioner of police had issued an export permit for the weapons without realizing the sensitivity of the matter. The commission found that the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to the KwaZulu Police had not been authorized by the management of Eskom, but that the sale had been arranged without authority by an employee of the company. The commission said it was satisfied that the National Intelligence Service had had nothing to do with the transaction.
