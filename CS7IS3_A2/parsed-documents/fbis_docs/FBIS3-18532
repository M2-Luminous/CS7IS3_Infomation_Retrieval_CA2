The U.S. GDP is growing at the rate of 3 percent per year, but in the last quarter of 1993 the rate of increase rose to 7.50 percent -- a record for at least the past 10 years. Exports, investments, and consumer spending, especially of cars and durable goods, are rising; and moreover the real estate sector -- which is the driving force behind the entire American economy -- has made a dramatic recovery, with a growth of 31 percent in the last quarter of the year. In other words, there is a boom reminiscent of the Reagan era, but achieved by means of an economic policy that is the exact opposite of Reagan's. This fact deserves to be pondered by the grandsons of the old cowboy who became U.S. President, rewarded the prosperous America, and bequeathed to the world the longest and toughest recession ever since the great crisis of 1929. As we said, the U.S. economic recovery is a tonic to the entire world: The dollar is rising, and so too is the tendency of American consumers to purchase foreign products, to invest abroad, and to travel abroad. In this way the market mechanisms gradually tend to distribute wealth also to countries distant from the stimulus center; and thus the U.S. locomotive is starting to pull along the cars of the long and varied international train. But this positive process is by no means automatic, much less universal. Some of the cars have had their brakes applied or are applying them, others are falling apart, and still others are actually out of service, lying abandoned on sidings which they are very likely incapable of leaving in order to join the train of recovery. All the Third World countries, including the once flourishing oil producers, lie abandoned on these sidings. Their bargaining power is now a distant memory, the rise of the dollar is proportionate to the fall in the price of crude; the Gulf War sealed the demise of the cartel of great Arab oil producers. Nevertheless, this is the Third World's special area. In other very extensive areas -- the Maghreb, Black Africa, a large part of India and Southeast Asia, and almost the whole of Latin America -- the wind of recovery is not felt even as a light breeze. The cloak of poverty, hunger, and starvation is combined with very high birth rates and is driving increasing masses of poor toward the wealthy metropolises. There no cars rejoin powerful locomotives; there is only despair and subhumanity; the market is a meaningless word, and hope is only a chimera. Among the stationary cars, which will get going again sooner or later and perhaps return to being locomotives themselves, the two most deserving of attention are Japan and Germany. A thorough examination of them would be beyond the scope of these observations, and has in any case been carried out several times in this paper. However, there is one important factor in part shared by these two major economic powers that explains their present crisis: In both the mechanism of accumulation has broken down. So this is no mere passing crisis but something different, more profound, more structural. In Japan what has broken down is the model of development in which enterprises constituted not only the locomotive of production but also the social and cultural locomotive. There has been a breakdown in entrepreneurial monolithism, monoculture, the Japanization of Japan (if I may be permitted to use the term). The picture of workers arriving at the factory singing the national anthem and performing martial gymnastics is now a memory; another distant memory is the submissiveness of the trade unions, and yet another is the close associations of the industrial groups, both among themselves and with the major banking groups. In other words, Japanese capitalism is becoming Americanized, nor could it have been otherwise; but it is thus losing part of its influence, while its accumulation mechanism is growing weaker. Japanese protectionism still stands, but American pressure is becoming increasingly vigorous, and sooner or later some breaches will be opened. Meanwhile, the Japanese power is marking time and watching the reawakening of the Chinese giant with an interest not without apprehension. At the start of the third millennium, this part of the planet will witness events that we cannot now even imagine. To talk about Germany entails talking about Europe, that is, about home. Here, too, development has broken down as a result not only of short-term causes but also of structural causes. There are three such causes: Germany has found its own developing area in the east Laender, and the encounter has been traumatic at times; the government has been either unwilling or unable to meet the costs of unification by physically drawing revenue from a share of the income of the west Laender and the more prosperous classes; the power of the banks has compensated for this by keeping real interest rates high. These three social and political factors have combined with the world recession that has penalized German exports and caused internal liquidity to increase. In order to absorb it, or at least to contain it, the Bundesbank is again turning toward a more restrictive credit policy, after some, albeit timid, signs of recovery in recent months. All this is coinciding with the very recent rise in American interest rates. The immediate effect has been apparent in the past few days in all the world's financial markets: Shares are falling, yield from bonds is rising, and savers are again preferring short-term rather than long-term investments, thus worsening the conditions on which governments can secure credit from the capital market. The American recovery is a good thing for everyone, as I said at the beginning. Nevertheless, there are some countries which, for various reasons, are slow to join that locomotive. However, in order to preserve its recovery without feeding inflation, the United States is raising the cost of money, with a domino effect. Those lagging behind do not yet enjoy the benefits of the economic situation but immediately feel the pinch of more expensive money. In this quandary, within this pincer, so to speak, some problems are also being experienced with the lira exchange rate, the prices of government stock, and the cost of the public debt. For the present these are not real phenomena but, rather, expectations: Italian savers expect that the yield on their bonds will rise and that the cost of the public debt again will rise after a long period of decline. Hence the weakness of foreign exchange and of 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year treasury bonds. There is no cause for excessive alarm; these are at present smoke signals, and no more; the pre-electoral situation is exaggerating their extent. The promise to reduce fiscal pressure, for instance, comes at a most inopportune time, as is amply demonstrated by our foregoing analysis. For that matter, the governor of the Bank of Italy, with the authority that he enjoys by virtue of that position, reached the same conclusions just the other day. It is true that [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi immediately accused him of being a conservative. What a reversal: Now the leader of the conservatives is labeling himself a progressive compared to someone who deems his promise of tax reductions demagogic! Of course, the burden of taxation could be reduced somewhat if spending were to be further contained and the deficit were to be confined to the projected 144 trillion lire. However, this presupposes that the cost of the public debt will not rise again. Will this happen? The recent events that we have recalled raise serious doubts in this regard. As though this were not enough, the right's economic program envisages various production incentives (in the automobile and housing sectors) and larger spending allocations for several ministries, starting with Justice and Defense. Last, we learned yesterday that the entire center-right bloc is in favor of the proposal made by the pope and [President] Scalfaro for major state subsidies for private -- that is, Catholic -- schools. To sum up: Greater expenditure, lower taxation, a presumable increase in the cost of the public debt; if this is the economic program of the right, the sole possible consequence is an increase in the deficit, further increasing the debt. In fact what lies behind this program is simply a renewed rise in inflation, a result greatly desired by all those who have major debts with the banks, but greatly feared by all citizens who have loaned the state part of their savings. These home-grown proponents of economic deregulation hate the state, but want to continue using it as a cash cow whenever their own vested interests are at stake. Now they even want it to subsidize church schools. But did they not say, "less state, more market?" Does this watchword not apply to education? As for tax pressure, it will remain the same, but the distribution of its burden on the various sectors will change. We already know that the program of the "pole for freedoms" includes the abolition of the minimum tax and 30 percent income tax for all. Yesterday we published a very eloquent table that highlights the effects of this proposed reform: Those earning up to 80 million lire a year will pay more, and those earning more than 100 million lire a year will pay less. Gentlemen, you could not have been clearer. Long live freedom, don Giovanni sings. His own freedom, that is, of course; already owning a fortune in Spain, he evidently wants much more.
