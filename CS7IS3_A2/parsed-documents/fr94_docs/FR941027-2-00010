FR941027-2-00010 FR941027-2-00008 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The ATP is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an element of the Technology Administration (TA) of the Department of Commerce. ATP was established by section 5131 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;418, 15 U.S.C. 278n), as modified by Public Law 102&hyph;245. The ATP works with U.S. industry to advance the nation's competitiveness_and economy_by helping to fund the development of high-risk but powerful new technologies that underlie a broad spectrum of potential new applications, commercial products, and services. Through cooperative agreements with individual companies or groups of companies, large and small, the ATP invests in industrial projects to develop technologies with high-payoff potential for the nation. The ATP accelerates technologies that_because they are risky_are unlikely to be developed in time to compete in rapidly changing world markets without such a partnership of industry and government. By sharing the cost of such projects, the ATP catalyzes industry to pursue promising technologies. The Proposal Preparation Kit expands on the goals of the ATP and describes in detail what constitutes a good ATP proposal. The ATP operates under program procedures published at part 295, title 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. These procedures were updated (59 FR, page 663, January 6, 1994). A copy of the updated version of these procedures is provided in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit. Cooperative research agreements rather than grants are the funding instruments used for ATP awards. A cooperative research agreement differs from a grant with respect to the amount of interaction between the Federal Government and the recipient, and is used to provide financial assistance when substantial involvement is anticipated between the government and the recipient. Invitation for Proposals The ATP CBD notices to be published later will invite applications for funding from: (1) Individual United States businesses in amounts not to exceed $2 million (federal share) over three years. Single applicants must fund all indirect costs associated with the project. (2) Industry-led joint research and development ventures, where ATP support will serve as a catalyst for the proposed joint venture project, and provided, however, that the ATP share is a minority share of the cost of the venture for up to five years. Applicant eligibility is discussed in detail in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit. All awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. Future or continued funding for multi-year projects will be at the discretion of NIST and will be contingent on such factors as satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. Abbreviated Proposals ATP reserves the right to use abbreviated proposal for any general or program competition. Information regarding the use of abbreviated proposals will be included in the CBD announcement of that specific competition. The purpose of abbreviated proposals is to provide applicants with limited resources early feedback regarding whether the proposed project falls within the scope of the ATP and whether the project proposed appears sufficiently promising relative to the selection criteria to warrant preparation of a full proposal. In competitions where abbreviated proposals are accepted, applicants who submit such proposals will be notified in writing whether or not ATP recommends submission of a full proposal. ATP may provide feedback to proposers in one of the following three ways: (1) (Used for abbreviated proposals only); A written transmittal giving a yes/no recommendation regarding preparation of a full proposal; (2) A checklist noting concerns regarding the proposal or abbreviated proposal. This transmittal may be accompanied by a statement summarizing common shortcomings noted in the proposals submitted to that competition; (3) An oral debriefing by telephone summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal. Which of these feedback mechanisms is used will depend on the competition and may depend on the number of proposals received. Proprietary information is abbreviated and full proposals will be protected. If your proposal contains proprietary information, mark it accordingly; however, the title page must not include proprietary information. We recommend including the following legend on the title page: ``Proposal contains proprietary information. Title page nonproprietary.'' Full proposals must be prepared in accordance with the instructions in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit. In competitions involving abbreviated proposals, heed the general advice provided in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, but follow the specific instructions announced in the specific CBD announcements. Funds Available for Cooperative Research Agreements An estimated $20 to $25 million in first-year funding will be available for General Competition 95&hyph;01. The number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the amount of funding requested by the proposals under consideration for awards. Based on ATP's experience the number of awards is unlikely to exceed 30. An estimated $100 to $125 million in first-year funding will be available for the several program competition to be announced. For every ATP competition, NIST reserves the right to fund proposals totalling more or less than the amount of funding tentatively allocated to that competition if the number of high quality proposals received is judged to be greater or fewer respectively than anticipated. Preparation of Full Proposal and Reporting Requirements The ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, available from the ATP, contains background material on the ATP, detailed contents and formatting guidelines for the preparation of full proposals, and the required forms. Also included is information of reporting and audit requirements for recipients. To be accepted for review, full proposals must meet all of the requirements outlined in the Kit. Full proposals that fail to meet one or more of those requirements will be considered non-responsive to the solicitation.
