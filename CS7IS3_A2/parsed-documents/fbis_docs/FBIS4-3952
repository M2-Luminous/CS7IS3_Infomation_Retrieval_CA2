The mysterious arms deal began in 1991 when Iran transferred the money to a Midland Bank in London to the Taiwan Changhua Commercial Bank [sentence as heard]. Iran had wanted to buy bullets and other like ammunition from Taiwan's arms dealers for use in its eight-year war against Iraq, which ended with a cease fire in August 1988. But the Taipei government later turned down the sale. (Aduba Hatami) and (Motosher Fatayi) told the Taiwan High Court they came to Taiwan in 1981 with another defense ministry official but the Taiwan bank rejected their demand for the money. The bank said that the money already had been withdrawn by three men presenting passports bearing the names of the Iranian officials listed by the Midland Bank as the recipients. Iran's Defense Ministry filed a lawsuit in the Taipei District Court to reclaim the amount. The Changhua Bank argued that its clients had been the Midland Bank, not the Iranian Government. The local high court did not say when it would deliver its final verdict.
