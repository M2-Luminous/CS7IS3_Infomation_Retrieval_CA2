Quite the opposite, many analysts admit the danger for armed conflicts has become greater," Russian Federation Security Council Chief Secretary Oleg Lobov said upon his arrival at the Sofia Airport. Mr. Lobov is heading a Russian Government delegation on an official visit to this country. The delegation also includes the Russian Federation deputy ministers of economy, foreign-trade affairs, defence and finance, senior officials of the military-industrial complex and businessmen. "While the danger for a nuclear war might be more distant now, we see local conventional wars breaking out just beyond the Russian and Bulgarian borders," the Russian guest also said. "We should therefore seek to stabilize the bilateral relations in the name of a greater world security," he also said. "We hope that Bulgaria and Russia will further promote their bilateral contacts, and not only those in the economy but in culture and tourism as well," Mr. Lobov said commenting on the results the visit is expected to bring. This visit is aimed, among other things, at restoring the broken contacts between the two countries, the head of the Russian delegation said. He further specified that apart from the contacts on government level, the visit will focus on the direct ties between Bulgaria and the different administrative units and autonomous republics within the federation. The sides will also discuss the military and technical cooperation which is of particular importance for both countries, Mr. Lobov said.
