Otherwise, 4,000 jobs will be lost, Werner Heinzmann, member of the Dasa Executive Committee and chairman of the company branches space flight, defense, and civilian systems, told journalists in Bonn. Dasa is trying to put the entire field of guided weapons into Euromissile -- a joint subsidiary with the French Aerospatiale. The seat is to be in France. Heinzmann reported "very positive signals" from the Federal Government, which is to facilitate armament cooperation projects in line with the so-called Schmidt-Debre Agreement in the next few weeks. This agreement refers to government cooperation projects and says one partner country must inform the other but the partner country does not have the right to veto the export intentions of the other partner. According to Heinzmann, France has been able to export the Milan and Roland weapons systems to areas, which would have been taboo for German companies because of the tighter export control. The Dasa Executive Committee demands from the Federal Government that this agreement should not just apply to government cooperation projects but also for industrial cooperation. The FRG Economics Ministry has confirmed that corresponding talks are taking place, but no details were revealed. According to Heinzmann, the joint subsidiary Euromissile would have a turnover of about 3 billion German marks [DM], to which Dasa contributes about DM1 billion. Heinzmann justified the French interest in cooperation by pointing to the fact that the German market continues to be interesting and that the Germans have complementary skills, which are indispensable for the French. According to Heinzmann, pure program cooperation is no longer sufficient, since the capacities have become undercriticial in many fields because of drastic cutbacks in the defense budgets, Heinzman said. Preservation is possible only in "full-step" European companies with a bundling of the resources and mutual dependence and supplies (single-sourcing). Heinzmann: "Basic military business can survive only in European companies in the future." Nevertheless, there remains defending the central business of Dasa. For this purpose, however, the company needs planning security provided by the Federal Government. According to Heinzmann, basic military business is the precondition for growth in civilian markets. Heinzmann announced "considerable efforts" to develop new civilian business and to expand existing markets. Here he cited in particular communications and information technology, environmental technology, and satellite-based navigation systems. Turnover in the civilian sector should rise from about DM700 million to up to DM2.5 billion. Since 1990 Dasa has created about 1,300 new jobs in the civilian area and it plans to create another 1,500 new jobs there by 1998, Heinzmann said. Dasa will leave research and development investments at the former high level of DM1.5 billion in five years to finance entering new fields of growth. Heinzmann warned Bonn against ending activities in manned space flight.
