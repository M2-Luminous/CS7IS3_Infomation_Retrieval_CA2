It would be in Latvia's interests to accept this system, because it would stimulate foreign trade and access to investment, chiefly in such fields as electronics, computer systems, and high technology, says a press statement from the Latvian Foreign Ministry. The member states of the Cocom have changed their strategy of activity, to promote the recovery of the market of the former communist countries, at the same time maintaining control over the investigation... [pauses] the spread of weapons, strategic materials, and technology. The situation since the end of the Cold War has changed; that is why the creation of a new organization is planned.
