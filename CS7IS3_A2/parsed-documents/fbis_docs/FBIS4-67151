FBIS4-67151 "jptdd021__l94004" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 12 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA ARGENTINA New Security `Supersecretariat' Plans Cause `Bewilderment' New Security `Supersecretariat' Plans Cause `Bewilderment' PY1305031994 Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish 12 May 94 pp 2-3 PY1305031994 Buenos Aires CLARIN Spanish BFN [Text] With a decision that caught most government officials by surprise, President Carlos Menem yesterday decided to group the Federal Police, the Coast Guard, and the Border Police, that is, the entire state security apparatus, under a future Secretariat for State Security [Secretaria de Seguridad del Estado]. Menem chose Julian Licastro, a retired Army lieutenant with a long career within the Peronist party, to head this supersecretariat (it might also include management of the Secretariat for State Intelligence, SIDE). In designing the new secretariat's structure Menem did not seem to realize some details: The future secretariat undermines the powers of the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. When the news had already spread outside the presidential office, the government was forced to issue a press communique in an attempt to calm the internal discussion prompted by the proposal. Some government officials attributed this initiative to [Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo's team. One of Cavallo's team members even told CLARIN that on 8 May Licastro met the economy minister. In an attempt to explain Cavallo's alleged meddling in this issue, the source noted: "The management of the about $2.6 billion that is spent on security is involved." The official communique was issued late after the reports had already astonished SIDE, Defense Ministry, and Interior Ministry officials. SIDE, the Defense Ministry, and the Interior Ministry had been dealing with pieces of rumors, prompting an atmosphere of bewilderment and irritation. This atmosphere spread to the security forces involved. To soothe the irritation, but raising more questions, the press communique's first paragraph notes: "As it is necessary to achieve an effective coordination among the various security forces involved in the protection of public property and in the struggle against crime and drug trafficking, the president of the nation has given instructions to the interior and defense ministers to study the formation of a State Secretariat for Interior Security [Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad Interior]." Social Violence Nevertheless, the communique did not manage to clear other doubts: Would the Drug Enforcement Secretariat, headed by Alberto Lestelle, also be included in the same package? Will SIDE, as had initially been indicated, be included or not? Will this be the organization to command the Rapid Deployment Units that are being planned to repress social disorders that overwhelm the provincial police? It seemed that no one at Government House last night had any response to these issues. The official communique's belated caution, with announcements such as "to study the formation of" or "to plan the new organization's operational structure," was prompted after those who have the structure established by the Interior Security Law at their fingertips went to the Government House to caution about the legal and political challenges that will undoubtedly be raised by various circles, including the security forces themselves. This issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting at the Olivos presidential residence. Menem's proposal seeks to group military units, intelligence activities, and drug enforcement forces under a single head. This disagrees with the spirit and provisions of a law agreed upon between Peronists and Radicals, who also make up a Bicameral Monitoring Committee that was also not consulted before taking this step. Nevertheless, an official involved in drawing up legal standards and decrees guaranteed to CLARIN that a presidential decree alone would be required to establish the new secretariat. This official, however, emphasized that such a presidential decree has not yet been drawn up, and that Licastro has not yet been appointed as secretary. The source actually noted that in order to establish a secretariat of such characteristics, the Interior Undersecretariat headed by Hugo Franco would be dissolved and at least the status of SIDE would be changed.
