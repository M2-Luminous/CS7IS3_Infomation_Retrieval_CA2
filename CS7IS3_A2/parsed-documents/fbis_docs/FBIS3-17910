It was devoted to the results of the first stage of voting in elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council. Petro Symonenko stated that in Ukraine "great interest in the leftist forces is noticeable right now. The stance of our candidates made an impression on our voters." Petro Symonenko is certain that the Communists will come out as victors in the second round of voting too. Answering the question of a UNIAN correspondent about how the CPU is planning to deal with party property that has not been returned to them, the party secretary replied: "Commercial structures have been given 60 percent of party property. Primarily, we would like to ask on what grounds the property was handed over to them and not to the ownership of the people. If these structures are speculative ones, then let them return the property, which belongs to the party, and then the party will decide where to direct the funds." Petro Symonenko reported that should the Communists obtain a party majority in the Supreme Council, they will be raising the issue of calling off presidential elections in Ukraine. As far as work in the new Supreme Council is concerned, the secretary of the CPU Central Committee stated: "We need to find a compromise with the opposing forces that will be in the future Supreme Council so as not to conduct a political struggle over a certain period of time. In the first place we need to resolve the economic problems, and only then the political ones."
