A ministry source said that relations between the ROC and Lesotho ran into difficulties last April, when Lesotho's new administration enthusiastically sought to establish close ties with Beijing. The Foreign Affairs Ministry is still trying to safeguard the existing relationship, according to the source, who said the ROC Embassy in Lesotho is still in operation. He said the reported diplomatic breakup could be confirmed after the end of New Year's celebrations in the African country.
