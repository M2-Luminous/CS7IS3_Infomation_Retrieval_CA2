FR941128-2-00116 FR941128-2-00065 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Notice of Establishment of National Grain Car Council and Request for Suggestion of Candidates for Membership AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice of Establishment of Federal Advisory Committee. SUMMARY: As required by Section 9(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., the ICC hereby gives notice that it has obtained approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a National Grain Car Council (NGCC) to assist the Commission in fulfilling its obligations to oversee the railroad industry's furnishing of safe and adequate car service for the transportation of grain under reasonable rules and practices, 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 11121(a). The ICC is also requesting suggestions for candidates for membership on the NGCC. DATES: Suggestions of candidates for membership on the NGCC are due on December 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send suggestions and supporting information (referring to the National Grain Car Council) to: Richard S. Fitzsimmons, Designated Federal Official_National Grain Car Council, Interstate Commerce Commission, 1201 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 3130, Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard S. Fitzsimmons, Telephone: (202) 927&hyph;5340. TDD for the hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has traditionally played an integral role in attempting to balance the needs of rail carriers and grain shippers. The regulatory reforms of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 encourage market-based private solutions to such disputes, with resort to the Commission only when the free market has not successfully resolved a problem. It has become apparent to the Commission that those involved in the shipment of grain by railroad face recurring equipment shortages, and the current mechanisms available for addressing these problems are inadequate piecemeal measures, subject to time-consuming and expensive litigation. The Commission attempted to encourage discussion between large and small railroads, grain shippers, car manufacturers, and others by hosting a conference in April 1994. See the Report on the National Grain Car Supply Conference, Ex Parte No. 519 (Commissioner Simmons August 1994) ( Report ). Despite an airing of competing positions, the parties failed to reach any consensus solutions concerning the problems facing shippers of grain. The Report suggested the formation of an NGCC, consisting of representatives of railroads, shippers, and manufacturers, to give these diverse groups an ongoing mechanism for discussion in a forum that is not currently available. Particular areas of discussion for the NGCC include identification of areas where car shortages might occur, new technological developments, grain export policies, new rail car purchases, and continuing advice to the Commission. The NGCC will meet at least once a year, with such meetings of subcommittees or study groups as the NGCC deems necessary. We anticipate that the NGCC will meet in early 1995. No honoraria, salaries, or travel and per diem is available to members of the NGCC; however, reimbursement for travel expenses may be sought from the Commission in cases of hardship. Suggestions for candidates for membership on the NGCC should be submitted to the Commission within 20 days. The NGCC will be balanced and representative of all interested and affected parties, and consist of 10 representatives of Class I railroads, 5 representatives of Class II and Class III railroads, 5 representatives of grain shippers and receivers, and 5 representatives of private car owners and car manufacturers. The Vice-Chairman of the ICC will serve as an ex-officio member of the NGCC. Chairman McDonald has appointed Richard S. Fitzsimmons, Director of the Commission's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, to serve as the Designated Federal Official_the agency's liaison to the NGCC. Suggestions for members of the NGCC should be submitted in letter form, identifying the name of the candidate; evidence of the interests the candidate will represent; and a representation that the candidate is willing to serve a two-year term as a member of the NGCC. Copies of the Charter of the NGCC may be obtained from the Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, 1201 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 927&hyph;7428 [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927&hyph;5721.] Decided: November 21, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman Gail C. McDonald.
