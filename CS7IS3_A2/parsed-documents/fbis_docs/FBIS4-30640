National Assembly Chairman Samdech Chea Sim says he hopes all members of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia will support this bill to place the PDK outside of the Royal Government's laws. Approval or disapproval of the bill requires a two-thirds vote. The Royal Government had considered presenting this bill to the National Assembly for a decision (?at its special session) but postponed it because His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, wanted to pursue the peace negotiations.
