"I believe we can go a long way if we continue in this direction," he added. Talks between the three party leaders, termed "lively" by a spokesman for the politicians appointed to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions, are concentrating mainly on ways of cutting back public expenditure. The parties already agreed on the extent to which it had to be reduced (with the exception of social security). In their election programs, the PvdA and the D66 planned to reduce spending by 6 billion guilders [G], and the VVD by G5 billion, part of it through rationalization, allocating tasks to local government, and having people contribute to the cost of services provided by the state. But, whereas the PvdA wants cutbacks on defense, the D66 and the VVD want some of the spending cuts to bear on public housing and education. The three party leaders completed the extensive talks on social security cutbacks on Tuesday without having yet reached an agreement. But their provisional agreement on a new implementation of social security does give the parties room for maneuvre in averting this stumbling block to a "purple" coalition. The negotiators believe that a new implementation structure will help to sharply reduce the numbers of unemployed and those registered as unfit for work. This could be so productive that any substantial cuts in the actual amount of social security payments, as sought by the VVD, will no longer be necessary. In order to be sure that, whatever happens, there will be a reduction in the social security budget during the next government, the threat of a reduction in allowances is being retained as the big stick.
