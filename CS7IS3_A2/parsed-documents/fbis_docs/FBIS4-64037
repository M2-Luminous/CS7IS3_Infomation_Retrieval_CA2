Now They Are Only Left To Decide On How To Position Them"] [Text] The situation in Crimea remains quiet. The armored personnel carriers spotted the day before on the railroad near Simferopol have been towed away to join a national guard brigade whose strength, according to Ukrainian First Deputy Interior Minister Col. Gen. Valentin Nedrigaylo, will soon reach 2,500. Intensive consultations are under way in the Crimean parliament on forming a working group which is to discuss outstanding issues with Kiev by 30 May. The group's composition is expected to be approved at a Crimean parliament session before 27 May. According to reports from Izmail, where a Black Sea Fleet river boats brigade is based, a group of Ukraine navy officers led by Lt. Col. Krichevskiy arrived at the local Black Sea Fleet naval engineers service. He stated that before 1 June a corresponding Ukraine Navy unit will be formed on the basis of the Izmail division and, on pain of dismissal, demanded that the personnel switch their allegiance and serve the Ukraine military department. Black Sea Fleet servicemen refused to obey this demand. Following this incident, Captain 1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, chief of the Ukraine Navy Western Maritime Protection Zone, stated that no one had given Lt. Col. Krichevskiy any such powers.
