He stressed that the offensive of the forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih "has been curbed on all axes." He added that this compelled them to haphazardly shell the villages near their positions, destroying more than 30 houses in al-Dali'. More than 80 families have been wounded in Kirsh. Both areas are in Lahij Governorate. He said that haphazard bombardment by heavy artillery of residential areas has led to many casualties among women and children, who could not escape. And that the element of surprise has contributed to increasing the number of casualties. However, Dr. Nu'man declined to disclose any figures about the losses at the present stage. He said that "the haphazard bombardment has made it difficult, so the real results will not be known until later." The interview, which was conducted over the telephone between London and Aden, was also joined by Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah (Muhsin), member of the YSP Political Bureau and minister of housing and rural planning. He said that "militias belonging to the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] are playing a major role in leading and launching the battle." He said that this falls "within the framework of qualifying themselves for assuming power at a later stage. Because they helped to spark off the crisis militarily. And they want matters in Yemen to proceed similarly to the way they did in Afghanistan." Muhsin specifically accused 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, deputy prime minister and secretary general of the YRG, "of throwing his party's weight behind the Yemeni president's military orientation. This orientation has confirmed what President Salih said to U.S. Envoy Robert Pelletreau, namely that he is fighting communism." Muhsin said that "the YRG has a major role inside the northern political security organ." He expressed his astonishment at "the sudden emergence of the fundamentalist scheme." He added that "it now justifies its presence by controlling key positions." He said that, "despite the current accord between the General People's Congress [GPC] and the YRG, a conflict is expected to occur between them at a later stage. Because there are indications in that direction, especially as the GPC faces have decreased in number in the southern and eastern governorates, while new YRG faces have begun to emerge and move actively." Asked whether there is a foreign role in the Yemeni war, Dr. Nu'man said that "the use of non-Yemeni forces is clear. It proves that the battle has assumed other dimensions. So we do not know why they [the north] are turning down Arab efforts to secure a cease-fire." To prove what he is saying, Dr. Nu'man added that "it seems that most of the foreign elements participating in the battle entered through the YRG, with the exception of the Iraqi role, which comes within the coordination between Sanaa and Baghdad." He said that "southern forces have arrested three non-Yemeni officers in the al-Dali' area: a Sudanese, a Jordanian, and an Iraqi. They were participating in leading al-Hamzah Brigade operations. It has been proved that they were there without their governments' knowledge." He pointed out that they will be paraded soon on television screens before Arab and foreign public opinion. Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah said that northern civilian planes have been moved to the airport of the Eritrean capital, Asmara. He added that a military delegation headed by Brigadier General al-Bashiri, former (northern) chief of staff, visited Eritrea and returned three days ago. However, he declined to comment on reports that northern warplanes are using Eritrean airports. He said: "We know nothing about that or about reports of a secret visit to Eritrea by the Yemeni president." On the ongoing fighting between al-'Amaliqah forces and southern units in Abyan Governorate, Dr. Nu'man said that "the fighting is continuing. The al-'Amaliqah Brigade went there immediately after unity, to the areas agreed upon. When the crisis began, they deployed in the towns and villages near their positions. But they have now retreated from the positions they occupied." He said that "al-'Amaliqah forces' retreat is attributable to the refusal of a large number of them to fight in accordance with the instructions issued to them by the GPC. As a result, the morale of the other troops has collapsed. But Sanaa reinforced them with additional troops." He said that they "do not know why they are fighting. The unity is there and the document is there, but they [the leaders] are refusing to implement them." Dr. Nu'man rejected the reports and statements issued from Sanaa. He said: "They control communications and are misleading Arab and foreign media by saying that Aden is under siege -- which is remote from the truth, because people are living their life completely normally."
