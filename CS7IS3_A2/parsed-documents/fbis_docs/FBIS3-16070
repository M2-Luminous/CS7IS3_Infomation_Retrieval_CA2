Turkmenbashi [Niyazov] has given an interview to journalists from Turkmenistan National Television. Regarding certain difficulties connected with the transition period, the head of state advised working people and the country's entire population not to be taken in by idle chatterers and people who try to make these problems out to be large and intractable. Saparmurat Turkmenbashi appealed to his countrymen not to trust the widespread rumors about the Turkmen manat, to maintain their restraint and keep calm. Certain shortages in the supply of food and other goods to the population, the president noted, are mainly attributable to the fact that a number of states have paid their debts to Turkmenistan at an inconvenient time.
