The Rural Development Administration said in a report on North Korean food production in 1993, released Thursday, that the Communist country is reckoned to have suffered a 34-percent decrease in rice production to 1.32 million tons, a 51-percent drop in corn production to 1.96 million tons and a 15-percent fall in production of other grains to 600,000 tons. The report attributed North Korea's sharp foodgrain production decrease last year to the unusually cold summer and said the North Korean people would suffer from the worst food shortage since the early 1980s. Estimating North Korea's foodgrain demand at 6.67 million tons this year, the report said the internationally isolated society's shortage in the coming year would be no less than 2.79 million tons.
