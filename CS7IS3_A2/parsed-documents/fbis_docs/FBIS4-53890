Attending the meeting was Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh. 1. The committee reviewed the preparations for the fifth session of the Ninth National Assembly scheduled to open on 26 May 1994. The committee commended the government, National Assembly agencies and other organs concerned, National Assemly delegations, and National Assembly deputies for having made adequate preparations to guarantee success for the session. The committee highly appreciated the positive efforts of people of all walks of life, sectors, and echelons in contributing views on a number of bills. The committee studied and contributed suggestions to a number of bills that had been reviewed based on the views contributed by the people. The committee requested the various compiling committees and other National Assembly committees concerned to continue perfecting those draft documents so that they can be presented to the National Assembly at an early date. The committee also gave its opinions about key issues and fundamental contents of the draft civil code and requested the compiling committee and the National Assembly Judiciary Committee to continue perfecting this draft document before soliciting the views of National Assembly deputies. The committee studied the government reports on the implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on a number of tasks for 1994 and other National Assembly's resolutions on other tasks for the first six months of the year, especially the results of budget allocations and fulfillment of the 1994 state budget; the development of the movement for thrift and against wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling; and diplomatic achievements. The committee commended the government for having taken quick steps to implement the National Assembly's resolutions from the very beginning of 1994 and for having worked out policies and measures to direct all sectors and echelons in motivating people throughout the country to effect positive changes and overcome difficulties step by step, thus successfully materializing the objectives set by the National Assembly's resolutions. The committee took into account the fact that our state's diplomatic activities in early 1994 had contributed to strengthening our ties with regional countries and to broadening our relations with friendly countries worldwide. The committee highly valued the fine results of the recent official friendship visits to the Republic of Indonesia and the Islamic Republic of Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to the Republic of India by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, and to the Union of Myanmar [Burma] by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. All those visits have contributed to strengthening the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and the aforementioned countries. They have also enhanced our country's prestige and position in the world and served the cause of national defense and construction. The committee requested the Government to continue to perfect reports before they can be presented to the upcoming session of the National Assembly. 2. The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the following three bills: -- The bill on protecting national defense projects and military areas. This bill is aimed at strengthening state management; enhancing responsibility of state agencies, armed units, socioeconomic organizations, and citizens in preserving and protecting national defense projects and military areas, thereby ensuring the capabilities in national defense and in serving the cause of national construction and defense. -- The revised bill on income tax levied on high-income earners. This bill is aimed at ensuring social justice and mobilizing more revenue for the state budget. -- The revised bill on amending and supplementing some articles of the law on land and house taxation to strengthen the law on land and the law on agricultural land use. Also at this conference, the National Assembly Standing Committee reviewed the draft bill on rights and obligations of organizations at home which have been allocated and leased with land; and the draft bill on rights and obligations of foreign organizations and individuals who lease land in Vietnam for submission to the National Assembly at the upcoming session. The National Assembly will also consider the bill on tax levied on the transfer of rights on using land. This will serve as a basis for the National Assembly Standing Committee to consider and adopt relevant draft bills at its next meetings. 3. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report on the results of its investigation team led by National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy on its inspection tour to Lam Dong Province to ensure national defense and security to comply with the spirit of the Ninth National Assembly's fourth session resolution. The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the team's report and asked the government and agencies concerned and localities to study and implement the team's proposals. The National Assembly Standing Committee welcomed the Lam Dong people and combatants' efforts in developing socioeconomic situation, maintaining national defense and security, improving the people's daily life. It urged the province to strive to consolidate and strengthen the all-people unity, improve socioeconomic development, and maintain national defense and security while resolving pressing issues as raised by the inspection team. 4. The National Assembly Standing Committee made a decision on the number of chief judges and judges of appeal of the Supreme People's Court, on the table of organization of the Supreme People's Court and of the central military court for 1994, and approved the assistant machinery of the Supreme People's Court. The National Assembly Standing Committee also decided on the change of members of the Council for Selection of Judges of Provincial and City People's Courts under the direct management of the central government, judges of military regional courts and courts at corresponding level, and judges of regional martial courts.
