The Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI), in a statement received here by AFP, said the religious leaders had either been executed or killed during clashes between the PUK and the rival pro-Iranian Kurdistan Islamic League (KIL). SAIRI also charged that several mosques in northern Iraq had been badly hit during the fighting. "SAIRI strongly condemns such acts and calls for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations," the statement said. Kurdish sources said at least 72 people had been killed and 250 wounded in clashes between the PUK and KIL since last week, mostly in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah, which lies close to the Iranian border. The PUK flushed out KIL fighters from their military bases on Monday. PUK leader Jalal Talabani told AFP on Tuesday that the KIL had surrendered their weapons. Meanwhile, SAIRI said an Islamic delegation representing groups opposed to the Iraqi government would soon leave Syria for northern Iraq to mediate between the rival Kurdish factions. The delegation met with Talabani in Damascus Tuesday to discuss the situation in northern Iraq, it said. They asked Talabani to declare an immediate ceasefire and called for information on the fate of the KIL leader, Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, according to SAIRI.
