The first communique is entitled "Hail Maoism!" It transcribes the "resolution" of the Central Committee about the commemorations of Mao Zedong's 100th birthday, stressing the SL's support "for the leadership of President Gonzalo." According to the document, "President Gonzalo" will make the New State flourish with the help of the People's Liberation Army, which through hard combat will eventually achieve the immediate goal: To conquer power in the whole country and to install the People's Republic of Peru." [no opening quotation marks published] The SL "resolution," which is just a party agreement at its highest leadership levels, also envisages an increase in armed actions against the Peruvian State. "It is our duty to aim all our actions (....) and mainly to develop the people's war with increasingly ambitious plans and greater war actions, using all our forces to the maximum; totally and strictly complying with the task established by President Gonzalo." Another SL communique, which includes the "speech" Guzman gave when he was presented to the media in a striped prisoner's uniform following his arrest in September 1992, states that "the international, national, and party situation marks the arrest (of Guzman) as an historical event and places on alert all forces to comply with the IV Strategic Development Plan and the VI Military Plan, according to what was established by the III Plenum of the PCP-SL Central Committee." Between Abimael Guzman's arrest until September 1993, the SL has carried out the first guerrilla campaign called "Defend the life of President Gonzalo!," and from November 1993 until the present it is carrying out the second campaign called "In Defense of the Leadership Against the Genocide Dictator!" The two campaigns are part of the so-called Sixth Great Military Plan to which the subversives refer. This latter document includes the most recent decisions of the leadership connected with the strategy and objectives of the organization led by Guzman. As for strategy, the Maoists state: "We reassert the three strategies established by President Gonzalo: political strategy: conquest of power; military strategy: the people's war, to develop preparations for insurrection; strategy of construction, to build the conquer of power amid the people's war." Among the objectives of the SL -- which totally opposes the contents of the letters Guzman sent to President Fujimori praising the policies of his regime -- we find: "To combat the treacherous genocide of the dictatorship of Fujimori, to defeat his counterrevolutionary plan (and) to upgrade the people's war by developing a strategic balance to conquer power in the whole country." Guzman's statements in his letters are not at all in keeping with his strategies and objectives expressed in the SL communiques or in the document published by LA REPUBLICA. On the contrary, they show that Abimael Guzman is playing a double game to "gain time" and to recompose his organization's apparatus and thus guarantee the continuity of the peoples war that he unleashed in May 1980. In another PCP-SL bulletin entitled "Declaration" the SL again stresses its decision to continue to combat the regime "headed by the genocidal traitor puppet Fujimori, the most loyal lackey of Yankee imperialism," whioch clearly contradicts Guzman's statements that the government "has made real accomplishments." The document minimizes the efforts for pacification and specifically refers to the "capitulation of the SL" to dialogue which is labelled as "another lie which the reactionary government periodically releases (....), a ridiculous and clumsy lie that no one with even the smallest brain can consider serious and which will evaporate, like the ones that came before it, prior to an endless turmoil of the people's war." Contrary to the spirit of the letters written by Guzman and the unveiling of the real motive for his apparent willingness to lay down his weapons, the PCP-SL Central Committee states: "The people's war will triumph inevitably, marking an event that will decisively contribute to the development of the international proletarian revolution; the People's Republic of Peru will become true thanks to the support and the combat trench of the working class." As for Guzman, the declaration states: "With his everlasting light (....) he is leading us to the golden and shining Communism with a firm and sure hand," which clearly shows that the leadership of the self-proclaimed "President Gonzalo" is not questioned and that his followers support his determination to hold talks with the representatives of the regime, but only to distract their attention because "we are sure and convinced of the triumph of the revolution." The most recent issue of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, the SL mouthpiece that Luis Arce Borja, who is at large, publishes in Brussels, reveals the real sense of the negotiations between Abimael Guzman and the government. The declaration states: "The people's war is not negotiable and there is no room for talks with this reactionary and criminal government. The revolutionaries have decided to destroy the old state, and to finish with the police and armed forces. We will definitively end this oppressive system and imperialistic domination, " adding: "These objectives cannot be conquered through agreements or `peace conversations.' The struggle of the masses cannot be auctioned." The viewpoint of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL is based on the attacks committed by the Shining Path in the last four months: "The military attack that the Maoist guerrilla has been promoting since last September and which brilliantly continued in October, November, and December, is the argument against all those who, based on the lies of the government, have tried to discredit President Gonzalo and the war of liberation in Peru." Arce Borja supports the "leadership" of Guzman and acknowledges that he is the irrefutable leader of the PCP-SL, therefore his criticisms of the peace talks are not aimed at "President Gonzalo" but at demonstrating the existence of a SL strategy to take advantage of the dialogue to "gain strength." "It is clear as daylight that the PCP-SL is as compact and strong organization as steel. It has been proven that its top central, regional, and local leadership cadres are active and healthy," states EL DIARIO. Regarding the negotiations, the SL mouthpiece states: "It is naive to consider the possibility of peacefully maintaining the old state and the system of oppression." Arce Borja asks: "What will a peace agreement serve for in Peru?, and answers: "The only ones to benefit from any `peace agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people, especially the imperialistic forces." The document published by LA REPUBLICA on 25 January clearly states that the SL people's war will carry on until 2060, stressing that it will be a "long" war. Arce Borja states that "time is not a problem for the people's war but it is for the Peruvian state." Arce Borja concludes: "To acknowledge the letters of Fujimori is to disapprove the general political line of the revolution established by Abimael Guzman and to deny the validity of the program of the party whose strategic objectives aim to conquer power in the whole country and to build the people's republic of Peru."
