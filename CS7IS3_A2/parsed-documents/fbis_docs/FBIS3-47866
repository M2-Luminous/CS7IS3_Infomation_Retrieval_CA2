Although it has been customary for bilateral negotiations to remain entangled up to the eleventh hour in the past, virtually no progress has been made this time between the two nations ever since they agreed on the basic framework of the trade talks last July. Settlement must be made in talks on four individual trade sectors -- automobiles and auto parts, government procurement of telecommunications equipment, government procurement of medical equipment, and insurance services -- before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit meeting, but the Japanese and U.S. Governments remain at odds at the very outset. The trade talks seem to have entered a tunnel with no light visible on the other end yet, due to the cumulative effects of such factors as the differences in trade policies between the two nations, accumulated mutual distrust, and the stagnant Japanese economy. "Numerical Targets" Have Become Barrier "The United States and Japan see the world differently." Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for international economic affairs at the U.S. Commerce Department, made this comment to describe the extent of the bilateral trade dispute. He visited Japan last week to talk with Japanese officials on automobiles and auto parts. The "argument over numerical targets" has been the greatest barrier to talks over the four individual trade sectors. The United States has asserted that "although we do not ask that Japan guarantee a certain share of its market to foreign products, it is necessary to set up a criteria to determine whether progress has been made in market opening." On the other hand, Japan has objected that "nothing that will be linked to setting numerical targets would be accepted in any form whatsoever." The United States has complained that "the Japanese Government has distorted U.S. assertions." However, it is certain that at the current trade negotiations, the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, which advocates a results-oriented policy as a pillar of U.S. diplomacy toward Japan, has stressed the need to reach "an agreement that will lead to concrete results." In response to criticism that this would lead to "managed trade," the United States argues that "what is necessary to open up the Japanese market, which is by far the most closed among the major industrialized nations, is not managed trade, but rather a policy to crush managed trade." Arguing Over Past Cases It is widely believed that when the Clinton administration hammered out the new framework trade talks last year, it designed it taking into consideration the bilateral semiconductor agreement and the action program on auto parts. The semiconductor agreement encompassed the "hopes" of U.S. industrial circles which expected that "foreign semiconductor makers should gain a 20-percent share of the Japanese market by the end of 1992." The action program which was put together during former U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in early 1992 called for "voluntary target goals" on the part of Japanese automakers who vowed "to increase procurement of U.S. auto parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994." A high-ranking U.S. Government official has said: "Since target goals were achieved in accordance with the semiconductor agreement, it was possible to avoid a further worsening of trade friction between the United States and Japan. This should have been to the advantage of Japan, too. We wonder why the Japanese are now taking such an inflexible attitude." Concerning the two precedents, however, a Japanese negotiator, taking a completely opposite view, has referred to them as having taught Japan a lesson, saying: "We yielded under U.S. pressure, ending up with a price to pay in the future." With the collapse of the cold war structure and the successful conclusion of GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round), Japan has taken the opportunity to try to shift its trade policy from a completely U.S.-oriented approach to that focusing on GATT. A senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has said agitatedly: "The European Union (EU) and Asian nations are paying much attention to how Japan handles the trade issues with the United States. We must not make inadvertent concessions here." Mutual distrust between Japanese and the U.S. Government officials in charge of the trade talks has been another factor causing the negotiations to be stalled. Joan E. Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic, business, and agricultural affairs, who visited Japan last week apart from Under Secretary of Commerce Garten, complained: "Japanese bureaucrats specialize on defense, judo style. They are trying to keep dragging on the talks." The United States has begun to suspect that Japanese Government ministries and agencies are trying to put off negotiations on market access itself by taking advantage of the dispute over numerical targets. In response, Japan has irately retorted: "U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other U.S. officials have started to refer to Japanese automakers' voluntary target goals of purchasing $19 billion worth of U.S. auto parts as a `Japanese pledge.' There can be no negotiations if they intend to push through with such an inconsiderate interpretation." Narrowing of Competitiveness Has Impact Concerning automobiles and auto parts, the narrowing of competitiveness between Japanese and U.S. makers has also cast a shadow on the trade talks. So far, the Japan-U.S. automobile friction has been settled under a formula where "the strong Japanese industry has given due consideration to the ailing U.S. industry." The voluntary export restraint regarding passenger vehicles that has been continued since 1981 is a classic example. Osamu Watanabe, chief of MITI's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, reflects that the action program under which Japan vowed to purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts was "a product of affluence." Now, however, the Japanese automobile industry cannot afford to carry out such plans. Sluggish domestic demand and steady yen appreciation have caused automakers' profits to decline considerably. Since U.S. automakers have successfully improved the quality of their products, the gap in competitiveness between Japanese and U.S. automakers is rapidly narrowing. In contrast to the Japanese automobile industry, the U.S. automobile industry has rapidly reaped profits, supported by a recovering domestic economy. The U.S. "Big Three" automakers recorded a total profit of $4.7 billion in the period from January to September 1993. As a result, there is strong dissatisfaction in some quarters of MITI, which is in charge of the trade talks, complaining that "the U.S. Government has not accurately grasped the current situation concerning the automobile industries of both nations." Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then prime minister, unfolded his critical argument against managed trade during talks with President Clinton last April. With this as a starting point, Japan has been determined more than ever to "assert itself" since the outset of negotiations on the basic framework of new trade talks. The agreement made during the Japan-U.S. summit meeting last July was ambiguous, and all it did was to put off the problems. In that sense, Japan and the United States have been continuously at odds for nine months already.
