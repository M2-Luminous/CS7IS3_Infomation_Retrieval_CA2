With the affiliation of Central and East European countries with the Western European Union (WEU), agreed upon on Monday, 9 May, in Brussels, West Europe is widening its sphere of responsibility in terms of security. But there is no need to wait for the possible expansion of the European Union [EU] to the east to take into account a new strategic deal. The expansion now proceeding with Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden is already introducing a profound change. In fact, the EU, for the first time in its history, will have an extended common border with Russia when Finland becomes a full-fledged member. To be sure, there is yet another possible contact point between these two great entities of the Old Continent, it is on the Kola Peninsula, where NATO -- through the intermediary of Norway -- and the former USSR challenged one another for a long time. But the likelihood of membership in the EU is greater for Finland than Norway, and the hundreds of kilometers that run from the Nordkyn Cape to Vyborg represent an unprecedented geopolitical reality. Having an extended common border with Russia should lead the EU to think differently about its security policy. To begin with, this reality greatly weakens the argument of those who, in the name of a pan-European vision including Russia, object to expansion of the Community to the east; according to them, a new demarcation line should not be drawn in Europe following the disappearance of the Iron Curtain. This refusal would be a new exclusion line leaving Russia -- and Russia alone -- outside the integration process. Would what is valid for Poland not be therefore valid for Finland? Why would a border between the Union and the Russian world passing over the Bug River be more discriminatory than the Finnish-Russian border? Would it not be due to Warsaw's former membership in the socialist camp? Which would be the equivalent of recognizing a special Russian right of inspection over its former satellites, and therefore of acknowledging a rather sweeping concept of what Moscow calls the "nearby foreigner." The fact remains that the idea of a "gray zone," belonging to neither East nor West, a sort of buffer zone between Europe and Russia that the Kremlin is sometimes tempted to maintain, has no longer the same power with the entry of Helsinki in the European Community. Undoubtedly, during the Cold War, Finland also held a position all its own. Often, the term "Finlandization" was used wrongly with a disparaging connotation to convey the neutrality of a country with a market economy having good neighbor relations with the USSR. It might have been interpreted differently: Without belonging to NATO, which would then have been contrary to that neutrality and seen as a provocation by its powerful neighbor, Finland benefited in a way from an unspoken guarantee of security on the part of the West. Finland was not in the zone covered by NATO, but the latter would not have accepted the application of the Brezhnev doctrine to the former. Membership in the Union is going to transform this guarantee; from unexpressed, it will become specific, and there lies the great geostrategic novelty linked to the existence of a common European-Russian border. The change will not occur in one day. Finland will have to reconcile its tradition of neutrality with its integration into West Europe. By applying for membership in the Union, Finland, pending a positive referendum outcome, has accepted all rights and duties, including the Maastricht Treaty's commitments pertaining to foreign policy and joint security. But the opposite is also true. The EU makes a commitment to Finland by accepting its candidacy; the former offers the latter the same protection that is offered all its members. The joint defense policy ultimately implies a participation in the WEU, therefore the security guarantee and the aid of the other members as called for in Article 5 of its charter in case of aggression. But this guarantee itself is valid only insofar as it is strengthened by NATO reassurance, that is to say, in the final analysis, by the United States. This aspect of European defense policy worries Washington. Last January, the Americans rejected the expansion of NATO to the east and proposed instead the Partnership for Peace [PFP], in order, to be sure, not to offend the Russians, but above all, so as not to have to give the new states the security guarantees available to the 16 NATO members (Finland and Sweden signed the outline agreement pertaining to the PFP on 9 May). As it stands, the Americans feel that the expansion of the EU and the Central European countries' plans for association with the WEU, launched by the French and German foreign ministers and implemented early this week, are equivalent to secretly creating new pretenders to the NATO umbrella. The Americans also feel that these projects are liable to ultimately leave them with a fait accompli. It is a difficult dilemma, for the United States can no more accept being forced indirectly by Europe to guarantee the security of new countries through an association with or a membership in the WEU than the Europeans can give the Americans a right of veto over candidates for Community membership. To insist on the significance of this European-Russian "new border" is neither to fear nor, all the more so, to predict troubles between Finland and Russia, that is to say, border incidents challenging the security of a (future) EU member and forcing its partners to fly to its aid. Nothing can be excluded in a Europe where all the borders have started shifting again. There were many territorial conflicts between Finland and Russia prior to 1945. Yet, during the process of dissolution of the USSR, and despite the centrifugal forces working within Russia itself, the formerly Finnish Karelia has remained remarkably calm. Everything seems to indicate that these Scandinavian borders should not be the first objective of a Eurocorps in the making. Therefore, it is less a question of existing fears than of questions about an important upheaval on the European scene. We have barely begun to measure the consequences of such an upheaval on a European Community built patiently over a 30-year period and sheltered by the Berlin Wall. It involves a new geography of the continent. Without waiting for the next stages, the current expansion shifts Europe's center of gravity toward the East and its zones of violence. For Helsinki is not the only one involved: Vienna -- another newcomer to the Union -- is closer to Ukraine than to the western border of Austria.
