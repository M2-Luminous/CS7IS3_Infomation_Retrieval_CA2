A UNIAN correspondent met with one of its chiefs, Colonel Aleksandr Belov. Here is what he said. [Belov] Over the past two years, we have sent more than 3,500 documents on national security matters to the Ukrainian president, Supreme Council chairman, and prime minister. This enables the necessary measures to be taken on the legislative level and allows people to keep one step ahead of events. Instead of writing history, we try to foresee developments. By the way, this is what former CIA Director Robert Gates demanded from his people. We are now studying two major issues. The first is Ukraine and the system of collective security, because just like other East European states, our country seeks to enter international institutions in order to obtain firm guarantees of its security. We are trying to consider all the advantages and disadvantages stemming, for example, from entry into NATO or the EEC, integration into the Visegrad Group, or the creation of a Baltic and Black Sea Union. The second issue is to determine the likely centers for international terrorist organizations' operations on Ukrainian territory. [Reporter] How often were your prognoses borne out? [Belov] When the armed conflict in the Dniester region was in its initial stage, the Ukrainian leadership instructed the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Foreign Ministry, border troops, and the SBU to prevent the spread of the conflict onto Ukraine's territory. At that time, we were preparing on a daily basis information for Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and Anatoliy Zlenko on the situation in the region and the likely directions that events might take. Our prediction that the 14th Russian Army was likely to turn into an independent political force was borne out. [Reporter] Do you have any evidence of any analytical operations by foreign special services in the Crimea? [Belov] At present, the Crimea remains a potential crisis spot, not only in Ukraine but also in the context of a larger geopolitical area. This is why developments in that region are closely watched by Turkey, Romania, the United States, Germany, and Russia.
