What about the future? What shape will the industry take in the years leading up to the turn of the century? To answer these questions, we reprint here a major study published in 1993 by Faulkner & Gray. The study, ``Debit Card 2000,'' surveyed the 45 largest debit card issuers and the top 35 networks to find out what kind of growth to expect, what new services and enhancements will arrive, and what developments to look for in national POS by 2000_just six years away. Some of the results are surprising, particularly if you've always viewed debit cards as a customer service rather than a profit center. That's now how issuers and networks in the near future will look at the product. By 2000, they say, there cold be as many as 1 million POS terminals installed. Visa and MasterCard, meanwhile, predict there'll be 100 million off-line debit cards in force in six years, well beyond today's 15 million. If your plans depend on solid forecasts for the foreseeable future, the following pages should make useful reading.
