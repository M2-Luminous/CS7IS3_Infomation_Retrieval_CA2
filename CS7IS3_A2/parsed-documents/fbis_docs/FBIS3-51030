The National Defense communique stated that in the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, the transgressors of the law released 63 workers of the Social Security clinic who had been kidnapped when the conflict began in Chiapas. The workers were taken to the Comitan de Dominguez Garrison, where they were fed, and then they were sent to the capital of Chiapas State. The Defense Secretariat stated that 10 days after operations began to reestablish order in the Chiapas highlands, clashes between the transgressors of the law and Army troops have decreased considerably. It added that from Monday night to early morning Tuesday, there have been no clashes; nevertheless, troops are continuing to guard several towns that were the targets of the armed groups. The bulletin read that in addition to the combing operations by the troops, several aircraft are overflying the area to detect the groups of transgressors still roaming around some towns. According to the communique, it has been learned that approximately 50 transgressors abandoned their weapons near Palenque and fled to unknown locations.
