To prevent acts of vandalism, hundreds of police officers were deployed along the city's main streets. Nevertheless, an official VENPRES report indicates that students from the Santos Michelena and Rafael Urdaneta high schools unleashed their anger on the San Jose police station, throwing stones and bottles that destroyed glass doors and windows. Thursday morning, student German Sotillo Rodriguez, 17, died from three gunshot wounds during disturbances staged by students from the Fermin Toro High School near the Miraflores presidential palace. The students were protesting a refusal by city bus drivers to honor preferential student fares. Authorities have confirmed that the student was killed by Raul Izea Bohorquez, a metropolitan police officer, who will be turned over to the courts.
