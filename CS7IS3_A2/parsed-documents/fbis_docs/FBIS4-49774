"We are satisfied with our achievement in China over past decade, and we still have lots to do here," said James Paulsen, president of the Ford China operation, in a recent interview with XINHUA. In the past year, Ford exported to China 6200 vehicles, double the 1992 figure, and sales service is now available in China's 10 major cities. Besides, Ford and China's Natural Science Foundation have signed an agreement last October to establish a fund to finance China's research in advanced auto components and technology, and on April 28 this year, 19 Chinese universities and institutes were awarded 25 scientific research grants. The company's next step is to set up a joint venture with China to manufacture auto components to meet the demands of all kinds of China-made vehicles, Paulsen said. "Ford's long-term objective in China is to assemble vehicles after helping China to develop its auto components manufacturing base," said the newly-appointed president. To achieve the aim, the company established Ford China operation last March to coordinate its business with China, including components manufacturing, technology licensing and joint scientific and technology research. Meanwhile, Ford and China's five biggest auto producers co-established a research and development center for auto components last year. It marks the first time Ford has made such cooperation with foreign companies.
