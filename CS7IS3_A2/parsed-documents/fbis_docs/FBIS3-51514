The forces also are investigating another explosion that did considerable damage to the Legislative Building and nearby areas. This is Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso. [Begin recording] [Ortiz Moscoso] Perpetrators of this barbaric method will get nowhere. It is only a means of underscoring their personal positions. Printed materials found at the site of these explosions call on the people to imitate these rebellious groups in opposing the plebiscite. I think, however, that they are getting nowhere and will not get anywhere. The Guatemalan people are fed up with this type of tactic and violence. [Unidentified reporter] What about the bomb thrown last night in front of the [words indistinct]? [Ortiz Moscoso] That is something different. That was not a leaflet bomb. We are alarmed about this explosion. I visited the place at about 1930 on my way home after leaving my office. The police were there in force also. We want to capture these irresponsible, wicked people. This is the only way I can describe them. I must inform you and the general public of my grief on learning that a child was killed by the this morning's explosion. This blood must be on the head of the perpetrators. It is unthinkable that such people detonate grenades at a place where tired people are waiting to go home. [Reporter] Can such explosions be regarded as attempts at destabilizing the government? [Ortiz Moscoso] I would rather say it is an attempt at destabilizing the democratic system, which is different. The government is represented by President de Leon. Such an attack on innocent people cannot be understood to be an attempt to destabilize the government but as a direct attack on democracy and the Guatemalan people's desire to live in peace.
