When one reviews the attitude of devotion, sacrifice, and rectitude of many comrades, it is very difficult for us to understand their egotism. It translates into a desperation to retain the leading role and preserve privileges on the part of the very persons who, by virtue of the very responsibilities they exercise within the party, should be an example for those who still believe that the FSLN is the last hope for achieving a more just society. The FSLN of today cannot be the same as it was in past decades. Trying to turn it into a docile, blind instrument prevents its adaptation to the dynamic times in which we are living. To cling to positions of power and use improper methods of struggle, methods at odds with honesty, is not proper revolutionary practice. From 1990 on, we have sadly observed an accelerated process of deterioration within our ranks. Sound debate of ideological principles and methods of struggle has been replaced by irrational, willful imposition. We have been incapable of giving its rightful place to a Sandinist Assembly that must be provided with the proper instruments rather than strengthened as the maximum authority between congresses. Nor is it the right, the social democrats, radicals, or moderates who must take the blame for the moral deterioration of the party. Rather, it is the elements that stand in the way of the search for solutions, believing that the party serves them, who are responsible. The method chosen in the attempt to discredit Sergio or any other Sandinist is sad and condemnable. Nor must one be deceived by the argument that (given his personality) one is merely dealing with an outburst by Carlos Guadamuz. With his personality and the radio, Guadamuz responds to partisan interests rather than the interests of the FSLN. These methods of struggle do more harm to those who promote them than to the individual they target. It is not by submissively and unthinkingly adhering to the will of a leader, whoever he may be, that we shall help maintain unity and define a political program that will bind us together and move us forward. To my way of thinking, Sergio made a terrible mistake by accepting the post in the the National Leadership. At that first Congress, he should have realized that the ticket would be imposed and that as a result, the decision of majority of the members of the National Leadership to cling to posts and positions would drag him into an internal struggle (new for him) rather than participation in a collective leadership. I also believe it was a mistake to respond to the radio attacks. The language, content, and their authors discredit them and render them unworthy of any response.
