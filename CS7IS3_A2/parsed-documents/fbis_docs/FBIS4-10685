Could this be a factor prompting the illegal and risky departure of thousands of people from Cuba? Why do people chose to leave Cuba illegally? What are the main causes? Lourdes de Urrutia, a Havana University sociologist and member of a group who conducted a study on the matter of illegal emigration, explains. [Urrutia] "I believe it is interesting to point out why those who choose to leave illegally do so. The fact is that 53 percent of those interviewed do not meet immigration law requirements, [passage indistinct] first-degree blood relationship that is required in order to be legally sent for by relatives in the United States. A certain percentage of those interviewed who do meet the requirements, or have first-degree blood ties with relatives in the United States, opt to leave illegally because they believe it is speedier than leaving via legal channels, and circumvents all the paperwork required to depart legally. Thus, I believe illegal departures are conditioned by the restrictiveness of U.S. policies and by the parameters for people to be able to emigrate legally to the United States that that country establishes." Specialists are of the opinion that economic reasons, as well as the difficult situation Cuba is going through, are the main reasons people weigh in choosing to leave Cuba illegally. [Urrutia] "Among the economic reasons these people mention is the frustration they are experiencing because of the conditions of the special period. There is also the fact that over 70 percent of them decided to leave Cuba during the special period, after 1990. Therefore, these are not people left behind from past surges of emigration. They are people who reached their decisions between 1990 and the present, and primarily during 1993, which is the year our study was on. This is the year when the difficulties of the special period were most acutely felt. We believe that all this supports our conclusion that this emigration is of an economic nature." The matter of illegal Cuban emigration to Florida reflects the status of immigration relations between Cuba and the United States. It also shows that this matter continues to be part of this bilateral conflict.
