According to its cochairman on the Russian side, Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov, doctor of philosophical sciences and historical sciences, the importance of the commission's work is increasingly obviously going beyond the framework of purely search tasks, becoming an important factor in the improvement of the climate in our two countries' relations. But the practical results are also substantial. Thus, Americans have been handed reports extracted from Russian archives about 1,500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots and air defense gunners. Many testimonies from witnesses have been heard, in particular from former Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute staffer P. Kovalskiy, who once took part in the investigation of a U.S. F-86 aircraft sent to the USSR, and now firmly states that the crew was not on our territory at all. The U.S. side, as Congressman Peterson stated at the press conference which took place, is satisfied with the level of cooperation. It has received access to previously secret documents which are advancing the search considerably. For their part the Americans have provided information about several Soviet citizens whose traces were lost in Afghanistan and other regions. It should be noted that the emphasis in the work of the joint commission is shifting increasingly to establishing the fate of our compatriots. That cannot fail to cause satisfaction, as can the action of the U.S. side in this direction -- we have been presented with the so-called "Klaus file" which contains extensive confidential information from the U.S. special services on conflict situations involving Soviet citizens. In general, the longer the commission works the clearer it is becoming how much the peoples need such search activity. The embassies of Britain, Italy, Australia, and other states have asked us for help, D.A. Volkogonov noted at the press conference. They are also concerned for the fate of their missing compatriots, and the experience of the Russian-U.S. commission will be useful to them. Or here is one more example of the public response. During the press conference representatives of the Kuwaiti mass media asked whether the Russian-U.S. commission could not help the return home from Iraq of the Kuwaiti citizens still languishing there. The commission has no legal powers, was the reply, but if instances of the enforced detention of Kuwaiti citizens are indeed taking place, the commission is prepared to appeal to the world public to promote the humane solution of the question.
