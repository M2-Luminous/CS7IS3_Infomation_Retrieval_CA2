"It is evident for the workers of the Academy of Sciences of Republic of Albania that these acts are components of the harsh measures taken by Serbian authorities against the Albanian people, the Albanian language and education and the endeavour for affirmation of the Albanian culture and science. This act follows the arbitral decisions of the Serbian Assembly for abolishing the Academy of Arts and Sciences of Kosova," was written in a protest note issued yesterday. The note appeals to the international community, science circles, to protest against this act, to solve the international position of Kosova in conformity with the international rights and its people will.
