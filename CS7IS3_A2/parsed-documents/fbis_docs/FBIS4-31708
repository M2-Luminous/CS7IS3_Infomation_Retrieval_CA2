The basic topic of their talks was, as both Galbraith and Martic said at a news conference, the issue connected with the implementation of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, i.e. the removal of the remaining misunderstandings between the Croatian and Krajina sides ahead of negotiations on economic issues and cooperation to be held this week. Galbraith and Martic assessed the talks as useful and stressed that they encompassed a wide spectrum of current issues and problems. Galbraith particularly stressed that at the meeting today the Krajina side told him of their concern over Croatia's failure to comply with the cease-fire agreement and a reduced level of monitoring by military observers of the demilitarized zone on the Croatian side of the separation line. He said that he was taking these demands extremely seriously and that he would inform his government and the Croatian side about them. President Martic particularly underlined Galbraith's stance that the Krajina-Croatia conflict could no longer be resolved by force. The war option accomplishes nothing, Martic stressed and added that today's talks focused specifically on the conduct of the Croatian and Serb police in the buffer zones. He also said that most misunderstandings have been removed as far as the Krajina side was concerned, while Ambassador Galbraith promised he would take similar steps to remove misunderstandings in Zagreb. Asked by reporters which issues could be agreed on quickly at the upcoming negotiations, Martic replied: These issues concern the securing of water supplies for Zadar by us, in return for the delivery of spare parts for the Obrovac hydroelectric power plant and the securing of water supplies for Teslingrad and Drnis by the Croatian side. We would then review humanitarian issues regarding compensation to hard currency account holders and pensioners -- 57,000 pensioners on the territory of the RSK. Only then will we discuss the opening of the Adriatic oil pipeline, on condition that it is completely opened all the way to Pancevo where Krajina crude oil is processed, Martic concluded. He added that communications issues could only be tackled after peace was stabilized and other issues are resolved. Ambassador Galbraith will also be visiting the Benkovac area, especially the devastated Serb villages of Kasic and Islam Grcki, ISKRA reports.
