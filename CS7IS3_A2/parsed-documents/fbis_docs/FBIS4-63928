We aspire to the all-around development of relations between the United States and Azerbaijan and in this context attach importance to the meeting with you," Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, declared, receiving on 15 May a U.S. delegation headed by James Collins, special adviser to the U.S. secretary of state and senior coordinator of U.S. policy in respect to the new independent states (CIS). The delegation, which had come to Baku to study the prospects of the cooperation of the two countries, also included Joseph Presel, chief of the State Department Regional Conflicts Desk and U.S. representative in the CSCE Minsk Group, and representatives of the Departments of Defense, Treasury, and Energy. Having expressed his respect for the leadership and people of the United States of America and the President of the country, Geydar Aliyev emphasized that he viewed with optimism the future of Azerbaijani-American relations and a strengthening of relations between the two countries. We value highly the efforts of the United States, he said, aimed at support for the new states that have formed since the disintegration of the former USSR. Considering that attempts are being made to deprive these republics, ours included, of sovereignty and independence, the support of the United States was and remains a powerful factor restraining these attempts. Speaking of the military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has essentially grown into a war and which is seriously damaging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, the president of the republic emphasized: "Our position is unequivocal--the conflict must be settled peacefully, and relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the question of Nagornyy Karabakh also must be discussed only at the negotiating table. Operating in this direction, we are cooperating actively with the CSCE and its Minsk Group, of which the United States is a member, and on which we pin big hopes." As Geydar Aliyev observed, the development of Azerbaijan's economic relations with other countries, the United States included, will play an enormous part in a strengthening of the republic's independence. In the president's opinion, the United States also has an interest in the establishment of mutually profitable relations with Azerbaijan--a state with strong economic potential--cooperation in the sphere of the development and use of the oil deposits included. We hope, he announced, that the negotiations between the State Petroleum Company of Azerbaijan and Western firms, of a consortium of which the American Amoco and Pennzoil companies are a part, will be concluded successfully. As you know, a stage of the negotiations is taking place currently in Istanbul, and I hope, the head of state observed, that the signing of oil contracts will be possible upon their conclusion. Geydar Aliyev also expressed the hope that cooperation in the sphere of oil production would make it possible to expand contacts in other spheres also, emphasizing that a strengthening of Azerbaijani-American relations would be of importance for economic cooperation between the two countries. Other matters connected with the prospects of the development of bilateral relations were discussed also. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fuad Guliyev, first deputy prime minister, State Counselor Vafa Guli-zade, Gasan Gasanov, minister of foreign relations of the republic, and Richard Dale Kozlaric, ambassador of the United States in Azerbaijan, were present at the reception.
