Two power units of the Kola nuclear power station have already been shut down. The nuclear power station accounts for 60 percent of the electricity generated in the region. Engineers will have to shut down yet another power unit of the nuclear power station in June. The situation in the region may have an effect at an all-Russian level, too, because a failure to restart all the power units of Kola nuclear power station, which supplies power to the Northern Fleet's rear bases and garrisons, will adversely affect the fleet's combat readiness.
