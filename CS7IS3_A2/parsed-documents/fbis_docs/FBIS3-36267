Democratic Russia's first prime minister, Silayev received the appointment to Brussels after handing over his government duties to Yegor Gaydar at the end of 1991. To be sure, Silayev's new post was a kind of honorary exile, but at the same time a sign of gratitude on the part of the president. What is behind Ivan Silayev's resignation -- dissatisfaction with his performance? another upcoming appointment? Our correspondent called the ambassador's office in Brussels: [Silayev] I am not a diplomat and therefore from the very start of my work in this capacity I have regarded it as temporary. After all, before that I had worked for approximately 40 years in industry, which has remained my main sphere of interest. This is why when the president visited Brussels in December, I asked him to consider the possibility of replacing me. He promised to, although he said that he had no complaints to make about by work. At 1000 on 20 January, in Moscow, the president received me for a final conversation. I stated my case and he agreed. Therefore on 1 March I will return to Russia, and I am very happy about this. I am not hoping for any government posts; I would like to go back to the production sphere. Machine building and aviation industry -- this is where I think my experience could be useful.
