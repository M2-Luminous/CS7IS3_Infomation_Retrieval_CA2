High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said on Tuesday. Foa could not specify when the airfield would be put into operation, except for confirming that technically, the facility was ready to reopen. Everything is ready, only an agreement of the two sides is awaited, she said. The fact that a U.N. plane with U.N. Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi landed at Tuzla airfield on Tuesday has been interpreted as the renewal of the humanitarian bridge. The airfield near Tuzla was closed on May 1992, a month after the war in the former Yugoslav [words indistinct] Herzegovina had broken out between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems. Tuzla is a Moslem enclave in the Serb-controlled territory. Bosnian Serbs, who fear that the airfield may be used for arms shipments to Moslems, insist that their monitors and Russian peacekeepers check all incoming cargo. Foa said last week's humanitarian effort was the most successful since the UNHCR started operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 9,400 metric tonnes of aid delivered last week almost constitute the optimum level of deliveries, she added. In collaboration with UNICEF's organization for children in exile which is based in Zagreb, the UNHCR has launched an operation to bring together children and their parents. Foa said about 20,000 children aged up to 18 were seeking their parents. They have no identification papers and many of them are too little to know who their parents are and where they might be.
