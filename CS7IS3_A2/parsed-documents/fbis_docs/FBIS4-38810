The sitting was brief--approximately two hours. The main topic was the absence of a quorum and the search for a way out of the parliamentary crisis. We recall that 15 deputies had walked out of the last sitting of the National Assembly, protesting the exclusion from the agenda of the question of the Bishkek Protocol, and that it has not been possible to muster a quorum since--34 votes (theoretically they could have been mustered--were the hajji faithful to have returned from Mecca, were the sick to have gotten up from their hospital beds...). As moved by R. Guliyev, three options of a way out of the parliamentary crisis were discussed. The first presupposes, in the speaker's words, "recognition of their responsibility by some of the deputies who walked out and their return to perform their duty." An appeal to the president that the latter, by edict, lower the quorum to 26 votes was the second option, which the deputies found more attractive than the others. The last option was the dissolution of parliament by edict of the head of state. According to the information presented by S. Mirzoyev, Supreme Council Secretariat general secretary, there are in the constitution lacunae in this sphere: It does not contain mechanisms for a way out of such situations. In similar instances in world practice the president avails himself of his right to dissolve parliament. S. Mirzoyev himself considers the second the optimum option. "It is not entirely legitimate, it is true, but it is the most acceptable way," he observed. Some 28 deputies of the 30 present voted for the second option--an appeal to the president. Two members of the National Assembly--Suret Guseynov and Mirgamza Efendiyev--did not take part in the vote. S. Guseynov had earlier moved that the speaker enter into negotiations with the opposition deputies in order to bring them back to the meeting hall. On 25 May the National Assembly once again acquired a quorum. The 15 deputies who had walked out in the past week returned. T. Gasymov delivered a statement on their behalf. He described the walkout of the group of deputies as an entirely normal occurrence in parliamentary practice in keeping with constitutional provisions, the Status of the Deputy Act, and the National Assembly standing orders. "But a campaign of slander was mounted against us in the news media: The opposition is allegedly opposed to an end to the war, is sabotaging the work of parliament, and is preventing a pay raise for the working people," T. Gasymov continued. "We emphatically reject these attacks and, not wishing the needy strata of the populace to suffer from an exacerbation of relations between the authorities and the opposition, we are returning to parliament. We will continue to struggle against the commitment of Russian troops to Azerbaijan under the aegis of the CIS peacekeeping force. We are opposed to `peace for land.' We believe that the Bishkek Protocol is contrary to the interests of the Azerbaijani people and demand its discussion in parliament," T. Gasymov said. Rasul Guliyev, the head of parliament, viewed T. Gasymov's statement as "unobjective." He was followed to the rostrum by Etibar Mamedov. He noted the connection between the approach of the deadline for the signing of the oil contracts and the exacerbation of the domestic political situation and criticized the policy of holdups in privatization: "A dangerous trend toward the concentration of control over economic potential in the hands of three or four persons has emerged." According to E. Mamedov, this trend is fraught with negative repercussions. Deputy E. Mamedov then announced his withdrawal from the National Assembly until he obtains explanations concerning the campaign of persecution on the part of the law enforcement authorities and the news media that has been mounted against him and members of his party. At an impromptu news conference in the lobby of the Supreme Council, Etibar Mamedov declared he had never recognized the "irreconcilable opposition" concept. In the opinion of the leader of the National Independence Party, the opposition should be constructive and open to cooperation. He is, as before, opposed to the commitment of Russian troops in any capacity. After this, parliament finally got down to legislative activity. The Commodity Exchanges Act was adopted without major criticism. After the break, the members of parliament embarked on a discussion of the draft budget of the Azerbaijani Republic for 1994. As Dzhumshud Nuriyev, chairman of the Commission of the National Assembly for Control of the Budget, announced, revenue in the current year will constitute 138.5 billion manat, expenditure, 181.4 billion; a deficit, therefore, of 42.9 billion, which should constitute approximately 7 percent of the gross national product. Dzh. Nuriyev sharply criticized the unduly high, in his opinion, appropriations for maintenance of the organs of state power and administration, which amount to almost 10 percent of budget expenditure. The head of the parliamentary commission sees as the way to reduce the budget deficit the adoption and realization of an official program of privatization, stabilization of the exchange rate of the manat, a flexible monetary policy, and the sale to the public of government bonds. Dzh. Nuriyev observed that capital investments would be allocated mainly for the development of the oil industry and agriculture--sectors in which investments are recouped and profits are produced most rapidly. As ascertained in the course of the debate, members of the National Assembly were worried particularly by how far measures of the social protection of the population had been taken into consideration in the draft. Fikret Yusifov, first deputy minister of finance, emphasized that the government would not go the route of an increase in the minimum wage since this would merely signify a further increase in the gap in income between the high- and low- income categories of the population, not, in fact, improving the position of the latter. According to F. Yusifov, work is under way at this time on the formulation of a mechanism of a rise in salaries according to grade in order to alleviate the position of the strata that are socially the most vulnerable. Summing up the sitting, the speaker briefly analyzed the country's economic situation and charted ways out of the crisis. The fall in production, the high spending on defense, tax evasion on the part of a multitude of commercial and industrial facilities, the delay in the reforms--such are the causes of the Republic's serious situation. It is essential for overcoming the crisis, in R. Guliyev's opinion, to halt the decline and achieve a growth of production and find markets for the sale of the manufactured product. Only high-quality merchandise, for whose production investments are needed, can compete successfully on these markets. Internal credit resources and external capital investments are the sources of the latter. Internal credit resources are at this time down to nothing. Moreover, 200 billion manat of loans not backed by real resources have been granted. For the formation of internal credit resources it is essential to undertake privatization and the formation of stock companies and to channel the funds thus obtained into the financing of the enterprises. But the results will show through only in 6-12 months. Until then it is necessary to liberalize export-import transactions in order to have earned approximately $500-$600 million by the year's end. It is necessary to avail ourselves of credit from foreign governments and international financial organizations. Credit of $1 billion would be sufficient to stabilize the economy and create reserves for its continued normal operation. The conditions of the allocation of foreign credit are a peaceful solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the signing of the oil contracts. Certain progress has been made in both areas. Combat operations have been terminated, and a search for ways to achieve a big peace agreement is under way. The oil negotiations have entered their final phase; the signing of the actual document is expected very shortly. The speaker supported the introduction of a progressive tax system. Concerning wages, R. Guliyev declared that it was expedient to raise them for doctors and teachers and increase student grants and retiree benefits. These strata of society (2 million persons approximately) are among the most vulnerable socially. The corresponding presidential edict will appear soon. Terming the proposed draft budget the "optimum version," the head of parliament called for its approval. But the deputies, of a mind not to hurry, postponed this procedure until the following day. On 26 May the National Assembly passed the 1994 Azerbaijan Republic Budget Act and the corresponding decree. Parliament instructed the Ministry of Economics to present a specific program of economic reforms, and the National Bank, guidelines of monetary policy for 1994. Two weeks were allotted for both.
