It said the companies involved were studying the decision, and would indicate their reaction. Eurofer did not officially react to a statement by Van Miert that the organization had set up a working group to coordinate the activities of the alleged cartel. In London, British steel, which was hit with the biggest fine among the 16 EC steelmakers fined a total of ECU104 million (115 million dollars) by the Commission, said it would probably appeal to the European Court of Justice, but was waiting to receive official notification. Keith Brookman, general secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the main British union in the sector, said he was "shocked and horrified" by the decision. The union totally supports British Steel on the matter and wants the government to intervene to protect British interests, he said. The British company was fined ECU32 million (35.2 million dollars). In Duesseldorf, Germany, the German Steel Federation said Wednesday afternoon that its members that were fined would probably appeal against the decision to the European Court of Justice. Federation president Ruprecht Vondran said "The German steel firms aren't going to accept these decisions without responding." Separately, German industrial group Preussag AG in Hannover said it would oppose the EC decision "by all available means." It said in a press communique that "We cannot understand" why the fine was slapped on Preussag, "since Preussag has not taken part in a pricing or quantities cartel. As far as we know, there has never been such a cartel" in the EC steel industry.
