FBIS4-35784 "drnes108yy_94002" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Nonaligned Movement Ministers on Cyprus, DPRK Nonaligned Movement Ministers on Cyprus, DPRK DPRK Urged To Cooperate With IAEA SK0406030594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0253 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406030594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Cairo, June 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign ministers of nonaligned countries demanded Friday [3 June] that North Korea cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in its efforts to carry out full inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, which the IAEA believes is the center of the North's suspected nuclear ambitions. An official statement, adopted at the end of a four-day meeting here of foreign ministers from 85 nonaligned countries, stressed the need for a peaceful resolution of the issue through continuing dialogue and negotiations among relevant parties, particularly among the United States, the IAEA and North Korea. North Korea had fiercely lobbied the delegates to the 11th conference of nonaligned foreign ministers to make no mention of the IAEA and the North Korean nuclear issue in the draft declaration, according to conference sources. The conference, however, ignored these efforts in an apparent setback for North Korea in the Nonalignment Movement, they said. A delegate from Singapore said it was impossible for the declaration not to mention the IAEA, adding that the Nonaligned Movement would have lost prestige in the international community had it not touched on the nuclear issue. A substantial part of the 66-page declaration, meanwhile, was given over to emphasizing the need to change the direction of the Nonaligned Movement in the post-Cold War era. In the declaration, the nonaligned countries pledged to strengthen cooperation among developing countries on the basis of mutual understanding and reliance and to pursue dialogue with the developed industrial world so as to promote international economic cooperation. Criticizing the rich industrial countries for employing various forms of protectionism in international trade at a time when developing nations are trying to adopt open market policies, the declaration claimed the industrialized world has denied developing states access to advanced technology by blocking technology transfers, citing concerns over military applications. Touching on regional conflicts, the declaration urged the immediate signing of a ceasefire between South and North Yemen, denounced the Israelis for their air raids on Lebanon Thursday and demanded that Iraq respect the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait. The nonaligned foreign ministers decided to hold a nonaligned summit conference in Cartagena, Colombia, in September 1995.
