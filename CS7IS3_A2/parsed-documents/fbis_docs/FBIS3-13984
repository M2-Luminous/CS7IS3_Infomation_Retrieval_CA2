The separatist movement constitutes the biggest challenge the country has faced to its unity and integrity since the dawn of Independence. Is the problem intractable? Is there no way out? Are we sinking into a quagmire? I don't think so. I believe that if some hard decisions are taken, the situation will definitely change, and from the long term point of view, for the better. There is no getting away from the grim reality that infiltrations will have to be stopped or at least very substantially reduced if we are to contain militancy in the valley. The security forces, despite the fact that they operate in an unfriendly and inhospitable environment, are doing a commendable job. Militants are being apprehended and liquidated every day. Seizures of arms, ammunition and explosives is a continuing process. Their figures make an impressive tally. The fact remains that Pakistan has been replenishing the militants' losses. It is a running battle between losses suffered by militants on one hand and fresh induction of trained personnel, Kashmiri and other nationalities on the other. Our objective must be to see that losses are more than the accretions. It is difficult to say if we have arrived at that balance yet. We have to remember that Pakistan has been pumping in enormous resources to keep the Kashmir pot boiling. That being the situation, it is essential that the movement of men and material across the line of control is reduced to a trickle. This was achieved in Punjab. Today, when people talk with a sense of euphoria over terrorism having been contained in that state, they forget that it happened only after the border was virtually sealed by barriers, human and artificial ones, ensuring that the supply of oxygen in the form of weaponry and infiltration was choked. Once that happened, the flame of terrorism naturally withered. How do we translate that in the situation obtaining in Kashmir? The border is being patrolled as effectively as it could be by the Indian Army and the BSF. Yet the configuration of hills being what it is infiltration continues. Fencing the undulating snow-covered peaks is impossible. My suggestion is that the valley should be fenced along the slopes of the hills. It would amount to raising a barrier along the points where the hills descend into the valley. The idea is that we should insulate the valley from the surrounding hills, particularly in the Pir Panjal Range. Once that is achieved, the security forces will be able to decimate the terrorists in the bowl. I am not saying that the hills should be cut off or left unguarded. Movement from the valley to the hills or vice versa should only be through gates which would be manned by the security forces and where any person going either way could be thoroughly frisked. The existing deployment of forces in the hill ranges should continue and operations not only sustained but also stepped up to the extent possible within the existing resources. The strategy should be to stop infiltrations, deal with those who manage to enter the hills and, finally, prevent their entry into the valley at any cost. Fencing paid dividends in Punjab. There is no reason why it should not give results in Kashmir where the militants' losses are being made up all the time. Borders have to be secured and infiltration reduced to the minimum if we are to break the backbone of militancy. Beyond a point pumping in more battalions on internal security cannot lead us anywhere. The Jamaat-e-Islami is the soul of militancy in the valley. We allowed this organisation to proliferate during the last several decades. "Madarsas" were opened by the Jamaat in every nook and corner of the state. The ideological indoctrination of the young minds caused havoc. The youth today frequently seen throwing stones or brandishing weapons are products of the "madarsas". It is unfortunate that when the seeds of poison were being sown, no action was taken and the State Government preferred to look the other way. Jamaat-e-Islami provides the ideological motivation, sustains and supports the separatists. Unless we strike at this institution, it will be futile to expect militancy to be liquidated or even controlled. Jamaat-e-Islami is a banned organisation and yet no action has been taken against its members in J&K. It is unfortunate that the loyalties of a section of the government employees are open to question. They are like Trojan horses in our camp. The security forces feel particularly bitter about the attitude of these functionaries on sensitive issues. They feel hamstrung in their operational efforts in the absence of cooperation from the local administration. These government employees are an unashamed lot and their brazenness is shocking. Some even contribute a certain percentage of their salary every month to the militants' coffers. It is a perverse kind of peaceful co-existence. Their conduct is a great damper to the moderate and sensible Kashmiris who are puzzled that the Government does not take action against its own employees having a nexus with militant organisations. It is an open secret that several senior officers of the State Government signed a petition to the UNO against the Government of India a few years back. What loyalty or commitment could be expected of them is anybody's guess. Why can't we take action against them under Article 311(2) and have these employees sacked? It is not necessary to sack all and sundry. Exemplary action against even fifty employees conveys the message. If there is one lesson to be learnt from Punjab, it is that the State Police holds the key to tackling terrorism or insurgency. There is no doubt that the army and the paramilitary forces made tremendous contribution to controlling terrorism in Punjab. However, only after the Punjab Police was revived by Rebeiro and given the required punch by K. P. S. Gill did the tide turn. Such a transformation is yet to take place in J&K. The State Police has to demonstrate the will to fight the militants. It needs a strong injection of strength, perhaps from outside. We should be able to send hand-picked IPS officers for a minimum of one year tenure to serve in J&K. Accelerated promotions could be the incentive. The modalities can be worked out, but the important thing is to give officers of appropriate calibre to the state at all levels. It is not that J&K Police is incapable of taking on the militants. It is, however, thirsting for dynamic leadership. Once that is given, it would certainly show better results. Time is running out fast in Kashmir. Pakistan is getting desperate. It is high time that a well-coordinated plan of action is worked out and pursued with vigour. *
