Robaina, who yesterday departed for the foreign ministers meeting of the nonaligned nations in Cairo, Egypt, indicated that the manner in which the Miami summit has been orchestrated speaks for itself on what its true goals are. He noted: "That meeting seeks to overshadow what Ibero-America has been doing." He criticized the fact that the United States -- the nation that has convened the hemispheric forum -- did not consult with the nations of the area when it came time to establish the summit's topics of discussion, the date, and the site where it is to be held. Robaina also considered it negative to "want to talk about Cuba when we were specifically excluded, and because of the fact the summit is being held in Miami," where the most aggressive and right-wing sectors of the Cuban immigrants reside. When questioned about whether Cuba would attend the meeting if it were included among the participants, he said "we have no fear of attending any forum we are invited to, even in Miami." He explained that Cuba is not seeking an invitation and even if it were on the list of participants of that summit, it would question the manner in which the summit was convened, and the date and the site chosen for the summit. With regard to the IV Ibero-American Summit to be held from 14-15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, he said that this summit's objectives could turn into a true forum for debate and economic integration. In terms of the nonaligned nations' meeting, he said that Cuba was interested in strengthening this movement "to gain a voice and authority that will allow us to debate on the international level." When questioned about the goal of his visit to the State of Qatar, he said that it was due to an invitation by his colleague who had visited Cuba some months ago. Robaina mentioned his intention to inaugurate a diplomatic mission in that country.
