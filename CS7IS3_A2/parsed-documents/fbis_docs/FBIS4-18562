The prime minister -- not necessarily from the [Northern] League -- would have to be a "staunch federalist." He would chair a governmental committee which would submit to parliament a bill for a new constitution. The second period would be political. The government would last five years altogether. This is the League's latest proposal to overcome the impasse. It was made by Roberto Maroni. Before that, the speakers of both chambers must be elected. The League has asked to meet Forza Italia, the National Alliance, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Lista Pannella on Monday [11 April].
