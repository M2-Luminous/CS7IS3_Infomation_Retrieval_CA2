One of the chief places among the multifaceted areas of that activity belongs to the strengthening of military discipline. Military discipline is one type of state discipline, and has particular significance for the Armed Forces. It performs a role of an organizational nature, and instills orders in and protects the system of relations within the setting of the military collectives. Military discipline is undoubtedly one of the most important constituent elements of the combat readiness of the troops and the functioning of the Armed Forces as a whole. We are in extreme need today of a state of affairs under which every serviceman would knowingly fulfill the laws and norms of morality. Numerous instances, however, testify that we are still far away from that. A considerable number of legal offenses were committed over the first quarter of this year in the ranks. And even though the increase is insignificant compared to the same statistical period for 1993, it must be admitted that a serious situation has taken shape in the Army. The state of military discipline as a whole is eliciting considerable concern in the Air Forces, the troops of the Odessa Military District and the ground forces. The supply of housing and the health of people remain acute problems among the troops. The prevention of absence without leave from units by conscript servicemen and searching for them is not being resolved in satisfactory fashion. The moral-psychological climate in many military subunits is not improving, and there are instances of non-regulation relations and barracks hooliganism; the overall number of instances of non-regulation relations in the Armed Forces of Ukraine this year has increased compared to the analogous period of last year. The number of crimes connected with the theft of state property is increasing. One out of nine crimes is the theft of material assets of military units, organizations and institutions. Why, while constantly and daily occupied with questions of strengthening military discipline, are we forced to admit that there is a drop in the overall level of organization and order and a rise in the crime rate? The unfavorable influence of the social climate that is taking shape surrounding the Armed Forces is being felt first of all. The increased difficulty of the socio-economic situation in Ukraine, the negative processes that are taking place in society and being recreated in the Armed Forces, are leading to an increase in psychological tensions, apathy, confusion and uncertainty for the future in the officer corps, and are affecting the socio-psychological phenomena that constitute the foundation of its moral-psychological state. Military sociological polling on problems of the social sentiments of servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine has shown, at the same time, that the officer corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, despite all of the difficulties and problems of everyday life, still has a certain reserve of professional energy that permits the state and military leadership to count on the maintenance of the necessary level of combat and mobilization readiness in the units and subunits of the Armed Forces. This is testified to by the fact that close to 49 percent of the officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a positive attitude toward their social status today, and are striving for the realization of creative initiative, the discovery of intellectual and physical capabilities and characteristics of will in their service activity. These values occupy the second and third places respectively after the aspiration for material security, which is natural under our conditions. Second, the higher leadership of the Armed Forces still has a reserve of trust among the overwhelming majority of the officer corps. This is the opinion of 72 percent of the servicemen who were polled for their assessment of the reasons for the problems and troubles in the Armed Forces. This credit of trust should be utilized by us as a means of consolidating and rallying the personnel in the contemporary stage of development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, if we do not make use of the patriotic potential of the officer corps, the consequences could be disastrous for the Armed Forces. The results of research also testify to this. We military people, however, in speaking of the immediate and organic dependence of military organization on the state of affairs in society as a whole, do not have the right to be troubled by it ourselves. One also cannot help but see the fact that our methods of activity are not in harmony with the actual circumstances and extraordinary conditions which the Armed Forces and state are in. There are many who approach the problems of today with the measures of yesterday, who do not see the disparity of the decisions that are being made with the way the Armed Forces are living and what people expect of them. That is happening in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense as well. We have also not been able to make a qualitative breakthrough in stabilizing military discipline because certain methods of work that had positive results under the conditions of the Armed Forces of the former Soviet Union have not yet played themselves out today, but have rather become a distinctive kind of brake. A number of generals and officers have had great difficulty getting rid of the approaches of yesterday in the indoctrination of the personnel and the strengthening of discipline. "Force" forms and "command pedagogy" frequently have the opposite effect. The human factor is being taken into account in word but not in deed. The generals and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense, on questions of strengthening military discipline, must in the spirit of personal responsibility: --improve the style and methods of management activity, and raise their personal executive discipline and responsibility for the ultimate results of the training of the troops; --fundamentally rebuild the process of working through and making decisions on questions of military discipline; --promptly review issues raised by the troops, be an example of energetic action to eliminate shortcomings and to strengthen organization and law and order, and raise comprehensively the effectiveness of organizational, executive and legal assurance of the fulfillment of the requirements of the Temporary Regulations of the Armed Forces; --forego inspectional activity and move to organizational-creative activity among the troops on the basis of professionalism, a critical attitude toward each step, and checking of oneself through practical results. This is also important because a significant change in cadres has occurred over the last two years in the regiment--brigade--division--corps--district echelons. The overwhelming majority of senior officers and commanders do not have sufficient practical experience. Shouting, abuse and image cannot train them to lead their subordinate units and formations in competent fashion. This signifies that we must not only learn ourselves, but also teach our subordinates and provide practical assistance in the field; --display constant concern for the professional growth of cadres in subordinate military structures, and provide practical assistance without excessive administration in the formation of a healthy moral atmosphere among the military collectives; and --be highly demanding of those who have a disdainful attitude toward the needs and aspirations of the troops, or who make formalistic assessments of the state of affairs in subordinate units. Our prestige as military leaders and our successes in the key areas of the organizational development of the Armed Forces as a whole will depend to a significant extent on this. Third. We must look in a new way at the problems of the moral-psychological state of all categories of servicemen under the conditions of the destabilization of the situation in the state and the changes that are occurring in the vital activity of the Armed Forces, as is required by the Military Doctrine of Ukraine. There can be no strong military discipline, no official activity in the mastery of military hardware and weaponry, no reliable maintenance of the guaranteed level of combat readiness and battleworthiness without these components. The Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work must take more decisive steps in the direction of the systematic development and formulation of a healthy moral-psychological state among the personnel along with the principal criteria for evaluating it, both in peacetime and in special times. Serious and practical work is needed. A unification of the efforts of all the directorates of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense is expected for the accomplishment of that task. The moral-psychological training of personnel is a constituent element of combat readiness. The commanders and superior officers supervising combat training, however, also have an effect on spiritual processes in the military environment. Very serious work still lies ahead for us in order to see that the moral-psychological factor is activated. It would be expedient, in my opinion, to begin promptly the development of a system for the study, analysis and resolution of problems of the moral-psychological state of the troops. I feel that the question of more profound and scientific study of the problem of the moral-psychological state could be the subject of discussion at one of the practical-science conferences of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense in 1995, after the completion of the first stage of the organizational development of the Armed Forces. This does not signify, however, that this question will only be raised a year from now. The results of work on these problems should be passed along to the military administrative elements at all levels to the extent of the receipt of those results, and they should pass through the prism of military practice during training, maneuvers and exercises. Fourth. The skill of the military personnel to conduct purposeful indoctrination work gains great value in strengthening military discipline under the conditions of the democratization of army life. Practice today demands that we think about the creation of an indoctrination mechanism for strengthening military discipline. We are unfortunately not able to do this to the full extent today, because we do not yet have a scientifically substantiated system of views on the indoctrination of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And that is not just a pretty theoretical reference. Life itself dictates the development of a national theory of the indoctrination process in the Armed Forces. The difficult socio-economic and political situation in Ukraine and around it, around the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the sometime impossibility of foreseeing the development of this situation, the ideological fragmentation and uncertainty in the consciousness of people, the wholesale denigration of all and everything, including the best traditions of the Armed Forces of the former USSR, whence we all came, and the denigration of the young Ukrainian Army are all undermining the morale of the troops and causing a real necessity of urgent measures of a political, economic, organizational, educational and moral-psychological nature to strengthen the moral-psychological climate for servicemen in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The national theory of the indoctrination of the personnel, in my opinion, should reflect all aspects of the indoctrination work with the troops, from the basic aims and concepts and the system of views to the preparation and distribution of cadres of logistical and financial support for the indoctrination process. A prominent place in it should belong to the substance, forms and methods of military indoctrination and the educational mechanism for strengthening military discipline. This should signify, first of all, a thorough knowledge of circumstances at all levels of the army organism, their constant analysis, the clear-cut distribution of duties of all officials on which the improvement of military discipline depends for the officers and generals of the directorates of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense--when what and how each of them should be doing what. The speeches of the generals and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense to the personnel on topical problems in military organizational development must be put into practice. The preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War are opening up broad possibilities for expanding the work to indoctrinate the personnel in the combat traditions of the people who, in unified combat ranks with the peoples of the former USSR and the anti-Hitlerite coalition, made a substantial contribution to the rout of German fascism and Japanese militarism. The martial glories of the warriors of Ukraine should be turned into a continuously running generator for the formation of civil consciousness and patriotism. The system of humanities training for the personnel should be an important factor in the indoctrination process. Much is being done in this area, but there are many shortcomings as well. Significant corrections in both the substance and the forms of the work are required. One cannot circumvent, in speaking of the indoctrination of discipline, the problems of the individualization of that process based on the utilization of the achievements of general and military psychology and sociology. Much cadre, theoretical and practical work lies ahead in this area. I feel, in the area of content, that a system of socio-psychological support for military discipline that would be composed of four basic elements should be created in the Armed Forces. First is a unified system of military professional and psychological selection. Second is socio-psychological support for military-professional activity. Third is the psychological training of all categories of personnel in official positions. Fourth is intensified special and dedicated moral-psychological training, depending on the specific nature of the professional activity. The creation of a system of indoctrinational work in the Armed Forces and an indoctrinational mechanism for the strengthening of military discipline is one of our chief tasks. This requires high competence and initiative, great inner organization and personal discipline from every officer and general in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense. A very great deal already depends on us today if we want to be the Ministry of Defense of a great European power--Ukraine. Fifth, it is important to impart a steadfast social-legal orientation to the process of strengthening military discipline. The priority areas of the military policy of the leadership of Ukraine and the activity of the Ministry of Defense should thus be constant attention toward the problems of social protections for servicemen. There is an urgent need for the rapid development of measures to ensure the stabilization of the social situation of officer personnel, and especially certain socio-demographic and professional categories. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense, notwithstanding the difficult economic conditions, are devoting constant attention to the problems of social security for servicemen. The discussion concerns, first and foremost, carrying out compensatory measures under conditions of inflation and permanent price rises, and the resolution of the housing problem. On the agenda is the development of drafts of such legislation in the sphere of social protections for servicemen. It is very important here to learn to accumulate both our own and overseas experience. We must think seriously about the development of a comprehensive, dedicated program for the social development of the Armed Forces. The essence of them, in my view, should consist of a scientifically substantiated definition of the aims, tasks, indications and measures, the establishment of the deadlines, rates and proportions of the development of the military-professional spiritual and social spheres from the military unit or ship up to the Armed Forces as a whole, and in the long run, the full-scale integration of the social sphere of the Army into the social sphere of all of society. The generals and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine should structure their organizational and indoctrination work among the troops exclusively on the basis of the laws of Ukraine, the edicts and directives of the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and statutes and orders. A situation must be sought in which the law is respected to an identical extent and is upheld by both superior officers and subordinates. The organization of a regulation way of life and the introduction of monitoring of the upholding of law and order should be a prominent direction of our work. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, referring to the participants in the conference, emphasized that "We will never raise discipline if we do not work on prevention. But military-social activity is not a static, fixed structure from a dynamic point of view; it is a unity of processes and phenomena that change and develop. We should thus be concerned with the introduction of scientific approaches to studying the reasons for offenses, predicting the possible development of processes in discipline and devising paramount and long-term preventive measures. In the sphere of social-legal work to strengthen military discipline, we must single out more clearly the principal chains that are linked with the contemporary turnaround stage in the emergence of the Ukrainian state and military organizational development. The main thing here, in my opinion (and this is very important today), is to advance not by means of an escalation of the arrogant conclusions of verbal courage, but rather by means of penetration to the very depths of social-legal problems on the basis of accumulated experience, a scientific approach and their guaranteed resolution in the interests of the person in uniform." Sixth, the successful strengthening of military discipline is possible only with a well-versed knowledge of its real situation. Objective, timely and complete information on violations of regulation order, incidents and crimes has great significance in this regard. This information should be present at all levels of military administration, from the subunit to the Ministry of Defense. The organizational measures of commanders and staffs of the bodies for indoctrination work at all levels should occupy an even more important place in this matter. The institution of regulation order, increased exactingness toward subordinates, improvement of the system of monitoring and the application of disciplinary practice should all be of an effective, educational nature. I feel that it is essential that the officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense analyze diligently the fulfillment of the requirements of orders, directives and instructions pertaining to the strengthening of military discipline, make an assessment of the organization of that activity by commanders, staffs and bodies for indoctrination work, and provide practical assistance on this issue during the end-of-training-period performance evaluations in the ranks.
