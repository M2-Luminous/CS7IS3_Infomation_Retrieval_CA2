Kurdish sources well-informed on the Silopi meeting, however, have stressed to AL-HAYAH that the question of elections was not even discussed by the Turkish delegation and Kurdish leaders Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. They added that the Kurdish leadership itself has not yet decided whether or not to hold early parliamentary elections. The current parliamentary term ends on 1 May next year. [passage omitted] The same Kurdish sources also told AL-HAYAH that the Turkish delegation did not ask the Kurdish leaders to hold a dialogue with Baghdad but rather "expressed its viewpoint" on that matter. The Turkish side was of the opinion that the Kurds "might be able to get more gains from Baghdad because of its regime's weakness and isolation, and that, in this connection, they should take advantage of the fact that they enjoy the protection of the Western coalition and Turkey." The sources also said that the Kurdish leaders affirmed that "they did not at all reject the principle of dialogue but were not willing to accept a solution at any price." They emphasized that Baghdad is refusing to implement UN resolutions including Resolution 688. The Kurdish leaders also reaffirmed that "the Kurds are committed to consultation with all the allies who provide protection for them, including the Turks." [passage omitted]
