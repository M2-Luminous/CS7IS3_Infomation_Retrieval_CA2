The [TEC] Subcouncil on Law and Order, Security, and Stability said the retention or repeal of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act had never been on its agenda, nor had the council sought or received advice on the matter from the police. Earlier the TEC was sharply criticized for an alleged decision to retain detention without trial.
