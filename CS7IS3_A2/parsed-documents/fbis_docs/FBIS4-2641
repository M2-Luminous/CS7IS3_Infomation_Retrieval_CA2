FBIS4-2641 "drchi070_w_94013" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong PRC May Restrict Eligibility for Appeals Court PRC May Restrict Eligibility for Appeals Court HK0904052694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 9 Apr 94 p 1 HK0904052694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Rain Ren] [Text] In a move that has shocked British officials, China is proposing to further restrict the eligibility criteria for Hong Kong's new Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Non-Chinese will in effect be barred from holding the three positions held by "local judges". The Legislative Council has already refused to endorse the 1991 Sino-British agreement on the establishment of the post-1997 CFA because it allows only one overseas judge to join the other five justices who will make up the court. Now it appears that China has an even more restrictive definition of who will qualify to serve as the three "local judges". A senior Chinese official told Eastern Express yesterday that they must be "Hong Kong permanent residents without any right of abode in any foreign countries". This requirement is the same as that which applies to the Chief Justice, who will be the fifth member of the CFA. China's new definition drew an immediate hostile response from a senior government official. "The Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and the Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal are very clear on this point. The words have a simple and plain meaning. If this is the Chinese view they ought to let us know through the formal channels, i.e. the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). If they would do so they would have to explain how this view could be made consistent with what the agreements actually say," the government official said. The mini-constitution, or Basic Law, for Hong Kong after 1997 does not offer any precise definition for the nationality and residence status of the local judges. A second draft bill for the establishment of the FCA is being finalised by the Legal Department and will be submitted to the Executive Council shortly. The Government maintains that the bill will be drafted on the basis of the Sino-British agreement, which states that Hong Kong "local" judges refers to judges who are permanent residents. They may be expatriates and no nationality requirement should be imposed. A locally-based British official said the definition of the word "local" was a difficult and sensitive issue. We do not have a definition of right of abode and of what is 'Chinese' yet. That obviously will affect the definition in terms of judges in CFA." The legislator Simon Ip, former chairman of the Law Society, said the attention of legislators and the legal profession would be focused on any nationality requirement for the three local judges. Ip said that China's requirements would be unacceptable to the legal profession and to himself.
