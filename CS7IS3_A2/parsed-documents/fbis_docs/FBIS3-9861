In the opening of the news conference Koenig made a few remarks, mentioning that he would like to elaborate a report that should be as balanced as possible. He also said that a special role in Romania's admittance as a full member of the Council of Europe was played not merely by the report he elaborated after his previous visit, but also by the constructive position of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the ethnic minorities. Koenig emphasized the fact that the favorable vote cast by the [Council of Europe] parliamentarians proved that they have confidence in the Romanian reform processes and that the goal of his current visit is to verify the way in which our country is complying with the pledges it made. Koenig also said that this is not an exceptional procedure, but rather one that was begun with Estonia and Slovakia and now continues with Romania. The speaker added that he did not come to Bucharest together with Jansson to teach Romania what to do, but rather to lend our country a helping hand in the democratization process. Referring to the ethnic minority issue, the two rapporteurs outlined the fact that this issue is not specific merely to Romania, as a majority of the Council of Europe member countries are facing the same problem, and emphasized that the observance of ethnic minority rights is part of the observance of human rights. They also mentioned that according to the head of the Romanian delegation to the Council of Europe, by 15 April Romania will ratify the European Convention on Human Rights. The rapporteurs also mentioned that fact that the citizens belonging to ethnic minority groups have to be loyal to the country the citizens of which they are and to fulfill their duties, while the respective states have to offer them proper conditions to maintain their ethnic identity. They also assessed that Romania can play a very constructive role as a point of stability on the Balkans and that our country's wish to join the European family [of states] ought to be encouraged. Yesterday Gunnar Jansson also met with the persons attending the preparatory course designed to train experts in ethnic minority issues and interethnic relations, which has been organized by the Council for Ethnic Minorities with the support of the European Center for Ethnic Issues and Social Communication Studies of the Romanian Academy. Jansson appreciated that course, asserting that it is unique throughout Europe. He also appreciated the fact that a national committee was set up to fight racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and intolerance, a body that was established following the recommendations of the 1993 October Vienna conference of the Council of Europe.
