Speaking at a joint press conference with Trade Minister Wu Yi in the Chinese capital during the 13th meeting of the EU [European Union]-China trade committee, Brittan warned China that "any discriminatory diplomatic action versus one of the member countries would be considered a serious question" for the community. (Talks between China and Britain over the transfer of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty broke down in December, when Hong Kong governor Chris Patten presented electoral reforms to the legislature despite the opposition of the Chinese government. China believes the government is trying to change the colony's political composition, strengthening pro-British, anti-China forces to "transform Hong Kong into an independent or semi-dependent political entity that will not be controllable by Beijing," the news agency New China said recently. Hong Kong is scheduled to pass to China in 1997, and the mainland government has warned it will not tolerate reforms being made now by a "lame duck" government they say will make the country "ungovernable" when it comes time for them to take it over. The Chinese were further angered when the British government published accounts of the 17 sessions in the talks between Beijing and London on Hong Kong's future.) Brittan spoke today after Ms. Wu Yi, in response to a question, called Great Britain's approach to the Hong Kong question "not very friendly and not very cooperative," and added that their problems "could not help but affect bilateral trade and economic relations." The sharp exchange came after initial declarations of mutual satisfaction with today's committee meeting, in an atmosphere described as "friendly and pragmatic" that led to "excellent" results. Ms. Wu Yi said "consensus" had been reached on many outstanding questions between China and Europe, and that mutual efforts were being made to resolve others. EU-China trade volume reached 26.1 billion dollars last year, a 50 percent increase over 1992, Wu Yi said. China's exports equaled 11.7 billion dollars and imports totaled 14.4 billion dollars, a 49 percent increase over 1992. "The European Union is China's major exporter after Japan," said Wu Yi. According to EU statistics, which include indirect commercial exchange, the total trade volume amounted to 31 billion dollars, with an 8 billion deficit for the EU. Brittan expressed admiration for China's "notable" progress in making economic reforms, underlining the fact that the EU supports China's claim to join the GATT roundtable "in the interest not only of China but of the entire world." The EU trade commissioner's visit to China ends Tuesday [1 March].
