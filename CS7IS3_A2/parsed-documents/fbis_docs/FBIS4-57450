De Soto told the press that when the Armed Forces are used that way "there is the risk of contradictions, among them human rights violations, corruption over drug trafficking, and the abuse of power and authority." De Soto, who was Fujimori's adviser, said in an interview with the weekly EL MUNDO that the Peruvian president soon realized that "the whip is much more effective than trying to coordinate or reach agreement. He is left with the whip in his hand which may have given him some short-term results but he has not resolved the main problem: A state that governs for very few," said de Soto who cooperated with Fujimori during the first two years of his government beginning in 1990. He said he was disappointed with Fujimori's administration because at the start he represented a government for the great majority and placed great emphasis on the democratization of the country. He then implemented a system that was "less transparent" following the 5 April 1992 self-coup "under the pretext of a better democracy." De Soto, the author of "The Other Path," added: "Instead of concentrating on the difficult task of reforming a state that does not work, he discovered there was, within the state, a group of well-disciplined people he could use: the Armed Forces." Hernando de Soto told a local radio station that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar would follow a more democratic administration than Fujimori "because of his tradition of respecting the rules" if he becomes presidential candidate for the 1995 general elections. He reiterated that Fujimori had democratic ideals for a long time but changed when he realized that "getting his hands on resources, based on vertical power and leaning on the Armed Forces, resulted in important achievements like his near victory over terrorism and his clear triumph over inflation."
