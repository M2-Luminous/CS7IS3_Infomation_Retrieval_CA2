FR940511-1-00075 FR940511-1-00013 First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties described at 40 CFR 261.20 which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity. Second, wastes may be classified as acute hazardous wastes if they are fatal to humans at low doses, lethal in animal studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious illness. Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors enumerated in ยง261.11(a)(3), that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. A substance is listed in appendix VIII if it has been shown in scientific studies to have toxic effects on life forms. Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who generate, transport, treat, store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazard waste management requirements, including the need to obtain permits to operate, are commonly referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue regulations for hazardous wastes as may be necessary to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or landfills that are required to comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators or landfills. Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code, 42 U.S.C. 6921 thru 6939e. EPA standards and procedural regulations implementing subtitle C are found generally at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. Solid wastes which are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities which are overseen by state and local governments. These are the so-called subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA which deals with federal assistance to state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste. Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6941 thru 6949a). EPA regulations affecting subtitle D facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru 247, and 255 thru 258. Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921 (e)(2) requires EPA to determine whether to list, as hazardous, wastes generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of organobromines. In response to this mandate, the Agency undertook a two-year study of the industry and, eventually, listed several wastes from the production of ethylene dibromide (EDB) and methyl bromide. The final rule listing wastes from the production of EDB was published in the Federal Register on February 13, 1986 (51 FR 5327). These wastes are listed in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations section 261.32 (40 CFR 261.32) and are designated by EPA hazardous waste numbers K117, K118, and K136. The final rule listing wastes from methyl bromide production was published on October 6, 1989 (54 FR 41402). These wastes are listed at 40 CFR 261.32 and are designated by hazardous waste codes K131 and K132. Methyl bromide and ethylene dibromide are also on the Appendix VIII list of hazardous constituents.
