The survey, carried out after local elections last weekend and due to appear in the PROFESSION POLITIQUE magazine dated April 8, shows a 10 percent rise in dissatisfaction with the government since a similar survey carried out at the beginning of March. In the intervening period, there has been criticism of his handling of plans to cut the minimum wage for young people which led to a wave of violent protests across France. The survey was carried out among a representative sample of 805 adults contacted by telephone on Monday [28 March]. It found that the government's rating fell fastest among right-wing voters (from 82 to 69 percent) while his rating among people with left-wing sympathies remained practically unchanged at 18 percent.
