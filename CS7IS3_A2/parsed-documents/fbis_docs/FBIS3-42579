Four months have passed since you took over the administration of the oblast. Have you been able to make plans for the tasks you plan to accomplish? What have investigations of the present status of the oblast economy shown. [Aqymbekov] It is true that time moves on. A great deal of time passes before you know it. Present difficulties are well-known to the people. We cannot say that the economic crisis in our country has left our oblast untouched. Conditions are in truth nothing to feel at ease about. During the last seven months, production of industrial products declined by 4.8 percent compared to the same period in 1992. Conditions in agriculture are likewise poor. [Mukhametshe] The primary wealth of the oblast lies in cattle and crops. These two sectors are also in difficulty. Increases in livestock and production are below 1990 levels. What is the reason? [Aqymbekov] This is a good question. The smaller increases in livestock and in production are alarming us. In particular, during the last year 15,800 fewer large cattle, 86,300 fewer sheep and goats, 3,200 fewer horses, and 30,300 fewer pigs were produced. These are not good signs. When we talk about agriculture, we must not forget that, above all, this is the sector which provides food to the people. If the economic crisis continues, it is doubtful that we will be able to get out of our circle of difficulties. Today complacency and irresponsibility have become endemic. There is no profit where there is no order. This being the case, what should we do? We must put our efforts into unwavering fulfillment of the edicts of the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan. We must do this if we are going to put a forceful halt to the deficiencies and the inadequacies which have arisen in our society. We, for our part, are not sitting on our hands: we have taken in hand some specific measures for the development of animal husbandry. We are in the process of carrying out important measures in the delivery and the storage of agricultural products. It will not be possible to put things to rights in a single day. We are thinking in terms of gradually restoring balance. However, it is important that the economic independence of agriculture and industry be protected. We will need the active assistance, above all, of organizations protecting rights in dealing with questions of order. [Mukhametshe] It would seem as if you have formed your own shadow government in the area of agricultural management: rural areas are now managed simultaneously by the Agricultural Inspectorate and by the Awyl Industrial Corporation. Just how efficient is this? [Aqymbekov] At one time everything was in the hands of a totalitarian system. At that time the administrative organs were the support of a command system. Now times have changed. Property has gradually moved from state supervision into the hands of labor organizations and of individuals. Giving orders to them as was once done by administrative organs is contrary to law and is not much needed. We must change and reform administrative organs in accordance with the needs of the times. Based upon just this principle, we divided the former agricultural administration into two parts at the beginning of the year. We went over to an oblast agricultural administration and an oblast inspectorate for the agro-industrial complex. A second structure, the Agro-Industry Commercial Corporation, provides services to enterprises and is involved with organizing their work. Such changes in organizational efforts will certainly be producing results soon. In any case, a great deal depends upon the carrying out of economic reforms. [Mukhametshe] We think that the primary way of getting out of the economic dead end which is exhausting us is the market economy. However, we are encountering managers who are taking advantage of the difficulties for their own benefit. When others are lacking for housing, such people have colluded, purchased houses, and rushed out to buy foreign cars. In particular, they seem to have taken advantage of the first stage of privatization for all kinds of tricks among the people... [Aqymbekov] The requirements of law were not completely observed during the first stage of privatization. It is now becoming clear what kinds of deficiencies there were. Due to a shortage of financing and a lack of building materials, construction of residential housing by the government was halted entirely. Residential housing was privatized. However, some persons in managerial positions got control of many goods at that time. If there were managers concerned about the people, they were in difficulty and unable to look after themselves. It is not proper to be extremely smug and to say that this is what was involved in privatization. There is always a need for a sense of civil honor, humanitarianism, and humane intentions. Do not our people say: people live with people. [Mukhametshe:] In order to raise the level of the oblast economy we have no choice but to carry out exchanges and trade. In this connection, what can you say about external economic connections? Are there goods which you can export? [Aqymbekov] We must systematize our external economic connections. With this goal in mind a special coordinating committee has been formed in our oblast. There are now functioning in the oblast 26 consolidated industries. We are in the process of establishing profitable and effective relationships between our oblast and countries such as China, Turkey, Korea, and Italy. There are some enterprises which have emerged as a consequence. Specific plans are being drawn up regarding various projects, including the construction of a paper combine in Taldyqorghan City. One thousand hectares of sugar beets were planted this year using advanced French technology, 600 hectares were planted using German technology. Likewise, we plan to grow grain on 15,000 hectares using Hungarian methods. Great assistance is being rendered on the part of the government of the Republic with regard to the introduction of advanced technology designed to increase agricultural productivity. Our oblast in economic terms has an agrarian character. For that reason, we import much more than we export. There are outstanding export products. Among the various kinds of products, demand for storage batteries and sugar beets is the greatest. We can meet, at certain levels, demand for onions, meat, and milk products. We are seeking new channels of communication in our efforts to deliver needed goods and implements to the people of the Zhetisu, utilizing all our existing resources. [Mukhametshe] It is proper that foreign investors have been brought in. However, Taldyqorghan is a border oblast. It is possible that among those flowing into the oblast from outside are certain other persons along with those with friendly ideas. In particular, the people have been extremely alarmed by the news that many from our great neighbors to the east are settling in the oblast. [Aqymbekov] We must rely on foreign investors for the development of the oblast economy. The geographic position of the Zhetisu is very convenient for external relations. We must utilize this productively. I understand that there are things alarming the people. However, should we fail to take advantage of favorable circumstances? There are the appropriate authorities: they will look into the circumstances of the question. There are rumors that persons from a neighboring country have been entering illegally. This is not true. To be sure, there are people entering the country. Most of them are involved in commerce. In short, we are looking into this question carefully. It is proper to avoid raising the alarm among the people or stirring things up with idle words and lending credence to every rumor we hear. [Mukhametshe] There is another question which I am dying to ask. In recent years our relatives and kinsmen in foreign countries have migrated. Among them are masters of various specialties. However, we have been unable to place those newcomers in their chosen specialties. Why have they been sent out to herd sheep? Is there no other possible occupation for a Kazakh than herding sheep?... [Aqymbekov] It is to be sure a joy that our kinsmen in distant places are returning to the homeland. What Kazakh is there who is not rejoicing about this when they encounter one another? Is there not the proverb: if one extra sheep is born, a little bit more wormwood will grow?... Since 1991 more than 850 families have moved to our oblast from Mongolia and the CIS countries. Just recently 126 families from Iran have settled in the Zhetisu. We are doing everything we can to help them. We are providing them aid in the form of housing, livestock, material goods, and money. We are providing a work placement for our migrant kinsmen. We try to place them in area of their specialty. Placing those with the specialties of teacher or doctor is not very difficult. However, it is not easy to place our relatives with specialties in the agricultural sector. Second, everywhere workers are being laid off in connection withthe transition to a market economy. For that reason we have taken in hand the retraining and preparation of our migrant kinsmen in needed specialties. Just now 76 persons are acquiring new specialties in the oblast. As for sending them off to herd sheep: herding sheep is our traditional occupation. Have we not for generations, when asking how are you, first about the cattle and then about the person. It is not proper to denigrate this occupation or to detract from it. You understand that your question is out-of-date. In those days did we not scare a child who was poor at his school work with the occupation of herdsmen?.. In my view there are no good and bad jobs. [Mukhametshe] In any case, when the president named you governor, he gave you all [necessary] powers. The new governor has the right to form a new administration. You are working with the old apparatus. Are you satisfied with their work? What changes have you made in cadre matters? [Aqymbekov] I was born in the oblast. I knew from before not only the circumstances in the Zhetisu region and the state of the economy, but most of the cadres in the administration. The spirit of the times and the changes taking place require competence from managers and specialists, new thinking and a carefully considered citizenship. For that reason, in choosing and in placing persons to govern the nation, my first priority was whether or not they embodied such characteristics. During part of last year I held an official post in Almaty. It is now a time of rapid social change. During these times the lives of most of us and out views of life have changed. During the time that I have been governor of the oblast, I have looked with very critical eyes on some serving with me. I wanted to determine what kinds of changes had taken place in themselves, in their views, and in their work styles. I noticed that many cadres were unable to work at levels demanded by life. In any case, it seems as if some citizens have not put down their foundations distant from what is old. For that reason it is clear that changes are being made in the composition of cadres. Relying on those able to meet the demands of the times, I am making an effort to fulfill the great tasks which stand before me. I am putting new thinking young people into the positions of cadres who learned their lessons from yesterday. [Mukhametshe] You are a regular reader and regular author of YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN. You have given many interviews. You have written articles on specific problems. We thank you for your activism. As you know, there is the rubric in the paper: Be a Governor Close to the People. Do you like these words? [Aqymbekov] If I can go a little more deeply into your thought: a governor is only a person who holds a leading public office. But how far from the people is that official personage? Only after becoming part of the people was he named governor. Thus, I think it natural that a governor should remain close to the people. From that point of view, I think that I am never far from the people. However, everything else depends upon the person in power. For example, are we not products of the trials of life along with such characteristics as thought, knowledge, ideas, humanitarianism, and control. I think that your papers rubric aimed at a new time, at a new point of view. [Mukhametshe] Governor Aqymbekov, what should the Kazakhstans state ideology be like? Recently we have become embroiled in history and are taking all periods into consideration. Whatever the circumstances, Kazakhs are divided into clans and are endeavoring to praise their ancestors. What do you say to this? [Aqymbekov] It is a social law that there should be a national state ideology for a sovereign country. However, what should this ideology be like? If we begin the discussion of the question from this point of view, and, if we look primarily at the past, we will commit a great error. This is the same as not tying up the lattice work of a felt yurt and letting an old tent rot. For that reason our national ideology must develop from our Constitution, from the supreme law of the land. If we are unable to establish a new national-state worldview, if our thoughts are full of a hodgepodge of ideas, it is possible that we will encounter a spiritual crisis. If we do not think now about future generations, then our struggle for independence, and all our good intentions, will be in vain. The riches of Kazakhstan are not just for present generations. They must become the property of future generations too. A Republic of Kazakhstan ideology will open the way for universal Kazakhstan feelings of pride. To this end, it is right to support properly all of those with good intentions in the formation of ideas. We must know our history. Our wise people have said: if a horse is driven away, it is the enemy; if it pounds, it is the wind. For that reason, we must reject division into clans and put effort into making our independence constant. There were not a few occasions in the past when we were divided from one another. Let us somehow become a powerful nation with strong unity. For that reason it is proper that we devote our entire lives to this goal. [Mukhametshe] Thank you!
