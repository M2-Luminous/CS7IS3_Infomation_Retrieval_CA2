The latest issue has been produced by a new team catering for the ruling Fatherland Party. According to Toomas Leito, RAHVA HAAL's former editor, the collective has been punished for refusing to serve as this party's instrument. Following Estonia's proclamation of independence, Edgar Savisaar's government made RAHVA HAAL a state joint-stock company. Throughout this period RAHVA HAAL has been the Estonian state newspaper. It has upheld its interests and those of the Estonian nation vigorously, forthrightly, and not always objectively in my view. In terms of its number of subscribers it is Estonia's second newspaper. While ceasing to be an official press organ de jure it remained one de facto. But the journalists, primarily the editor and the editorial collegium, did not identify the state with the latest government, or the Estonian nation with the ruling Fatherland Party. Journalists consistently opposed the government's economic and social policy, And the authorities evidently grew tired of putting up with this opponent. RAHVA HAAL was put up for privatization. Young and rich entrepreneurs from Fatherland Party circles won the tender. But the "victory" was so equivocal that the privatization council, scared at society's abrupt response, immediately canceled the results of the tender. Following the abortive cavalry charge with kroon in hand the government carried out a purely political attack -- and dismissed Editor Toomas Leito. Haste went hand in hand with carelessness, a breach of the law -- the first order had to be abrogated and a new one issued, formulated in more precise terms. Then the whole collective bar one man handed in their resignation. They began publishing the newspaper EESTI SYNUMID [name as transliterated] (Estonian News) with Toomas Leito as its editor. Even the protection of Europe's organizations of journalists did not have an effect although the government is usually sensitive to European opinion. In last fall's municipal elections, the Fatherland Party suffered a major defeat. There will be parliamentary elections in a year's time, and the Fatherland Party is in a hurry to assert its ideological monopoly. "While examining the most acute problems of the day from the position of the poorest population groups, RAHVA HAAL is failing to take notice of key aspects in the recent past," a member of the Fatherland Party asserts. That is unforgivable for a newspaper that is geared to the opinion of the poor, in other words the opinion of most voters, and enjoys their trust. According to official statistics, 5 percent of the republic's inhabitants are rich and around 20 percent are middle class, while the rest are poor.... Will the government not try to do the same to other newspapers? "We are particularly alarmed by the Russian-speaking press, which sometimes engages in patently antistate propaganda (MOLODEZH ESTONII, ESTONIYA)," the Fatherland Party's official organ stressed. If the Fatherland Party starts combating the Russian-speaking press by publishing its own "pro-Estonian official" newspaper, that is an exclusively party matter. But the easier and more tempting option is to make short shrift of ESTONIYA and MOLODEZH ESTONII. That is possible now that RAHVA HAAL has effectively been knocked out.
