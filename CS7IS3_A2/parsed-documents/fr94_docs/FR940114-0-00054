FR940114-0-00054 FR940114-0-00020 Technical Comments Comment: The Department has not justified its proposal to require a lower load duration factor for designing wood members and fastenings to resist wind forces than is specified in the 1991 edition of the National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS) published by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). Response: The Department agrees that the higher factor of 1.6 in the NDS has been justified by research completed by AFPA for wood members subjected to short duration loads of 10 minutes or less. This is generally recognized as the maximum period for exposure of structures to wind forces. In addition, the 1991 NDS has already been adopted without exception by certain model code agencies. However, cyclic testing to evaluate fasteners and connectors has not yet been completed. Preliminary results suggest that a higher load duration factor may be appropriate. Therefore, the Department will accept the higher load duration factor of 1.6 on an interim basis and will recognize the 1991 NDS without exception in this final rule. The Department intends to monitor this research and may propose a different load duration factor for fasteners and connectors in the future, subject to the research and test results. Comment: There is no basis for the 12'' limitation and prescriptive requirements for eave and cornice projections; their implementation would inhibit design innovations. Response: While longer eave and overhang projections will subject trusses, fasteners, and connectors to significant increases in design loads, and thereby increase their likelihood of failure under extreme wind conditions, the Department agrees that the provision should be removed because it does restrict innovation, and truss and home manufacturers are capable of designing roof systems and connections to resist the higher wind forces. However, manufacturers that use larger projections than 12 inches are cautioned to review their designs carefully to assure that all components and fastenings are adequate to resist the design pressures specified in ASCE 7&hyph;88 or the table in ยง3280.304. Comment: The prescriptive requirements for sidewall-to-roof and floor connections using steel strapping or brackets should be replaced with performance criteria that permit the use of alternative methods of connection, such as structural sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor. Response: In general, the Department agrees that the use of performance-based standards is preferred. However, on-site investigations of the damage from Hurricane Andrew revealed that current designs using 30 gage straps failed. Based on the above information, the Department has retained the prescriptive requirement for strapping in high wind areas, but will permit to be used a combination of strapping and structural sheathing that overlaps the roof or floor, instead of only steel straps or brackets, provided the sheathing and its fastenings are demonstrated by calculations or tests to have equivalent strength and resistance to the design wind uplift forces. Comment: The use of the 1.5 factor of safety for design of anchoring systems is not consistent with ASCE 7&hyph;88. Response: The Department concurs that there is no provision in the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard for increasing the wind pressures for the design of anchoring systems to resist overturning and sliding forces. Therefore, the anchoring design provisions for Wind Zones II and III, which are based on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 requirements, will not require the application of the 1.5 factor of safety to be applied to the design wind drag and uplift pressures. However, the 1.5 factor of safety will continue to be required for calculating the required resistance of anchoring systems for Wind Zone I, since the design lateral and uplift wind forces remain based on the current standard, which is lower than all model building codes. Comment: The Department should clarify whether new wind uplift design loads in the Table (in ยง3280.305) are gross or net uplift loads. Response: The uplift wind loads in the table are the full or ``gross'' loads. Gravity or dead loads may be deducted from these loads when calculations are prepared using the design pressures in the table. Comment: Existing truss testing procedures in ยง3280.402(c)(2) should be clarified as to: (1) The acceptability of existing inverted truss testing procedures for evaluating new wind uplift design loads; (2) whether vertical live and gravity roof load testing must still be conducted with trusses in the upright position when uplift forces are higher than downward loads; and (3) whether eave loads are to be applied simultaneously with roof uplift loads. Response: (1) The inverted test method may continue to be used on an interim basis while the Department evaluates results of an industry study to compare results of the existing test method, which applies load to the bottom chord of the truss, to results obtained from applying the load to the top chord of the truss. (2) Testing must continue to be conducted in the upright position, because the loads are applied to different members (chords) of the truss. (3) Uplift loads are to be applied to truss eave projections when uplift loads are applied to the truss bottom chords during each loading phase required by ยง3280.402(c)(2). Comment: A new provision should be added requiring a professional engineer to prepare and certify wind load designs and calculations.
