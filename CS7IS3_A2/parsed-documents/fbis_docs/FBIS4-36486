This move comes hours after Amman and Israel reached an agreement in Washington to define future trade and economic relations between the two countries, as our correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi reports. To clarify the reasons for this cabinet reshuffle, we contacted the Jordanian prime minister and asked him about the significance of the timing of the reshuffle and its connection with the Washington agreement. [Al-Majali] I do not think it has any connection with that. The real significance is that we feel that the entire region is passing through a very delicate situation regarding the possibility of the existence of a new regional order and the much talked about Middle East market. Therefore, the executive and legislative authorities must cooperate and the whole nation must take a common stance. ['Awn] Mr. Prime Minister, Syria has maintained that the Jordanian-Israeli agreement is a violation of the principle of comprehensive peace. Is it really? [Al-Majali] Sir, first we do not think that Syria feels like that. We and Syria are in full agreement. We have always maintained each of the four tracks has its own peculiar character, and therefore the acceleration on any of the tracks is natural. We are fully committed to a comprehensive solution on all fronts, including, of course, the Syrian Golan Heights. This is a basic principle of our policy. We believe in a comprehensive solution. But the speed of movement on any track is good for the other tracks and not harmful to them. ['Awn] You were quoted as saying in a parliamentary session that the Syrians have reached an agreement with the Israelis on the principle of withdrawal from the Golan. On what did you base your statement? [Al-Majali] The statement was based on remarks made here and there, particularly the statements made by the American sponsor, his repeated visits, and the possibility of another visit. All these indicate that there is a possibility of progress on the Syrian-Israeli track. We hope it will happen, we strive for it, and we desire it because we think it is good for all of us: for Syria and for us.
