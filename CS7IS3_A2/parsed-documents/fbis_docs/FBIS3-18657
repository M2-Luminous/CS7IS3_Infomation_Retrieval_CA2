[Kliridhis] Right now, we have given the UN secretary general's representative our views on two basic issues: Safe access to the fenced-off part of Famagusta, along with which we also include the issue of the security of the fenced-off part under UN control. We cannot build by day, while they go in and steal by night. There are two issues: Safe access and the security of the fenced-off area. We believe the United Nations should have responsibility for both and that there should be access through an area under UN control. We have also given our views on the second issue of the timetable the secretary general wants. We have adopted the clear position that if we reach an agreement, as soon as we sign it the entire fenced-off area of Famagusta should be turned over to the United Nations and placed in UN custody. According to the agreement [on accepting the confidence-building measures], residents should begin to return within two months in order to proceed with repairs and so on. These are our positions. I do not know what the Turkish side's positions are, but if they are positive I would know about it. So they have positions that are different from ours. [Kaouris] Do you see the picture becoming clear in the next two to three weeks and things going somewhere with either positive or negative results? [Kliridhis] As far as I know, the secretary general will now prepare a report, which, as both sides have been told, will be preliminary. In three weeks, he will submit another report that will clarify things. Don't forget that the time limit is two months. In three weeks, the new report should say whether views have converged on the points that he has stressed are substantive for the implementation of the confidence-building measures. [Kaouris] Why do you think Rauf Denktas does not accept these measures? The Turkish Cypriots have much to gain from them. [Kliridhis] I believe the Turkish side--and this was crystal clear--regarded these measures as much more in our favor because they return the entire fenced-off part of Famagusta, which means all the municipal boundaries of Famagusta. Denktas does not seem as interested as we might think in operating the airport; he does not know what airlines will use it. The airlines will use it if there is traffic. [Kaouris] When we discuss access, do we mean a road, a big area, or merely the road that would have led to Famagusta? [Kliridhis] We mean an area that will include a road and will be under UN control. [Kaouris] Would it have some guardposts through which we would cross? [Kliridhis] Yes. [Kaouris] Does the international element, particularly the Americans and the British, play some positive role at this phase and do you see at least some indications that its efforts are turned toward Turkey? [Kliridhis] We should first define the UN role. There is no doubt that referring to the United Nations I mean the permanent Security Council members. There is unanimity among the permanent members on the confidence-building measures, and they are watching closely to establish which side is trying to torpedo their implementation. The latest joint move by the Americans and Russians stresses this thing -- that is, that the United Nations, or, if you like, at least these two permanent members of the Security Council will work to realize the confidence-building measures. But other permanent members also support the confidence-building measures and warn that it would benefit no one to reject them. I am telling you what the permanent Security Council members say. Consequently, the confidence-building measures enjoy the support of the permanent Security Council members. [Kaouris] Has the Russian element intervened actively recently? Lamb [U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue] gets a call to go to Moscow. How do we interpret that? [Kliridhis] It seems that for some time, Russia left the initiative on international issues completely to the U.S. element. But now it appears that we are entering a new period in which, with regard to particular areas, Russia has decided to return to the position of the big power that should be playing a role. We saw this in Serbia. The Russian intervention had two interpretations: First, it appeared that a NATO military action in Serbia could jeopardize U.S.-Russian relations, and it seems that this was considered quite seriously. Russia pointed out that it had both a say and influence in that area and intervened in the direction of the Serbs so that in return, a peacekeeping force of 400 men would be dispatched from Russia to remove the heavy weapons. You can see that it was the first cease-fire agreement that was kept; none of the others were kept. You cannot say that this wasn't due to the Russian intervention. Second, the U.S. coordinator left Washington for Moscow to be briefed and to align his policy. This is very important. Why should the U.S. official visit Moscow? It is also very important for another reason: All those who were dealing with the Cyprus issue earlier, Nelson Ledsky and the others, made stopovers. If they were coming from the United States, they stopped in London and had talks with the British Government before going to Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. This time, there was no visit to Cyprus. He did not leave Moscow and go to Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. His trip was Washington, Moscow, and back. The question being raised is: Whose idea was this visit? Was it a thought by the Americans to meet and coordinate with the Russians, or was it Russia's demand to which the Americans responded? This is the first time we have seen the man who is entrusted with coordinating the Cyprus issue go in another direction and make a joint decision instead of doing the customary triangle. The United States appears to be realizing that for particular problems to be solved, it should cooperate with Russia. [Kaouris] The foreign news agencies reported that Lamb was invited by Moscow... [ellipses as published] [Kliridhis] He responded. Don't forget that some time in the past, when the Russians began demanding a say, the Americans refused completely. There is a big difference now. Whether or not the Russians asked for this--they might have asked for it--it is now proven that Russia says there are particular areas in which my own involvement is also needed to solve the problems.
