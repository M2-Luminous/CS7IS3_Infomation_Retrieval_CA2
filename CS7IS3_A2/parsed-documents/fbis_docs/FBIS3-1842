A draft labor law submitted today by the State Council to the country's legislature for deliberation stipulates that all laborers are entitled to rights to choose jobs, to be paid, to rest, to have job protection and to receive job training. Laborers' rights should be equal, irrespective of differences in nationality, race, sex and religious belief, the draft said. The law will also authorize employers to fire employees within certain limits, when the enterprises are in true difficulties. "An enterprise on the brink of bankruptcy or in grave difficulty may reduce working staff, provided that the decision is agreed upon by the trade union organization in the enterprise or after consultation with all the staff members," the draft said. Li Boyong, minister of labor, explained the draft to the legislators at the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which started today. "The rights of enterprises to dismiss employees for reasons other than employees' faults will guarantee the legal rights of employers to run businesses independently and will give enterprises a certain edge in market competition," Li Boyong told the meeting. However, the limits set for job reductions are "necessary for China's social stability," he said. Because China has far more laborers than required, and such a disparity cannot be changed in a short time, massive job reductions would lead to social chaos, he added. The current session will conduct a preliminary review of the draft law. The draft law also rules that the contract system will be the fundamental form in shaping China's labor relations between employers and employees, in both private and publicly owned enterprises. "This is based on China's experiments in implementing the systems and experiences of other market economies," Li Boyong said. There are already 25 million contract laborers in China, Li said. The draft also accepts in principle the form of "collective agreement" -- which is reached by the trade union organization and the enterprise on matters of payment, working conditions and welfare for the employees. This system will be mainly implemented in private enterprises. Publicly-owned ones may follow the steps after property rights are cleared and operation improved, Li said. The minister of labor said that the primary reasons to make the law are "to protect the legal rights of laborers, establish and maintain stable and harmonious ties between employers and employees, and promote China's labor system in line with the establishment of the socialist market economy." He said that without a systematic legal system to protect working people's rights, China has in recent years witnessed quite a few labor disputes in enterprises, and some "major and grave" labor accidents, especially in private enterprises. He said workers have been forced to work long hours, or their pay cut without reason in some private enterprises. Some workers have even been humiliated or beaten by bosses from outside China's mainland, he said. Li said the draft has been revised more than 30 times since its first version in 1978. The provisions have all been tried out and accepted by all regions, industries, and enterprises of different forms of ownership. International labor conventions and common practices in market economies have also been referred to in the drafting, Li said.
