FBIS4-1385 "drafr082_a_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Leader Kanyarengwe Protests International Condemnation RPF Leader Kanyarengwe Protests International Condemnation EA2704191994 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French to Rwanda 1040 GMT 27 Apr 94 EA2704191994 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura French BFN [Excerpts] The president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, held a news conference yesterday which focused on our country's current situation. He answered journalists' questions on the cause of the resumption of hostilities -- after a cease-fire which was announced by the RPF and subsequently violated by government troops -- the credibility of the negotiations, the continuing massacres in our country, and on the politicians who are responsible for the atrocities. [passage omitted] By announcing the cease-fire, the RPF showed its predisposition for peace, but the war will always be inevitable as long as its causes are not removed. This is a condition for any other cease-fire. In fact, the RPF president went on, the international community first should solve the causes of the war before pushing the RPF to negotiate. Saying that the war should stop is not enough. If the international community had the will to take measures against our war's causes, notably by energetically condemning and actively opposing the continuing massacres in our country, then the international community would have a right to tell the RPF to stop fighting the (?government) forces. Therefore, it is not honorable for the international community to keep silent in the face of these horrible massacres, whose perpetrators pursue survivors inside hospitals and finish them off. The dishonorable attitude of the international community contradicts the need for the cessation of hostilities. If foreign nationals and UN employees were evacuated by their troops during the first hours of the massacres, why then should the RPF not do the same for Rwandans who have been abandoned by those same foreign troops [words indistinct]? That is a question the international community should ask itself, before making declarations on keeping the RPF from fighting those criminals who launched themselves to power in our country. [passage omitted] Concerning war news, the RPF president recalled that the fighting was turning in favor of the Rwandan Patriotic Army on all fronts. The prefectures of Byumba and Kibungo are entirely under the control of the RPF, as well as most of the prefectures of Ruhengeri -- not to mention several communes in rural Kigali and important strategic positions in the capital.
