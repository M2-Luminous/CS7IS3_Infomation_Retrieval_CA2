Article 2 Small-scale trade with the Taiwan Region (abbreviated hereafter as small-scale trade with Taiwan) refers to commodity trade carried out according to the pertinent provisions between residents of the Taiwan Region and designated mainland coastal ports (in Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanghai). Article 3 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be conducted only between residents of the Taiwan Region and mainland companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan. Taiwanese residents refer to those who hold the pertinent status identification, such as valid and complete Taiwanese fishing licenses and ID cards. Article 4 Companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan should be approved by responsible foreign trade organs in coastal provinces and cities authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (abbreviated hereafter as MOFTEC), as well as being registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan are permitted to conduct only small-scale trade with the Taiwan Region, not ordinary import-export business. Article 5 The import-export quota for small-scale trade with Taiwan is $100,000 per ship per trip. Article 6 The commodities involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan are limited to those not subject to state franchise, prohibition or import-export restrictions, and those not under import-export quota licensing control. As to the few commodities under quota licensing control that must be exported, companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan should submit them to the higher-level MOFTEC organ for examination and approval formalities according to the pertinent regulations on ordinary trade and trade with Taiwan and, after approval and consent, apply for and receive export licenses and customs-document releases. Article 7 Imports involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan are restricted to commodities whose place of origin is Taiwan. Customs should when necessary check and approve product-origin certificates for imported commodities. Article 8 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be carried out only on Taiwanese ships under 100 tons (including 100-ton ships). Taiwanese ships refer to carriers officially registered in the Taiwan region that can carry out normal operations and navigation at sea. Commodities carried on ships engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan that are not sold should be returned on the original ship. Article 9 Small-scale trade with Taiwan may be carried out only in the designated ports. The ports for small-scale trade with Taiwan will be designated by responsible foreign trade agencies in coastal provinces and cities authorized by MOFTEC, such as local public security, border inspection, customs, communications, and Taiwan affairs. The authorized responsible foreign trade organs in coastal provinces and cities should promptly report to MOFTEC for the record their locally designated companies and ports involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan, as well as notifying the Customs Office and State Council Taiwan Affairs Office. Unless MOFTEC objects within 30 days of receiving all data on companies and ports involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan, the reported cases will automatically go into effect. Article 10 Small-scale trade with Taiwan should be conducted mainly in the form of barter, with the prices of all bartered commodities being calculated in U.S. dollars. Small-scale trade with Taiwan conducted in cash should be settled with foreign currency converted with the approval of the state. All cash earned by both sides should be handled according to the pertinent state foreign-exchange control provisions. All export-earnings foreign exchange will be retained by companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan. Article 11 All import-export commodities, ships, and sailors involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan must accept supervision and control by local customs, border inspections, and other joint port-inspection departments, as well as paying taxes and fees per regulation. No commodities or ships involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan may display symbols that violate the "one China" (the PRC) principle, such as words, flags, insignias, or names. The articles for personal use carried by individual sailors should be limited to reasonable amounts for personal use. Sailors may not carry articles which under provisions are prohibited entry or exit, and individuals may not use ships to carry articles for others. Equipment, fuel, and materials necessary for navigation by ships that are brought in should be taken out on the original ship. Such articles may not be involved in commodity exchange. Commodities not declared to customs or given inspection releases may not be loaded or unloaded. Article 12 Except as the state provides otherwise, import-export commodities involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan are subject to preferential customs tariffs in line with the "PRC Customs Import-Export Tariffs" and taxation according to the "PRC Product-Tax Regulations" and "PRC Value-Added Tax Regulations," as well as being subject to control by the pertinent customs tax provisions. Article 13 When companies engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan violate these regulations, the original organs that examined and approved them can penalize them based on the seriousness of the case by warnings, severe warnings, and revocations of their operating authority. Penalties involving revocations of operating authority should be reported promptly for the record to MOFTEC and the Customs Office. As to companies and ports involved in small-scale trade with Taiwan that are not qualified for such trade, MOFTEC is authorized to revoke their operating authority. Violations of customs provisions will be investigated and prosecuted by customs according to the "PRC Customs Law" and pertinent laws and regulations. And such violations that constitute crimes will be turned over to judicial organs for investigation and fixing of criminal liability. Article 14 The responsible foreign trade organs in provinces and cities engaged in small-scale trade with Taiwan should, prior to the end of January each year, sum up and report to MOFTEC their previous year's small-scale trade with Taiwan. Article 15 These regulations are subject to MOFTEC and Customs Office interpretation, oversight, and enforcement. Article 16 These regulations take effect the day on which they are promulgated. Where there are inconsistencies between these regulations and pertinent ones written previously, these regulations will be the standard.
