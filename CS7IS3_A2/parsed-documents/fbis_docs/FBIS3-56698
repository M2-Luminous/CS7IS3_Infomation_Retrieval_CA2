Andrey Kozyrev said that defense of Russians' rights in the former Union republics is one of the main strategic issues in Russian foreign policy. In his opinion, the question of dual citizenship has now become a key element here. The minister stressed that it has of late proved possible to secure greater understanding on this score. Among other most pressing problems the minister pointed to the need to boost the effectiveness of existing cooperation mechanisms and to create new ones, as well as to develop a short-, medium-, and long-term strategy for forming an economic union. The minister spoke about military and military-technical cooperation and underlined the need to retain a Russian military presence in this region. "We should not leave regions that for centuries have been spheres of Russian interests. We should not be frightened of these words." The "security vacuum" created as a result of the Russian troops' withdrawal will "inevitably be filled by other forces, by no means always friendly forces, moreover, and in many cases directly hostile to Russian interests," the minister stressed.
