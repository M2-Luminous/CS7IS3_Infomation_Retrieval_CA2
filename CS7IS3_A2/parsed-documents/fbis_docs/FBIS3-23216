Monsanto denied that the URNG was responsible for the explosion, adding that the URNG has no men in the area and therefore could not participate in that terrorist attack. The rebel commander said that in an attack of this type, one cannot rule out the participation of criminal groups who seek to stop the peace dialogue, and they might be linked to the retired military men, who do not want to see an end to the 33 years of warlike conflict in Guatemala. For a long time now, Monsanto added, the previously mentioned military men have caused divisions in the Army, and therefore, one cannot ignore their interest in the suspension of peace talks between the URNG and the government. Monsanto referred to the case of Quilo Ayuso, who during his farewell ceremony at the Polytechnic Institute, pointed out there was division among the military forces.
