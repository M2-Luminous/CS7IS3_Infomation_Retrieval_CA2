FBIS4-19883 "drweu079_p_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 GREECE Spokesman on Reference to National Issues Spokesman on Reference to National Issues NC2304204594 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network in Greek 1700 GMT 23 Apr 94 NC2304204594 Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos commented in Thessaloniki today on the prime minister's [U.S.] visit. Our correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report. [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I believe that the statement made by President Clinton to the journalists is satisfactory with regard to all the issues concerning us -- that is, primarily on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, Greek-Albanian relations, the Patriarchate's position, and the prospects of the Cyprus issue. It is a significant fact that President Clinton recognizes the Greek sensitivities and, if you like, the soundness of the Greek position and that he attaches so much importance to Cyrus Vance's mission and that of Matthew Nimetz, who will be coming to supplement the Vance mission. [Karzis] On Albania, Athens is waiting for the upcoming crucial Papoulias-Serreqi meeting while taking continuous steps to protect the Greek minority. [Venizelos] The protection of the Greek minority's rights is a self-evident prerequisite, respect for international law and human rights is non-negotiable; and this, of course, concerns all the levels at which this issue is raised. [Karzis] Concerning Greek-Turkish relations, Mr. Venizelos said that Greece must be sparing and careful when referring to Turkey's internal political problems. However, he pointed out that Ankara is trying to export these problems. [Venizelos] What concerns us about the recent local elections in Turkey is that we hope there are no provocations, no violations of international law, and that the historic existence and international status of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is respected.
