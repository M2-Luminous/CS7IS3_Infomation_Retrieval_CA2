SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is revising its Transportation Planning Process. The revised process will more effectively link the transportation access needs identified in BLM resource management plans with the respective State's Department of Transportation (SDOT) Statewide Transportation Plan. The purpose is better coordination in fulfilling the intent and requirements of Section 135, 23 U.S.C., as amended by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Further, the BLM will coordinate with State, county, Tribal, and local governments to identify and designate a Land Management Highway System (LMHS). The LMHS will consist of those public roads that provide major public access to BLM-administered public lands, resources, and facilities. Denise Meridith, Deputy Director.
