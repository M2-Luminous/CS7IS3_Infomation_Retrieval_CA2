"I am truly sorry for the failure of the government to let the people know the correct contents (of the modification), giving rise to misgivings," Yi said. In a statement, the premier said he had to acknowledge a loophole that existed in the government's initial negotiations with UR authorities. The government ought to have included supplemented and corrected items in its initial schedule during the UR negotiations last December, he said. It also was a mistake, Yi said, to not have given a clear explanation of a supplemented and corrected final UR schedule, thus making the final schedule look as if it ran counter to the government's earlier statement that "the established UR schedule cannot be modified through renegotiation." The prime minister said, however, that the UR schedule was supplemented due to the efforts of working-level officials from the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry seeking to obtain a better deal for Korean farmers. "In fact, we have been able to secure a substantially better outcome than the original agreement of last Dec. 15," he said. Yi said it was not that the Ministry had changed the original agreement: All it did was simply supplement or correct those clauses which needed to be supplemented in terms of interpretation, he said. Therefore, he said, the supplements and corrections cannot be taken as a change made through renegotiation of the existing agreement. Saying that the government would strive to develop rural areas with the UR accord serving as an impetus, Yi asked the people to understand the government and help it surmount rural problems.
