This invitation was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Mohammad Javad Zarif, who did not rule out that this committee could become a nucleus for a security alliance grouping all states situated on the Gulf. Well-informed sources have said that the Iranian invitation is addressed for the time being to the six GCC member states but could include Iraq later, specifically after its present problems are settled. The Iranian official said that such a committee would enable the region's states to discuss all their problems and analyze the threats to their joint security. Diplomats believe that the Iranian proposal is aimed at splitting the "Damascus Declaration," which includes the GCC states, Egypt, and Syria. Iran proposed the idea in the past but the proposal collapsed because of the Iranian-Iraqi dispute. Observers believe that this proposal may face the same fate as a result of the disputes between Iran and a number of states in the region, especially the United Arab Emirates, which claims sovereignty over three islands currently occupied by Iran.
