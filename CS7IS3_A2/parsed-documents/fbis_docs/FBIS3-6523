Kumagai said: As far as we see, the United States basically has no appreciation of them at all -- at least where the Clinton government is concerned. Minister Kumagai also said that even though he has not formally decided whether to continue with the voluntary restraint system or not, such controls can bring the charge that they show Japan's auto manufacturers are cartelling. Attention must be paid to this point, he added. The system of putting voluntary restraints on Japanese-made car exports to the United States was instituted in 1981 after such exports grew sharply. MITI thinks now that the U.S. auto industry is making high profits while Japanese auto exports are falling short of export control ceilings, there is little likelihood that auto exports to the United States will rise sharply. As such, MITI is coming to believe there is not much point in continuing export controls. Minister Kumagai's remark today is believed to suggest his ministry is thinking about reviewing export controls for next year and thereafter, including the possible abolition of the controls altogether, once the government finalizes its measures on opening up Japan's markets to the United States by the end of this month.
