When you hear for the first time the word "volost," which is known only from books, doubt involuntarily sets in: Why is such a reorganization necessary? Is it a just a change of nameplate? A fad? I Want Very Much To Be an Official In reply to my questions, Nikolay Anikanov, administration head in Nekrasovskiy Rayon, where these events are currently taking place, and architect of the volost's resurrection in rural areas, objected strongly: No, there can be no question of any fad. Government by the volost represents a completely self-financing self-governing rural territory with its own budget and bank account. In the final analysis, it represents a reduction in the army of officials in rural areas. Anikanov considers that the system of government in the rural areas -- whether in the form of rural soviets or the rural administration -- has discredited itself once and for all and become obsolete. Take note of the fact that in each rural administration (and this is usually the territory of a kolkhoz or sovkhoz) there are up to 10 officials. The wages of each is sometimes five times higher than that of a machine operator or a milkmaid. The rural administration's second problem is that it lacks its own budget. Its head has no interest at all in collecting taxes because he knows: These taxes will just the same leave the area and end up in the rayon, oblast, or republic budget, and after that it will be necessary to beg for pennies from the rayon or oblast, like alms in the church porch, in order to repair a well in disrepair or to take firewood for the winter to an old lady living on her own. The Elder Will Judge Your Case We took great pains to break this system and to make the territory self-financing for the first time, Anikanov continued. That is, it is a question of the authorities having a vital interest in the development on their territory of diverse industrial and agricultural production facilities from which taxes will accumulate in the local budget. But there is also a second issue. That of actually implementing local self-government and not just talking about it. A law on this has, as we know, been adopted, but it is not working as there are no corresponding power structures. This is why, having set a course to resurrect volost power, we began this process from the bottom and not from the top, electing at village assemblies in the rayon elders to represent about 300 inhabitants each. What is more they have very wide-ranging rights. I consider the village elder, Anikanov says, to be at one time deputy to the volost head, judge, and land-surveyor who can sternly make whomsoever he sees fit answer for disturbing the public order, distribute hayfields, and pass judgments on squabbling neighbors in his role as justice of the peace. Own Bank Account I came across the first volost head in post-communist Russia in the government premises temporarily housed in the former Krasnoprofinternovskiy settlement administration building. The Russian tricolor is already fluttering above the government premises, though there is no new nameplate yet. Aleksey Andreyev, 47, is impatiently waiting for a tractor and trailer from the rayon which he has been promised and which will plow pensioners' truck gardens and transport firewood. Borovskaya Volost has already opened an account at the bank. The first autonomous budget for this year has been put together and (here is an amazing thing) income exceeds expenditure by as much as 50 million rubles [R]. Now the most important thing is to obtain this money as quickly as possible and release it for the people's benefit. One other thing about which the volost head is presently concerned is cadres. Under conditions of the territory's self-financing and self-government, volost administration workers should possess completely different professional qualities than workers of the abolished rural administrations. Incidentally, there are now two new posts in the volost government's staff -- that of tax collector and land-tenure regulator. At the same time as the compact 15-strong volost government staff is being formed, rural administration staffers are working out their last days in their former positions. These are real people, mostly women, who have children. This is a vexed question. But come what may, 10 officials must go. In this volost alone R25 million will be saved which will be spent entirely on the needs of its population. In the wake of the first Borovskaya Volost, Rayon Administration Head Nikolay Anikanov says, all 18 rural and settlement administrations in the rayon will be transformed into 8 volosts by the end of the year (which will make a saving of about R200 million by reducing staff). Anikanov does not consider the transition to the volost system of governing rural territories to be a panacea. It is hardly necessary to redraw the whole map of the country in an unthinking and wholesale manner. It is necessary first of all to introduce volost government in those places where the infrastructure is well developed.
