The DEA dismantled a drug trafficking ring that laundered more than $10 million and was made up of Panamanian and Colombian lawyers, accountants, and businessmen. Cordero said that there is cooperation with DEA authorities to investigate drug related crimes. The diplomat said that he agrees with acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos on the rules for this cooperation and added that the Foreign Relations Ministry will collaborate in this regard. Cordero said that DEA participation in investigations related to drug trafficking do not violate the country's sovereignty as long as Panama grants authorization as a sovereign country, which it is. The investigations indicate that distributors in this network introduced large amounts of cocaine into the United States from Colombia and Panama. The deputy foreign minister pointed out that DEA agents no longer participate in searches or arrests in Panama, leaving these tasks to Panamanian authorities.
