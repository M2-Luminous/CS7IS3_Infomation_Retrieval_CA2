They adjust their attitude by integrating the sense of sight and soimatosthesia with the function of the vestibular otolith organ. They will adapt to the change of vestibular sense as time elapses when they are put in an utterly new environment such as microgravity. Man sometimes exhibits symptoms of space motion sickness during the adaptation process. In ``Fuwatto '92,'' the role of the otolith organ in attitude control in microgravity was examined using two carps. Goldfishes are used in IML-2 to investigate the temporal change of the attitude control mechanism using their attitude and behavior as indices (i.e., to clarify the adaptation process in microgravity and the process to re-adapt to ordinary gravity on Earth). Though goldfishes exhibit various attitudes and behavior, their innate reaction to turn their back to the light source is useful for observing the interaction between the sense of sight and gravitational sense. Figure 1 shows the reaction. In the natural environment on Earth, gravity works toward the bottom and light comes from the top. In such an environment, the goldfish takes an attitude with its belly down and its back up. When the light is applied from the side, it tries to turn its back toward the light but is not completely successful due to the downward gravitational sense. The most important organs for sensing gravity are the left and right vestibular organs. If both of them are removed, the goldfish turns its back to the light source independent of the direction from which the light comes (see Figure 2). However, the inclination decreases as time elapses and becomes constant in 6 months. In contrast, the goldfish which has undergone surgery to remove only the left or light vestibular organ inclines significantly to the operated side and the inclination toward the intact side increases a little (Figure 3). The inclination toward the operated side decreases with time, but the inclination toward the intact side rarely changes. The goldfish eventually adapts a balanced position between both sides. During short (20 second) exposures to microgravity obtained during parabolic flight of an airplane, the inclination angles of these goldfishes approach 90 degrees, and the attitude seemed to be controlled by the sense of sight. Figure 3. Change of Light Response of Goldfish In the space experiment, a total of six goldfishes, including two which had had the vestibular organ on one side removed 2 weeks earlier, one with both organs intact were flown in space. Changes in the reaction to the light source during and after the flight were photographed with a video recorder to analyze adaptation to the gravitational environment change. Clarifying the adaptation mechanism of the sensing system, with emphasis on the vestibular system, should provide useful information to clarify and provide countermeasures against space motion sickness, an important problem in space medicine. The experiment is expected to reveal the interaction between vestibular organs on both sides and with other senses.
