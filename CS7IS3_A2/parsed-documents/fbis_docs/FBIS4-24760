A 40-member Russian Government delegation led by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security Council, signed an agreement on the deal during a visit to Sofia earlier this week. It provides for joint manufacturing of highly accurate surface- to-air missile systems and radar equipment for coastal defense. Following political changes in Bulgaria in 1989 its relations with Russia have been rather cool and military cooperation at a low level. Now, many Bulgarian institutions are calling for a restoration of Bulgaria's traditional ties with Russia in a bid to seek guarantees for national security. The delegation briefed Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev on Russia's stance on maintaining a regional balance, peace and security in the Black Sea area.
