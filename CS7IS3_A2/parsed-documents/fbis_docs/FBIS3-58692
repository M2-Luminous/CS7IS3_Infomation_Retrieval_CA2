A So-So Year"] [Text] A Makno poll reveals a pessimistic prospect: People are consuming less and saving less, and the fear of inflation persists. Almost 60 percent of the Italians have no confidence in the political and economic future. They are willing to make sacrifices, providing everybody pays their taxes and the welfare state works. One Italian in five, however, does not agree. He does not want to make any more sacrifices, even if they are aimed at an "effective improvement" in the Italian economic situation. The others would perhaps be willing to accept them, but only under precise conditions (see the accompanying tables). For example--and this represents the great majority--provided the welfare state is preserved, if not actually strengthened. Or else (and this is another numerous category), only on the assumption that everybody pays their taxes. A generally pessimistic outlook emerges from the poll Makno conducted last month [i.e., November] with a significant sample of citizens throughout Italy. And it can be summed up in a kind of brief indication: In answer to the question concerning the near future of the "economic, political, and social situation" of Italian families, 55.9 percent of those interviewed replied they had no confidence, while only 29.3 percent is optimistic, and there is a very high number of those who are undecided (14.8 percent). This situation is reflected in the assumptions about future actions. The poll was based on 1,022 telephone interviews. (The sample was selected on the basis of scientific criteria, taking into account geographic areas, demographically significant economic classes, sex, age, and academic diplomas.) Actually, the poll also investigates possible destinations of private savings. And here there are many surprises. For example, one is struck by the very high percentage of those who believe that in 1994 (to be exact, the question concerned the next six months) they will be unable to save even one lira because "all their income will be absorbed by everyday expenses." No less than 43 citizens out of 100 stated that of necessity "they were not savers." However, it should be pointed out that the same question posed in the past (that is, "What did your family invest in the last six months?) provided even worse responses, since 47 percent of those questioned then were found to be nonsavers. But who is it that manages to save despite everything? What does that person expect to do in the first half of the new year? In this situation, the bank wins by far. In fact, 15.7 percent of those interviewed said they will leave their money in their checking account and 8.8 percent opted for their bank savings book. (Probably also included in this category are certificates of deposit, natural offspring of the old bank books). Despite the great battage [publicity campaign] over privatizations and new job placements, the number of those putting their money in the stock market is practically nonexistent while the number of those very faithful to government financial instruments is surprisingly low: Only 8.4 percent say they want to buy treasury bills, treasury certificates, and multiyear treasury bonds. Then there is the chapter on consumption. The year of economic and institutional crisis has also changed Italians' habits. And while official data refer to an inflation under control, the people, on the other hand, have the feeling that prices are continuing to rise. There are a few differences within the social classes. For example, women are more pessimistic than men. And the elderly believe that prices are rising much more than young people do. Finally, concerning past conduct, in the south they spent more for food and clothing; in the north; for housing; and in the center, for transport. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italians and the Recovery | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(In percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Are You Willing to Make Sacrifices in Exchange for Effective Improvements in | |the Italian Economic Situation?
