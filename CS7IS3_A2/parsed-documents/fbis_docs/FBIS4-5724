Yi Eui-kon, senior presidential secretary for government affairs, said the steps had been prepared after confusion surfaced in key government programs such as Uruguay Round negotiations and dealing with the North Korean nuclear question. "All government offices are expected to work out detailed programs based on the steps to secure specialized manpower on their own," Yi said. The measures given by Chongwadae include the idea of restructuring public officials training programs in a way that gives more emphasis on the training of specialized personnel, and sending more public officials to international organizations for temporary duties there. Another measure calls for the rotation of officials among externally related offices like the Economic Planning Board, Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Foreign Ministry. Also under one of the measures, special allowances are to be given to qualified recruits to reduce wage gap between public officials and private industry people.
