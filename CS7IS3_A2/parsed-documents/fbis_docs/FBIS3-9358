Fifty jurists of the commissariat and two members of the DLK [Kosova Democratic Alliance] Presidency, the Benelux branch, Ramadan Gashi and Gani Azemi took part in the meeting. The DLK representatives pointed out that due to the terror and continuous violence in Kosova, many Albanian youngsters are forced to leave their country and seek temporary asylum in the Western states. Moreover they are under the Serbian threat for violently being called up in the Serbian Army and then sent to Bosnia and Croatia. Referring to this campaign, Mr. Gashi and Mr. Azemi said that "the Albanian people in Kosova are under a permanent threat, thus concrete measures must be undertaken in their defence."
