This time, it was Democratic Congressmen David Bonior's and Robert Torricelli's turn. They submitted a draft resolution to the Foreign Affairs Committee on our country's upcoming elections. If approved, Bonior's and Torricelli's initiative would be debated and voted upon by the full House. In essence, the U.S. lawmakers are proposing an invitation be extended to have "total international observance" of the Mexican elections and also "the establishment of autonomous electoral authorities at the federal, state, and local level." Before unveiling their proposal to journalists, Bonior and Torricelli were not remiss in including their venerable opinions on Mexican politics of the past years. All of this, according to the concerned U.S. politicians, so there can be genuine democracy in our country. According to newspaper reports, a histrionic David Bonior said: "It is our hope that in approximately 95 days, the world will once again celebrate the triumph of democracy and raise its glass to another democratically elected president in Mexico." The Mexican Embassy in Washington was the first to reject this clear meddling, which is unacceptable despite the fact that is has been often repeated. Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor was next to reject it. In that respect, many Mexicans feel accurately represented. Is it necessary to have others observe us on election day? Who are these ethereal, almost immaterial individuals, uncontaminated by base economic and political interests, who could unquestionably decide if Mexicans elected their president, senators, and deputies in a democratic manner or if they cheated and have to play overtime, take penalties, or even repeat the game. Such individuals do not exist, and the U.S. lawmakers know this well. If they insist, I am certain it is merely because they want to continue meddling, deciding the future of Mexicans. If the idea is not to impose a president because the old, deeply rooted Mexican nationalism will not allow it, then it is at least to obtain other concessions that may not be as decisive but which are certainly vital to their interests. The message is clear: If you do not agree, if you do not accept certain treaties and agreements, if you do not accept certain conditions for conducting business, I will accuse you and portray you as undemocratic and dictatorial. It is an intimidation tactic. It is a tactic they are already using against Cuba. Robert Torricelli is sponsoring the latest tightening of the U.S. blockade against that island. Under the pretext that there is no democracy in that small country, Cubans are being starved to death. One cannot buy anything from Cuba; one cannot sell anything to it; and if a ship (no matter from what country) even docks there, it is penalized by not being allowed to dock in U.S. ports for six months. All of this because the interests defended in the Capitol are not the same as those defended in Cuba. In fact -- and much has been said already -- democracy, the election of authorities based on the sovereign will of the people, is never and has never been anything but an excuse for meddling. There are countries where there is no democracy, where it is not even known, where the people live under outrageous oppression, but those governments and systems are not the object of the mildest censure on the part of the champions of democracy to whom we refer today. On the contrary, these lawmakers are their great allies and commercial partners. Close to us, in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, the military violently toppled the democratically elected president. Now he must wander for years all over the United States begging for support. He only receives evasive remarks and promises. Father away we have an example that is similar or even more eloquent. Saudi Arabia has been ruled for decades by a despotic family that does not even know what "international observers" are, much less "autonomous electoral observers." When the time came, however, it proved itself to be one of Washington's most unscrupulous and therefore staunchest and most reliable allies. We will not even mention the terrible years of Pinochet, Stroessner, and General Videla, among many others. We Mexicans are read the riot act, but we flatly reject it. Decisions concerning Mexico's economic and political life and everything else fall solely within our purview, even more so now that the solidarity of the poor with the poor is only an illusion of the past. If our system of life has flaws, even if it has aberrant features, it falls to Mexicans to correct it. It is clear that models from abroad are not always viable and that pressure from abroad is never acceptable. The best and only way to have a fatherland that is more just, sovereign, free, and democratic, which is what many of us want, is through the unity and organization of the people who suffer abuses and injustices and who are always living under oppression. Heeding the north is not and will never be the way. They have their interests, not friends. We have our children to leave them a better, or a least a little better, world.
