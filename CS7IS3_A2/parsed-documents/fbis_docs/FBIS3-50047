The supply break was due to administrative problems at Nafta, the Russian exporter, MOL said. The break, which "was not the first example of a halt of supplies", did not affect work at Hungary's oil refineries and resulted only in rescheduling a 40,000-ton delivery to Hungary, the officials said. Last year, Hungary imported 5.1 million tonnes of crude from Russia and this year's imports were also planned to exceed five million tons, they said.
