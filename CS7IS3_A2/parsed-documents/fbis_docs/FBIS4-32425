The project is supported by the Budapest Ministry for Foreign Economic Contacts. Recently, Hungary has been attempting to revive commercial flow among Central European countries and, of course, to find new markets. The fact that Hungarian manufacturers have something to offer could be verified by several Czech journalists in recent days. Their journey led them not to Budapest but, rather, to northern Hungarian rural areas, specifically to the region of Nograd, which borders the Slovak Republic. The region, with its 230,000 inhabitants, is one of the smallest in the Hungarian Republic. Its center is at Salgotarjan, which has a population of approximately 50,000. "We are greatly interested in having Hungarian and Czech businessmen get to know each other better and establishing mutually beneficial contacts. That is why we have decided to introduce our region, our firms, and their products in Prague," stated Ferenc Korill, chairman of the General Assembly for the region of Nograd, during a news conference. Neither he nor any other officials from the region and representatives of local firms there, who met with Czech journalists, made a secret of the fact that the economy of the region is currently wasting away. The extraction of brown coal has been halted, and metallurgy and steelmaking (which was, at one time, the backbone of the regional economy) are in deep crisis because they were oriented toward a single principal market. Unemployment in the region affects more than 20 percent of all jobs (the national average is 12.2 percent). Agriculture in the region has outstanding natural conditions, primarily for the raising of fruit, vegetables, and potatoes. Other developmental opportunities are provided by the riches of the forests, and there are even possibilities for tourism. But, much as is the case elsewhere, there is a lack of investments, not only for modernizing production, but also for investments in the weak infrastructure (the highway network, communications, sources of potable water, the ecology). "Foreign investors are not exactly rushing into the crisis regions in Hungary. I would say that their interests end at the Danube River--in other words, primarily in western Hungary," noted F. Korill. In his estimation, the region receives about 1 percent of all foreign investments placed in Hungary (toward the end of 1992, the region received 4 billion forints). Prague will be visited from the Nograd region not only by firms that have already traded with Czech partners, but also by those who have thus far "cultivated" no foreign contacts. Of course, the region also has firms (which have been fully or partially privatized) that already have the worst behind them--some have even highly successfully penetrated into western markets. They would very much like to try it in the Czech Republic. The presentation by Hungarian firms from the region that is economically wasting away but that has not resigned itself to this fate enjoys official support: The Budapest Ministry for Foreign Economic Contacts has allocated 7.5 million forints for this purpose. Let us add that, in the Prague U Hybernu Palace and the Hungarian Cultural Center in Prague, not only will firms and their products be introduced, but also folk art from the region, its rich history, and examples of its contemporary social life.
