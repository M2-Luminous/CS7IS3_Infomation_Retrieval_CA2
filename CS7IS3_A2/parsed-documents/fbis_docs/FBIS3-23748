The Novo-Yezhovskaya mine has been closed, and the end of mining at Degtyarskaya and Gumeshevskaya is not far away. True, there are promising deposits in the northern part of the Urals, but geological prospecting there has been suspended for lack of money. Against this background, all the more unexpected is the opening of a new Safyanovskaya mine near the city of Rezh, where full-scale mining operations have already begun. It is envisaged that by the end of this year the first tonnes of minerals will be produced in the new mine. Not too many people dare these days to begin development of new deposits. The Safmed AO [joint-stock company], among whose founders are the Rezh nickel plant and Krasnoyralskiy Copper-Smelting Combine, several St. Petersburg and Podolsk enterprises, and the British Mardima company, also have certain concerns in this regard. As is known, due to rising copper prices on the domestic market, exports are becoming unprofitable, while domestic demand at this point is insignificant. The Safyanovskiy deposit, however, is one of the biggest. There are enough deposits of copper and zinc ore there to last 50 years. The mine contains 1 million tonnes of copper alone. Although in terms of reserves the deposit is smaller than the famous Udokan, half of the ore can be strip-mined, and at some sections it is as close as 11 meters below the surface. Besides, the average content of copper in Safyanovsk ore is 3 percent, in places as high as 28 percent, although even 1 percent is considered normal. The deposit is located in an inhabited area with developed communications. In addition to copper it contains zinc, sulfur, gold, and silver. The Safmed AO is counting on delivering to the consumer up to 350,000 tonnes of copper-zinc ore in 1995. In time the Safyanovskiy pit may replace Degtyarskiy--the largest deposit, which has been depleted over a century of exploitation.
