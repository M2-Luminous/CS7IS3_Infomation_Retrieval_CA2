On February 10 in Moscow, revolutionary romantics conducted a protest against the declining standard of living. The small crowd was led into battle by the zealous promoter of the people's wellbeing, the CPSU. Despite all metamorphoses the CPSU retains its former goal, that of building communism. Sergei Skvortsov, one of the few legal leaders of the party, explained to an MN correspondent, how he would do this. The CPSU, relieved of the heavy burden of power, sanatoriums, armoured limousines, game reserves and secret laboratories for forging documents and deprived of Article 6 of the Constitution, has shrunk to the size of an ordinary party. Its leaders critically appraise the numerical strength of its Russian organization at 20,000 roughly as many as the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party had in 1917. Some time ago the central committee even allowed "dual citizenship" so that a CPSU member could be also a member of other parties, but now the rules have been made stricter. The highest official of the CPSU Central Committee, secretary-coordinator Sergei Skvortsov, is a short, balding bespectacled man in his early forties. He completed a postgraduate course as an economist and served in the army as a deputy political instructor in a construction battalion. He lives in the Moscow Region. Besides being responsible for the party's leadership, he fulfills the role of chairman of the movement in defence of Russian history (meaning Lenin). He is also editor of the "People's Newspaper". The CPSU is not registered and has no office nor address. The composition of its secretariat and the central committee is a secret. Action "On February 10 the party conducted a day of protest against declining living standards", says Sergei Skvortsov. "Several groups set up an interregional strike committee which I also joined. We do not plan to organize a general strike which would grow into an armed uprising, as was the case in 1905. We advance economic and general democratic demands: a price freeze on essential goods, the indexation of the minimal earnings to the subsistence level, compensation for a delay in paying wages at half of one percent a day, and a prohibition on the closing of enterprises. We also demand the indexation of deposits in the Savings Bank in keeping with the rising prices. Our only political demand is for free democratic elections. Our party has initiated the boycotting of elections. The action of February 10 was in fact the first step in building a mass people's movement. The way out of an economic crisis is strict regulation by the state, in any case, the strengthening of the state's role. There is no other fitting model, you see, besides the Marxist one". MN: Why do you laugh when you say "Marxist"? S.: Because the word has been abused too much by many, including our activists. Property MN: What is your party's attitude to ownership of the means of production? S.: There is consensus among almost all communist parties. We base ourselves on the classic Marxist approach that the state should have the commanding positions, while private property is eradicated as it gradually becomes socially unnecessary. MN: Ownership of land? S.: It should not exist. It is not an absolute dogma, but the absence of private property is necessary in our country, because in the event of free purchase and sale of land it does not get into the hands of those who cultivate it. The law on land was built for the area around Moscow in order to secure plots of land for country houses. MN: What is your attitude on the property of the CPSU? Do you consider yourselves its heirs? S.: The succession is direct. We have elected a new leadership of the party that existed. The number of new members who joined the CPSU after it was reinstated is a mere hundred or two. We practically have the same people. In legal terms we are claimants to the property. We may probably raise the question of property if a new political situation arises, but we shall demand not the return of the entire property but only of what is necessary for political activity. Cornerstones MN: Dictatorship of the proletariat? S.: The concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat was considered to be a corner-stone of the Marxist theory. Those who speak about it now mean the working class. But this part of society is no longer in the majority. The leading role in society should be played by the workers of manual and mental labour, those who create not only material, but also, to use a Marxist term, spiritual benefits. But this must not necessarily be a dictatorship as it was understood before. MN: Class struggle? S.: Class struggle remains the way we understand it. Today we may be allies, but the situation may change tomorrow and we may have neutral relations or become opponents. MN: The attitude to religion? S.: According to our rules we may have believers in our ranks. We believe, generally speaking, that Marxist philosophy by which we are guided is atheistic, but do not intend to force this viewpoint on anyone, including the members of our party. This principle is now characteristic of almost all communist parties, at least of those which are not in power. The Soviet Union MN: What is your position on the national question? S.: To reinstitute guberniyas is an entirely unrealistic aim connected with doing obvious violence to peoples. At the same time we naturally stand for the reestablishment of the Soviet Union. We believe that it can be done by means of adopting by the legislative body of Russia of a decision on the restoration of the operation of the USSR Constitution on the territory of the Russian Federation. Several republics can practically immediately follow this way. The Final Goal Is To Work for Idlers MN: It follows from the name of your party that you are fighting to build communism. Do you think that "the next generation of Soviet people" will live under communism? S.: I cannot make categorical forecasts. I myself belong to a rather young generation, but as for the next generation... No, there won't be communism in 50 years from now, so you are right. MN: What will communism be like? S.: People will be engaged in some kind of creative work, though there may be some left who will want to till soil because they may find it interesting, or for the sake of relaxation. At the initial stage a certain minimum of life's benefits will be granted to all. At this stage some additional benefits will be offered to people who have made the greatest contribution to society's development. Further on, the range of these benefits will evidently decrease because the most important element is the development of a new man. I consider the desire to have two or three Mercedes cars a deviation.
