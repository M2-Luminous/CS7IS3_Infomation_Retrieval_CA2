FR940516-1-00005 FR940516-1-00001 In implementing its statutory mandate to regulate the activities of CPOs and CTAs, the Commission has endeavored to refine its rules as appropriate to respond to changing market conditions and to simplify and streamline the disclosure process in a manner consistent with customer protection. For example, in 1985, the Commission adopted Rule 4.5, which, as last amended, 12 provides an exclusion from the definition of the term ``commodity pool operator'' for the operators of specified types of collective investment vehicles operating pursuant to other regulatory frameworks, i.e. , certain pension plans, registered investment companies, bank or trust company collective funds and insurance company separate accounts, whose use of futures and commodity option transactions is limited to hedging and to non-hedging transactions for which initial margin deposits and option premiums do not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of the entity's portfolio. 13 12 58 FR 43791 (August 18, 1993), effective September 17, 1993. 13 Rule 4.12(b) allows the use of a simplified disclosure document that does not contain, among other things, the past performance records, risk disclosure and cautionary statements otherwise required by Rule 4.21. Thus, a pool's securities offering memorandum should require little supplementation to meet the requirements for a pool disclosure document under Rule 4.12(b). In 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.12(b), which provides relief from certain requirements of Rules 4.21, 4.22 and 4.23 with respect to pools that commit no more than ten percent of the fair market value of their assets to establish commodity interest positions and trade such commodity interests in a manner solely incidental to their securities trading. Also in 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.14(a)(8), which provides registration relief to investment advisers registered as such with the SEC, who provide commodity interest trading advice to trading vehicles that are excluded from the definition of the term ``pool'' under Rule 4.5 or are qualifying entities for which a notice of eligibility has been filed under Rule 4.5, provided that the investment adviser's commodity interest trading advice is solely incidental to the adviser's business of providing securities advice and consistent with Rule 4.5, and that the investment adviser does not otherwise hold itself out as a CTA. In August 1992, the Commission adopted Rule 4.7, which provides relief from certain part 4 requirements to CPOs offering pool participations and to CTAs offering managed accounts to certain highly accredited investors. 14 Rule 4.7 also facilitates multi-jurisdictional offerings by making relief available for private offerings exempt from registration pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and pursuant to the SEC's Regulation S 15 and by including certain foreign persons as eligible participants in pools qualifying for Rule 4.7 exemption. 16 14 See note 3 supra. 15 Regulation S generally provides that the registration requirements of the Securities Act do not apply to offers and sales of securities that occur outside the United States and provides two safe harbors from those requirements for specified offerings where no ``directed selling efforts'' are made in the United States. ``Directed selling efforts'' are activities undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, conditioning of the market in the United States for the securities being offered. See 55 FR 18306 at 18307 (May 2, 1990). 16 As of April 5, 1994, relief has been claimed under Rule 4.7(a) for 360 pools, and 150 CTAs have claimed relief under Rule 4.7(b). In addition, the Division of Trading and Markets (``Division'') has issued relief on a case-by-case basis to facilitate application of the disclosure requirements in the context of new market conditions not contemplated by the existing regulatory framework, such as multiple CTA and fund-of-funds structures, with the objective of fostering clear and succinct disclosure of material information, especially concerning fees and the manner in which proceeds of the offering will be used. In many cases, strict application of existing disclosure requirements to pools whose CPOs have voluminous performance histories or which retain multiple CTAs or invest in multiple investee funds may result in such extensive track record disclosure that past performance records generally may be given undue emphasis and the most germane data given insufficient prominence. These effects have been mitigated in appropriate circumstances through grants of exemptive or no-action relief. For example, in Interpretative Letter No. 92&hyph;12, 17 the Division granted relief from required disclosures (including disclosure of past performance records) concerning CTAs and investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets of the investor pool. The CPO had an operating history of more than three years and changed the pools' CTAs frequently based on its continuous analysis of over 500 CTAs. This relief has since been made available to other CPOs in similar circumstances. 17 (1990&hyph;1992 Transfer Binder), Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶25,343 (July 28, 1992). In Interpretative Letter 94&hyph;10, the Division granted relief permitting a CPO to use a summary format containing specified core information to present, in the disclosure document of a single-advisor pool, its past performance with respect to other pools operated by the CPO, none of which was advised by the same CTA as the single-advisor pool. The CTA advising the single-advisor pool had a ten-year track record that would be fully disclosed in the disclosure document of the single-advisor pool and the full performance record of the CPO's other pools would be available upon request. 18 18 [Current Transfer Binder], Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶25,991 (December 16, 1993). The Division also allowed the use of a capsule performance disclosure format in Interpretative Letter 94&hyph;12 under similar circumstances. [Current Transfer Binder], Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶25,993 (December 27, 1993). In Interpretative Letter No. 93&hyph;107 the Division granted relief permitting a CPO to omit disclosure of the past performance of certain single-advisor pools in the CPO's disclosure documents for two multi-advisor pools, provided that the CPO gave a brief description of the single-advisor pools and made their performance records available upon request. This relief was based upon representations that the CPO, which played an active role as an administrator and asset allocator for the multi-advisor pools, performed no asset allocation functions for the single-advisor pools and that the single-advisor pools served as vehicles to provide access to commodity pools advised by certain experienced CTAs whose minimum investment levels for managed accounts would otherwise have been prohibitive for individual investors. The CPO's track record as an asset allocator would be more significant in the context of multi-advisor funds than its track record in the context of single advisor funds, where the skill of the individual CTA would be of greater interest to prospective participants.
