However, if North Korea does not show any change in its attitude to the last and sanctions are inevitable, the government will work out all possible measures based on the international cooperation system. Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed this while appearing in the program, "Diagnosis of Policies" carried by KBS-1 television network. He said that although North Korea did not show any indication of military provocation, it intensified slander, propaganda, and instigation activities against South Korea. Thus, North Korea more clearly showed its line for communization of the South. He revealed that the ROK established a firm security posture in close cooperation with the United States, including 24-hour operation of the AWACS system. Concerning the issue of the North Korean residents' escape to China, which was recently intensively reported by KBS, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said that this issue was related not only to the ROK and North Korea but also to China, and as a result of this, the exercise of the rights for diplomatic protection is very difficult. However, he said, the government will make diplomatic efforts to solve the issue at an early date.
