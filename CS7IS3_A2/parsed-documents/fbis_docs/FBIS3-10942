The 246,101 unemployed workers were joined by another 30,000 now searching for a way to earn a few pesos to dig themselves out of the "hole" they are in. Unemployment has turned into one of the most serious consequences of the crisis faced by the agricultural sector in the past three years, especially in the case of such crops as cotton, sorghum, tobacco, rice, and coffee. Given the loss of profitability and the smaller crop area planted, the demand for workers has plummeted. The national and municipal governments are both rushing to launch a large number of projects of common benefit in order to provide remunerative jobs for those out of work. Resources available this year total some 62 billion pesos, money it is hoped will generate roughly 6.2 million days of work, the equivalent of 24,800 full-time jobs. Emergency Measure The Ministry of Agriculture came up with the idea as a result of its analysis of the difficult social situation created by the crisis in agriculture. After examining the alternatives last year, the ministry designed an emergency program to create jobs by undertaking labor-intensive projects that would benefit the community such as roads, aqueducts, and reforestation. The government's Program To Generate Rural Employment (PGE) was formally approved by CONPES [National Council for Economic and Social Policy] in June and went into operation in September 1993, when it was given a budget of $900 million. Ricardo Vargas del Valle, adviser to the minister and director of the PGE, explained that the resources were incorporated into the DRI [Integrated Rural Development Program] Fund. The latter then drafted a fiduciary contract (the first of its kind) for its management by the Fiduciary Department of the People's Bank. However, since the projects are to be cofinanced, the municipalities standing to benefit from them contributed another 1.3 billion pesos, raising the sum available in 1993 to 2.2 billion pesos. Vargas del Valle said the resources should be made available during the first half of this year and thus help relieve unemployment problems in the departments of Atlantico, Cesar, Cordoba, Magdalena, Sucre, Meta, Risaralda, Huila, and Tolima. However, the funds supplied by the PGE directly are not the only resources. Vargas del Valle also noted that some 32 billion pesos were allocated in 1993 to finance rural development projects in the same regions through entities such as the DRI, Agrarian Fund, PNR [National Rehabilitation Plan], and Himat. When last year's balance is combined with these two sources of funding, projects on the drawing board will provide 3.4 million days of work. More Money for 1994 In addition to these funds and projects, the General Rural Employment Program starts this fiscal year with a budget of 6 billion pesos in the DRI. When that sum is combined with cofinancing from municipalities, the total is 12 billion pesos. When one adds the 52 billion channeled through other national and territorial entities via labor-intensive rural development programs, the grand total for 1994 is 62 billion pesos. The departments benefiting from this new allocation are Atlantico, Bolivar, Sucre, Cesar, Tolima, Huila, Caldas, Risaralda, Valle, Cauca, Meta, and Narino. It is estimated that projects planned using this year's funding will provide 6.2 million days of work. Details Explaining just how the program operates, Vargas del Valle said that after identifying the most urgent areas and assigning priorities to projects, the DRI is ordering the fiduciary enterprise to negotiate the respective contracts with the municipalities. The latter will in turn hire local workers, which means that the projects will take longer and be somewhat more costly. Specialized personnel are excepted from this rule. Programs eligible basically include roads, aqueducts, marketing, housing, reforestation, irrigation, agroindustry, and fish farming, as well as special projects for the integrated management of drilling.
