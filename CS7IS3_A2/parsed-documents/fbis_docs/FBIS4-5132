Suharto, in his capacity as chief patron of the country's ruling political groupings, said in a written statement that there is talk of there being political undercurrents. He felt that these are subverting Golkar because they have created the impression that the group has been torn apart. "These so called `undercurrents' don't exist," said Suharto, who chairs the council that has the last word in Golkar. "They are simply a few people who claim to speak on behalf of the masses." "This is nothing but political engineering. Politics cannot be separated from engineering," he said in a keynote address to Golkar's working conference. The speech was read by Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas, who sits in the council. Golkar has been shaken in the past few months by dissension among some of its regional leaders in the elections of provincial governors and regents. Reports from the regents suggested that the dissenters were responding to political engineering in those regions, and were therefore casting their votes for the more popular local leaders, instead of the candidates nominated by Golkar's central executive board. The term "political undercurrents" first became popular last December with the election of Megawati Sukarnoputri as chairman of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), despite stiff opposition from the government and the Armed Forces. Megawati Sukarnoputri, is the daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's first president. The three-day conference is the first since the appointment of Harmoko, minister of information in Suharto's cabinet, to chair Golkar's central board last October. Golkar leaders have attributed the regional dissension to lack of discipline among the regional leaders, something which they hope to straighten out at the gathering in Jakarta. Harmoko told reporters after the opening ceremonies that the central board will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will punish members who have stepped out of line. However, he denied allegations that Golkar was falling apart just because some members refused to obey central directives in local elections. "We are solid," he said. In his speech, Suharto also told the estimated 600 Golkar leaders to avoid debate on the presidential succession which has been widely reported by the media in recent weeks. The Patron Council feels it is not worth debating because there is already a mechanism to deal with leadership succession," he said referring to the five-yearly election process through the People's Consultative Assembly. Suharto, who is now 72, indicated several times this month that he would not be pursuing a seventh, five-year term in office but he stressed that he intends to stay till the end of his current term in 1998. The president also told the Golkar leaders to make sure that the political grouping retains its majority position in the next general election of 1997, targeting the estimated 21 million young people who will be voting for the first time. He said Golkar should ignore the allegations that the single majority status that it has enjoyed could turn out into a dictatorship. "Five election victories have not turned us into a dictatorship. On the contrary we have always represented the views of the people and accommodated their aspirations." He also said that Golkar should fight against any attempt to reform election law, apparently referring to the constant demands by PDI and the United Development party (PPP) for changes in the electoral system.
