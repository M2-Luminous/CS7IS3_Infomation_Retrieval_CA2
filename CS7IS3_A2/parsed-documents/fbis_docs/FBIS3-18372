So far, there have been 8,000 to 9,000 heroin or cocaine addicts in Berlin, according to official estimates. Says an investigator: "I am sure that in the future the large East European dealers will use the distribution network for illegal cigarettes to sell hard drugs." There is also a new route for smuggling drugs into the capital -- the West African route. The drugs come from Ghana via Zurich to Berlin. Since the end of last year the drug investigators have been watching this trend. The drug couriers swallow condoms filled with drugs, so-called containers. Then they fly to Europe and report to their contacts. At the end of 1993 alone the investigators caught four couriers from Ghana with forged passports. According to findings by the criminal police, the hot goods are partly produced in West Africa. However, South American cartels, too, use Ghana as an interim storage site for transports to Germany. Behind the African gangs of smugglers there are mostly old tribal ties with a strict hierarchy and their own language. Last year Berlin drug investigators seized 15 kg of heroin and 35 kg of cocaine. In 1992 they caught 12.3 kg of heroin and 26.5 kg of cocaine.
