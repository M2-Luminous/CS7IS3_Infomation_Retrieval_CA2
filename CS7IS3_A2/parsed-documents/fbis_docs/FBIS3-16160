"The shots sounded when it had become known that the Economic Freedom Party will not join Zyuganov's Communists and Zhirinovskiy's respectable fascists in signing a document on civil concord," the union said in its communique released on Sunday. According to the communique, the attempt to kill Borovoy "is the start of red political terror and the first consequence of the amnesty granted to political criminals and of the discourse on civil peace and accord with communists and fascists." The Democratic Union believes that the stand taken by President Yeltsin will lead in Russia to "democracy without democrats," who will be removed either "with the help of Soviet courts -- witness the case of Vil Mirzayanov, or with the help of political terror, as in the case of Konstantin Borovoy." In this connection the Democratic Union "gives the Russian president a month to cancel the amnesty, return the October rebels to prison, and outlaw the extremist activity of communists and fascists." Otherwise we shall consider ourselves free to start forming on April 12th armed units to defend ourselves, democracy, civilization and the Constitution together with other radical democratic forces," said the Democratic Union of Russia in its communique.
