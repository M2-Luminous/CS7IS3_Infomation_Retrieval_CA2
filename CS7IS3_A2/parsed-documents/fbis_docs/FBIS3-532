South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said the government of President Lucas Mangope had clearly indicated that it would not join the electoral process. However, people in the homeland had indicated that they wanted to take part in the election, he said. The TEC called on Mr Mangope not to resist the progress towards a new dispensation and to commence co-operation with the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. The TEC recommended that if Mr Mangope did not comply with its directives, measures should be implemented including terminating diplomatic representation, terminating special financial arrangements that benefitted the government of Bophuthatswana, controlling the movement of Bophuthatswana government personnel in South Africa and securing the IEC in the execution of its duties. The TEC said it would initiate direct contact with civil servants and security force members to plan for their integration and the implementation of the new constitution if its directives were ignored.
