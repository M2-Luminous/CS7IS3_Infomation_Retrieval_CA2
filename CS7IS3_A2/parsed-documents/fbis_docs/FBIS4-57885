FBIS4-57885 "drlat102_a_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Gore, Central American Presidents Meet Gore, Central American Presidents Meet FL2505202394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 25 May 94 FL2505202394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] Seven Central American countries have just participated in a brief summit with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, and Honduras, represented first by their foreign ministers and later by their heads of state or government, presented a united bloc in the meeting with Gore, who had previously announced he would stay for only eight hours. As a matter of fact, the brief dialogue that was conducted spearheads the summit President Bill Clinton has called for December in Miami, as well as the Cartagena de Indias summit in Colombia on 14-15 June. With the Miami summit, the United States hopes to initiate a new era in its ties with Latin America to eliminate vestiges of the Cold War. It has not invited Cuba, however, using the pretext of a lack of democratization; or Haiti, although its government is recognized by the United Nations and the OAS. It was reported that during the talks between Vice President Gore and the leaders of the region, economic and social issues were discussed as well as the strengthening of democratic institutions, the environment, the war against drugs, and issues related to probable economic aid from the U.S. Government. The main focus of the summit, however, was getting Al Gore to clarify the true possibilities of Central American countries' joining the North American Free Trade Accord. The accord, signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, is bound to become the most powerful commercial bloc in the world. Still convalescing from the ravages of almost a decade of armed conflict, and short of having consolidated true peace, Central America has a population of 30 million people, over 30 percent of whom live in extreme poverty because the enormous economic aid provided the region by the United States was mostly consumed by the military in fighting the guerrillas. Central America hoped the Clinton government would clearly define its position regarding this region and explain the conditions under which commercial negotiations might occur in order to later analyze and decide on the prospects of whether to move as a bloc or bilaterally, but still united.
