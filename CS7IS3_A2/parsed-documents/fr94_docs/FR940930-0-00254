FR940930-0-00254 FR940930-0-00031 3. One element of the Demonstration that was criticized was the eligibility criterion requiring mortgagors to be at least three months in arrears before they could be considered for the program. It was felt that this was counterproductive to the goal of loss mitigation, and that in many cases, a case-by-case determination of need and qualifications could be performed at virtually any time before allowing mortgagors to become program participants. Several commenters urged that a comprehensive determination be made, using financial statements, etc. [six mortgagees] Response: The experience of the PFS Demonstration has provided the basis for the decision to retain the eligibility criterion pertaining to the defaulted status of a PFS candidate's mortgage loan. There must still be a determination made in every case that the mortgagor is in default, and that, at a minimum, three monthly installments are in arrears. As a practical matter, however, this means that a candidate for PFS could satisfy this criterion as early as the 62nd day of default, i.e., because the third payment can be due and unpaid at that time. Retaining this criterion as the new nationwide PFS procedure as implemented does keep the administration of pre-foreclosure sales from possibly impinging on servicing requirements related to HUD's mortgage assignment program. Notification of the mortgagor of his right to apply for assignment assistance from HUD (which mortgagees are required to perform at or after the third payment is due and unpaid), will occur at a time when homeowners can choose between a course of action directed toward homeownership retention OR one whose objective is to dispose of the property and relieve the mortgagor of his mortgage obligation. It is the Department's intent that defaulting mortgagors make such an informed decision. Permitting participation in the PFS procedure at an earlier juncture will be evaluated in the future, however, and could be implemented if found not to be detrimental. 4. Another element of the Demonstration that received criticism was the allowance of a ten day period for review of the proposed pre-foreclosure sale. [three mortgagees, one real estate service company, one individual] Response: The ten day period for review of the proposed pre-foreclosure sale, as described in the Notice, was reduced to five (5) working days during the Demonstration, and will remain a maximum of 5 working days when the function is transferred to the mortgagee. The period might be further reduced (e.g., to three working days) after evaluating the experience of the nationwide PFS procedure. 5. Another criticized provision was the series of cash incentives payable to mortgagors who consummate a pre-foreclosure sale after participating in the program, although several commenters did support this concept. Four commenters opposed seller incentives [two mortgagees, one individual, one quasi-governmental organization]; three supported them [one mortgagee, one real estate services company, one national association of real estate sales professionals]; one supported case-by-case determinations of amounts [a mortgagee]; and one suggested that cash ``incentives'' be applied toward property improvements only [a real estate services company]. One commenter [a mortgagee] also criticized the expanded deed-in-lieu incentive as being over-generous and inappropriate. Another [a mortgagee] suggested that mortgagors were prepared to pay money towards accomplishing a deed-in-lieu. A third [a mortgagee] suggested that the mortgagor assign any and all refunds of insurance, etc. to HUD as a provision of enrollment in the PFS program. Response: Cash incentives for mortgagors are being reduced for the nationwide implementation of the PFS procedure. The amount payable to a mortgagor who has successfully marketed and sold his home will be $750, with an additional $250 if the time needed to go to closing is 90 days or less from the date the mortgagor was advised that he could participate in the PFS procedure. HUD is retaining the policy of paying incentives to mortgagors in return for a successful pre-foreclosure sale as a means of providing moving assistance or the promise of reimbursement for cosmetic repairs and maintenance undertaken by homeowners who may still be experiencing financial problems. In addition, the Department wishes to encourage the maximum number of interested and qualified mortgagors to take advantage of the PFS option, because of the savings this generates for HUD.
