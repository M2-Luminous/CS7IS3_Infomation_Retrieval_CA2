In the areas affected by arsenical poisoning, the incidences of ascites due to cirrhosis, skin cancer, and lung cancer are very high. Patients suffering from chronic arsenical poisoning mainly live in Jiaole Village (formerly Jiaole Township), Yuzhang Town, Xingren County; and Dadi Village, Bayou Village, and Xiaogeduo Village under Xingyi City; as well as Anlong County's Haizi Township and Getang Town. The incidence of disease in Xingyi City and Xingren County has reached 17.28 percent, whereas in Anlong County a new affected area was discovered in the second half of 1993, and experts estimated that the incidence of disease there would surpass 17.28 percent. Over the past few years, governments at various levels and the relevant departments have adopted measures time and again: Closing down some coal pits, banning coal mining in some districts, distributing medicine to people, and modifying their cooking stoves, thereby controlling arsenical poisoning to certain extent. However, the problem is still a very serious, as well as urgent one, which merits further attention from the authorities and various quarters of society.
