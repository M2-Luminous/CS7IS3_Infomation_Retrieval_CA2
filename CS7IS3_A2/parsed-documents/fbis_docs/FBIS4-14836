Natiq Gasanov, was appointed a new Chairman of Supreme Majlis of Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. Earlier he was the chief of the Administrative Department of Supreme Majlis. The Chairman of Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Rasul Guliyev, attended the session as well. Since June 1993, when the former speaker of Nakhichevan's Supreme Majlis, Geydar Aliyev, took the office of the President of Azerbaijan, the post of the speaker in Nakhichevan remained vacant. The tension in Nakhichevan mounts. There were a series of rallies of the members of the opposition in Ordubadskiy and Dzhulfinskiy region. The local powers of those regions support Abulfaz Elchibey. Deepening socio-economic crisis in Azerbaijan lessen Baku's control over Nakhichevan. Obviously, after the elections Azerbaijan will increase pressure on Nakhichevan.
