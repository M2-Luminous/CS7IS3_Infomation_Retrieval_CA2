Loyter and D. Rasskazov, identified by caption] [Text] [170950] [Loyter over video of industrial facilities, with camera homing in on "Zvezdochka" plant] The information ballyhoo around radioactive waste recycling has not bypassed Severodvinsk. This is understandable. Over the past 30 years more than enough problems have accumulated at enterprises of this center of nuclear shipbuilding. While the spent nuclear fuel still has its uses -- the fuel rods are sent to the Mayak Combine in the southern Urals -- no one is interested in the metal, which also absorbs quite a bit of radiation. The storage facilities built for this purpose at the "Zvezdochka" plant are full to the brim. In cooperation with specialists from the center of nuclear shipbuilding, the Arkhangelsk Oblast Committee has drawn up a program to ensure nuclear and radiation safety. The oblast leaders have suggested that all departments interested in solving this problem, which is of crucial importance for the population of this entire region and which can no longer be shrugged off, get together in Arkhangelsk.
