New Shares of certain classes (``Class B Shares'') could convert automatically into New Shares of another second class (``Class A Shares'') at the end of a fixed period following the purchase of Class B Shares (the ``Conversion Period''). New Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid regarding Class B shares also will be Class B Shares. Such Class B Shares will convert to Class A Shares on the earlier of the end of the Conversion Period from the date of such reinvestment purchase, or the conversion date of the most recently purchased Class B Shares which were not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions. 7. The conversion of Class B Shares to Class A Shares is subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling that the conversion of the Class B Shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. The conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion no longer is available. 8. Fund shareholders generally will be limited to exchanging shares for a similar class of shares of another Fund of the Investment Company. Any exceptions to this policy will be disclosed in the appropriate prospectuses, and in all events, the Investment Company's exchange policy will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. B. The CDSL 1. Applicants also propose to assess a CDSL on certain redemptions of shares and to waive the CDSL under certain circumstances. The amount of the CDSL will vary, depending on the length of time the shares have been held. The CDSL typically will be 1%, but can range up to 8.5% on shares redeemed within the first year of purchase. Applicants will comply with article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, regarding any sales charges and asset-based distribution charges. The CDSL may be reduced during the applicable CDSL period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period would not be subject to any CDSL. A CDSL will not be imposed on any shares issued prior to the date of the order granting exemptive relief. 2. The CDSL would not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased in connection with the reinvestment of dividends. Furthermore, no CDSL would be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares purchased during the CDSL period. In determining whether a CDSL is applicable, a redemption would be made first of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions, second of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions, second of shares purchased prior to the CDSL period, and third, of shares purchased during the CDSL period. The amount of the CDSL will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents the percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. 3. The CDSL would be waived (a) on redemptions following the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, of a shareholder, (b) in connection with distributions from an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan following death, total or permanent disability or reaching retirement age, (c) on redemptions effected pursuant to a Fund's right to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the minimum account size, and (d) in connection with shares sold to customers of State Street, Trustees and officers of Investment Company, and employees and retirees of State Street, RFD, and the Administrator. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemptive order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act to the extent the proposed issuance and sale of New Shares might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the Act, and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. 2. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowing and does not affect a Fund's existing assets or reserves; nor will it increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund, since all shares will participate pro rata in all of the Fund's income and expenses, except for the proposed Plan Payments and Class Expenses.
