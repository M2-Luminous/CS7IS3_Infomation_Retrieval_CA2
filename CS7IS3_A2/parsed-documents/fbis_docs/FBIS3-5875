"Our objectives are simple -- to open markets and to promote global economic growth," he told Japanese business leaders. "To advance these objectives, Japan needs to take credible actions, and to take them now." As in comments the day before, Christopher laced a speech to the Japan Association of Corporate Executives with criticism of Japan for failing to keep its trade commitments, as well as optimism that both sides will meet "our responsibility to change." In prepared remarks, he described Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton's decision "not to paper over our differences" when bilateral trade "framework" talks collapsed February 11 as a "welcome sign of new candor." But, Christopher said, "agreeing to disagree is not good enough. Acknowledging economic differences must be a starting point for finally resolving them." He said last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus measures "are insufficient to produce sustained, demand-led growth," which Washington demands to help curb Japan's huge trade surplus. "Japan has been unwilling to reach agreements on specific steps to open markets in the priority sectors of insurance, government procurement and autos and auto parts," Christopher said. Despite agreeing last July to use "objective criteria" to gauge the opening of its markets, "Japan has declined to provide realistic ways to measure progress to ensure that any such agreements are working," Christopher charged.
