The head of its Special Branch was feared to be among the dead last night. His role, at the very top of the intelligence pyramid, is seen as crucial in the fight against the IRA. Special Branch's most important task is in the gathering and collating of information about IRA volunteers. Among the dead were also figures from the Northern Ireland Office's shadowy terrorist finance unit, a department so secretive that many of its operatives are not even familiar to long-standing civil servants. Members of the department which is senior in rank to the RUC's C13 antiracketeering unit, are drawn from other government departments because of their expertise in taxation accountancy banking, VAT [value-added tax] and financial law. The department played a key role in last month's Operation Madronna, the biggest antiterrorist finance operation ever carried out, supported by police forces in England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Special Branch's responsibiIities include recruiting of agents within the paramilitary organisations and the running of these prized figures. Highly placed security figures on both side of the border agree that a well-placed mole is the most dangerous threat to the paramilitaries. Special Branch is also in command of organising other means of acquiring information, such as eavesdropping and photographic record, all of which is handled within the RUC's "E" department. The department would also co-ordinate liaison with other intelligence services, including M15, Interpol, Scotland yard's antiterrorist squad, and the FBI and CIA in the United States. Much of the Special Branch's energy in Northern Ireland is expended infiltrating and recruiting from loyalist and republican paramilitary groups. It has undoubtedly made inroads into both factions, although its methods have frequently been criticised. Last September the family of IRA man Joseph Mulhern, who was shot dead by his paramilitary colleagues, accused branch officers of pressurising his son into working for the security service. Frank Mulhern, the IRA man's father, claimed his son was taken to the RUC interrogation centre at Casllreagh and told that if he did not provide information, police would use contacts with loyalists to have members of his family shot. Raymond Gilmour, a former RUC supergrass whose evidence was used in attempts to jail over 30 terrorist suspects claimed a Special Branch officer tried to recruit him when he was teenager. After he was arrested for his part in a robbery in the late 1970's, Gilmour was approached by the same officer. He eventually agreed to infiltrate the Irish National Liberation Army. "Others may have seen me as an informer, but my handler called me an agent and I saw myself as an undercover policeman. My handler told me: The only thing I can't give you is a uniform," he later said. In recent years, Special Branch officers in the province have been involved in a power struggle with their MI5 counterparts over who controls the antiterrorist operations in Northern Ireland. The decision taken over a year ago, by the then Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke, to give primacy over such activities to the MI5 provoked a great deal of resentment within the branch. Last night one security source said that the crash was the most serious blow since the murder of two highranking RUC officers, who were shot dead in the Ardoyne district of North Belfast in 1971. Their murders are said to have contributed significantly to the failure of the internment raids which were supposed to have removed the senior players in Northern Ireland's paramilitary organisations.
