I slept very well. As of this morning, the Russian battalion is in its place. Things are stable and under control. I am pleased and I am going back to Zagreb. I will return to Sarajevo, however, if anything should go wrong. I had a long conversation yesterday with some Bosnian Serb leaders and generals. They assured me that they are going to completely fulfill the promises they gave us on the basis of our agreement. Our troops are stable, the weapons have been removed, and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is in control. There are good relations between the Serbs and UNPROFOR, as well as among us, UNPROFOR, and the Bosnian Serbs. This is a secure network and everything is heading towards peace. [Unidentified correspondent] What do you think of the Muslim wish to nevertheless bomb the Serbs? [Churkin] If they are disappointed by the lack of strikes and that there are no more battles, then they have some psychological problems. We are talking about wrong things here. However, honestly speaking, I do not think that this mood prevails in the Muslim government. I think that they do realize what this city and country mean and that they need more peace than war. I think that they can be satisfied that arrangements initiated by the Serbo- Muslim agreement were implemented at the request of Russia and have not led to confrontation but to cooperation.
