FBIS4-10401 "drlat070_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 MEXICO Authorities Hold Six in Colosio Murder Case Authorities Hold Six in Colosio Murder Case PA1004032694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 7 Apr 94 PA1004032694 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [From the "Radio ACIR Newscast"] [Text] The most recent information supplied by the authorities tasked with investigating the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio indicates that the authorities have so far arrested six people who are presumably involved.... [pauses] accused of co-participating or co-masterminding the assassination of Colosio. The last person to be arrested was Salvador Hernandez Tomasini. He was identified as one of the individuals who collaborated with the plot to assassinate Colosio. Sources at the Attorney General's Office reported that Hernandez, according to the Assistant Attorney General's Office in charge of the case, was the person in dark glasses who was advancing on the candidate's left flank, called his attention, and knelt on three occasions; the last time when the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] candidate was hit by gun shots. The arrest of another person who is assuredly involved in the plot is pending. He is the person who threw himself at the feet of the candidate forcing him to stop and look down. At that moment, Colosio was shot by someone holding a revolver, apparently Mario Aburto Martinez, the confessed assassin and presumed murderer of the PRI presidential candidate. It is still said in Tijuana that it is shameful and grave that the PRI recruited those involved in Colosio's assassination to work as security guards. In other words, the party recruited the hired assassins. Jesus Ruiz Barraza, former PRI leader during 1986-89 in the State of Baja California, made this observation. Remember that elections were held in Baja California in July 1989 and that the PRI lost the governorship, which was won by Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the National Action Party [PAN]. Henceforth, the PRI in Baja California started to dismember, to disintegrate. There is resentment, profound resentment. Thus -- and this is speculation, a theory that we were noting yesterday and that continues to gain force -- it appears that the masterminds of this crime are PRI groups that resented Luis Donaldo Colosio, because as national PRI president, he recognized the PAN victory, that is, the victory of Ernesto Ruffo Appel. PRI candidate Margarita Ortega de Villa lost that election. This is very serious, this former PRI leader in Baja California said. It shows a lack of responsibility and knowledge, but this was predictable a long time ago, because these people were attacking the party ever since I was a leader, Barraza pointed out. He added that they are the people with whom I had frictions and disputes, because I did not want the scourge of society to be part of the PRI. This is a very serious and delicate issue. Barraza was interviewed at the international airport in Tijuana. Lazaro Cardenas, also a former political leader in Baja California, said that the result of a disorganized party and Political Council, in which each one of its 300 members have gone their own way, is negligence in contracting those who should have protected Colosio. This was undoubtedly an important factor that affected his assassination. The people involved in the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, according to the authorities -- and based on available videotapes -- were identified as members of a group called TUCAN. TUCAN, we reported yesterday and the newspapers noted today, is an acronym whose expansion is: All United Against National Action [Todos Unidos Contra Accion Nacional]. In other words, this is a group struggling to recover the governorship, power in Baja California. In this case, they resorted to violence to protest against what Luis Donaldo Colosio had done, at least that is what the evidence shows for the time being. Thus, we are getting closer to what might be the truth. This is why Ernesto Zedillo, who leads this effort, and leaders of the industrial, commercial, and other sectors, and of the political party demand that this investigation be completed at all cost.
