Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira said he has reached an agreement with rapporteur Nelson Jobim to extend the deadline for 15 days. Oliveira wants Congress to vote on 17 February on a resolution to extend the constitutional amendment works -- which are currently scheduled to conclude on 15 March -- including amendments to the social emergency fund and a reduction of the presidential mandate from five to four years. On 22 February Oliveira will ask the party leaders to guarantee the presence of at least 20 percent of their congressmen in the plenary hall to guarantee a quorum for all constitutional amendment sessions. With the help of political parties and the definition of a minimum work agenda, Oliveira believes the constitutional amendment works may conclude on 1 May, leaving 15 days of extra time. He is sure the elections will not harm the constitutional amendment process. On the contrary, he said, the parties will wait to conclude the constitutional reform before defining their campaign strategy. Senate President Humberto Lucena said he will suggest that the constitutional revision process be extended until 30 May because he said this is the preference of most parties.
