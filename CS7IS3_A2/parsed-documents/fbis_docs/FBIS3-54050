[Sha'th] Yes, I do. If there is a breakthrough, it will be thanks to the most recent round of talks in Taba, which I had said would help us move forward on the security front. I believe that the meeting in Oslo between President 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres will be another contributing factor, along with our contacts here with President Husni Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, and Dr. Usamah al-Baz, and there is yet another meeting between 'Arafat and Minister Peres planned for next Saturday [29 January] in Davos. These contacts and the talks set to resume next Tuesday in Taba between ourselves and General Shahaq and the Israeli delegation should help us overcome the obstacles holding up an agreement. God willing, we will arrive at an agreement in February and Israeli withdrawal will get underway and the Declaration of Principles will be implemented. [Mu'addi] When will the talks resume and what are the items on the agenda? [Sha'th] The talks about the transfer of civilian administration resume in Aba tomorrow, Monday. The points agreed are now being drafted, and we are close to agreement. Of course, the more intractable issues such as water, archaeology, and regional planning will have to wait a bit. However, God willing, we will also make progress on those fronts. The security committee is scheduled to resume work on Tuesday with both chief delegates' participation. I believe that in light of the headway made in Oslo, we should not rule out fresh progress on the area of the Jericho enclave and the crossings. [Mu'addi] Is it fair to say that the crossings problem is now behind us? [Sha'th] We are close to a solution. Let's temper our optimism with realism and reason. [Mu'addi] Given recent developments, what were 'Arafat's instructions to the Palestinian delegation? [Sha'th] We are in constant touch with President 'Arafat. We met this morning, and we are to meet this afternoon before he travels to Saudi Arabia. We are in constant touch. He was here three days ago and is being updated regularly. He is asking that we work overtime to conclude the agreement. [Mu'addi] Do you think that by the end of the month all issues blocking the implementation of the Declaration of Principles will have been sorted out? [Sha'th] It is hard for me to set an exact date, since that will be a matter for the political leaderships of both sides. I think we are on the road to a solution. It is extremely hard for me to be more specific. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, thank you so much. [Sha'th] Thank you, Sa'id.
