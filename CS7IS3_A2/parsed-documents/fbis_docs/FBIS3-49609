FBIS3-49609 "dreeu008__a94020" FBIS-EEU-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Poland Dailies Comment on Results of NATO Summit LD1101104994 Warsaw PAP in English 0903 GMT 11 Jan 94 LD1101104994 Warsaw PAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the "Press Review"] [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 11 -- Poland's national dailies on Tuesday give extensive coverage to the Jan. 10 NATO summit in Brussels at which the leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) agreed to endorse the U.S.-proposed "Partnership for Peace" proposal, that will draw East European states closer to NATO but without granting them full membership. "GAZETA WYBORCZA" headlines its front-page report with the words "Partnership for the Sake of Peace" and devotes two pages of commentaries to the issue. In a commentary entitled "Let's Consummate This Concubinage", Former Deputy Defence Minister Przemyslaw Grudzinski states that what happened in Brussels is not a historic event because key decisions concerning the future of NATO, that is, automatically linking the U.S. proposal with NATO membership, have not been taken. He claims, however, that "Poland's interest requires to join the programme." He argues that Poland has outpaced other countries at the start to "Partnership for Peace" and is ready to meet "effectively the proposal's tasks, including "clearly defined" military budget, civilian control over the Defence Ministry, joint military planning and military training with NATO plus the tradition and experience in peace-keeping operations." Alluding to the metaphor included in the title, Grudzinski states that "this is not a marriage yet, merely a concubinage. At stake is that the present ruling political forces in Poland wanted this concubinage and rapidly consummated it." In concluding remarks, Grudzinski concedes that it is not easy to leap from exclusive NATO into a general security system that embraces everyone. The road from the system of divided security to the system of indivisible security has been "taken step by step, through gradual enlargement of the area of stable and democratic states." Other Polish dailies greet the news from Brussels with pages of stories and commentaries. "RZECZPOSPOLITA" announces the endorsement of the "Partnership for Peace" proposal in huge type and leads with a few stories on its front page summing up the results of the first day of the NATO summit in the article entitled "We Will Not Leave You Alone" and describing a reaction of President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in their terse statement "this is an insufficient leap in the right direction." The NATO summit meeting is also widely covered and commented upon on the front page of the left-wing "TRYBUNA". The headline over the article about the government's decision to join the U.S. proposal reads "Beneficial but Insufficient". The paper's journalists write about the NATO decisions in an article under the ironic title "The Hole to the NATO Key", while "TRYBUNA" editor-in-chief Dariusz Szymczycha says in his commentary that "Poland is not the `Christ of nations' and has not been given a bonus for leadership in overthrowing communism. Instead, high expectations have been set before Poland. A perspective has been outlined, but no promises have been made. This is the reality one has to reckon with." Piotr Bazylko writes in a commentary in the "ZYCIE WARSZAWY" daily that "the Polish Government has been forced to participate in the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" programme and quotes Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski as saying that Poland is in the "corridor" of NATO. "The fact that Poland has not been admitted to NATO means that the process of our integration with the West will be slower," Bazylko contends.
