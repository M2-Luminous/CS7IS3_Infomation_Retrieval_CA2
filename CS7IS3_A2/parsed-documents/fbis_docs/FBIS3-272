He is believed to have been arrested in February of this year, after Andre Santana Pitra Petroff, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, government's interior minister, had accused him of incitement in the incidents that led to Bloody Friday on 22 January of last year in which many citizens of Bakongo origin were murdered by the MPLA-PT's police. PDP-ANA had accused the MPLA-PT government of involvement in that massacre. Once the PDP-ANA's militants had learned that their leader had been detained, they asked the United Nations to intervene and secure his release, but so far nothing has been said concerning Lando Vitor's whereabouts. This matter is beginning to worry the Angolan opposition.
