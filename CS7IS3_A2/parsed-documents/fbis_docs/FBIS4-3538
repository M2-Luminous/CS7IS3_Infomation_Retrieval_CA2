To begin with, as the president of the world's "sole superpower," Clinton did not have enough international knowledge and had limited diplomatic knowledge when he took charge of the White House. Then let us look at his supreme policymaking circle. It does not have seasoned statesmen like former Secretaries of State Baker and Schultz, nor veteran advisers like former National Security Advisers Kissinger and Brzezinski. However, precisely because this group of diplomats is lacking strong men, many notable readjustments have been made in diplomatic strategy over the past year. When Clinton put his group of diplomats in place, some U.S. papers and magazines commented that Clinton used competent personnel rather than strong men in order to hold the decisionmaking power for foreign policy firmly in his own hands. "Home and Foreign Policies Are Inseparably Close" Clinton holds the foreign policy decisionmaking power in his own hands to prevent the policy from deviating from the fixed principle touted during his election campaign, namely, the main course of "putting domestic affairs first." Prior to his inauguration, he said clearly at one time that he would "concentrate on economic issues like a laser beam." He unequivocally said: "In today's world, foreign policy and domestic policy are inseparably close." He criticized former President Bush for putting too much energy into foreign affairs, while neglecting the serious economic and social problems at home. Clinton's idea is this: In order to reverse the trend of a weakening United States so that it can play a role in the diplomatic arena, it is necessary to begin by reviving the economy and upgrading scientific and technological competitiveness and education. Not long after he assumed power, he put forward a basket of economic revitalization plans with the stimulation of economic growth as the short-term objective and the reduction of the deficit as the long-term objective. Economists are still disputing what achievements Clinton's economic plans have made over the past year. However, the U.S. economy enjoyed growth exceeding 2.7 percent in 1993, higher than the average level of developed Western countries, improving the Clinton administration's image. U.S. economic growth is expected to continue to exceed that of Japan and Germany this year. The United States has always been a world leader in aeronautic, astronautical, and computer technology. In traditional industrial sectors such as the auto industry, it is also enhancing its competitiveness. At the end of last year, Vice President Gore announced that the nationwide information network called the "information highway" will be completed in 10 to 15 years, which is a sign that the United States will lead the world in the information revolution. As for domestic policy, the Democratic president is enjoying a Democratic-majority Congress, so he is getting along much better than the previous administration. The proposal Clinton put forward to Congress last year received 88 percent approval. Compared with the first-year administration records of preceding U.S. presidents before and after the World War II, this percentage was just lower than Eisenhower's. Although Clinton does not have a high popularity rating, he is better off with his domestic situation than the leaders of other major Western countries. All this, of course, does not affect Clinton's diplomatic achievements. However, his modest successes in the economic, science and technology, and domestic areas have added to the United States' bargaining chips in dealing with other Western countries. The Three Big Moves in the Economic Field Although some people at home have repeatedly criticized Clinton, saying that he has not had a clear foreign policy and that he always wavers in handling foreign affairs, this "inexperienced" president from Arkansas has made the biggest readjustment in U.S. foreign policy since World War II -- putting economic security as the center of foreign policy for the first time. The United States' major diplomatic activities last year were generally centered on economic relations and trade. Whether at the Group of Seven Summit in Tokyo, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Seattle, or at the U.S.-EC trade talks on agricultural products or the GATT Uruguay Round talks, Clinton and his high-ranking officials have strived to better the U.S. economy. After the arduous multilateral talks, agreements were ultimately reached in these diplomatic rounds which can be viewed as the limited success of the Clinton administration. The process of global economic integration is, in the final analysis, a drive for the U.S. economy, although the United States will have to pay a considerable price. Explaining the significance of the Uruguay Round, Clinton said: "The successful signing of the GATT agreements will create 1.4 million employment opportunities (for the United States) and increase the U.S. average annual household income by $1,700, thus ending the two-decade long stagnation of the middle class." As the U.S. Congress debated the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was proposed during the Bush era, Clinton also used similar, moving words. He even mobilized almost all living former presidents to boost the approval of the agreement. He also charged Vice President Gore to hold a televised debate with H. Ross Perot (who ran in the presidential election as an independent candidate against Bush and Clinton). In a hot debate with the trade protectionist forces represented by Perot, Clinton had a close shave. Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement by a weak majority. This was another point for Clinton. The Seattle forum was the Clinton administration's important move in the Asia-Pacific region. The economic boom in the Asia-Pacific region has attracted Clinton's interest. His meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle has made an obvious improvement in the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations. The successful convening of the Seattle forum has added another great success to Clinton's economic and diplomatic activities. Using "fair trade" as the banner, Clinton has been taking a much tougher stance at international economic and trade talks than in the past. "Fair trade" means in fields where U.S. products have an edge, the United States compels other countries to open their markets by threatening to set up trade barriers for their products in the United States. For instance, now that the United States is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products and its agriculture has a relative edge over the EC, it compelled EC countries to lower export subsidies for their agricultural products. Moreover, the United States exerted great pressure on Japan and South Korea, forcing them to open up their rice markets. Although this practice works at times, it has led to the strong dislike of its trading partners and to their retaliatory measures. Military Interventions Win No Support If one says Clinton's diplomatic achievements last year were mainly reflected in the economic field, then the incessant overseas military interventions were his greatest failure. It was Bush who decided to send troops to Somalia under the banner of UN peacekeeping forces, but it is Clinton who should be held responsible for sending additional troops to Somalia and then putting warlord Aidid on the wanted list. The consequences of this were large-scale armed disputes, U.S. officers and men getting wounded and killed, and high casualties among the peacekeeping forces. In the face of acute criticism at home and abroad, Secretary of State Christopher was compelled to publicly admit last October that the United States made mistakes in Somalia. Moreover, the United States sent personnel to hold secret talks with Aidid to seek a political solution and fixed 31 March as the deadline for the pullout of U.S. troops from Somalia. The setbacks in Somalia made the Clinton administration think twice on the question of overseas military intervention. The example was that when U.S. military personnel were about to land in Haiti in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution last October, they were barred from entry by Haiti's military and the Clinton administration suppressed its anger and did not hastily send ground forces to intervene. Similarly, after repeated hesitation, Clinton never used force against Serbian troops in Bosnia. One of the reasons for this is that he has drawn a lesson from Somalia. The kind of prudence shown by the United States in overseas military interventions reflects the readjustment of its defense policy. The emphasis of the Clinton administration's defense plan is to build up quality armed forces; appropriately cut military expenditure, the size of the armed forces, and overseas military bases; and enhance quick mobility and combat effectiveness. Its objective is to win two regional wars simultaneously if this is necessary. It is out of keeping with the diplomatic thinking of "putting the economy first" if the United States gets involved in a military dispute which is not vital to its own strategic interests. Moreover, it will find its ability limited, it will be criticized by public opinion, and will find the loss outweighs the gain. If the Clinton administration can learn something from its past setbacks, does more things like bringing about the signing of the Palestinian- Israeli peace accord, and carries out less unnecessary military interventions, it should be able to improve its prestige at home and abroad. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the United States will take new military risks abroad in an attempt to "revive its military prowess." Clinton has one problem, namely, that as the president and the general commander of the Armed Forces, his relations with the U.S. military have never been straightened out. During the Vietnam War, he refused to serve in the Armed Forces. No sooner had he become the president than he legalized homosexuality in the Armed Forces and continued to cut military expenditures, thus offending many high-ranking military personalities. Recently, U.S. leaders had an internal argument as to how to use limited foreign aid. Clinton and Gore were on one side, favoring using more foreign aid to promote environmental protection and "democratization" of other countries, and not on traditional items related to national security, and this was another issue with the military. At the end of last year, compelled by pressure from the military, Clinton could not but agree to lower the military spending cuts. In the future, faced with frequent regional military conflicts, nationality confrontations, religious disputes, and the proliferation of sophisticated weapons about which the United States is most worried, it is doubtful whether or not the Clinton administration can really place its foreign policy emphasis on the economy. Values Are Challenged The Clinton administration considers the safeguarding of economic security, maintaining powerful Armed Forces, and promoting global democracy as the "three pillars" of its foreign policy. In promoting the values of American-style "democracy" and "human rights," Clinton really has nothing to brag about. At international forums such as the World Human Rights Conference held last June, Western human rights concepts sharply contradicted the views of many developing countries. In the face of the speedy economy development of East Asia, many Americans admit that it is not merely Western political and social development patterns that can lead to economic prosperity. In an article entitled "the Clash of Civilizations," Harvard University Professor Samuel P. Huntington predicts that conflict between civilizations will supplant ideological conflict, and Confucian civilization and Islamic civilization may join hands to pose a strong challenge to Western interests, values, and power. Some commentators hold that Huntington's argument shows a pessimism of being incapable of making the world accept American values. Various facts show that in promoting "democratization" in the world today, the United States meets no less resistance than it did during the Cold War. The Clinton administration has set aside $1 billion to strive to support Russia economically so as to expand the "democratic family." But President Yeltsin's American-supported radical political and economic reforms have not produced obvious results. The bloody disputes in Moscow last October ended with the "democratic faction's" temporary victory. But no sooner had Americans had a breathing spell than the worrying "Zhirinovsky phenomenon" appeared in Russia's year-end parliament elections. The question of how the United States should cope once the extreme nationalist forces get the upper hand in Russia will be a big test for Clinton. Generally speaking, in his first year of governing, Clinton has had diplomatic achievements and failures. Economically, in handling relations with other major powers, he seems to have made some positive readjustments. But he has met some obvious setbacks in overseas military interventions and has had numerous obstacles in pursuing "democratization." The Clinton administration does not have any immediate diplomatic issues at the present time, and it is a rare opportunity for him to make a review and readjustments. Can he prudently and pragmatically conform to the trends of the times? People are waiting to see.
