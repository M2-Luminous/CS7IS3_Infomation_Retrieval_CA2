FR940810-0-00012 FR940810-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;20&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8985; AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;14] Airworthiness Directives; Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters, that establishes a mandatory retirement life of 60,000 high-power events for the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), which is currently not a life-limited part. This amendment is prompted by the manufacturer's analysis and retesting that has shown that frequent takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) shorten the life of the trunnion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion, loss of the main rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Lance Gant, Aerospace Engineer, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, ASW&hyph;170, Fort Worth, Texas 76137, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5141, fax (817) 222&hyph;5959. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters was published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 556). That action proposed to establish a mandatory retirement life of 60,000 high-power events for the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number (P/N) 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, which is currently not a life-limited part. High-power events are takeoffs and external load lifts. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, the FAA has added a sentence to paragraph (d) of this AD dealing with the retirement life of this part to make it clear that the retirement life established is 60,000 high-power events; but, since this AD establishes a new method of determining the retirement life, those trunnions that have 59,400 or more high-power events need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with this change. The FAA has determined that this change will not increase the scope of the AD. However, the FAA has performed a more detailed cost analysis and has determined that, when factoring in the creation and maintenance of the component history card or equivalent record, the anticipated costs are $9,900 higher than the proposed amount for the first year and $8,525 higher than the proposed amount for each subsequent year. In the proposal, the cost of this AD was estimated to be $29,523 each year. The FAA estimates that 15 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and that (1) it will take approximately 16 work hours per helicopter to replace the affected part due to the new method of determining the retirement life required by this AD; (2) it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to create the component history card or equivalent record (record); (3) it will take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to maintain the record each year; and (4) the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $10,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the first year is estimated to be $39,423 and each subsequent year to be $38,048, assuming replacement of the trunnion in one-sixth of the fleet each year, and creation and maintenance of the records for all the fleet the first year and creation of one-sixth of the records and maintenance of the records for all the fleet each subsequent year. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. This AD and any related information may be examined in the Rules Docket at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;14␣Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;8985. Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;20&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters, equipped with main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number (P/N) 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.
