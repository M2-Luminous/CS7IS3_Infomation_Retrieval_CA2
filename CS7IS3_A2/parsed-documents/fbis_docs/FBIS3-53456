The Palestinians and Israelis, however, agreed on 20 points in the last round of talks. These, al-Tarifi added, include education, health, social affairs, electricity, and postal services. The points on which no agreement have been reached include taxes, tariffs, city planning, and water supply. The talks, which will resume tomorrow in Taba, will focus on these unresolved issues, he pointed out. The Palestinian people have a big problem concerning water, because Israeli settlements are exhausting the water resources in the occupied territories, particularly Gaza. Only these settlements, al-Tarifi said, are allowed to dig for water. The Palestinians are not, he noted. Al-Tarifi said: We insist on our right to issue Palestinian passports and ID's. The Israeli side does not agree to the issuance of a Palestinian passport on the grounds that it is a mark of state sovereignty and therefore unacceptable. Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians can exercise civilian authority successfully and without technical or administrative glitches. There are already Palestinian employees working for and running the civilian services and departments. Al-Tarifi pointed out that the number of Palestinian teachers and employees working in the education sector in the occupied territories amounts to 6,800 people, compared with 150 Israelis. We only want them to give us the files and computer data. We can run life in the West Bank and Gaza on our own.
