Chong Chun-ki, chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee, made a report, which was followed by speeches. The reporter and speakers estimated the role and achievements of the world peace council in the 45-year long endeavours to strengthen and develop the struggle of peaceloving people all over the world and elaborated on the major tasks to promote the world peace movement and ways for their fulfilment. They highly appreciated the world peace council for expressing firm solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle to achieve the reunification of the country. They strongly urged that the United States stop its unjustifiable rackets to put pressure on and stifle the DPRK and accede to dialogue and negotiation for a fair solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Considering it necessary to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace one and make a peace arrangement in place of the present armistice body in order to remove the hostility between the DPRK and the United States, achieve reconciliation between them and ensure genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula because the Military Armistice Agreement [as received] has been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the Korean Armistice Commission [as received] turned into a nominal organisation by the unwarrantable acts of the United States, they expressed full support to the recent proposal of the DPRK Government concerning this. An appeal to the peaceloving people of the world was adopted at the meeting. It called upon all the people who value world peace and security to firmly unite as one irrespective of differences in political views and religious belief and turn out in the struggle to build an independent and peaceful, new world freed from domination and subordination, aggression and war. It said: After its foundation, the World Peace Council has made a lot of contributions to achieving national independence and social progress against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism, averting war and ensuring a durable peace and security of the world. We remember the fact that it expressed full support and solidarity for the struggle of the Korean people to defend the freedom and independence of the country against the armed invasion by the imperialist allied forces and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the divided country. To resolve the Korean question in a peaceful way is urgent in ensuring a durable peace and security in Asia and the Pacific. We urge the United States to abandon its hostile policy to stifle Korea, the old policy of the Cold War era, and observe the principles already agreed on between the DPRK and the U.S. sides and promptly accede to the proposed DPRK-USA dialogue and negotiation intended to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful and fair way, replace the Korean armistice agreement with a peace one and make a new peace arrangement in place of the present armistice body. We express the conviction that the world peace forces would continue to extend positive support and solidarity to the Korean people in their struggle to achieve the reunification of the country by means of confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments on the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as agreed upon by the North and the South of Korea.
