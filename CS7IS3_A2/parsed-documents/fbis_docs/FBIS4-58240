It also denied "any indication that the Foreign Ministry, represented by its minister, has any link with that." It is worth mentioning that this denial comes in response to an article supported by documents which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT published last week. The Foreign Ministry promised to publish a response supported by documents to back its position, in order to "prevent it from being pushed into the dispute which has been raging since the crisis erupted," and to ban its employees from exercising partisan activities during their work abroad.
