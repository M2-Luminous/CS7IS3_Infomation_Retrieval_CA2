[Alfonsin] We would have liked to have seen it approved in the version approved by the lower house, with a four-year mandate for senators. [LA NACION] Do you think this was an exclusive decision by the senators? [Alfonsin] All the blocs voted in unison. I must admit I was unable to convince my fellow party members. [LA NACION] Do you believe that the government has not helped in passing these changes? [Alfonsin] No, not at all. [LA NACION] There is a feeling that the pact was violated. [Alfonsin] I would not use the word violated, but evidently it was not clear. [LA NACION] Carlos Corach, legal and technical secretary for the presidency, said that the National Constituent Assembly will have sovereignty in discussing the articles mentioned in the law, and that within this sovereignty they will be able to do what they want with these articles. [Alfonsin] Of course they may do so with the mentioned issues. I am convinced that we will improve a lot of things, that we will improve democracy. I am very satisfied with the agreements. [LA NACION] Isn't it possible that Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity] and Great Front will grow considerably? [Alfonsin] No, they may obtain a few constituents. But in any case, after the Constituent Assembly we will have to speak with everybody. [LA NACION] With the purpose of making an alliance for 1995? [Alfonsin] No, I am not speaking of an alliance. I think that we Argentines must define a possible alternative to a new conservative project. [LA NACION] How will that be? [Alfonsin] I am thinking of a coalition government, a model like that in Chile. [LA NACION] With whom? [Alfonsin] With whomever wishes to defend a general project that will be an alternative to the neo-conservative project. [LA NACION] Let us be clear. Does this definitively rule out the PJ? [Alfonsin] No, we hope the Justicialists will convince themselves of our proposal. Why not? [LA NACION] You do not rule out a coalition government with the PJ [Justicialist Party]? [Alfonsin] I do not rule out anything. I think that many Justicialists are against the policies that are currently being carried out. So that is why we think Justicialists should be included. [LA NACION] Do you mean the dissident Justicialists, the ones who do not agree with Menem? [Alfonsin] I do not know. We will see. We hope they will be as many as possible, because the country will work better that way. [LA NACION] Who will be the UCR candidate for 1995? [Alfonsin] I cannot say. I think Angeloz is the one in the best position. Nothing of this has been discussed yet, nothing at all. [LA NACION] Angeloz was not told anything? [Alfonsin] Not one word. [LA NACION] Will this coalition model be different from a political front? [Alfonsin] I think so. [LA NACION] Why don't you explain it further? [Alfonsin] No, I will not explain it, because it is not the moment. We are not discussing that right now. [LA NACION] What are we talking about, then? [Alfonsin] I do not know, about anything you want. Do you want more insights? [LA NACION] All right. In 1985 you said that Menem was the best governor in the country. [Alfonsin] He gave me a great hand with the Beagle issue. I was indeed thankful for that. And I also gave him a great hand with his governorship. [LA NACION] And now, after the long and public quarrels, what do you think of Menem? [Alfonsin] Look, efforts have always been made to indicate that my opposition to the government was some kind of quarrel. This was done by sectors who not only detest politics, but are also uneasy with it. They are the ones who are uneasy about the current agreement, because this represents starting politics anew. [LA NACION] Did the Radicals then lose four years with a useless quarrel? [Alfonsin] You can see that in my speeches I always said we offered a hand to the president. [LA NACION] You also said you were counting the days for his departure. [Alfonsin] Yes, sir. We said that because it was impossible to say anything else with his hyperpresidential style. [LA NACION] Can the dialogue with the government be expected to continue in the immediate future? [Alfonsin] Yes, sir. Why not? We will demand dialogue. [LA NACION] Would it be surprising, then, to see new high-level meetings on other issues? [Alfonsin] Not in the least. There are issues like education which should be taken out of politics. We will also have a lot of discussion on foreign policy. But we will go with proposals. [LA NACION] For example, what would the UCR do if there is a strike by the CGT [General Confederation of Labor]? [Alfonsin] We will talk with all sectors. Yesterday we held a meeting with CGT lawyers. It is absolutely necessary to hold dialogue in the country. The word dialogue should now be the symbol in Argentina. [LA NACION] Menem does not seem to discard the possibility of a new presidential term in 1999. [Alfonsin] No, no, that is quite clear. I have no doubt whatsoever. [LA NACION] That he will want to continue being president? [Alfonsin] [laughing] No, no. That he will fulfill the pact. [LA NACION] Why are you so confident that the guarantee that the agreement will be respected has absolute value? [Alfonsin] The guarantee we are going to offer is our victory in the elections [of delegates for the Constituent Assembly]. There will be more delegates from UCR at the Constituent Assembly than from any other party. [LA NACION] Why do you feel so confident that the UCR will score a victory in the elections? [Alfonsin] It is very simple. Whenever there is a labor problem, people do not come to us, they have recourse to the CGT. Whenever there is an economic problem, many people will turn to the experts of the Mediterranea Foundation. Whenever there is a problem in soccer, people will resort to [Cesar] Menotti or [Alfio] Basile to solve it. Whenever there is a problem at the university, people get help from Franja Morada [mouthpiece for the UCR at the university]. Whenever there is an institutional problem, a problem confronting democracy that pertains to the institutions of the nation, people turn to us, the UCR. This is why we are going to win the elections. [LA NACION] Are you really convinced of that? [Alfonsin] Of course I am. When I ran for the presidency [in 1983] and said for the first time that I was going to win the elections, people used to say: "He has bats in his belfry. Alfonsin has gone mad. How can he entertain such an idea?" And the UCR is going to win these elections, too. [LA NACION] During an interview with LA NACION, President Menem told us that the chief cabinet minister will not usurp any of his power, not one single iota. [Alfonsin] Well, he may say so if he wishes to. [LA NACION] And don't you believe him? [Alfonsin] It is not that I do not believe him. Do not try to make me argue with the president (he laughs). Read the law and draw your own conclusions. It is my considered opinion that the chief cabinet minister will have a very significant role. He may even act as a safety valve in difficult situations. If only I had had a law such as this. [LA NACION] Do you believe the pressures exerted on the Supreme Court were justified? [Alfonsin] We have always contended that the Supreme Court had to be modified. We have moreover requested some resignations in the Supreme Court, although we did not specify any names in particular. This is not tantamount to any type of pressure. I was asked to resign when I was president, and I so I did. It is a legitimate right to request the resignation of any government official. [LA NACION] Then in that case, it would have been more legitimate to start proceedings for an impeachment. [Alfonsin] Are you pulling my leg? [LA NACION] No. [Alfonsin] That would have taken at least two years. It would have been a scandal to try to conclude an impeachment in a month. That would have been really scandalous. [LA NACION] Do you think the Supreme Court has now been enhanced? [Alfonsin] I have no doubt whatsoever that it has. [LA NACION] How is the domestic situation in some constituencies like Buenos Aires Province, or the capital city, going to be overcome? [Alfonsin] We shall see. Whenever the different constituencies seek my advice about this, I suggest that agreements should be worked out to avoid holding primary elections. [LA NACION] But in the city of Buenos Aires, for example, the ticket would then include Constituent Assembly delegates who have different stances on issues such as the president's reelection. [Alfonsin] No, no. They may have their own personal opinions, but they will have to abide by what the party decides on that issue. What will surely happen is that their campaigns will differ; some will stress one thing, while others will insist on other things. [LA NACION] Are you going to be a delegate? [Alfonsin] I would really like to be a delegate (he laughs). [LA NACION] Given the fact that you would really like to be a delegate, don't you feel like running for the presidency a second time? [Alfonsin] No, absolutely not. [LA NACION] Neither in 1995 nor in 1999? [Alfonsin] I am going to be too old in 1999 (he laughs for a long while). [LA NACION] Haven't you ever thought that you might poll fewer votes in April 1994 than in October 1993? What would you do in that case? [Alfonsin] No, not at all. How could I entertain such a hypothesis? It is absurd that such an idea could ever cross my mind, so let us drop the subject.
