FBIS4-39572 "drsov111_b_94018" FBIS-SOV-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Economic Issues Chubays on Privatization Results Chubays on Privatization Results LD0806163294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1429 GMT 8 Jun 94 LD0806163294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays in an exclusive interview with the Financial Information Agency today said that after the deadline for using privatization vouchers (July 1) Russians might still have about 5 million unused vouchers (over three percent of the 148 million vouchers distributed among Russian citizens). "Inevitably a part of the vouchers will remain unused. However, those five million amount to only three percent of the total number and the fact that 97 percent of Russians will have used their vouchers by July 1 is an indication of the large-scale success of privatization", Chubays said. At a Wednesday news conference in Moscow Chubays said that by June 6, 126 million vouchers had been invested. The State Property Committee will auction 63 very promising companies for vouchers this month, among them platinum producer Norilsk Nikel, the oil company Megionneftegas and the Beryozka chain of stores. Chubays said that this unprecedented drive will allow Russians who have not yet invested their vouchers to exercise their right to purchase a share of former government property. He denied rumors about the prolongation of privatization for vouchers, stressing that July 1 was the deadline. Commenting on the results of privatization, Chubays said that by June Russia had turned 18 out of 22 thousand big and medium-sized companies subject to privatization into joint-stock companies. Over 50 percent of industry is now privately owned, by July 1 the figure should grow to 70 percent. Over 250 major manufacturing facilities have been sold through national auctions held in 86 regions. Since the beginning of the year government property worth 45 billion rubles was sold for vouchers at auctions. Chubays said he believed the figure in June would be 93 billion. Chubays said that most of the 600 voucher investment funds had held the first meetings of share-holders over the past two months and paid small but acceptable dividends. He added that the State Property Committee has serious complaints against 15 funds and their operations will be investigated. Speaking of privatization after the expiry date for vouchers, Chubays said that by June 15 amendments to the draft program will be collected and after that the program will be submitted to the government for final approval. He said that after July 1 it is expected that some 20 percent of government property be sold for cash.
