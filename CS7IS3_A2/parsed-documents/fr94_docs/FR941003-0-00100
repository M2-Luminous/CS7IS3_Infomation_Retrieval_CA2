FR941003-0-00100 FR941003-0-00016 Three major factors form the basis of the proposed amendment: (1) The FAA's support in fostering public interest in aeronautics through model rocketry; (2) the agency's recognition of the importance for model rocketeers to utilize state-of-the-art technology to enhance educational value and international competitiveness; and (3) the agency's responsibility to ensure aircraft flight safety. Accordingly, the proposed amendment reflects the FAA's desire to support the advancement of model rocketry while maintaining an assurance that larger and faster rockets do not jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight. Several commenters oppose both the NPRM and NAR's original petition. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the Air Transport Association (ATA) believe that the larger and more powerful rockets pose a potential threat to air traffic safety. Both organizations underscore the point that larger model rockets are capable of achieving aircraft cruising altitudes. In this regard, ALPA believes collision with a model rocket can cause aircraft damage beyond that ``comparable to the impact of large hailstones'' and that penetration of the aircraft wing skin is likely. For this reason, ALPA believes that the current provisions of 14 CFR Part 101 best ensure safety and recommends that the notification requirements be applied to any rocket firing surpassing 1500 feet above ground level (AGL), regardless of airport proximity. Additionally, ALPA recommends that a safety officer should visually survey rocket firings in controlled areas and manufacturers should provide a copy of applicable FAA regulations relating to launch activities. The ATA favors ensuring safety by permitting no unmanned rockets within a 30-mile radius of regulated airspace. The FAA acknowledges a minimal risk increase in hazard potential that accompanies the operation of larger, more powerful rockets. This minimal risk increase was confirmed by a March 1991 FAA study, Model Rocketry Hazard Study, conducted as part of the agency's analysis of in-flight collision probability between aircraft and model rockets. In concert with the study's final report recommendation, Notice 92&hyph;12 proposed certain guidelines for large model rocket launches. These proposed guidelines, together with rocketeers' proven launch safety vigilance, effectively lessen the minimal risk increase in hazard potential associated with heavier model rockets. One commenter concurs with the safety concerns raised by ATA and ALPA and alleges that hazardous incidents have occurred with larger model rockets. This commenter believes that present technology offers model rockets sufficient propellant capacity so that the FAA should set a maximum allowable rocket weight of 3 pounds and hold propellant mass to a maximum 62.5 grams. To further ensure safety, this commenter recommends that the FAA establish clear, defined limits for model rocket construction material. The commenter contends that ``hi-tech'' paper and plastic are being used to construct more durable rockets than 14 CFR 101 intends. No data was provided by the commenter to support the allegation, and the FAA has no other data which substantiates any occurrence of hazardous instances with larger model rockets. The FAA shares the viewpoint that model rockets only be constructed of paper and other breakable material. To reiterate this agency intent, Notice 92&hyph;12 maintains the current language of §101.1(c), which outlines appropriate material for model rocket construction. However, to issue explicit direction on the manufacture of model rockets, which appears to be the commenter's suggestion, goes beyond the FAA's regulatory purview. Several commenters asked that the FAA create a uniform set of regulations pertaining specifically to model rockets weighing greater than 53 ounces launch weight. The FAA acknowledges the commenters' suggestions and concerns. However, since Notice 92&hyph;12 conveyed only those proposals contained in the original NAR petition. Recommendations to create an additional set of uniform rules specifically for model rockets would be a separate rulemaking action and is beyond the scope of this particular action. The NAR and several other commenters assert that an apparent typographical error in Notice 92&hyph;12 incorrectly reports the NAR's estimate of model rocket launches as 250,000 since the inception of the sport. Commenters state that the appropriate number, as submitted in NAR's 1985 study, is 250,000,000. The FAA has investigated the commenters' assertion and noted that Notice 92&hyph;12 reference was ``250,000 launches of model rockets since the inception of the sport .␣.␣.'' The estimate, as contained in the NAR report is, ``At the time the NAR's petition was submitted in 1985, NAR informed the FAA that more than 250,000,000 launches had been made.'' Because the number of launches of model rockets since the inception of the sport was not used in any FAA rulemaking calculations, the correct figure is hereby noted in this document and has no further bearing on this rulemaking activity.
