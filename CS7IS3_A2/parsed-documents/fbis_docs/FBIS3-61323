However, the degree of their gravity is different. In order to reduce the probability of committing new errors, it is necessary to analyze the objective nature of their occurrence. Let us first turn to the market (Western) economy. Developing cyclically, that is, when from time to time a boom is interrupted by an absolute slump, it thus is able to check the quality of its existence during relatively short periods of time and, having adopted a healing measure in the form of an overproduction crisis, eliminates the disproportions and moves forward. A happy surprise can befall it on this path: while cyclicity is maintained, it can enter the phase of accelerated advanced transformations for decades. Not every national economy manages to realize such a chance. The point is that two types of progress are characteristic of the economy. The first--a cyclical ascent upwards, as though climbing along the spiral to the Tower of Pisa. It does not depend much on the economic management of the authorities. Even if the worst variant is allowed, that is, for some reasons the government would hamper a recovery from the cyclical crisis, the movement of the economy itself would break the resistance of the administration. By now Western economic science has developed a number of generally accepted rules of anticrisis policy. Fulfilling them, the government can save its face even if these rules are incorrect from the point of view of their positive effect on the final result (it is impossible to prove anything mathematically). The cyclical crisis contains the automatism of overcoming itself in a short space of time. Consequently, the sense of the policy of management in countries with a market economy lies not so much in eliminating the cyclical upheaval as in solving another problem: how to lead the economy to a higher plane of development, that is, to ensure conditions for the second type of progress. Economic history gives several facts of this type. One country or another, which until a certain time was not noted for special economic advances, suddenly begins to sharply outpace its competitors in key indicators. Germany and Japan have become chrestomathic examples. New industrial countries in Southeast Asia are now making a spurt. At one time Soviet science did not ignore this matter. However, it examined it from its own specific point of view. Many works on the unevenness of economic and political development of countries during the era of imperialism were written for the purpose of searching and substantiating the weak link in the chain of imperialism, which falls out from it and becomes socialist. Be that as it may, not every country and, all the more, not every government is lucky history-wise. Therefore, cases of an economic spurt are extraordinary. They do not lend themselves to forecasting and, owing to their isolated nature, are not subject to generalization. The situation with a centrally managed economy looks different. A cyclical movement is absent here and, therefore, even the minimum of (cyclical) progress contained in the genes of capitalism is not guaranteed. However, we did not need the minimum, because the planned system set for itself the task of attaining the maximum possible on the basis of the fact that everything can be envisaged and calculated. Here, however, we have encountered a phenomenon, which has not yet been fully recognized in our country. It is a matter of the unknowability of the economy. Unknowability of the economy begins from an analysis of its past. First, with a potential multiplicity of variants only one variant is realized and, in principle, it is impossible to calculate or demonstrate whether it was optimal. It is only possible to assume, taking into consideration political, moral, and military factors, which do not lend themselves to a quantitative measurement. During an evaluation of the past, public opinion can lean toward any side, which is represented, for example, either by a single monopoly opinion, or by a majority of votes, or by disarming eloquence. Second, similar insurmountable difficulties arise during a retrospective analysis of the most realized variant of development and during the clarification of the question of what affected it to a greater, and what, to a lesser extent, and whether everything that affected it is known. Third, it is impossible to grasp the intricacies of current economic development at every moment. Economy as such is the absolute truth and only its small part is accessible to us. Possessing only relative truth, during the Soviet era we used the entire power of the state apparatus for the formation of a process, the scale, structure, and nature of which were not clear to us from the very beginning. The nature of past economic mistakes lies precisely here. State planning did not withstand the gravity of assumed responsibility and the economy secured by nothing fell into a crisis, which differs from the cyclical one by the fact that it does not contain any self-overcoming automatism. They strove for the target maximum, but fell below the market minimum. During favorable periods, when the planned economy externally demonstrated tangible achievements, cardinal disproportions ripened and large-scale flaws were allowed in it. When they became obvious, their elimination occurred according to the same scenario: the rectification of the situation simultaneously created foci of new omissions and even crimes, for which we had to pay during and after decades. The sum of economic knowledge available today objectively permits neither us nor the West to declare ourselves dictators of such a most complex phenomenon as social reproduction. The experienced West does not even try to do this and, therefore, does not make mistakes similar to ours. Local experts understand the fundamental self-regulation of the market economy. They reduce the economic role of the state to fine tuning, correctly thinking that decisive proportions determine the market. Of course, the development of productive forces forces the state to participate in economic life to a greater extent than earlier. However, even in the era of computers and information science it is aware of its secondary role. Private property gives rise to a natural movement of things. It creates a superstructure over itself and redistribution relations, which, clashing and becoming balanced in varieties among themselves, ensure the functioning of the entire economic mechanism. What is the way out? The continuation of previous economic policy would be hopeless for the country. However, giving it up, it would be incorrect to copy criteria for market behavior characteristic of Western functionaries (as yet there are no real prerequisites for this). We face another kind of task: to lead the country to a guaranteed (cyclical) minimum of progress. We cannot wait any longer. The present situation creates for Russia a growing lag behind Western powers, whose economy goes forward despite any crises and contradictions. The market system steadily becomes complicated and this, perhaps, is the most dangerous factor for us from the point of view of the strategic race. The complication of the economy involves a constant and intensive enrichment of Western experts with new knowledge, which, in turn, improves the quality of state economic management. Right now Western economists possess a bigger arsenal of knowledge than our science and practice. Our own chance should be seen in the development of a market nature of the economy, which will ensure its efficiency in all cases, even with the current mistakes of the country's administration. The latter should concentrate on the main question--how to lend an additional speed to the development of the market. Only then will the chance to carry out the second type of progress become realistic. Thus, in order to be equal in potentialities with market countries, we will have to meet two indispensable conditions. First: to accelerate the development of the market environment. Second: having discarded the burden of microeconomic concerns, state bodies should create for the economy strategically favorable conditions for a long boom. This requires high professional competence. We can acquire it only with our own experience and only after the realization of the first condition.
