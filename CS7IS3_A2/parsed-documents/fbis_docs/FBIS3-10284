Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" presidential candidate, travelled to Colombia where he met with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria to discuss economic issues that will ``undoubtedly'' benefit the socioeconomic development of Panama. On this occasion, Carles also met with Argentina's President Carlos Menem, who was also visiting Colombia. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 pp 16, 17) Carles told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that if he is elected president on 8 May, he will send a delegation to Washington on 9 May to renegotiate the U.S. military presence in exchange for economic benefits. Carles accused the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, of "waging a friendly opposition campaign against the government." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1) "Change 94" presidential candidate Carles said once he is elected president, he will organize a commission to promote investments and the creation of jobs. "This commission will be placed directly under the president and will be composed of representatives from business groups, worker associations, and the government. All investment projects will be presented to them." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 1 Mar 94) Yesterday, Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party presidential candidate, said that just because a party member meets with an official of a former regime does not mean her party wants to negotiate with the military. With regard to presidential candidate Carles' interest in talking to the military, she limited herself to saying: "I imagine that as a politician he will want to talk to all sectors." (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 5A) Fernando Manfredo, Papa Egoro vice presidential candidate, denied rumors of disagreement with the party's presidential candidate Ruben Blades, as has been rumored in political circles. Manfredo said: "The voters appear somewhat cynical; they are not impressed by those demagogic speeches and false promises. I think this is the current campaign's tendency." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb 94) Yesterday, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares returned from his trip to the United States, where he met with U.S. investors. Perez Balladares told the media upon his arrival that he had met with the board of directors of the NEW YORK TIMES and THE MIAMI HERALD, and contacted the Latin Chamber of Commerce and the Miami mayor. Perez Balladares said: "We established ties to work jointly in possible investments and trade exchanges starting 1 September." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb 94) Perez Balladares said that if he wins the May elections he will not grant amnesty nor pardon former civilian and military collaborators of the former regime, if they have been found guilty of committing a crime and sentenced. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 1A) Perez Balladres travelled to Mexico City to meet with Luis Donaldo Colosio, Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate. Perez Balladares said: "Had I been president, I would have investigated more thoroughly General Torrijos' death." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1) Perez Balladares thinks candidate Carles' offer to solve the nation's main problem in 100 days "is an insult to the Panamanian people's intelligence." In statements to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Perez Balladares said it was "very irresponsible" to request that U.S. military bases remain after 2000. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1) Presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo of the National Consensus Alliance called ``irresponsible'' statements by former Health Minister Guillermo Rolla Pimental, who said money used by breweries and the PRD in political campaigns are generated by money laundering and drug trafficking." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1) Although the most recent polls do not favor candidate Lewis Galindo, yesterday he admitted he does believe in this type of information. In addition, he criticized presidential candidate Carles for not "adequately managing" the public debt when he was comptroller general. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p A1) Lewis Galindo told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that military bases must not be offered to the United States if they do not ask for them because "one must maintain one's dignity. The public must be consulted" regarding any proposal on this issue, said Lewis. (Panama City, LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1) On 25 February Lewis Galindo presented his state modernization program. He hopes to improve the nation's public administration with the program. Lewis Galindo said: "We must put our house in order. Those who think that because they have personal contacts and relationships, they can obtain funds and credits are making a serious error and are mistaken. Until we have a modern, flexible state that does not hinder local investors, much less foreign investors, we will not achieve anything." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 28 Feb 94) Four of the seven Panamanian presidential candidates participated in the inauguration of CADE 94, the Annual Conference of Business Executives, today in Bambito, Chiriqui province under the slogan, Concrete Alternatives for Development of the Western Part of the Nation, that is, Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro. Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" candidate, denied accusations that he had paid international financial institutions. Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance candidate; Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party candidate; and Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD candidate, spoke in the afternoon. Mireya de Gruber, Arnulfist Candidate; Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro candidate; and Salvador Munoz, Panamenist Doctrinate Party candidate, sent messages saying they would not participate in the conference. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 Feb 94) Electoral Tribunal President Guillermo Marquez estimates that between 350,000 to 375,000 voters will not go to the polls on 8 May. Recent polls indicate that 20 to 25 percent of the voters will not vote. Marquez indicated that 40 to 50 international observers will be present at the 8 May elections.
