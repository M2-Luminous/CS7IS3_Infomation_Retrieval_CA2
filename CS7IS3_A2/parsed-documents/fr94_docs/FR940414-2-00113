FR940414-2-00113 FR940414-2-00076 27. Except as described below, the Partnership will be given the opportunity to sell or otherwise dispose of its investments at the same time and on the same terms as the MS Venture Capital Funds. The General Partner does not intend to make distributions-in-kind to the Partners of portfolio securities that are subject to restrictions on sale (other than pursuant to rule 144(k) of the Securities Act) or that cannot be sold due to sales volume limitations, except in connection with distributions upon the dissolution of the Partnership. Because the Limited Partners generally will be affiliates of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the General Partner may elect not to make distributions-in-kind of portfolio securities to the Limited Partners even though, in its capacity as general partner of the MS Venture Capital Funds, it has decided that a distribution-in-kind of portfolio securities of the same class as those held by the Partnership is appropriate for the MS Venture Capital Funds. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any Partnership investment may be reinvested by the General Partner in Partnership investments, subject to certain limitations. 28. Subject to the limitations described above, the Partnership will be permitted to enter into transactions involving: (a) A member of the Morgan Stanley Group (including without limitation an MS Venture Capital Fund); (b) Any entity in which the Partnership and/or the MS Venture Capital Funds make investments; (c) Any partner of an MS Venture Capital Fund that is not a member of the Morgan Stanley Group (together with the affiliates of such partner, a ``Non-MS Venture Fund Partner''); or (d) Any Partner or person or entity related to any Partner. Any such transaction, however, must be on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than are generally afforded to unrelated third parties in comparable transactions. Such transactions include, without limitation, the purchase or sale by the Partnership of an investment, or an interest therein, from or to any member of the Morgan Stanley Group, acting as principal. With respect to any investment purchased by the Partnership from a member of the Morgan Stanley Group, acting as principal, the Partnership will acquire the investment for no more than the fair value at the time of purchase, plus carrying costs and certain organizational expenses. The fair value at the time of such purchase may be more or less than the price paid by the member, depending on the appreciation or depreciation in the particular investment. 29. A member of the Morgan Stanley Group may provide investment banking, management, or other services and receive fees or other compensation and expense reimbursement in connection therewith from entities in which the Partnership makes an investment or competitors of such entities. Such fees or other compensation may include, without limitation, advisory fees, organization or success fees, financing fees, management fees, performance-based fees, fees for brokerage and clearing services, and compensation in the form of carried interests entitling the member to share disproportionately in income or capital gains or similar compensation. The Morgan Stanley Group reserves the right not to charge or to waive all or part of any such fees or other compensation or expense reimbursement that the Partnership otherwise might incur or bear indirectly. However, except as described in paragraph 16 above, any such fees or other compensation or expense reimbursement received by a member of the Morgan Stanley Group will not be shared with the Partnership. 30. The Partnership may make distributions to the Partners at such times and in such amounts as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. Until the Limited Partners have received distributions equal to their respective capital contributions (disregarding, for this purpose, any distributions to enable Partners to pay taxes with respect to the Partnership's net taxable income allocated to them during any fiscal year), all discretionary distributions will be made to the Partners in proportion to their respective capital contributions. Thereafter, such distributions generally will be made 12% to the General Partner and 88% to the Partners, subject to certain limitations. When distributing cash or securities or both to the Partners, the General Partner will be required to distribute the cash and securities to all Partners in the same proportions; however, the General Partner will have the right, with the consent of Limited Partners representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate capital commitments, to make fair non-ratable distributions in kind. Such non-ratable distributions would be made in the event a Limited Partner notifies a General Partner that the receipt by such Limited Partner of a specific portfolio security would violate any law, regulation, or government order applicable to such Limited Partner. No distribution may be made to a Partner to the extent that such distribution would (a) create or increase a deficit balance in such Partner's account, or (b) render such Partner liable for a return of such distribution under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. 31. The General Partner will conduct a valuation of the Partnership's assets each time items of Partnership profit or loss (including unrealized gains and losses) are to be allocated to the capital accounts of the Partners; at the time of any distribution in kind to the Partners; and in connection with the preparation of periodic reports to the Partners. The General Partner's valuation of any securities will be conclusive and binding on all parties; however, if Limited Partners representing at least a majority of the aggregate capital commitments object to any valuation, a procedure exists for submitting the valuation to arbitration. The rules applicable to the valuation of Partnership assets are the same as those applicable to the valuation of assets of the MS Venture Capital Funds. 32. The Partnership will be permitted to borrow money, subject to limitations as to the aggregate principal amount and maturity of indebtedness that may be incurred by the Partnership. It is not anticipated that a member of the Morgan Stanley Group will advance funds to the Partnership but, if any such advances are made, the terms thereof will be no less favorable to the Partnership than would be obtained on an arm's-length basis.
