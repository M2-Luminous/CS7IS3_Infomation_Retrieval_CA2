FR941021-0-00081 FR941021-0-00013 13. We believe that cable operators should be permitted to adjust rates on account of the regulatory fees without prior regulatory approval, subject to our requirements for 30 days' advance notice. Thus, operators may adjust rates to reflect the newly imposed regulatory fees, and any subsequent increases in the fees, in the same manner that rates may be adjusted for increases in franchise fees, as discussed above. Decreases in Commission regulatory fees will continue to be treated as external cost decreases under our existing rules and must be passed through to subscribers in accordance with those rules. In addition, fees may not be passed through to the extent that there are other offsetting fee decreases. 14. Operators shall recover the annual regulatory fee according to the following schedule. Regulatory fees of $0.37 per subscriber that were due on August 12, 1994 and/or September 9, 1994 for fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993&hyph;September 30, 1994) shall be recovered from subscribers over a ten month period beginning in December of 1994 and ending in September of 1995. For the first three months of this ten month period (December 1994&hyph;February 1995), operators shall recover $0.03 per month per subscriber. For the remaining seven months (March 1995&hyph;September 1995), operators shall recover $0.04 per month per subscriber. Operators may provide notice of the entire fiscal year's regulatory fee pass-through in a single notice so long as that notice states that the fee pass-through will increase from $0.03 in February 1995 to $0.04 in March 1995. Regulatory fees that are assessed for subsequent fiscal years shall be recovered in twelve monthly installments during the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the payment was imposed. For example, operators may begin recovering regulatory fees paid for fiscal year 1995 during the 12 month period from October 1995 through September 1996. Payments shall be collected in equal monthly installments, except that for so many months as may be necessary to avoid fractional payments, an additional $0.01 payment per month may be collected. All such additional payments shall be collected in the last month or months of the fiscal year, so that once collections of such payments begin there shall be no month remaining in the year in which the operator is not entitled to such an additional payment. Recovery of regulatory fees paid for fiscal year 1995 and subsequent fiscal years is, of course, subject to the notice requirements contained in this Order and in our rules. We recognize that operators will not recover the regulatory fee until after they have paid it. However, operators may not assess interest on the amount charged to subscribers for regulatory fees in order to avoid the substantial administrative burdens on operators and regulators in determining and reviewing interest calculations. 15. The Report and Order released June 8, 1994, implementing regulatory fees on cable television systems, also provided that, for fiscal year 1994, each Cable Television Antenna Relay Service (CARS) licensee would be assessed a regulatory fee of $220 per license by the Commission. We decline to provide for the external cost treatment of CARS regulatory fees. CARS license regulatory fees are assessed on a flat fee basis of $220 per license and should not represent significant amounts to most operators. We will consider the need to permit external cost treatment of CARS regulatory fees for small systems upon completion of our cost studies. III. Administrative Matters
