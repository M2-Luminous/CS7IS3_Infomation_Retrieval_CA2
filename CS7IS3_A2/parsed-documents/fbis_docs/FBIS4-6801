Suharto welcomed them to Indonesia and said he hoped their contacts with Indonesian parliamentarians would further boost bilateral ties. The president noted that during a visit earlier in the week to Indonesia by Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the foreign minister discussed with him recent developments in the UN Security Council [with regard to Iraq's demand that the sanctions be lifted]. Suharto told Salih that Indonesia takes a keen interest in the matter and will pursue it in its capacity as the current president of the Nonaligned Movement through its coordination bureau in Jakarta and liaison office in New York. Indonesia also plans to contact the movement's nations who are not permanent Security Council members. In case no suitable solution is worked out to end the hardships the Iraqis are experiencing from the sanctions, Indonesia, Suharto added, will explore other avenues. His country also stands ready to extend humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, particularly medicines. Sa'di Mahdi Salih thanked the Indonesian president for his time and for the positive approach of the Indonesian leadership and people to Iraq.
