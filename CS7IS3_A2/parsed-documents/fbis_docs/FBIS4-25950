Two months before "4 June," the CPC Central Committee instructed the State Education Commission and the Communist Youth League Central Committee to jointly carry out "an analysis of the current conditions of college students," to understand the current ideological conditions and characteristics of college students. The "analysis of the current conditions of college students" is summarized below. [end editor's note] Compared with other social groups in contemporary society, today's college students are still a group which is very idealistic and politically sensitive and is characterized more by belief and aspirations. A Group Which Is Ideal and Diversified in Development Compared with the college students in an earlier period, today's college students exhibit the features of diversity in thinking, choice, and the problems they face. In concrete terms, at present, the number of students who want to "learn some practical knowledge" has increased, reaching 84.9 percent; at the same time, 60 percent of them are still interested in major international and domestic issues and news but their focus on politics, the channel through which they care about politics, and the style with which they do so have changed and shifted. Eager To Work Part-Time and Fall in Love Judged superficially, college students today have obviously become more pragmatic in all areas and at different levels. In the area of study, students are quite vigorous. Most students have a "broad" understanding of "study," saying that "reading books is study but using knowledge is a more important study method." In terms of behavior, they have already jumped out of "books." Absence from class, being late for class, and leaving before class is finished are spreading phenomena. The "craze for going abroad" among students has declined a bit but is basically in a condition of steady development. On campus, a "craze for becoming capable people" is taking shape. However, as regards the criteria for a qualified person and how one can become a capable person, useful to society and needed by the country, students have an understanding and behavior very different from the traditional modes. In the area of politics, discussions on political problems, as well as expressing and exchanging ideas, have decreased, and there is little deep pondering and research. Thus, there is no clear sign of any emerging political ideological trend and there is a certain degree of indifference and apathy. In the area of daily behavior, last year, the phenomenon of students breaking the law and discipline was frequently seen. The number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases was four or five times that in the previous year and the most acute phenomenon was "fighting and beating." The "love wind" was constantly blowing. During last summer, about one-third of students worked amid the "work craze." The Sense of "Ego" Swells Judged psychologically, most students are currently in the "individualizing" condition and their senses of "ego" and of being an individual are gradually becoming explicit and clear. This is mainly illustrated by the following three points: 1) When they choose a mode of behavior, they mainly or solely ask "whether it is beneficial to myself" or "whether I can obtain benefit from it." 2) In the area of politics, they cannot resist the temptation and about two-thirds of students show great interest in and enthusiasm for the major international and domestic political issues. 3) In daily life, their psychological condition and concepts are in a rather seriously unbalanced state. From the above descriptions we can see inconsistency and a great deal of contradiction between the superficial phenomenon of students and their psychological condition. The use of traditional viewpoints and angles to observe and analyze students' superficial problems will easily slip into an impasse characterized by puzzlement and confusion. Judged from a static perspective, that is, from the current conditions, the basic situation among college students is quite optimistic. They are still fully confident and hopeful about the future and still want very much to train themselves into "people useful to the society," wanting to do great things. They show a higher degree of care for politics. For example, about 73 percent of the college students in the Beijing area said that they are "very concerned" or "quite concerned" with "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's inspection tour to the south" and "the 14th CPC National Congress," 95.8 percent of them agree that "economic development needs a stable political environment," and 76 percent of them thought that the central authorities have scored results, or havve "obtained marked effect," or "scored initial result" in "stabilizing the political situation." Mammonism Has a Certain Market on Campus However, judged from a dynamic perspective, that is, from the situation of development and changes, there is something to worry about. Judged from the students' job choices, mammonism has a certain market on campuses. "High income" has already jumped from second and third choice in several previous surveys to first choice and "giving full play to individual specialties" has dropped from first to second choice. Judged from the psychological condition of the students, although they think that the future is full of promise, about half of them "do not know exactly what to do in the future." When 1993 is compared with 1992, the degree of satisfaction felt by students toward the relevant work in schools is decreasing, generally by over 20 percent; the degree of satisfaction toward the work done by the central authorities in recent years has also decreased by over 15 percent. The main current among today's college students is good, positive, and upwardly mobile. This is mainly manifested in the following: Some 75 Percent of Students Think That People Should Have Belief 1. In the area of outlook on life, all college students hope that they can become people who are viewed by others as "useful persons," "successful persons," or "persons who can accomplish a lot of things." Although they have different criteria regarding "success," (making contributions to society or making themselves happier and freer); although they have different choices of channels to "success," (such as "going to the mountain," "going to the sea," carrying out theoretical research, or engaging in actual operations), most students have a positive outlook on life; and the degree of "waiting" is decreasing and the sense of "struggle" is increasing. A survey in Beijing shows 73 percent of students strongly advocate that "people should have belief" and 50 percent of students do not agree with the viewpoint "enjoying without delay." Many college students throughout the country gave similar answers. The "craze for becoming a capable person" has quietly emerged. Nearly 70 percent of students thought that "university students should become builders of socialism." Not Caring About Politics, Caring Only About Immediate Interests 2. In the area of politics, although one-third of students have the concept that "it is better to be indifferent to politics" and two-thirds of them feel that "at present, most people do not care about politics but care only about immediate interests," two-thirds of students are still very interested in international and domestic political issues, toward which they show a high degree of concern, and their viewpoints are quite correct. For example, 75 percent of students think that "China's future is full of promise" and this is particularly true after further unfolding of the "anticorruption" work and the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The minor points regarding students cannot be neglected and belittled. These are mainly manifested in: Feeling That Religious Activity Is "Fun" 1. There is an increasing number of students who feel that religious activity is "fun," who have a certain interest in religion, and who have varying degrees of religious belief. According to information, there is a certain number of students who go to church on Sunday but only a few of them really have firm religious belief. 2. Among students, the number of those who agree with the "tendency to become the same" theory is increasing and the number of those who are indifferent to politics is also on the rise. According to a survey carried out on the campus of a comprehensive university in Beijing, in 1992, 41.9 percent of students believed in the "tendency to become the same" theory and thought that the socialist and capitalist systems will gradually mix together; in 1993, the figure had risen to 51.1 percent. According to a survey by Beijing Municipality, in 1986, 11.9 percent of students held the viewpoint that "university students should mainly concern themselves with study and not with politics and society"; in 1988, this figure dropped to 6.2 percent. However, in 1993, 36.8 percent of students held the viewpoint that "it is better to be indifferent to politics." 3. The phenomenon of psychological imbalance among college students is quite general and the condition of psychological well-being among students is deteriorating. According to a survey done by a college of engineering in Beijing, 34.3 percent of students have psychological illness to varying degrees, far surpassing the average level (16 percent) in the colleges across the country two years ago. Twenty-Five Percent of University Students Have Premarital Sex 4. The moral condition of college students is "deteriorating." According to a survey of 2,000 students in 20 universities, about 25 percent of students have had premarital sex and this tendency is increasing; according to the heads of many student work departments (offices) in higher learning institutes, students' morals have sharply declined and cheating in exams has become prevalent. College Students Are Seriously Unbalanced Psychologically Judged from the above analyses, to varying degrees, college students have left the "intermediate state" and entered the "polar state" or "plural state." That is, activity and passivity coexist, stability and agitation occur simultaneously, and hope and despair perpetuate together, forming a rather seriously conflicting condition. Superficially, campuses do not seem to have any "flash points" and "no focus" but, in fact, they have "many flash points," "many focuses," and "many tendencies," and are in a disorderly state and a psychologically unbalanced, and even seriously conflicting, condition.
