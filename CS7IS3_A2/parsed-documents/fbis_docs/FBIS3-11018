Moreover, the communique states that although a democratic process has started, the government has still not managed to set up a socioeconomic structure that will benefit the weakest. During the CEP-Conferpar meeting held in Ypacarai yesterday, the bishops, priests, and nuns issued a communique voicing the need for effective commitment to national unity through a moralization campaign, so to be able to face the socioeconomic crisis the country is suffering through. The communique issued by the religious group maintains that they welcome "with happiness" a democratic regime that, among other things, made it possible to win public liberties. It notes, however, that this is not the case in the socioeconomic field, which is "marked by a series of factors and by an economic policy in which the social aspect has not been taken into account, and which encourages the defense of individual interests to the detriment of the common well-being." It then adds that, "sadly," one can witness every day the growing deterioration in the country's socioeconomic situation, and especially the situation of peasants, workers, and the poor, "who are the most affected, and continue to be denied the benefits to which they are entitled by law. This situation is even worse in the case of the indigenous communities." The clergy maintain that the solution to social problems cannot be found through violence and government repression against these sectors of society. In this regard they explain that the solutions will be found within a framework of dialogue and freedom, where none of the sectors resort to the use of force. The communique goes on to state "that we have also seen that privileged people and groups have distorted the moral values by means of a way of life based on moral, psychological, administrative, political, and juridical corruption, which is reflected among other ways in the deficient administration of justice, and in the lack of essential health, education, and housing services." In view of this panorama of progressive impoverishment of the people the clergy reasserted their "preferential treatment of the poor," expressing solidarity and support for the initiatives taken for the sake of the common well-being, seeking "a fair distribution of assets, a broad land reform policy, aid and organization for peasant settlements, fair prices for agricultural products, the recovery of ill-begotten property, salaries commensurate with the cost of living, and the fair demands of workers and peasants, who have a right to use nonviolent means in their search for a more dignified life." The communique also states that, taking into account the social situation prevailing in the country, the national citizenry must assume the commitment through a moralization campaign to face the socioeconomic crisis we are enduring.
