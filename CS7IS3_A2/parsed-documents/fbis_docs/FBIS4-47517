These shortcomings of solar power plants may be eliminated by creating combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plants such as those that have been operating since 1985 in the United States. The possibility and feasibility of siting a megawatt-class combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant in Ukraine for the purpose of stable commercial production of electric power was analyzed. The following seven strategic aspects of siting such a plant in Ukraine were considered: finding a priority technological combination of one thermodynamic cycle (conversion of heat into electricity) with an existing power system (conversion of solar radiation into heat); determining the ``niche'' of use of the electric power produced at a combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant; determining the ecological impact of such a plant; using the earth's surface; identifying tap and fresh water sources to be used for cooling; identifying a source of fuel (i.e., natural gas); and giving consideration to the implications of the shortage of electric power in the southern part of Ukraine. The analysis indicated that a megawatt-class combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant in Ukraine could reduce the amount of fossil fuel required to produce electric power in Ukraine if it were sited so as to make use of the actinometric characteristics (``solar potential'') of the semiarid southern rayons of the Odessa, Nikolayev, and Kherson oblasts and western and eastern regions of the Crimea and if the plant were designed to include parabolic concentrators with hollow heat receivers in its ``solar'' part and gas-steam turbine units with steam injection into the combustion chambers in its ``thermal'' part.
