FBIS4-52342 "dreas090__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-090-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Hitachi Telecom To Expand U.S. Production Hitachi Telecom To Expand U.S. Production 942A0164A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Apr 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0164A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Hitachi will launch local production in the United States of core equipment for next-generation communication networks such as superhigh-speed optical transmission systems (SONET) and asynchronous transmission mode (ATM)-related equipment. The program will call for a threefold increase in personnel and a sales goal of 50 billion yen for fiscal year 1998 for the local subsidiary. In the United States, telephone companies and cable television (CATV) companies are building high-speed digital communication networks compatible with the "information super highway concept" and demand for next-generation communication equipment has risen sharply. Hitachi hopes to preclude trade friction through local production and assume an aggressive marketing stance in this new field. SONET and ATM switching equipment encompass a variety of communication equipment used for high-speed transmission of not only voice and character but images as well. Production will be in charge of Hitachi's local subsidiary, Hitachi Telecom USA, headed by President Makoto Suzuki and located in Atlanta, Georgia, which currently handles the production of private branch exchanges (PBX) in the United States. Capital expansion will involve investments in the range of 4 to 5 billion yen and if the project goes well, production will start by the end of the year. The program will involve an increase in Hitachi Telecom's employees from the current level of 130 to about 400 by fiscal year 1996 mostly through appointment of local hires. This will be the first time that Hitachi markets SONET systems. Executives of the company say, "We are receiving many inquiries from U.S. communications companies." The company's sales objective for the transmission sector for fiscal year 1998 is 35 billion yen. At the end of last year, Hitachi received an order for ATM multiplexing systems in the area of ATM-related equipment from Time-Warner for use in two-way CATV service systems. The seven units for which orders were received at that time were manufactured domestically and have already been delivered. In the future, manufacture of all products destined for the United States will be completely transferred to Hitachi Telecom as a means of avoiding trade friction. The sales objective for fiscal year 1998 is roughly 15 billion yen. Hitachi hopes to increase its market presence in the face of rapid developments in the multimedia sector and attendant growth in market potential for next-generation communications networking businesses.
