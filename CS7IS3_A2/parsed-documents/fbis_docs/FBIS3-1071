According to our correspondent Pedro Manuel in the Zambian capital, although the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] accepted the portfolios offered by the government, the Black Cockerel's men want more. The government in turn refuses to yield and points out that its offer is not negotiable. Pedro Manuel reports. The process continues at an impasse. The parties have not yet reached an agreement in the country's administration. Although it is being said that UNITA has accepted the ministries of health, trade, tourism and hotel industry, a source said that this does not change the present situation. The government has offered UNITA these posts and although UNITA has accepted them, it says they are not enough. UNITA also wants to hold other ministries, the so-called [word indistinct] ministries. The government continues to say no because its offer is nonnegotiable. It also seems as if UNITA wants to hold the Ministry of Public Works and Urbanization, instead of the Construction Materials Ministry. This issue could find an easy solution, because both the Public Works Ministry and the Construction Materials Ministry are part of the ministries offered by the government. That is not all however [words indistinct]. On provincial governments, the situation continues unchanged. Apart from Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango which were offered by the government, UNITA also demands the provincial governments of Benguela, Huambo, and Bie. As if this was not enough, UNITA also wants to administer more than 20 districts and about 50 communes [words indistinct]. The government has answered no. Now, the mediators are [words indistinct]. This work began yesterday afternoon and continued this morning, but no results have been obtained so far. The talks will be resumed on 21 March. Meanwhile, the government negotiating team returned to Luanda this afternoon for consultations with the president of the Republic [words indistinct].
