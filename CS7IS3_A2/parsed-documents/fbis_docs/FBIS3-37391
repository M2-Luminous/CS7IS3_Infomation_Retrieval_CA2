The committee held hearings Tuesday on the possible escalation of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The restoration of a single democratic state is the sole way to discontinue the military, political, economic and inter-ethnic crisis in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, says the resolution. The document says that the implementation of a NATO decision on air strike against the Serb positions near Sarajevo should be considered as an act of international terrorism. The Russian president is proposed to use his right of veto at the UN Security Council, as well as lift economic sanctions, imposed by Russia against Yugoslavia. Representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Ivanovskiy, told deputies that the UN resolution on Yugoslavia puts responsibility for unblocking Sarajevo on the UN Secretary General and it is not necessary to convene the Security Council to take decision on air raids. This means that the use by Russia of its right to veto could be discussed only "hypothetically", he said. The UN resolution, said Ivanovskiy, allows the use of the military force only if there is threat to the safety zones, including Sarajevo, and to the relief convoys and UN peacekeepers.
