The building, in the Mariina Roshcha district in northern Moscow, was badly damaged overnight last Wednesday, in a fire which police said was due to an electrical short circuit. Rabbi Berel Lazar is less certain, noting threats made against another synagogue recently, and a fire at a Jewish community school in Moscow last week. "I hope it is all accidental," said Lazar, sent to Moscow by the orthodox Lubavich movement, as he led a service by young and old Jews outside the burnt out building Monday. Addressing the two-hour service in the cold, he questioned the police's decision not to open an official inquiry into the fire. "We have neither the time nor the means to find out who is responsible and what happened," he said. Moscow's small number of synagogues have suffered a number of incidents in recent years, culminating in an arson attack on the Hasidic synagogue on Bolshaia Bronnaia street in April 1992. The 1929 Mariina Roshcha synagogue was the only Jewish house of worship built after the Bolshevik revolution. Jewish fears have been particularly raised by the electoral success of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. "That is just one thing which leads us to say that the events of recent days are not simply accidents," said Lazar. In response to a growing threat of anti-semitism, the government last October banned a number of organizations and publications which were openly anti-Jewish. A Moscow city official, Vladimir Sister, assured Jews Monday of the "cooperation, friendship and understanding" of the authorities, although he insisted that the fire was caused by a short circuit. A collection was organized at Monday's service, as those present tried to be positive. "All we can do today is rebuild our synagogue," said worshipper Heshiel Fried, his voice strained with emotion.
