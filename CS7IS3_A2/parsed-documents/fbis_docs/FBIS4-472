FBIS4-472 "drafr070_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Government, ANC Pessimistic on kwaZulu Prospects Government, ANC Pessimistic on kwaZulu Prospects MB1104105394 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 11 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 MB1104105394 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [Report by Helen Grange, Chris Whitfield, and Norman Chandler] [Text] kwaZulu could face an intensified security crackdown if last-gasp talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in the electoral impasse. There are widespread fears that violence in kwaZulu/Natal might soar if the special working group -- set up to provide the summit sequel with fresh initiative -- fails. Yesterday there was deep pessimism in both Government and ANC circles over prospects for a breakthrough. "Even if we manage to reach agreement in the working group -- which is possible -- it appears that it will be blocked by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leadership," said a senior Government source. They pointed out that encouraging progress in talks between the king and Mandela on Friday [8 April] had been reversed after he consulted the full IFP delegation. With the failure of the four-way Skukuza summit, it is understood that security action will be considerably intensified if tensions in the province continue to lead to bloodshed. KwaZulu politicians acknowledge that the next four days will be crucial to the territory and the Zulu monarchy. They fear that if their demands are not met, the low-key civil war now raging in the region could escalate out of control. The situation in the territory was generally quiet yesterday. South African troops had not been mobilised by nightfall at their temporary base at the Eshowe showgrounds. It is understood that mobilisation could begin by Thursday, depending on the success of the task force discussions. Yesterday Ulundi was abnormally quiet, according to local residents. The local hotel had only three guests, and normal Saturday trade at the bar and restaurant was non- existent. With hopes of an ANC-IFP constitutional resolution all but shattered by Friday's inconclusive summit, attention is also focusing on getting as many kwaZulu/Natal voters as possible to the polls. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer, speaking in Cradock yesterday, said it was estimated about 60 percent of Natal's inhabitants would be able to participate freely in the election. But IFP supporters, especially north of the Tugela, were actively intimidating people not to take part in the election, he said. Meyer warned that if the election was postponed, the future of the country would be determined by radical elements of the Left and Right, and that a Bosnian-style situation would develop. None of the arguments that were now being brought up by the IFP were new and there were no solutions for them, he added. The IFP warned at its central committee meeting on Saturday that kwaZulu citizens would resist the state of emergency, and demanded its immediate lifting. In resolutions addressing the reasons for rejecting the ANC's "offer" at Friday's summit, the IFP central committee said it had displayed a "great deal of ignorance" and some aspects were "even colonial in character". The committee said the offer was a political promise with no legal effect on the Interim Constitution, and amounted to an offer to the king "as a person" and not as the head of the Zulu nation. It gave him ceremonial functions but provided no space for the autonomy and self- determination of the Zulu nation. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi told THE STAR: "We are very depressed. In my whole lifetime I have never seen such anger by our people." He added that the state of emergency was not a recipe for peace.
