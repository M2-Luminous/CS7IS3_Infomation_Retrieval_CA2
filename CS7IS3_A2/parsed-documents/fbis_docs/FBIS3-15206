Moreover, all telephones and computers were stolen. Nakhichevan's sources told TURAN that yesterday the police suggested that the employees of the Nakhichevani branch of the PFA should leave the building. The same sources report that a special regiment of police was sent to the Ordubadskiy Region in Nakhichevan. As is known, presently the leader of the PFA, Abulfaz Elchibey, lives near there. All those facts cause further tension in Nakhichevan. Meanwhile, the opposition is still subjected to persecution in Baku.
