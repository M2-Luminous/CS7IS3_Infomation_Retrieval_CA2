However, they have no troops to command yet, as the soldiers are still being selected for retraining. In an interview after their swearing-in ceremony, former Renamo military chief, Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, said that from this moment on he ceased to be Renamo. He said that he now represented the armed defense forces of Mozambique. Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo, selected by the government as joint commander with Gen. Ngonhamo, said the challenge facing them was to defend the country and its territorial integrity. The two officers will command a 30,000-strong army as provided for in the terms of the 1992 peace accords.
