His electoral platform says that he would initiate reforms, which should cut the monthly inflation rate to 7 to 10 percent against the present over 40 percent. Under a plan his team have developed, within six months the average citizen would earn $100 to $150 a month against the present $3. Shushkevich and his supporters want to create as soon as possible a private sector and to improve the management of the state sector. The platform says that the private sector would put the economy on its feet, create competition, lead to a restructuring and modernization, make the economy work for the people and create jobs. Shushkevich promised he would use to the maximal advantage of the Republic's geographical position of a bridge between Russia and Western Europe, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. He thinks that it is necessary to carry out a national program of encouraging the export that would facilitate transformation of the traditional markets in CIS member nation into those where international competition is welcome. Once he became president, Shushkevich would reduce the import of fuels and grain and use customs tariffs to encourage the import of technologies and equipment. The platform offers free choice between the kinds of land ownership such as collective farms, state farms, individual farms, cooperatives and farm product processing society. It says that mechanisms had to be developed under which state-owned land would be rented and efficiently operating collectives or citizens could take it over from bankrupts. Only a land tax would be levied, eventually. The platform calls for demonopolization and privatization of the agrarian service and the processing industry with the participation of agricultural producers in the process. Shushkevich also intends to change radically the budgetary and taxation policy. He is convinced that heavy taxes are the outcome of government overspending. He would have the state expenses cut by one third but would maintain if not increase the expenses for education, science, culture, public health, and elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Shushkevich would also increase the real estate tax, transit tariffs and duties on import of luxury goods and resolve the payment crisis by introduction of promissory notes which would become securities. The reforms would enable the private owner to become the engine of the economic growth and stability. Thousands of small- and medium-size companies engaged in production of foodstuffs and consumer goods would spring to existence within a year, the platform argues. It expects the economic freedom to trigger an investment and construction boom in the manufacturing industries. New roads and communication lines as well as cottages would be built. As a result, the building material industry would flourish. The investment policy and the possibility to use the privatization money locally would step up business activities in every part of Belarus. The tax and subsidy reduction would enable redistribution of the cash in favor of the consumers with a significant increase of grants, pensions and wages concurrently with production increase. Shushkevich promised he would immediately stop inflation and set up a working financing system using a convertible currency. If Russia did not agree to an equitable merger of the monetary system, Belarus would introduce its own currency. A strong currency would put a stop on the price rises, provide stability and confidence in the future.
