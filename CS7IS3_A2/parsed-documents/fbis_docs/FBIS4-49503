They agreed to use the results of a census conducted in 1991 and give all cities and towns where Croats and Muslims constitute the majority to the Muslim-Croat Federation, the Croatian news agency HINA quoted Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak as saying. Bosnian Foreign Minister Ifran Ljubijankic said the federation will have more than 51 percent of Bosnia's territory. U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman said the round of negotiation was held in a "friendly atmosphere" and made certain achievement. But he added that Muslims and Croats could reach final agreement on borders only after the Bosnian issue is solved comprehensively. Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic both showed some optimism about the negotiation. The negotiation is being conducted in two separate working groups, one of which is focusing on the border issue.
