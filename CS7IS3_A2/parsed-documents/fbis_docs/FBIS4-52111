FBIS4-52111 "dreas088_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 South Korea Hyundai Awaits Government Lift of Sanctions Hyundai Awaits Government Lift of Sanctions SK0605070394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0643 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605070394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The betting is on as to whether the government will lift financial sanctions on the Hyundai Business Group as four banks and financial institutes have offered to lend 110 billion won to Hyundai Petrochemical Co. If it is approved, the joint loan from Boram, Korea Long-term Credit, Kwangju Bank, and KKBC International will be the largest form of financial assistance to a Hyundai affiliate since the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government. Financial sources say that except for the main trading banks -- Korea Exchange and Korea Development -- Hyundai had experienced no trouble in trading with commercial banks. Nevertheless, Hyundai is reportedly attaching great meaning to the 110-billion-won loan, considering it a cue on whether the government still has hard feelings against the business giant, which allegedly helped fund the presidential campaign for its founder Chong Chu-yong in the 1992 election. If the loan goes through, the group is poised to initiate various investments it has so far shelved or scaled down. Hyundai had initially planned to spend 4.5 trillion won this year, 3.3 trillion won on facilities and 1.2 trillion won on research and development. It had hoped to receive assistance worth 1.54 trillion won from the Korea Development Bank for spending on seven affiliates including Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision and Industry. But when its application for facility funding at the state- financed bank was not even registered, Hyundai had to put off some projects or scale down investment. Hyundai officials say they anticipate smooth funding by banks now that Chong has announced his plans to retire from active business management. The group had planned to invest 1.1 trillion won in its biggest company, Hyundai Motor, to expand production lines. But construction of the factory with an output capacity of 100,000 trucks and buses has been put on hold because of slow financial assistance. Hyundai Electronics hopes to finish constructing assembly lines for 16 megabyte dynamic random access memory chips by the latter part of the year after a long delay. Company officials say they could have fully enjoyed the semiconductor boom like other firms in the industry had the plant been built on schedule. The group is apparently getting restless just thinking about how rival companies are forging ahead due to its delayed investments. "Frankly, we would like to register the shares of our affiliates on the over-the-counter market and apply for a loan at the Korea Development Bank right now," one official says. But Hyundai is refraining from any hasty action lest it irritate the government. "For the time being, we will just wait and see," he says.
