Sergey Dubinin, Russia's acting minister of finances, said at a meeting with correspondents that the talks went on for two days and two nights, and ended this morning with the signing of an appropriate agreement. The rescheduling concerns the part of the basic capital and the interest on it that Russia was to have repaid this year. The $7 billion on which the accord was reached will be paid back later. Russia has achieved advantageous conditions for the rescheduling of this part of the debt. The `Paris Club' has granted a 3-year grace period, during which no demand will be made for the money and after which the sum will be repaid over 17 years. A favorable interest rate will be charged on this part of the consolidated debt. The head of the Russian delegation drew attention in particular to the fact that the agreement with the `Paris Club' opens the way to agreement with other creditors. Corresponding talks are to be held with the commercial banks, suppliers, and private banks which make up the `London Club.' As a rule, agreements are concluded with these crditors on conditions comparable to the conditions of the `Paris Club.' In total, it is a matter of a sum amounting to approximately $25-27 billion. Last year an accord was reached with the `Paris Club' on rescheduling payments on Russian external debts amounting to $15 billion, due in 1993. Sergey Dubinin stressed that Russia's fulfilment of the obligations it had undertaken on this agreement are inspiring trust in creditors who also understand Russia's economic difficulties and the efforts of its government to reduce inflation rates. The total debt inherited by Russia from the the former Soviet Union amounts to $78-84 billion. The acting finance minister stressed that the servicing of debts taken on directly by the Russian Government since 1 January 1992 is on schedule. For the time being the draft state budget for the current year, which is being discussed by parliament, allocates $4.1 billion to debt repayment. Russia will realistically be able to pay its creditors after talks with them within the framework established by the law. He said talks would take place in the fall on a general restructuring and consolidation of Russia's total external debt and on rescheduling forthcoming payments. To do this it is necessary to reach agreement on Russia's economic policy with experts of the International Monetary Fund. Afterward, the creditors will be able to hold talks on rescheduling the payments, as a result of which foreign debts will cease to pressurize the Russian economy. Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Sergey Dubinin stressed that Russia attaches great significance to participation in the upcoming meeting in Naples of the `G-7'. We are expecting all its participants to confirm the policy of cooperation with Russia as defined last year in Tokyo, he said. No dramatic turns in this policy are proposed, he said, although a change in accent is possible in connection with the development of events in Russia. He noted the particular importance of attracting direct foreign investments to Russia which, alongside Russian capital investments, guarantee a way out of the crisis.
