The ruling was made following a plea of the defence to suspend the implementation of Zhivkov's seven-year jail sentence passed by the Supreme Court. The defence cited the convict's age and health, as well as the complicated range of issues tackled in the criminal action, disputed according to Zhivkov's lawyer, Daniela Dokovska, not only by the sides to the case. Prosecutor Krasimir Zhekov described the motives of the defence as insubstantial and insisted that the sentence be carried out. After hearing the sides, the Criminal Divisions of the Supreme Court decided to suspend the implementation of the sentence until the Supreme Court has made a supervisory review. The seven-year jail sentence passed by the Supreme Court on the former head of state and the Communist Party, who ruled for 35 years, took effect on January 13, 1994, after an appeal with a second-instance panel of the Supreme Court, chaired by Melkon Melkonyan. Zhivkov pleaded for a supervisory review. Zhivkov, 83, was convicted to seven years in prison and made to restore 21 million leva (some $600,000), on charges of exceeding powers and sharing out public funds and apartments among top aides. A week ago the Prosecutor General's Office postponed the execution of the sentence for two months, citing the ex-dictator's age and health. Zhivkov is a defendant in the case of granting public funds in aid to communist movements and parties in the Third World and in the case against the culprits in the 1980's campaign to assimilate Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.
