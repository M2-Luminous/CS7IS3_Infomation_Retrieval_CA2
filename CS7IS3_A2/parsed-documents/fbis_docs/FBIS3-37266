Gen. Leonid Mayorov, has sent a letter to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs in which he expressed his concern about the repeated attempts to evict servicemen of the Russian Army from their flats and about the ultimatum form of such actions. The commander wrote that this behaviour was typical especially of the heads of the Vidzei suburban territory and the Kurzem District of Riga. They had sent notices about the necessity of leaving their flats to several Russian officers and generals, including Anatoliy Gaponov, deputy commander of the North-Western Group of troops, and Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant commander. The commander of the North-Western Group troops reminds the prime minister that the flats of Russian servicemen belong to the housing resources of the Russian Defence Ministry, and that their further use is a subject of inter-state negotiations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Latvia. In his letter the commander points out that unilateral actions, more so the use of force, by local authorities may again exacerbate the situation with regard to the temporary presence of the Russian troops in Latvia.
