FR941006-0-00024 FR941006-0-00006 In addition to these restrictions on brokered deposits, FDICIA also established a comprehensive regulatory scheme for insured depository institutions based on their capital levels. Section 131 of FDICIA, adding section 38 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. Under the ``prompt corrective action'' provisions of FDICIA, the statute places severe constraints on what undercapitalized institutions can do, including severe restrictions on asset growth. As explained in the regulation which implements section 131 of FDICIA, 12 CFR 308.200 et seq. and 325.101 et seq., and which took effect on December 19, 1992, as soon as a bank receives notice, or is deemed to have received notice, that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the bank must restrict the growth of its assets as set forth in section 38(e)(3) of the FDI Act. That section of the Act states that an undercapitalized insured depository institution shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter unless: (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency has accepted the institution's capital restoration plan; (2) any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan; and (3) the institution's ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the institution to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. 12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(3). In view of the above statutes and regulations, the FDIC considered whether there was a continuing need for the rapid growth rule. Under the rule, the FDIC, upon being informed by a bank that it is about to undergo rapid growth, can engage the institution in a dialogue as to whether such growth would be prudent and should be pursued. Under the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, restrictions on brokered deposits and rapid growth attach automatically to certain banks having an insufficient capital level. Thus, although the rapid growth rule operates somewhat differently from the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC felt that the rapid growth rule is no longer necessary given the existence of those other two regulations. For this reason, the FDIC proposed (59 FR 15869, April 5, 1994) that the rapid growth rule be rescinded. This action would ease the regulatory burden on those institutions now subject to all three rules. While the rapid growth rule overlaps the brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action regulation, this overlap is only partial. For instance, rescinding the rapid growth rule would mean that an insured bank would no longer have to notify the FDIC before it either solicited fully insured deposits outside its normal trade area, or when it acquired secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, if one or a combination of both of these activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period. And while a well-capitalized bank planning to accept brokered deposits on a large scale would no longer have to inform the FDIC of this fact in advance once the rapid growth rule is rescinded, that bank still must report the amount of brokered money it has accepted after the fact in its quarterly Report of Condition and Income (``Call Report''). Also, deposit brokers must continue to register with the FDIC, and, if requested, could be required to provide data on the extent of a given bank's brokered deposit activities, under the brokered deposit regulation. With rescission of the rapid growth rule, some of the rapid growth resulting from rapid growth rule activities will continue to be detected by the FDIC's Growth Monitoring System (a system administered by the FDIC's Division of Supervision which identifies rapid growth over a single quarter in assets or loans and long-term securities and any related deterioration in key performance ratios), some rapid growth will be controlled or prohibited by the brokered deposit rule, and some will be prohibited by the regulation on prompt corrective action, but a small part of rapid growth might not be controlled or detected at all. Thus, comment was sought on whether the rescission of the rapid growth rule would create a regulatory gap that would have harmful effects on banking.
