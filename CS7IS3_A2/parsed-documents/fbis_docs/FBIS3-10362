When the URV is transformed into the real, the economic program will be able to reduce the present inflation rate to around zero. But this achievement will be in vain unless the country can implement a state and tax reform program, introduce changes into the social security and political systems, and make other adjustments that are essential for balancing the economic system. We are afraid the FHC plan's effects will not last long because we do not know if the economic stabilization strategy based on the real will be maintained for long. We know the structural problems were not removed. The fiscal adjustment implemented so far has great deficiencies and loopholes. If we are not capable of formulating more permanent answers to unravel the crisis, we will surely fall down the same hill that destroyed the Cruzado Plan, which had a big impact but a short life. The simple change in currency will not take us anywhere. In this context, we are greatly concerned by the cost to be paid by industry and employees. We know that by indexing the foreign exchange to the value of the real, eventual residual inflations in the real will mean a loss of Brazilian competitiveness in the internal and external markets. That situation would disorganize the market, creating instability and great expectations in the productive sector. This is precisely why we hope the plan will be successful and sustained in an orderly fashion, the constitutional revision process will end in good form, meaningful changes will be promoted in the field of monopolies, the privatization process will be speeded up, and changes will be introduced in the field of social security, among other items. On the other hand, our industries vigorously defend the maintenance of the purchasing power of workers' salaries. We oppose any attempt at reducing salaries because we understand consumers' purchasing power is an instrument that consolidates markets. We also support the idea of maintaining salaries at realistic levels. All salary losses must be negotiated before the plan's second phase takes effect. We also believe that the sooner the market converts to the URV the sooner and more successful the plan's next stage, which includes the creation of the new currency. Then we will be able to rid ourselves of high inflation rates. We will closely follow the next steps, knowing that the obstacles that still must be overcome must be resolved through negotiations on all fronts. That aspect might contain the secret of the plan's success. We believe the country is already mature enough to discuss, at all social and institutional levels, its priority programs and its preferred path to definitively defeat this climate of crisis. Industries expect politicians to be sympathetic to the expressions of support and hopes of all social groups, and will see in the FHC plan not an instrument to gain political mileage but a program of substantial economic changes. This is why the plan's success will depend on our legislators' spirit of public service. Without structural reforms capable of supplementing the FHC plan's weaknesses, we will again risk making the same old mistake, the outcome of which we all know is not at all pleasant.
