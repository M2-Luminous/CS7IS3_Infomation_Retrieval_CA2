The ministers agreed to tackle the boycott issue, which had been on the agenda at the Arab League meeting due to end in Cairo Sunday, at their next session later in the year, participants said. "The climate is not favorable for lifting the indirect boycott" on international firms dealing with Israel, because of the February 25 massacre, a diplomat close to the Arab League told AFP. Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to support such a move if it came to a vote. Gulf states Oman and Qatar recently began "intensive efforts" to ease the embargo, but "this lobbying effort did not get the hoped-for results because of the Hebron massacre," the diplomat said. "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect boycott," according the diplomat, who asked that his name not be used. Since the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on September 13, Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted in exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, the first two areas earmarked for autonomy under the delayed accord. For Syria the main issue was not the massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said the boycott "cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from occupied Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own state." Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of Arab trade with Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said. Syria's official Tishrin newspaper said Sunday that Israel "had not broken off the negotiations with Arab parties, but it is also true it has made no step toward peace and made no effort to help the peace process succeed." US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said in January that Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had promised to raise the issue of the indirect boycott at the ministerial meeting in Cairo. As the session opened Saturday, 'Abd-al-Majid reiterated the Arab states' condemnation of the massacre, and calls for adequate international protection for Palestinians in the occupied territories. Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in 1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests in Israel. Barring Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, only Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year. The Arab League also postponed debate on creating an Arab court of justice and amending the league's charter, participants said.
