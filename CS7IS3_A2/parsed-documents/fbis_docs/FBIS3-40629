The prices of sugarcane, tobacco, and peanuts will fall on the first day. The practice of announcement of the approved price at the time of sowing will stop. Various types of agriculture will come to an end. It is necessary to consider these fears to be true because the statements made by the government's department secretary, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, and by U.S. Vice President Al Gore support these fears. Pranab Mukherji said in the Parliament that it is not necessary to raise a fuss over the subsidy to the farmers and the cheap grains sold in the ration shops. It is important to consider how much help the government is able to provide. It should be remembered that the issue of subsidies over fertilizers, electricity, and water to the farmers is stuck in Manmohan Singh's economic policies. The efforts were to reduce these subsidies. It is said that the government is not in position to give these subsidies. The amount of grains provided to the ration shops was reduced by 25 percent last year. It is clear that the government is not able to increase the subsidies under these two plans. The Dunkel proposals clearly ask for the grains kept for domestic use to be accounted for and records of it kept. The quantity needed must be declared in advance. Additional purchases or storage to this declared amount will not be permitted. The government will purchase and sell grains at the market rate. There is one exception here. Grains at reduced rates with government subsidy can be provided to a specific group. However, account of this subsidy must be kept and shared. This exception can be made only for feeding for survival. Dr. S.K. Sinha, director of the Indian Agricultural Institute, says on the results of this system, "There will be no determined price for agricultural production. The open market rates will be followed. The government will not be able to levy any thing. It will have to purchase and sell at the open market rate. Even if the government keeps the present subsidies, the grain prices in the ration shops will be higher." The records of all these are required to check subsidies given by the government if it sees the prices in ration shops increasing. The GATT committee will meet to discuss it to discuss this subsidy and decide whether it should be approved. Why are all these restrictions being imposed on agriculture? Just to make sure that the third world countries do not grow more grains than are needed. It is being done because when the people began to migrate to cities after the World War II, these industrialized nations had to provide 200 percent subsidy to farmers in order to keep them there. This did save their agriculture, but they have had to destroy huge amount of grains in order to control the international market rates. They also have to make arrangements to sell this, therefore, they have determined that three percent of grains consumed must be imported in the first year, 3.5 percent during the next five years. This amount will increase to five percent in the sixth year. India's future will depend on one exemption. It will not be required to import grains if the trade balance is not in its favor. India does not have the balance of payment problem now because of the money received in loans. We have been importing oil to keep the domestic prices low. Therefore, whether we will get this exemption or not, only the future will tell. What will happen during the next six years? Anwarul Huda, our former special commerce secretary and now assistant director of GATT, says that our balance of payments is not going to improve in six years, therefore, we will be protected from this required import. Commerce Secretary Tajender Khanna says, "Not now, but it is possible that after six years, we may be forced to import." J.C. Pant, special agriculture secretary, says, "the difference between three and five percent appears to be very small, however, keeping in mind India's population and domestic consumption, even this three percent is not a small amount. We should oppose it. Let us say, we have to negotiate again in six years, our opposition now will help us at that time." Now let us hear what Al Gore said. He said, "At present we are trying to save the plants that are becoming rare. First, because of environmental pollution. Second, multinational companies are giving consistency to such plants for major sale in the world market." The patenting of genes and biotechnology is being done to benefit these multinational companies. How the farmer will have to depend on multinational companies for seeds every year is clear from Pranab's comment that there will be a law to stop farmers using his seeds a second time. However, the question is of the new hybrid seed. How will it work? Our Commerce Secretary Tajendar Khanna explains, "The multi-national companies can cause havoc here over producing and selling seeds. We should have a national policy stopping multi-national companies from coming here." We know that they are ignoring the issue of farmers and seeds because it is not easy to stop it. If the farmers get certain types of seeds in small quantities one year and they produce it in large quantities the next year, sharing it will not be a barter deal; it would be a sale and they must pay royalty on it. Let us look at India's Green Revolution for comparison. The seeds that our farmers use were procured from genes taken from Japan in 1963 and developed by our agricultural scientists. Genes for various rice varieties were brought from China. It was made possible because at that time the goal was to provide grains to everyone in the world. The goal now is to get royalty from every field. There will be no campaigns to determine approved prices now. The campaign will be to reduce the prices of sugarcane, tobacco, and peanuts as much as is raised. The government says that the subsidy for these three crops is less than 10 percent. Those outside the government figure this subsidy to be about 30 percent. The international prices of these three crops are lower than in our country. Thus, when all this is put together, it is clear that the days of agricultural subsidies are gone.
