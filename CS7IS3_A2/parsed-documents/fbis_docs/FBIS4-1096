He said he does not know what is responsible for some of these individuals' behaving like weaklings who have become bought over. Mr. Taylor said some members of his delegation are behaving like defectors and said it will not be surprising to the NPFL, because it has had a similar experience in Monrovia involving Mr. Togba Mackintosh Gewieh. The NPFL leader disclosed that he has received information from Monrovia that some NPFL ministers are wavering and planning to participate in confirmation hearing contrary to the earlier position of the NPFL that it will not partially sit on the transitional government. Mr. Taylor said the NPFL will not tolerate any halfway seating of the transitional government. Mr. Taylor, however, said the NPFL has no intention to withdraw from the peace process and will do everything to ensure lasting peace in Liberia. Although Mr. Taylor (?did not agree with) officials of the NPFL who are wavering, some nominated ministers from the NPFL to the LNTG have been confirmed by the Transitional Legislative Assembly. Those who have assumed offices are Justice Minister Laveli Supuwood, Labor Minister Tom Woewiyu, Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie, and the minister of lands, mines and energy, Z. Dehkie.
