Paragraph (d)(2) has been added to allow a SPRE, if an institution presents compelling evidence that its failure to satisfy a SPRE standard does not warrant further SPRE action, to forego any further action.

Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, were identified in the preamble to the NPRM under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.8, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, 667.22, and 667.26 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). These regulations contain records that will affect States and State postsecondary review entities. An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that will result from the collection of the information is 2000 hours per response for 57 respondents for a total burden of 114,000 burden hours for this package. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on this burden estimate should be submitted by May 31, 1994.
