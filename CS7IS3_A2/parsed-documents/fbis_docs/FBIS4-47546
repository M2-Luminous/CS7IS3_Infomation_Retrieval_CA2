To this end, the structural and functional properties of the pBS195 plasmid, including physical and genetic mapping, are examined, and the protein products determined by the pBS195 plasmid are studied. The ability of the pBS195 plasmid to coexist with a broad range of hosts, both gram-positive and gram-negative, is noted, and the areas containing the kanamycin and oriV resistance genes are localized. The study reveals no homology of the kanamycin resistance determinants of the pBS195 plasmid with the determinants which control aminoglycoside of types I and II phosphotransferase and type II nucleotidyl transferase. It is speculated that in contrast to other plasmids, the pBS195 contains a rep-system homologous with pUC19 which supports it in E. coli cells. Two 26 and 34 kD protein products were discovered by electrophoretic separation in the system of E. coli X295 minicells containing the pBS195 plasmid. The oxygenase activity determined by the pBS195 plasmid is discussed, and it is noted that enzyme is unusually substrate-specific and highly active in E. coli cells determined by the pBS195 plasmid. The plasmid shares homology with the nahC gene in the EcoRI-BamHI region. It is emphasized that the functional role of the oxygenase determined by the pBS195 for the host cells remains unclear.
