At the present time, there are over 3,000 fighter aircraft in China's various military services, placing it third in the world. At the end of the 1970's, China was successful in designing and manufacturing the Jian-8 fighter. At the present time, China has already armed itself with the third generation fighter, the Jian-8 II and has the fourth generation in development and it should be in service before the year 2000. [passage omitted] Analysis of Fighter Capabilities Engine China's advanced fighter aircraft, the Jian-8 II, employs two WP-13A [Turbojet-13A] engines, each developing only 6600 kg of thrust with afterburner: This is the Jian-8 II's greatest innate inadequacy. In comparison, the Mig-29M's RD-33K engine develops 8820 kg of thrust on afterburner, so obviously the RD-33K engine is more advanced. Total thrust for the Jian-8 II's two WP-13A engines is 13,200 kg, with a thrust-weight ration of 0.95, while the Mig-29M's two RD-33K engines have a total thrust of 17,640 kg, and a thrust-weight ratio of 1.1. We can thus see, in comparing the thrust-weight ratios of the two aircraft, the Mig-29M is obviously superior. The thrust-weight ratio is a reflection of an aircraft's maneuverability and climbing characteristics. This is one of the deficiencies of the Chinese fighter. Aerodynamic Configuration Foreign fighters change their aerodynamic configurations about once every ten years. For example: In the 1940's we had the swept-wing aircraft, in the 50's the delta wing, in the 60's the variable swept wing, in the 70's the tapered wing [biantiao yi 6708 2742 5065], in the 80's the canard wing, and in the 90's the composite wing. In the process of developing the Jian-8 II, the Chinese quite possibly studied aerodynamic configurations of the Mig-21, the Su-15, the Mig-23 and the F-4. They eventually chose the delta wing. The reasons for making this choice were: 1. China's manufacturing technology was exceedingly backward; their stock of relevant technology was obviously inadequate, and this had a direct impact on model development. 2. China's research and development of a fighter grew out of their self-defense requirements, which mainly emphasized intercept capabilities, with relatively stringent requirements for high altitude and high speed capabilities, and the delta wing can fulfill these design requirements. Actually, the delta wing has some unique advantages: Air resistance at high speeds is low, there is plenty of open space inside the wing structure, it is light weight, it has good rigidity, and it is not prone to vibrations in a high angle of incidence attitude. However, the delta wing also has some obvious drawbacks. For instance, its aspect ratio is small, and at subsonic speeds it can induce increased drag; the surface area of the wing is great, which also increases friction drag; when operating the elevons there is a relatively great loss of lift. In addition, in powered flight, the detached vortex which is depended on for increased lift can cause a certain amount of resistance. Also, because the delta wing is thin as well as swept back, lift is slow to alter with changes in the angle of attack, and for this reason, in order to produce the greatest lift, the required angle of incidence is rather great, and this affects the pilot's field of vision, especially on landing approach, when one can be constrained by altitude limitations: In this instance, the lift required has to be obtained from increases in velocity. All of these can degrade its maneuverability in subsonic patrols and at low and medium altitudes and take-off and landing characteristics. This is why, in the 1970s when air combat was emphasized, foreign fighters seldom used a pure delta wing. The United States and the former Soviet Union both employed tapered wings, and only France and China chose to use the delta. On the Mirage 2000, France used fly by wire technology which, to a certain extent, compensated for the delta wing's deficiencies. But China's Jian-8 II, despite not employing the electrical relay controls, improved its characteristics by using coupled take-off and landing ailerons which can be shifted forward and automatically correct the curvature of the wing during air combat or take-off and landing. In sum, the supersonic characteristics of the Jian-8 II are superior to those of the Mirage 2000 and the F-16A, and, in fact, in turning capability it surpasses the Mirage 2000-5. However, at subsonic speeds it does not equal either the Mirage 2000 or the F-16A. Maneuverability If we say that by and large China's aircraft can compare with the U.S.'s and the former Soviet Union's aircraft in maximum speed level flight and service ceiling, then the deficiencies in maneuverability which directly affect combat effectiveness are rather obvious. For instance, the maximum rate of climb for the Jian-8 II, Mirage 2000-5, F-16C and the Mig-29M are, respectively, 250 ms [meters per second], 305 ms, 360 ms, and 368 ms; the smallest turn radii are respectively: 800 m, 950 m, 610 m, and 400 m; acceleration from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2 respectively: and 25, 22, 18 and 15 seconds. In regard to maximum service overload, for the Jian-8 II it is 9 g, for the Mirage 2000-5 it is 9 g, for the F-16C it is 9 g and for the Mig-29M it is 12 g. Thus, if the Jian-8 II would rely solely upon flight characteristics in combat with these aircraft, the probability of success would be rather low. One of the main reasons for creating a Chinese fighter aircraft with rather weak characteristics was because its thrust to weight ratio was so low. The Jian-8 II's thrust to weight ratio is only 0.95, while for the Mirage 2000-5 it is 0.97, for the F-16C it is 1 to 1.1, and for the Mig-29M it is 1.1 -- all of these are superior to the Jian-8 II. On Board Firepower and Control Systems Navigational and on-board electronic equipment have always been a weak point for China. Although the Jian-8 II's radar employs a pulse Doppler system and has look-down shoot-down capabilities; it is, after all, only 1970's technology. Today, advanced foreign fighter aircraft, such as the Russian Mig-31 and the Su-35, employ multi-function phased array radar. Besides this, there are other advanced foreign fighters, such as the Mig-29M, the Mig-31M, the F-15E, the F-16C and the Mirage 2000-5 which have forward-looking infrared detectors, laser-spotting tracking equipment and other supplementary search equipment. Some aircraft, such as the Mig-29M, use target search instruments connected with a helmet mounted aiming device. In summation, in the realm of firepower and control systems, the Chinese fighters are lagging some 15 years behind advanced foreign levels. Combat weapons Chinese fighter aircraft generally carry aircraft cannons and their short-range firepower is relatively powerful. However, relatively speaking, their armament is somewhat weaker than comparable foreign aircraft. The Jian-8 II can carry only 4 to 6 AAM (air to air guided missiles), (2 medium range, 4 short range), and has a maximum external load rating of 4,500 kg. The Mig-29M, on the other hand, can carry 6-8 AAM (4 each medium and short range) and its maximum external load is 6,000 kg. Because the accuracy and range of China's AAM is somewhat less than that of the foreign counterparts, so they greatly emphasize maximum firepower in each missile launch. However, as the technical level of China's air to air missiles improves, their size and weight will gradually be reduced and their destructive force will be enhanced. Summation of Experience, Flying Into the Future Summing up what has been said, the technological level, combat capability, on-board equipment and weapon systems are some 10 years behind the United States and Russia. There are many reasons for this, the main reasons being: Weak technological base, development time too long The development time for the Jian-8 fighter was almost 15 years. Technical equipment lacking Key aircraft technology is not the product of basic research but is tested and proven in the air. The United States carried out a great deal of basic research during the 1950s and 1960s, insuring that there was an ample store of technology to support the development of the F-15 and F-16. In their aircraft development work, the former Soviet Union met some of the same problems China met, but they quickly compensated for them and were able to develop the Mig-29 and the Su-27 fighters. Engine and onboard equipment development has not advanced, thus the development of the model and major components is uncoordinated. One thing that should be noted is that since the 1980's China has intensified the search for and research of new technologies so that China's fighters of the 1990s can attain a higher level, and an excellent base is established for further development in the 21st century.
