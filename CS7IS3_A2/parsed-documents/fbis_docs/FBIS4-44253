Cindoruk returned to Turkey after participating in the third plenum of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Assembly. In a news conference at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Cindoruk said that during the meeting, which was attended by the parliamentary speakers of 40 countries, Europe established a consensus on democracy. He said: [Begin Cindoruk recording] Democracy is being consolidated in Europe. There are countries in Europe which have embraced democracy and have no difficulties in implementing it, as well as countries, which are in the process of adopting democracy. This process must be accelerated and a convergence of laws and institutions must be achieved. We are now seeing that human rights have ceased to be a national legal issue. Human rights are no longer a country's internal affairs. Especially in Europe, they have become a common law regulated by the countries' joint laws and agreements. Therefore, no country can consider itself independent on the subject of human rights or regard this matter its internal affair. [end recording] Cindoruk pointed out that it is very important to secure agreement among the parties if the constitutional amendments are to be enacted. He criticized the fact that members of the Democracy Party, which has been banned, participated in a demonstration against Turkey in Germany. [Begin Cindoruk recording] They made a grave mistake. I denounce the fact that they demonstrated against Turkey. They say that they will participate in politics in Turkey. Their action will disappoint the Turkish public, which is sensitive. Let us resolve our problems in Turkey. I do not resent those who apply to an international court; but, I say that if they are to engage in politics, the forum for that is Turkey. Let them come here and engage in politics. The laws and the executors of the law are not against them. Everyone is implementing the law and the rule of law is in effect. If an error is committed, the courts will rectify it. The State Security Court is a reliable court. [end recording]
