It is understandable that in troubled times of cardinal changes in upper echelons of state authority, all of us would like to be sure that neither amateurish decisions, nor absurd chance, nor some maniac's evil will will be able to set in motion the nuclear ruin of mankind. At one time this "nuclear briefcase" was created for our country's supreme leadership, permitting the final decision on use of strategic nuclear forces to be kept constantly under supreme control. This is where our conversation began with Sh. Sh. Chipashvili, Academy of Natural Sciences corresponding member, State Prize laureate, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Problems of Information Science. [Chipashvili] Of course, public interest in the "nuclear briefcase" can be understood, and the press also constantly "stirs up" this topic. All this is explainable by political aspects and the state level of those persons for whom the "briefcase" is intended. Doctor of Technical Sciences M. S. Loginov, the head of this work who is presently alive and well (he received the Hero of Socialist Labor title for it), can tell much of interest about the fascinating story of this item's creation and introduction. But from a technical standpoint, this is just a portable personal subscriber device, which is a diminutive particle of an enormous iceberg--the unified, comprehensive, automated system for command and control of the country's entire Armed Forces, created under the direction of General Designer Academician Vladimir Sergeyevich Semenikhin. [Pokrovskiy] It follows from your words, Shota Shotovich, that the public at large knows little about such a global program and Academician Semenikhin's role in the country's history? [Chipashvili] You are absolutely right, especially as the successful solution to this enormous national problem led to our country's attainment of strategic military inviolability. One would like to believe that in the final account all aspects of this work gradually will find worthy, truthful and sufficiently complete coverage in the open press. This is especially important now, when there is indiscriminate discrediting and smearing of everything previously achieved. This often is done by those who do not have a sufficiently realistic impression about much from our past, and in the best case have become casually familiar with very superficial or inferior information, on the basis of which amateurish or opportunistic conclusions and generalizations subsequently are made. [Pokrovskiy] Just what is the Armed Forces automated command and control system? [Chipashvili] You asked a very difficult question. It is impossible to portray the entire problem as a whole in a popular manner in a newspaper article, even in general outline. But I am sure you will bring in for cooperation many of Academician Semenikhin's companions-in-arms who are now alive and well, and the impressive panorama of the solution to an enormous national problem gradually will come out in the pages of your newspaper. To begin with, let us recall what kind of situation shaped up for the country's defense capability approximately in the early 1960's. By this time atomic and hydrogen weapons had been created and were being upgraded constantly. This entire program is linked above all with the name of Academician Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov and the collectives he headed. Diverse means of delivering these weapons (for ground, air and sea basing) had been created and were being developed. The main program here is connected with the name of Academician Sergey Pavlovich Korolev and his collectives. Thus a fundamentally new and at the same time paradoxical situation began to form both in our Armed Forces and in the armed forces of leading world powers. On the one hand, the stockpiling of enormous arsenals of mass destruction weapons seemingly was making the powers strong and was creating the illusion of an enemy's instantaneous defeat with the surprise of being first to attack. On the other hand, the looming threat of a more and more powerful enemy surprise first strike was forcing the sides to build up nuclear potentials. The potentials of mass destruction weapons grew and the military threat to the sides increased. This paradox could be resolved only by completing the triad--by creating an automated system for command and control of all kinds of strategic weapons which not only ensures one-hundred percent probability of a retaliatory strike, but also makes it more powerful because of a correction to initial plans, i.e., being first to attack becomes tantamount to suicide. This last enormous amount of work was headed up in the final account by Academician Semenikhin as General Designer. Initial interpretation of the entire upcoming enormous task of creating the Armed Forces automated command and control system was accomplished in the mid-1960's under the direction of Doctor of Technical Sciences V. V. Konashev, who later became Academician Semenikhin's first deputy and closest companion-in-arms and a Lenin and State Prize laureate. But all necessary preconditions were not yet ripe in the country as of that period for beginning wide-scale practical work on such a very large Soviet automated command and control system. [Pokrovskiy] But this meant that not only scientific and technical problems, but also very complicated organizational problems had to be solved... [Chipashvili] Specifically very complicated ones. Fortunately, in those times not everything was as bad as certain indiscriminate slanderers of our past now try to represent it. I can attest that the party CC Defense Department, the Military-Industrial Commission, and heads of all sector ministries which had been set in motion directed all this enormous, comprehensive work in solving the problem of creating the Armed Forces automated command and control system at the proper level, on a large scale and in a businesslike manner. In all his posts (both in the party CC and in the Ministry of Defense), D. F. Ustinov devoted much attention to this problem and was its active proponent. The Ministry of the Radio Industry was the leading ministry for the problem as a whole and bore full responsibility to the country's leadership. Deceased Minister P. S. Pleshakov put much of his energy and health into creating the Armed Forces automated command and control system, and therefore conferral of the Hero of Socialist Labor title on him for this system was a deserved assessment of his personal contribution. Directorates subordinate to Marshal of Signal Troops A. I. Belov acted as the general client from the Ministry of Defense. Broad military, scientific and technical erudition, understanding and support of risky new solutions, readiness to assume responsibility at any level in the interests of the job, a constant desire to become personally familiar in practice with results achieved, and all this with precise, businesslike exactingness--these personal qualities of Marshal Belov played a role of deciding importance in the success of work on the Armed Forces automated command and control system. General K. N. Trofimov, Marshal Belov's closest assistant and a person of profound erudition, great experience and highest morals, who was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor title for this work, was a match for the Marshal. Unfortunately, he died tragically in a helicopter crash during a flight between Armed Forces automated command and control system sites. General Staff Representative General V. P. Shutov, a champion of new principles of operational work based on modern information technologies, who was awarded the State Prize and who was an active, creative participant of the work, died with him. The military science of command and control took a very perceptible quality leap with creation of the Armed Forces automated command and control system. The leading scientific research institute of the Ministry of Defense, together with institutes of branches of the Armed Forces and military academies, created new battle management algorithms and successfully introduced them in the system. General B. I. Strelchenko, chief of the leading institute and a doctor of military sciences, was awarded the State Prize. An enormous volume of work was done to construct hardened rooms for command and control sites throughout the country's territory. This epopee needs a separate narrative. Thousands on thousands of specialists worked far from home for many years on the industry's test benches and at Ministry of Defense sites. The organization headed by A. V. Myshletsov, who was awarded the Lenin Prize, was the leading organization in this process. Specialists of different departments, different profiles, different ages and different nationalities made up those unified, friendly collectives, which were united by a sincere desire to successfully realize what had been conceived. There was an enormous number of institutes, design bureaus and plants which took part in this work of many years and, by the way, in many former republics of the USSR. The memoirs of chief designers of branch automated command and control systems and of individual unique technical systems and articles will be interesting. The most prestigious prizes and high government awards were deservedly bestowed on the majority of these companions-in-arms of Academician Semenikhin. The Council of Chief Designers, which included the immediate scientific-technical and organizational directors of all functional automated command and control systems, which were joined in the unified Armed Forces automated command and control system, functioned constantly under Academician Semenikhin's direction. Very much of interest also could be told both about this Council and about Academician Semenikhin's closest kindred spirits and colleagues. [Pokrovskiy] Everything you enumerated indicates that journalists still owe a great debt and must cover this little-known page of our history more fully. [Chipashvili] It is desirable that Academician Semenikhin's companions-in-arms and colleagues who are alive and well and who possess the full scope of historical information publish their memoirs about the very useful and instructive experience of creating such an enormous automated command and control system. For work on the Armed Forces automated command and control system essentially permitted forming a powerful, world-class domestic school on all aspects of comprehensive automation of the process of command and control of heterogeneous structures. It should not be forgotten that unified thematic and engineering solutions on a world level were worked out in developing and realizing the Armed Forces automated command and control system which, in addition to their direct purpose, are suitable for use at the present time in creating automated systems for management of regions, sectors and the entire national economy of the country as a whole. What has been built up must not be lost! [Pokrovskiy] We have been speaking all the while of the problem as a whole. Couldn't you tell briefly about something more specific? [Chipashvili] Insofar as I can, I will try. Everything that was realized in creating the Armed Forces automated command and control system was rather revolutionary both for the Armed Forces and for the country's science and engineering. But even against this background, the development and creation of the data exchange system for the Armed Forces automated command and control system on a fundamentally new conceptual and scientific basis was such a revolutionary and risky measure that it still generates a feeling of surprise, admiration and pride in our science and engineering. Based on his own experience of creating automated command and control systems for individual branches of the Armed Forces, Academician Semenikhin understood well that data transfer questions were assuming ever greater importance in the problem of command and control. Based on this, Academician Semenikhin gave constant, steady attention to the problem of creating a data exchange system as the basis of a unified Armed Forces automated command and control system. Specialists realized from the very beginning that it was impossible to create such a comprehensive Armed Forces automated command and control system with the old approach to questions of data transfer--not only would requisite characteristics not be achieved, but the number of communications channels also had to be so enormous that it would exceed the bounds of what was reasonable. Ever larger staffs and command and control facilities must turn into enormous communications centers, with all ensuing consequences. And proposed ideas of creating a data exchange system for the Armed Forces automated command and control system based on principles of switching individual portions of information through special automated centers seemed so unusual, unpredictable and risky for that time that far from everyone (even specialists) was agreeable to making the fate of the entire Armed Forces automated command and control system dependent on the possibility of realizing these new ideas. It should be recalled here that all this occurred long before the accumulation of world experience and the appearance of international recommendations on a similar problem, which subsequently resulted in the enormous labor of large collectives of highly qualified specialists from different countries. Our developers not only had to develop very complex data exchange procedures for the first time on their own, but also ensure fulfillment of unprecedentedly high demands on the quality of data transfer with the use of essentially all types of communications channels, often of very poor quality, over enormous territories. Despite all these difficulties, a large-scale territorial data exchange system was developed and realized for the first time based on a fundamentally new ideology, with unique indicators of functioning reliability and of the validity and probability of communicating data, a system which became a highly reliable, unifying foundation for all systems and subsystems of the Armed Forces automated command and control system. When actual quantitative indicators of functioning of the data exchange system had been generalized for the first time, even the developers were pleasantly surprised. It was for a more understandable report to state leaders that the famous comparison which Academician Semenikhin very much loved was calculated: Reliability of data transfer over the data exchange system allows the distortion of no more than one out of the total number of characters in 165 volumes (i.e., 5.5 sets) of the "Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya" [Great Soviet Encyclopedia]. The data exchange system also is being operated successfully at the present time, and many of its characteristics have not been surpassed to this day not only in domestic, but even in world practice. Academician Semenikhin was very proud of the results of work on the data exchange system and highly esteemed its chief designer, his deputy, Russian Academy of Sciences Corresponding Member I. A. Mizin, who was awarded the Lenin Prize for this work. [Pokrovskiy] I had occasion to meet Vladimir Sergeyevich and prepare his interviews and articles for PRAVDA. Of course, the talk in them was not about military, but peaceful use of computers, particularly about the unified computer system. For some reason I did not have occasion to hear high praise of it. [Chipashvili] Insofar as I recall, Academician Semenikhin appeared in PRAVDA, including also under a pseudonym, following guidelines of that time about maintaining secrecy. With respect to the second part of your question, I would not like to enter into polemics, but I will express my view of the situation briefly. No matter what was said there, all defense equipment without exception was of domestic origin. All this was done by our brains and our hands. In places we were ahead, in places we were not... On the average it was parity--in the modern world it is impossible to break ahead abruptly. But everything that shoots, crawls, swims and flies is all domestic. And when computers began to be developed rapidly, all onboard computers [vychisliteli] (or "kompyutery," as you like) were and are only domestic. And we were not somewhere behind in the area of fixed computers. The problem appeared when the question arose of mass production of computer equipment for command and control systems. [Pokrovskiy] Since political points have appeared in our conversation, how do you assess the effect of the Armed Forces automated command and control system on higher politics? The fact is, results of work on the Armed Forces automated command and control system could not remain unnoticed in other countries... [Chipashvili] The system's capabilities for giving political and military leaders timely information for making important decisions on a retaliatory strike and the real-time realization of these decisions with any effect of the attacking side all led to the suicidal nature of the idea of a first strike. [Pokrovskiy] What would you like to say in conclusion? [Chipashvili] Just one thing. Large-scale, epoch-making problems also require corresponding directors, and as a rule they become inseparable from one another in history. I would like to express the assurance that Academician Semenikhin as a person and his work to create the unified Armed Forces automated command and control system will find worthy coverage in our press and literature.
