Moreover, it did not strike me as all that dramatic. Historically, voter participation in Colombia has always left a great deal to be desired. With a few extraordinary exceptions, such as the plebiscite of 1957, most elections have had little more than a 60-percent turnout. The abstention rate reached 70 percent in the elections for the Constituent Assembly in 1991. After the congressional repeal, the elections to choose a new one had a 65-percent abstention rate. This is disturbing, no matter how you look at it. It would be better to see the voter turnouts of 80 and even 90 percent that democracies such as Italy, Spain, and Costa Rica have. Not because voting is mandatory--that is a disagreeable requirement--but because they have greater political maturity and democratic consciousness. Indifference, cynicism, apathy, skepticism, ignorance, rejection, or complacency--all these and more explain the persistence of abstentionism in Colombia. And it is not exclusive to us; in the United States, to choose an example not too far away, voter turnout is hardly ever more than 50 percent. It is significant, in any event, that with so much political openness, so many new civil rights, the proliferation of electoral lists, new groups, special districts for blacks and Indians, etc., not only do people not flock to the polls, but voter participation actually declines. This is something to think about. Furthermore, if blank ballots, the citizen's most explicit and conscientious way of expressing his repudiation for everything, are not given enough attention, people will feel that this form of protest vote is not worth the trouble, either, and will be discouraged from participating. A central conclusion to be drawn from these legislative elections is that there are no national leaders. Only 16 senators were elected by quotas, and the impressive battle for the leftovers reflects an fragmented political scene in which there is not a single figure with national appeal. There are so many things to remark upon in these elections: the return of longstanding but very weakened electoral barons, such as Guerra Serna and Name Teran; the decline of others, such as Gustavo Dajer, Salcedo Baldion, and Humberto Pelaez; surprises such as that of Jimmy Chamorro, which confirm the political consolidation of the Christian groups; phenomena such as Poncho Renteria, whose 20,000-odd votes can be considered a protest against the political class. I was saddened by the disappearance of Galanism as a parliamentary force and the absence of figures such as Maria Cristina Ocampo, Juan Lozano, and Alfonso Valdivieso from Congress. No leader has been able to fill that void (Gaviria is another matter), and the petty bickering they got involved in was the final blow to that liberal faction in Congress. I was also disturbed by the defeat of the M-19 Democratic Alliance (AD M-19). It was completely annihilated, losing all 12 seats. Figures such as Vera Grabe, Anibal Palacios, Bernardo Gutierrez, and Eduardo Chaves will not be around anymore. We may have disagreed with them, but they were an active presence and represented voices of criticism and debate. The debacle of the "M" confirms the limits of populism. But the parliamentary disappearance of the left (with the exceptions of Cepeda of the PC [Conservative Party] and Jorge Santos of the Revolutionary Independent Worker Movement, MOIR) may send the wrong signal to armed groups about the futility of the parliamentary, legal struggle. Some columnists, such as Francisco Santos, have expressed the opinion that the big winner in these elections was Andres Pastrana, while Ernesto Samper lost out. This is a dubious argument, apparently based on the fact that the conservatives doubled their seats in the Senate--from 16 to 32--and in particular on the fact that Samper got 1.5 million votes less than Gaviria did in the Liberal Consultation of 1990. It should be noted, however, that at that time of indignation and grief, people voted overwhelmingly against the dictatorship of terror that the drug lords were trying to impose, and in favor of the person who had been designated the successor of the slain leader. When they feel that something important is at stake--the survival of the system, for example--they go more decisively to the polls. The results of the legislative elections can be interpreted in a number of ways, and everyone talks about the party according to how it went for them. But now that the electoral scene has been cleared of the confusion of lists and the question of the vice presidencies has been resolved, it is time for the home stretch in the race between Samper and Pastrana. Samper made a big hit by naming Humberto De la Calle as his running mate. He is the ideal vice president, given his training and experience, his personal abilities, and his presidential stature. The Samper-De la Calle ticket clears the way for the Liberals and significantly strengthens Samper's presidential chances in an election where every vote will count. Pastrana's ticket, on the other hand, does not have a comparable attraction. Not because Luis Fernando Ramirez is not up to the job, but because he does not give Andres what De la Calle gives Ernesto. The ticket looks very "kindergartenish." Lacking a candidate of De la Calle's stature, one whom Pastrana sought desperately, or a figure like Noemi Sanin, who prefers to save herself for more dignified jobs, the Pastrana-Ramirez ticket lacks that element of complementarity, that charismatic attractiveness that wins votes, which the Samper-De la Calle ticket does have. Now, let the presidential campaign begin in earnest. Let us see the debates and the clash of ideas between the presidential and vice presidential aspirants. We have two months to find out how they plan to govern us; to know what their specific proposals are for peace, for the economy, and for the social ills that plague Colombians; and above all, to compare them.
