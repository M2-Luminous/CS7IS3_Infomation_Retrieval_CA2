After continuous experiments, the SS removal rate in the pretreatment unit was found to be more than 80 percent, the reduction rate of the Volatile Suspended Solid (VSS) in the SS methanization reactor was 51-79 percent under temperature conditions of 25-35�C and HRT 4.2-10.2 days, and the effluent from the nitrogen removal unit was stable at BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of less than 5 mg/l. Introduction Since 1988, this test plant experiment has been carried out as a part of the AQUA RENAISSANCE'90 PROJECT (a national project of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan). The objective of this Project is to develop a new system based on a combination of bioreactor and separation membrane technology, which can efficiently treat industrial waste water or sewage to recover methane gas from organic matters contained therein. In this study, sewage was treated. Today, in developing a new sewage treatment system, energy saving, minimization of sludge production, improvement of treated water quality, environmental protection, and such like, must all be taken into account to meet the needs of the times. The greater part of organic matter contained in sewage is in the form of suspended solids (SS). In the system used for this study, SS separated from sewage is treated in a methane fermentation (SS methanization) reactor combined with a separation membrane module, while SS-separated sewage is subjected to removal of nitrogen and organic matter in a reactor combined with a separation membrane module. Flow Diagram Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for this experiment. Figure 1. Flow Diagram The sewage is separated into low SS effluent and concentrated SS by the pretreatment unit. Then, the separated SS are treated in the SS methanization reactor combined with the SS separation membrane module. The low SS effluent from the pretreatment unit and the permeate of the membrane are mixed and treated in the nitrogen removal unit combined with the rotary disk membrane. This test plant has a capacity of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/day in the basic design. Characteristics of the Units Table 1 shows the characteristics of each unit in this system. Raw Water Raw sewage from the existing sewage treatment plant was used as the raw water for this experiment. The properties of the raw water are shown in Table 2. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Properties of the Raw Water in 1990 (Unit: mg/l) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |CODcr |BOD |SS |T-N | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Minimum |57.6 |24.0 |45.0 |7.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum |563.8 |344.0 |466.7 |39.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average |235.9 |140.2 |164.5 |23.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Results Pretreatment Unit By utilizing polyurethane sponge as the collection material, this unit was able to operate efficiently and continuously removing SS efficiently, without being clogged. The SS concentration of raw and pretreated water, and the SS removal rate are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The SS removal rate was continuously more than 80 percent and the unit was able to steadily supply concentrated water of a SS concentration higher than 10,000 mg/l. Figure 2. SS Concentration Figure 3. SS Removal Rate SS Methanization Reactor The concentrated SS from the pretreatment unit was solubilized and methane-fermented in this reactor at long SRT by combination with the SS separation membrane. We investigated acid fermentation and methanization in mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation in two periods using the organic membrane and inorganic membrane. The reason we report the results of the methanization in two periods is because the solubilization rate of SS in the acid fermentation was lower than that in the methanization. SS concentration and VSS/SS ratio (percent) in the reactor under the long operation of mesophilic methanization are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The data in Table 3 shows the results of the representative mechanization of SS. Figure 4. SS Concentration in the Reactor Figure 5. VSS/SS Ratio in the Reactor The outline of the results in the methanization are as follows: -- The VSS reduction rate under the thermophilic methanization ranged from 67 to 78 percent, but the difference between the mesophilic and thermophilic methanization was not big in view of the heating energy. The mesophilic conditions were therefore better. -- In the mesophilic conditions, at 35�C, the VSS reduction rate was 51-79 percent (solubilization rate based on TOC was 45-56 percent) under the VSS volumetric load of 0.93-1.94 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day and the HRT of 4.2-8.4 days. This efficient treatment compared with the conventional anaerobic digestion of SS in HRT of 15-30 days was reached by combination with the membrane module. -- Decreasing the temperature from 30 to 25�C in the reactor did not greatly influence the VSS reduction rate. It was possible to maintain a rate from 67 to 70 percent with a VSS volumetric load of about 1 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day. (Solubilization rate was 52 percent.) -- The volume of recovered methane from charged VSS was maintained from 270 to 317 l/Kg-VSS except for one case. SS Separation Membrane Unit Separation and returning of SS to the reactor by this inorganic membrane unit guaranteed a long SRT and the permeate contained almost no SS (SS < 1 mg/l). The results of the long time operation are shown in Figure 6.[.sup]1[/] The permeate flux was maintained at 0.6-1.0 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day and the membrane module could be operated for the liquid containing high concentration SS (55,000 mg/l). TOC of the permeate was different between the mesophilic methanization (10-30 mg/l) and thermophilic methanization (500-1800 mg/l). Figure 7 shows the characteristics of the permeate flux to the SS concentration and membrane surface flow rate.[.sup]1[/] Figure 6. The Results in Long Operation Figure 7. Characteristics of the Permeate Flux Table 4 shows the optimum conditions and the performance of this membrane unit. In this case the power consumption for membrane permeate was 6.92 Kwh/m[.sup]3[/]-permeate (efficiency 51 percent). That value is not big because the quantity of the concentrated SS into the SS methanization reactor was about 1 percent of the raw sewage water. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

For the rotary disk membrane module, polysulfone membranes having a cut-off molecular weight of 750,000 were mainly used. When the denitrification tank had the same volume as the nitrification tank, the total nitrogen (T-N) removal rate was about 75 percent when methanol was added to the inlet water. Without the addition of methanol, this rate was about 52 percent. At a volumetric T-N load of 0.24 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day in the nitrification tank, and with 40 mg/l of methanol added, the BOD and T-N of treated water did not exceed 2 mg/l and 5 mg/l, respectively. After the denitrification tank was transformed to increase its volume twofold, it was possible to obtain treated water with a BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of less than 5 mg/l without addition of methanol at a volumetric T-N load up to 0.14 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day. In this case, the permeate flux was about 1.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day under the operating pressure of 0.2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] and MLSS of 14,000-15,000 mg/l.[.sup]2[/] Water Quality An example of the water quality in the system is shown in Table 5. Conclusion The pretreatment unit was able to supply the low SS water (removal rate > 80 percent) and concentrated SS (SS > 10,000 mg/l) steadily and continuously. So the methanization of the concentrated had a higher efficacy rate in the reactor combined with the membrane (VSS reduction rate of 51-79 percent (solubilization rate of 45-56 percent), HRT of 4.2-10.2 days, temperature at 25-35�C, permeate flux of 0.6-1.0 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day). The low SS water was treated by the nitrogen removal unit and effluent was of high enough quality to be reused (BOD < 2 mg/l, T-N < 5 mg/l). On the other hand, this system was able to connect the simple aerobic treatment unit for the pretreated water in exchange for the nitrogen removal unit.
