FBIS4-17287 "drsov078_b_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Economic Issues Letter Gives Yeltsin's `Own View' Letter Gives Yeltsin's `Own View' PM2104145994 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 21 Apr 94 p 1 PM2104145994 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Bankruptcy Surgery May Be the Way to Help a Sick National Economy"] [Text] On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin sent a letter about the problem of nonpayments not only, as it happens, to Viktor Chernomyrdin, but also to Ivan Rybkin, Vladimir Shumeyko, and Viktor Gerashchenko. While drawing attention to the urgency of the problem of nonpayments, the president stressed at the same time that the highly delicate problem of bankruptcy, which the authorities are showing no signs of tackling, had to be resolved more rapidly. But the choice of the epistolary mode raises some questions. Aleksandr Livshits, head of the president's group of experts, talking about it in an interview for IZVESTIYA, said that a letter, unlike an edict, has no directive force, and it does not prescribe measures that have to be implemented. Yeltsin was merely expounding his own view of an urgent problem, setting it out, as it were, for the Federal Assembly, government, and Central Bank to view. So the mode chosen by the president suggests that Boris Nikolayevich is granting the addressees the right not only to tackle a very acute issue independently, but also to take responsibility for its solution. It should be noted in this connection that the head of the group of experts categorically rejected the statement ascribed to him by ITAR-TASS that, by sending the letter, "Boris Yeltsin is assuming full responsibility for the second step of the reforms, including the need to rid the Russian economy of those production facilities with no future." "Of course, the president did not have anything of the sort in mind." Indeed, the document itself is devoted, apparently, not so much to the problem of bankruptcy as to actual nonpayments. According to Livshits, the letter maps out various ways of resolving this problem, including the bankruptcy procedure. And each addressee is being recommended tasks that fall within his sphere of responsibilities. The president has taken into account, Livshits stressed, all the proposals from various departments on resolving the nonpayments problem. Including the Finance Ministry's scheme for the return of state debts, which are often the cause of nonpayments (see IZVESTIYA 31 March 1994 for more detail), and a proposal on implementing bankruptcy procedure, put forward by the Federal Administration for Insolvency Cases and the Economics Ministry... Unfortunately, IZVESTIYA journalists were unable to get a look at the text of the letter in order to be able to provide more details. The two-hour search for the document was unsuccessful. The unflappable president's press service duty officer said: "It is an unofficial document and we do not have it..." Either the addressees' press services, offices, and general deparments had no idea of the letter or they were being kept out of it, as was the Duma apparatus: "Rybkin has the letter. What were we supposed to do, show it to everyone?!" Yet, actually, it would not have hurt to "show the document to everyone." Of course, I am addressing this notion not to a petty official in the Duma general department, but to senior staffers of B. Yeltsin's apparatus. The heads of the Federal Assembly, government, and Central Bank will have a great deal of work to do implementing the proposals set down in the president's letter. Not only will they have to adopt special decrees, but they will also have to amend current legislation. But the existence of the letter by no means signifies that amendments and decrees will be adopted immediately. The president has merely expressed his view on an urgent problem, thus indicating possible ways of cooperating with the legislative authority. Whether this cooperation comes about is not dependent on him alone.
