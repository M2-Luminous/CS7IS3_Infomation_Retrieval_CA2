"The main task is to prevent the emergence of red lines of confrontation on the map of relations between Lithuania and other states, including Russia. It is necessary to note that Russia's fears connected with the singing by representatives of Lithuania and NATO of an agreement within the context of the Partnership for Peace programme are groundless. The more so because Russia itself is taking an active part in the process of NATO expansion and, probably, will join the all-European security system," the minister said.
