This information was confirmed to Radio Cooperativa this afternoon by Investigative Police General Director Nelson Mery. This cell is believed to be responsible for a series of attacks. Many weapons were found in their possession. [Begin recording] [Mery] They are responsible for the attack.... [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Is it true some arrests have been made? [Mery] We have arrested eight individuals, all members of the Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front.... [Reporter, interrupting] Do we know any of them? [Mery] Some are important within their criminal organization. [Reporter] How many of them participated in the latest attacks? [Mery] They have admitted participating in terrorist activities during the past few months, particularly the Carabineros premises. [Reporter] How many participated in that attack? [Mery] They were arrested yesterday. We raided their safe houses and their alternative hideouts. The police seized M-16 riffles, submachine guns, explosives, documents describing the group's participation in various acts, and materials used to forge documents. [end recording] The police seized five M-16 riffles, two UZI submachine guns, a large quantity of explosives, dynamite, and banners used by the Investigative Police. Let us recall that some of these individuals used Investigative Police documents and shot at Carabineros premises. The Investigative Police has thus dealt a new blow to this extremist group. We have been asked to keep the names of the terrorists secret, at least for this afternoon. We reiterate, five men and two women were arrested; they are responsible for the most recent terrorist attacks, particularly the double bank robbery in Providencia and the attack on the Carabineros Nueva Espana Building.
