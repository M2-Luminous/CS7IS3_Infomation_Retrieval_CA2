For the second consecutive day, Gen. Stange, who is still on leave, went to his office where he met with members of the Carabineros Superior Advisory Council. Gen. Carlos Pecchi, the Carabineros Legal Department chief, stated later that there is no legal reason why Gen. Stange should not return to duty on 17 May, adding that this is what he will do. The Chilean Communist Party mouthpiece EL SIGLO has reported that Stange's return would prompt a cabinet crisis that will culminate in the resignation of Interior Minister German Correa. [Begin recording] [Correa] That is not true. I will not answer reports published in EL SIGLO which is completely misinformed and has no idea of what is happening in this country. [First unidentified reporter] Do you believe there is a campaign against you or your administration? [Correa] No, but obviously there are some who dislike my presence at the Interior Ministry. [Second unidentified reporter] What is the government's reaction to statements by [Stange's] Lawyer Pablo Rodriguez who insists that Gen. Stange will resume his post on 17 May. [Correa] I have carefully not commented on this to avoid making it a household issue. It is a delicate issue that the government is handling with the required prudence. [end recording] Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister secretary general of the government, held an unscheduled meeting with Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma. [Begin recording] [Reporter] It seems Gen. Stange's return is imminent. What is the government's stance regarding his return. [Rebolledo] I decline to comment on future developments. We are obviously discussing the issue. [end recording] Some hours later, Minister Rebolledo again discussed the issue in Temuco. [Begin Rebolledo recording] Gen. Stange should stay away from the Carabineros headquarters while the case is under investigation and remain on leave. [end recording] The issue continued to be discussed at the Presidential Resort in Cerro Castillo in Vina del Mar where Interior Minister German Correa held meetings with Coalition of Parties for Democracy leaders and legislators. During this meeting, Correa stated that the Carabineros had officially informed him that Gen. Stange will resume his duties on 17 May.
