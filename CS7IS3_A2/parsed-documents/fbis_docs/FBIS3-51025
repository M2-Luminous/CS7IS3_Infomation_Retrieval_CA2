In statements published today by the Mexican newspapers REFORMA and EL NORTE, Cantu indicated that the rebels seek to internationally discredit President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's. He said the rebels want to prevent free trade, the creation of jobs, the increase of foreign investments, economic growth, and wage increases in Mexico, objectives that NAFTA seeks. "It is obvious that it is not an Indian insurgent movement, because if it were, they would be using machetes. This armed group would not have been repudiated as it has," he added.
