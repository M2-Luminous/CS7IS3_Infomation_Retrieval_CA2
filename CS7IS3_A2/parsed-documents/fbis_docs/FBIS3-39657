Ankara was disturbed, because it has now become clear that Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to the Black Sea through Russia. Now attention has been riveted on the status of the Straits. [Begin Fatih Yilmaz recording] Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United States at the beginning of the week produced an intriguing result for Turkey. Nazarbayev and U.S. President Bill Clinton reached a consensus on transporting Kazakhstan's oil to the Black Sea through Russia. This created unease in Ankara, which was hoping that Kazakhstan's oil would be transported to Ceyhan through Baku. Kazakhstan's pro-Russian stance was the primary cause of the unease. The issue of transporting oil through the Black Sea was the other cause for the unease. This question raises the status of the Straits. The U.S. oil companies favor transporting Kazakhstan's oil to the Black Sea through the Straits. But now tension persists between Turkey and Russia over the issue of the Straits. Turkey is not positively inclined toward the use of the Straits for oil transportation. Russia is insisting on it. The status of the Straits will be taken up during the talks to be held between Turkey and Russia next week in Ankara. Ankara is getting ready to present an alternate proposal to transport the oil reaching the Black Sea and the Mediterranean through the Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline. [end recording]
