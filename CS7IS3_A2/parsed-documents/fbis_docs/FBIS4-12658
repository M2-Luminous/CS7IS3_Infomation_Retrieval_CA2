"A meeting of senior PLO and Hamas leaders took place last week to sort out daily problems and the two groups decided to carry on the dialogue," the official told AFP. "The discussions are serious and positive and we hope to reach an agreement. We respect the position of Hamas on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho," he added. The fundamentalist organization has sworn to fight on against Israel despite the September 19 autonomy deal, which it considers a sell-out. A Hamas official confirmed that a meeting had taken place after an armed clash between rival militants left 18 wounded in the Rafah refugee camp at the end of March. But he refused to say more until an accord was struck. The fight erupted over a piece of wasteland on which PLO supporters played football and Hamas wanted to build a doctor's clinic. Then on April 2, Fatah and Hamas each kidnapped one of the other's supporters in Gaza City. Both hostages were freed unharmed after lengthy negotiations. A Palestinian research centre last month found that 40 percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent for Hamas.
