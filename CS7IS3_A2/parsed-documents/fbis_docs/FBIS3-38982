How Gerry Adams' U.S. Visit Crippled the `Special Relationship'"] [Text] It looked as though it was going to be a productive holiday for Edward Kennedy. As his plane touched down at Dublin airport for a Christmas break with his sister, the veteran Democratic senator had a hunch he was about to achieve a long-held ambition. For years, Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president, scion of the premier Irish-American family and prominent supporter of a united Ireland, had lobbied to get a lasting peace agreement. For years, successive Republican administrations had refused to negotiate with terrorists or to whisper a word against America's closest ally in this most sensitive area of policy. But now the whole political climate had changed. During the previous month, it had emerged that the British government had been in secret talks with the IRA over a possible ceasefire. Then John Major and Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach [Irish prime minister], announced their joint declaration, giving Sinn Fein the chance of joining the peace process if the IRA stopped its terrorist campaign. Kennedy was convinced that he now had the ammunition to get his way; he had a powerful ally in his sister. Jean Kennedy Smith had been appointed American ambassador in Dublin in June last year on her brother's recommendation; in that short time she had made an impressive power play to control American policy in the whole of Ireland, attempting to wrest control of policy in Ulster from Ray Seitz, the American ambassador to London. The Kennedys got to work, organising dinners with Reynolds, Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), and Brian Lenihan, the former Irish foreign minister, at the taoiseach's house. Later Kennedy met John Hume, the SDLP leader who had launched his own peace initiative with Gerry Adams, the IRA's political front man, and Mary Robinson, the Irish president. By the time he headed home on January 2, Kennedy was well satisfied that if he pushed for a visa for Gerry Adams, the Irish govemment would not stand in his way -- he might even have convinced himself that an Adams visit to America might help move the stalled peace process forward. As it turned out, the opposite happened. Adams's 48-hour trip to America last week ended up as a humiliation for the Kennedys, a publicity coup for the IRA and a public relations disaster for the British government. It also crippled the special relationship which the two nations had cherished for half a century. The first sign that Adams might be on his way to America came at the beginning of January, with a call to the British embassy in Washington asking for Sinn Fein's fax number. It came from the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a think-tank run by an Irish-American businessman, Bill Flynn, which, unaware of the Kennedy initiative, had decided to set up a conference in New York to bring together all the political parties in Northern Ireland. As the alarm bells rang in London, Belfast and Washington, the Foreign Office contacted Kennedy's office and asked if it knew about the conference. "There was complete surprise," said a Foreign Office source. "They were upset as they had not yet got their own plans ready and thought the invitation had come too early." But Kennedy was not one to waste an opportunity. His lobbying had begun a month earlier, after President Clinton had written to the then New York mayor, David Dinkins, saying Adams would be denied a visa because of his "involvement in terrorist activity." That was the eighth time Adams's visa application had been turned down. Kennedy mobilised his well-organised staff to set up an assault on the administration. Forty Congressmen including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York signed a letter to Clinton supporting the application. Kennedy himself spoke to a number of senior officials and in particular sought out Nancy Soderberg, his former foreign affairs aide, now number three in the National Security Council (NSC). In her late 30s, with the blond hair of her Swedish ancestors, Soderberg is a strong backer of a united Ireland and for years has been a point of contact between Kennedy and supporters in Northern Ireland. Her appointment to the NSC was in part a payoff to Kennedy for his support during the presidential campaign. In September, four prominent Irish Americans had visited Northern Ireland and met Adams. They returned convinced that an earlier administration proposal for a Clinton peace envoy to visit the province would not work. Instead, they thought they could persuade Clinton to grant Adams a visa. They met Soderberg, who agreed to support the application. That time she was overruled by the president. This time, she was determined to make it happen. Initial soundings by the Foreign Office suggested that the Americans' usual opposition to the visa request would hold solid. American intelligence had access not only to Adams's record of terrorism but also to the current British assessment of his influence on the IRA army council, where he is one of seven members. More recently, offlcials at the American embassy in London had visited Belfast and been briefed by British intelligence on Adams's role in organising and ordering recent terrorist attacks. The Americans were told that Adams would not accept the peace proposals and had no intention of stopping the violence. This view was accepted by the Americans and passed to Washington. "But there was a different tone this time," said a Foreign Office official. "We had the peace proposals and the fact that we had secretly been talking with the IRA. That gave the IRA's allies (in America) some powerful levers and it was clear we were going to have a fight on our hands." Sir Robin Renwick, the mild-mannered yet tough British ambassador to Washington, had been preparing for such a confrontation ever since he arrived three years earlier. He came from the turmoil of South Africa to steer the Anglo-American relationship through what was to become the rocky road of the Clinton administration. A formidable operator with a dry sense of humour, he had assiduously courted senior administration officials and his dinner parties had achieved legendary status for the range and distinction of their guests. Last month, he hosted a dinner in honour of Michael Howard, the home secretary, to which he also invited Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, and Janet Reno, the attorney general. In his after-dinner toast, Renwick stressed the role America had played in countering IRA terrorism, a message later underlined by Howard. In reply, Reno promised that the support would continue. Now it was time for Renwick to cash in some of those chips. In the course of four days, he contacted Reno, Freeh, Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Peter Tarnoff, the undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department. Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called Warren Christopher, his counterpart in the State Department. All assured the British officials of their full support: Adams would not come. The one holdout was Tony Lake, Clinton's national security adviser, who was unconvinced when called by Renwick. The position of national security adviser is traditionally held by a man with strong views on foreign policy. But Lake has proved the exception to this. He has emerged as a conciliator between different departments, a man, like the president himself, who searches for the middle ground. For months he had been criticised for his weak leadership and many of his staff had become thoroughly demoralised. Renwick was unable to get a firm commitment from Lake. At the same time, lobbying by Kennedy, Ray Flynn, the former mayor of Boston and now the Vatican ambassador, Soderberg and Jean Kennedy Smith was beginning to pay off. Kennedy had made clear that if Clinton wanted his vital support on health care and welfare reform, the visa would have to be issued. In an administration obsessed by domestic policy, health care clearly mattered more than upsetting America's oldest and most faithful ally. In cables to Washington, Kennedy Smith said that an Adams visit would help the peace process. She also said that the Irish government was strongly in favour of a visa being granted. This stretched the truth, as Reynolds was largely neutral on the matter and Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, assured the British that there was no active campaign by the Dublin government to get the visa. George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's closest adviser, saw the issue as a simple calculation between the president's need to keep Congress happy and the marginal concerns of a British government to which they owed no favours. The British government's actions during the presidential campaign still rankled strongly with Clinton. It was bad enough that Conservative Central Office had sent over two officials to advise President Bush on the best tactics to win. But Clinton was particularly peeved that the government had also launched a search of Home Office files to check for evidence of his activities while a student at Oxford and whether he had ever sought British nationality to evade being drafted for the Vietnam war. Such evidence would have sunk the Clinton campaign -- it was not something he was going to forgive lightly. The coolness showed when Clinton travelled to Europe for the Nato summit on January 10. Major saw the opportunity to press his case against Adams being allowed into America and officials from the Foreign Office began to push for a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. But it was a measure of the state of relations between the countries that this was not automatically granted. Instead, at the last minute and sandwiched between other meetings, a grudging 10 minutes was given to Major. Clinton listened to the case but, to the prime minister's disappointment, made no promises. In Washington, some administration officials argued to Clinton that by letting Adams in, he would play a key part in securing peace in Northern Ireland. The president had just returned from a successful trip where he had met President al-Asad, of Syria, to discuss peace. He had also brokered the famous handshake on the White House lawn between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. By January 26, it was clear that the White House was not going to be deterred from granting Adams a visa and so the Foreign Office agreed a compromise. Adams would be asked: Would he personally renounce violence and work to end violence in Northern Ireland? Would the IRA and Sinn Fein work for peace on the basis of the proposals evolved by Major and Reynolds? The British knew that if Adams answered either question positively it would be a big step forward. He had never renounced all violence and had refused to sign up to the peace proposals with unspecified "clarifications." London was confident that he had been cleverly boxed in. On Friday, January 28, Adams was summoned to the American consulate in Queen Street, Belfast, for a 90-minute meeting with Valentino Martinez, the consul-general. Faced with the questions, the Sinn Fein leader replied: "If I accept those, I might as well retire to the mountains." Martinez pressed Adams, but he refused to either condemn all violence or accept the peace proposals. In a cable to Washington that afternoon, Martinez firmly recommended denying the visa. But immediately after he left the consulate, Adams gave an interview to NBC news in which he said that he did indeed condemn violent attacks on innocent civilians and that the peace proposals were a useful framework. It was this form of words, rather than those given to Martinez, that was relayed by Soderberg to senior officials in Washington later that day. The British embassy received a copy and was asked for its comments. It pointed out that nothing Adams had said was new and that he had very specifically not accepted the two questions that had been put to him by Martinez. A further wrinkle to the drama was added on Friday afternoon when three disarmed grenades were found in San Diego. The southern California branch of the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility and warned that more would follow if Adams were not granted a visa. News of the spoof attack caused near-panic in the administration, where there were absurd visions of a full-scale campaign against targets in America. But officials also recognised that if a visa were granted under such a threat, then Clinton would be seen as a weak leader who had caved in to blackmail. Fearing that the fight was about to be lost, an administration official contacted Adams to alert him to the problem. He had heard nothing about the dummy bombs, which had received no publicity, apan from a brief mention in the local San Diego paper. Adams was only too happy to condemn an attack he knew nothing about if it would save his visa application. So, once again, Soderberg was able to produce "evidence" that Adams was on the side of the angels. Last Sunday morning, in the Oval office, Clinton held a meeting with his senior foreign policy advisers. In a heated exchange, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, continued to oppose the visa, while Lake thought Adams should be allowed in. The NSC argued that Adams had complied with all the conditions the Americans had set. Although Christopher still opposed the visa, he was under the impression, because of that NBC interview, that Adams had indeed renounced violence, a lie skillfully propagated by the NSC. It was on the basis of this deceit that Clinton went ahead and authorised the visa. Adams would be allowed into America for 48 hours, prevented from fundraising and ordered to stay within 25 miles of New York. Naively, it was believed these restrictions would restrain the media circus that the British had warned the Americans was certain to be unleashed. Within minutes, news of the decision had leaked -- the White House believes from the NSC -- and it was running on the wires by Sunday afternoon. To the fury of the British embassy, officials heard about the decision not from the administration but from the media. It was the start of a week that was going to convince some British officials that the administration was run by naive incompetents who had little or no understanding of foreign policy in general and Irish politics in particular, and cared little about tossing the special relationship overboard. With his dark suit, carefully combed hair, manicured teeth, white shirt and conservative tie, Adams arrived at Kennedy airport to be treated not as a visiting terrorist but as a conquering hero. For the next two days the American press indulged in a sycophantic orgy of coverage, allowing Adams free rein with his Goebbels-like propaganda spree. There was scant mention of the IRA, of which he is in charge, or the death toll of innocent people, for which he is responsible. The Irish novelist Edna O'Brien described Adams in one American paper as "thoughtful and reserved, a lithe, handsome man.... Given a different incarnation in a different century, one could imagine him as one of those monks transcribing the gospel into Gaelic." At each stop, his message was the same and little different from the language he used back home. "The largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the British army followed by the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed." To the British, this was little more than Orwellian doublespeak, at which Adams had become a master. American journalists could not grasp that when Adams spoke of peace, he meant surrender by his enemies. He was winning the propaganda battle and the British appeared helpless to do anything about it. By coincidence, Douglas Hurd was in America to visit officials in New York and Washington. There is, rightly, a standing policy that government ministers do not appear on the same programme as terrorists. But instead of finding other ways to put the truth about Adams across, Hurd showed almost a patrician disdain for becoming involved in the debate. At a press conference he said he did not want to answer questions about Adams, thereby missing the chance of a robust attack on Adams. Nor did the British authorities put up a tough official critic to counter Adams's carefully chosen yet meaningless phrases about peace. Adams had decided to pack as many appearances as possible into his brief visit and each one was carefully selected to reach the maximum audience, preferably with a "soft" interviewer like Larry King on CNN. He was driven from one studio to another with an entourage of bodyguards. No matter that his chauffeur was a convicted IRA bomber who had entered America illegally and been granted political asylum, the media lapped up his every word. At each appearance, the soft-spoken Adams preached the same message: it was the British government and not Sinn Fein that was the real obstacle to peace. As the extent of the coverage emerged, it began to dawn on the White House that it had blundered and a disaster was unfolding. "They were warned what would happen but they honestly believed nobody would pay any attention to the visit," said one British official. "That may be hard to understand but it is true and a measure of just how ignorant the officials are." Here was Adams, making speech after speech, but there was none of the public commitment to stop all violence that Kennedy and his allies had been promising. There was nothing, either, about accepting the terms of the peace accords agreed last December. With rising alarm, both the White House and the NSC made calls to Kennedy, insisting that Adams had to make a positive statement that could be presented as some kind of breakthrough. First, the reply came that Adams would renounce all violence before he left. Then he was going to announce a three-month ceasefire during his speech at the conference on Tuesday. Finally, Adams promised a dramatic announcement before he took the aircraft home on Wednesday. As each opportunity passed with another promise broken, the administration began to understand it had been duped. When Hurd went to see vice-president Al Gore on Tuesday he brought with him the headiines from the British papers which had been united in their condemnation of the visit and of the Clinton administration. Gore, who had favoured the Adams visit, was shocked and immediately issued a statement which called on the Sinn Fein leader to accept the framework of the Major-Reynolds peace proposals. Later that day, the president backed that line and announced that any idea of sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland had been dropped. "Part of the incompetence is that the administration had no idea what the impact of the visit would be," said one Foreign Office official. "To puncture your relations with your closest ally and not realise you are doing so is quite a spectacular feat." As he headed back to Ireland on Wednesday, Adams promised that he would be looking at the peace process "in a more concrete way." The phrasing ofthis statement was designed to appease his American supporters and act as the important statement he had promised Ted Kennedy. In fact, he achieved neither. To Clinton and the Adams supporters in the administration, the visit was a profound disappointment. Instead of the breakthrough they wanted, Adams, the consummate political operator, made fools of all of them by promising everything and delivering nothing. Officials spent the end of the week running for cover. Gore's office leaked that the trip was nothing to do with him; the State Department made clear that it was all the NSC's fault; while Soderberg was nowhere to be seen. "There is a smell of burned fingers around town," said one senior British official. As usual, it was a glittering occasion when Robin Renwick hosted a dinner party last Thursday in honour of Lady Thatcher, who was visiting America to be enrolled as chancellor of William and Mary College. The guest list was a distinguished one, with Dick Cheney, the former defence secretary, Bob Gates, the former head of the CIA, Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser, and other senior officials from previous Republican administrations. The talk was all of how things used to be, when Britain and America stood shoulder to shoulder against the Soviet Union. It was a paean to a bygone era which the British government would like to think will return, but most now accept has gone, perhaps forever. To Thatcher, the visit had a particular piquancy. The next night she gave the toast at a dinner to celebrate the 83rd birthday of Ronald Reagan. Over a decade, the two had forged an extraordinary friendship that had brought Britain and America closer together than at any time since the second world war and had played a crucial role in bringing the cold war to an end. Friends were quick to point out that Thatcher would never have allowed the Adams visa to have been issued without picking up the phone and calling "Ron" to demand a hearing. It is striking that Major failed to do that, recognising perhaps that he would be rebuffed. His only recourse was to call in Seitz, the ambassador, to remonstrate with him over American policy. It was, as The New York Times commented, "a diplomatic demarche virtually unknown in recent memory." While last week's fiasco over Adams may have been the symbol that finally laid to rest the special relationship, the destruction of its foundations began the day Thatcher was toppled from power. It was undermined still further when Clinton entered the White House a year ago. Although the 47-year-old president had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, he has no particular fondness for Britain. Other "Rhodies" around him, including Stephanopoulos and Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, regale friends with stories of the slights they received as "Yanks at Oxford." Culturally, too, Washington has begun a divorce from London. The generation in power today is the first to have no representatives who fought alongside the British in war. This is also a generation to whom Europe, and particularly Britain, are seen as a kind of cultural theme park that has been left behind by the economic tide. Brought up without the "baggage of history," their eyes are focused instead on the American economy and domestic affairs. As a result, their gaze, when it is lifted from the minutiae of health and welfare reforms, looks in only one direction: to the Pacific Rim. They believe that America can only boost its recovery and secure its long-term economic future by focusing on the Pacific "tigers" which are bounding ahead in economic growth. This new America wants a slice of the action and looks hungrily at markets in the vast economy of Japan a booming China and South korea. Clinton and his advisers believe these markets were largely ignored by Reagan and Bush and are determined not to repeat the mistake. Today, the Pacific Rim contains almost half the world's GNP, $120 billion of American exports, keeps 2.3 million Americans in jobs, is three times America's trade with Latin America and accounts for 50 percent more trade than America has with West Europe. To underline this shift in policy, Clinton hosted a summit in Seattle last November of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum designed to find new ways to develop an economic and security relationship among the 14 members. There is even talk that Nafta, which brings together the United States, Canada and Mexico in a trade pact, could be extended across the Pacific to some of these countries, creating a formidable rival to the European Community. Normally, the United States is careful to play down these realities so as not to alarm its European allies, but in a significant statement last year Christopher admitted that "West Europe is no longer the dominant area of the world." Stung by European criticism, he is now more diplomatic, saying that America is seeking only a "new balance" in its relations with Europe and Asia. It has been hard for British officials to adjust to the change. Both Reagan and Bush were on the phone every week to Thatcher when she was prime minister, discussing all aspects of world affairs and allowing Britain to "punch well above its weight." But her departure meant a subtle Atlantic sea change: suddenly Britain was run by a grey figure who lacked the iron lady's chutzpah. That change was abruptly and rudely reinforced by Clinton. Here was a new president intent on not allowing his domestic policy-- which won him the election and may secure a second term--being sidelined by foreign affairs unless it could boost his standing and that of the American economy. Britain, as part of a self-preoccupied continent in recession, barely "featured on his radar screen." Acutely aware of the Tories' role in trying to disrupt his campaign, he also personally had no fondness for Britain or its leader. His relationship with Major is at best "respectful but not close." At worst, according to one White House aide, "it is lousy. He doesn't like Major and never thinks of asking his views." He also knows the prime minister is in political trouble, and this in turns further weakens his international standing. The contacts are now strictly rationed, with barely a monthly phone conversation between the two leaders. In one celebrated incident, Major rang the president to congratulate him on the signing of the Nafta agreement. Clinton was "unavailable" and did not bother to ring back until three days later. Bosnia has served all too clearly to expose the rifts. America wants bombing raids on Serbian forces and the lifting of an arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, policies that have been opposed by Britain. Here, too, Clinton has succeeded in humiliating Major: in talks last year Clinton made an embarrassing aside about how Major had privately confessed that he could not support lifting the arms embargo because his government might fall; it was hardly the stuff of a special relationship. In truth, when he does turn his mind to foreign affairs, Clinton concentrates on Asia. His policy in Europe is to keep out of trouble and hope Russia does not explode. The only two leaders he is comfortable with are Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl, with whom one diplomat wittily commented he shares the same healthy appetite. When Major comes to Washington to meet Clinton at the end of this month, there will be much talk about Bosnia, Russia, trade, the success of Gatt and so on. It is unlikely that they will dwell too long on the Adams affair, but the scars will be profound. By the end of last week, a senior State Department official dismissed the row as a mere "blip" in an enduring relationship. That analysis is not shared by the British. Even experienced diplomats talk derisively about the "incompetence" and "naivety" of senior officials. Where once there was forgiveness for mistakes in places like Somalia and Haiti, there is now a clear judgment that this administration is both unprofessional and dangerous. Maybe the Americans will, as has happened in the past, find their new friends far from reliable in a crisis, and come running back to embrace sturdy, loyal Britain. According to this fantasy--for that is all it is at present--once again the telephone lines will start humming and the warmth will return to melt the ice. But as one diplomat said last week, "I wouldn't bet my last buck on it."
