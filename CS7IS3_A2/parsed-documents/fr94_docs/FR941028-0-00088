FR941028-0-00088 FR941028-0-00009 Commenters further asserted that the proposal inappropriately expanded the type of information required for operations linked through ownership or control. In substance, the commenters argued that the proposed regulation is overbroad and vague in requiring the reporting of ``all outstanding violation notices'' received prior to the date of application which are linked, through ownership or control, to the applicant. Again, OSM disagrees with the commenters. As discussed previously in this preamble with respect to §773.25 of the final rule, an ``outstanding violation'' is one which is currently in violation of the Act or of other laws specified in §510(c) of the Act. Under the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(d), an ``outstanding violation notice'' is a written notification from a governmental entity advising of a violation which remains uncorrected. Such violations are the basis for permit denial unless an applicant can demonstrate that the violation is in the process of being corrected or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). It is reasonable to require, prior to the date of application, that a permit applicant disclose such violations to the regulatory authority with respect to surface coal mining operations to which it is linked through ownership or control. One commenter suggested that the proposed amendment should be modified to require only the reporting of violations which would subject an applicant to permit block. OSM considers this proposal to be too restrictive. For instance, under commenter's proposal, an applicant correcting a violation to the satisfaction of the agency which has jurisdiction over such violation would not report such violation at the time of application. Nevertheless, any permit to be issued should be conditioned upon the performance of the corrective work being accomplished. Absent the reporting of such violation by the applicant, a regulatory authority might overlook the violation and issue the permit unconditioned upon such performance. The same rationale would apply with respect to the reporting of violations which are the subject of good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Accordingly, OSM must reject the proposed change. In addition, commenters asserted that requiring such disclosure by large companies with multiple affiliates and multiple surface coal mining operations is overly burdensome. OSM believes that companies which own or control surface coal mining operations should be aware of the compliance status of such operations. If companies choose to engage in surface coal mining operations, they should also have the capability of monitoring such operations. It is reasonable to require the disclosure of outstanding violations. Thus, OSM disagrees with the commenters' assertion. Nevertheless, OSM intends to further address the issues of compliance under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14. In a recently proposed rule package of June 28, 1993, OSM proposed the streamlining of companies' reporting under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14 through the use of information already incorporated into AVS. See 58 FR 34652 et seq. (June 28, 1993). Further, OSM's AVS Office stands ready to work with companies in the development of methods to report such companies' ownership or control relationships and to track the compliance of surface coal mining operations. As indicated previously in the preamble discussion of final section 773.15, OSM has decided to retain a limited presumption that notices of violation are in the process of being abated for purposes of a regulatory authority's review of a permit application. OSM made this decision as result of comments received in response to its proposed rules. Accordingly, OSM has amended paragraph (b)(1) of final §773.15 to provide that a regulatory authority may presume, in the absence of a cessation order, that a notice of violation is in the process of abatement if certain conditions are present. These conditions include that the abatement period for the notice of violation has not yet expired and that the applicant has provided certification that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation as part of the violation information provided pursuant to §778.14. In accordance with that change made to final §773.15, OSM has added language to paragraph (c) of final §778.14 requiring that an applicant provide such certification along with his or her disclosure of violations.
