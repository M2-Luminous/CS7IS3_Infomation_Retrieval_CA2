President Umut Arik is in Taiwan as the head of a Turkish trade mission. In a speech on Monday [25 April], he touted Turkey's potential for Taiwan businessmen seeking to expand to the Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States markets. Arik's visit marks the opening of a series of business promotions, including speeches, trade workshops, and visits by Turkish business groups to Taiwan, a China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) official said. The Turkish Entrepreneurial Association Musiad, which boasts 17 affiliate organizations and more than 1,800 members, is scheduled to host a trade and investment workshop Thursday at CETRA headquarters, the official said. The workshop aims to promote investment cooperation between Turkey and Taiwan and expand Turkish distribution networks which target the Asia-Pacific region, he added. Despite an inflation rate of 71.7 percent last year, Turkey's economic development potential should not be ignored, the official said. Turkey's foreign trade stood at U.S.$44.8 billion in 1993 with industrial products dominating the imports and manufactured goods and textiles and garments forming the bulk of the exports. Taiwan's imports from Turkey totaled about U.S.$220 million in 1992 with crude steel dominating the imports. The island's exports to Turkey, totaling U.S.$150 million in the same year, including mainly consumer's goods and electronic products, CETRA reported.
