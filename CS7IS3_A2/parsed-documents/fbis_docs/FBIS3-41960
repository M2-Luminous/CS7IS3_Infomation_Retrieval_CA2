And if they have to leave, will they return home or will they find work in other countries beforehand. It is certain that this problem will cause difficulties for Thai workers and their families at home and perhaps even for the government. This is another big problem which might affect international business, the labor business and the market for Thai labor. [passage omitted] This time America learned that Mr. Qadhdhafi was developing the most dangerous chemical weapons people could devise which could cause more suffering for those poisoned than nuclear weapons. America could not allow Libya to continue to develop such chemical weapons because they would present a serious danger to American allies including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as well as some other Arab states. Even Europe and America itself were threatened. Therefore America developed the plan to bomb the chemical weapons plant. One must believe that America was concerned about Thailand and the Thai workers and so called for a withdrawal from the area beforehand. America feared that with the bombing many Thai workers would be injured and killed, and this might affect relations with the Thai government. As one Thai person I would like to thank America for the relatives of those Thai workers. We Thai are the most peculiar people on earth. We get involved in various situations in various countries throughout the world. In many cases even the Thai government does not know about them. In almost every Arab country there are Thai people working at many different jobs from the lowest level to positions close to the leadership. The "Saudi Diamond Case," which is so famous there is no telling how it will end, came about because we Thai went to work at the highest levels of the palace in Saudi Arabia. And the person who made it possible for Thailand and Thai people to be disgraced throughout the world turned out to be a Thai policeman. In Libya it seems that there are Thai people working close to the leader, Mr. Qadhdhafi, who even peel fruit for him. At the factory which is to be bombed there are many Thai construction workers. In fact if America had asked for good intelligence or at least had asked for cooperation from the Minister of Interior or asked my associates, then America's intelligence would have been better because Mr. Chiu or my associates could not be considered weak in intelligence. It would appear that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut even had good information about who led the military leadership to believe that General Chawalit or Mr. Den Tomina was behind the burning of the school in the South and supported the partitioning of the land. It was a just a question of solving the political puzzle. Many intelligence sources agreed that the target factory was under construction. But it was not clear whether it was a factory for chemical weapons or not. The construction this time was in an underground foundation, and a company from England, an American ally, was the contractor. By the time this was finished, it would have required at least two years to build the building, and it would have required a long time to assemble the machinery etc. Altogether it would have taken at least four years. By that time we would have been in the second or third Chuan government, or my Prime Minister Chuan, might not be in power any more. The engineers for this factory were not just anybody. They were German engineers, and it was a company from Germany, an American ally. In a situation like this America should have known about this just as my Mr. Chiu knew. Why were they so concerned now? And it does not appear that Germany and England were warned to stop assisting the construction. I feel that if America were genuinely concerned about the Thai workers, then it should have been no less concerned about the well-being and lives of the Germans and English. And if one considers the length of time [until completion] then the time to bomb would be when the factory is completed in two years because then an enormous investment could be destroyed at one time. In addition it would help America's allies to get the income from the project. Or the allies might be able to gain additional intelligence. It would appear that England feels the same. Now I feel that the message to remove the Thai workers from Libya is strange somehow. When one thinks about it, if the Thai workers are removed and the timing of the bombing is changed to two years in the future, where does the labor come from to do the work? If one looks around, one can see three possible sources: South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. I think Vietnam would do the physical work while South Korea or Taiwan might supervise the construction. If one thinks like this, one comes to the realization that this would be similar to economic assistance to Vietnam and setting up lines of communication with Vietnam. And the gaining of this experience by Vietnam could be important for opposition to China in the future. We Thai might have to pay the price for stupidity. We must call on the Thai government to consider this carefully. It should quickly withdraw the Thai workers for whom there is concern before it is necessary. The homework for the Minister of Labor in this matter is very heavy because if America does not listen and bombs now then I feel we will lose some people.
