What Should the Role of the European Parliament Be? CVP [Christian People's Party]: The European Parliament (EP) is still too limited in its ability to take action. The joint decisionmaking procedure, political control of the European Commission (EC) but not of the Council, and budget control are all inadequate. The EP must be a legislative pillar. VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats]: The Maastricht Treaty strengthened the EP legislative role. This is apparent in the decisionmaking power it shares with the Council in some areas. Be that as it may, Europe is led by a small group of national leaders who are not elected, or at least not directly. We must lean toward an EP which is on an equal footing with the Council. The EC must be able to count on a majority. SP [Socialist Party]: The EP played an important role in the European unification process. It managed to impose important measures: Lowering the price of unleaded gas, limiting food additives, maintaining travel reductions for young people, etc. Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty granted it new powers. Live Differently: The EP is working in a situation of democratic deficit. It does not have the same powers as national parliaments. We suggest that the future EC president as well as the future commissioners, be chosen from among the EP members. 2. Europe Has Almost 20 Million Unemployed People. What Solution Do You Recommend for This Dramatic Situation? CVP: Unemployment can only be fought with the support of a strong economy. The redistribution of labor is one path, which can be adapted to the various sectors. In addition, greater flexibility as well as a lowering of indirect labor costs (employers' contributions, etc.) will make our economy more competitive and will facilitate recruitment. The European social model of bilateral negotiations offers the best weapon for fighting unemployment. VLD: In order to combat this immense problem, both structurally and permanently, it is essential that wage costs be reduced throughout Europe. An employment policy must go hand in hand with an increase in motivation. We must therefore close the gap between the minimum wage and unemployment benefit payments. Furthermore, the current regulations governing working time, professional careers, and the legal retirement age must be made more flexible. SP: We want a coherent recovery plan that takes account of ecological and social issues. Money must be reinvested in labor, not in speculation. Every year we want to offer 5 million Europeans the chance to get trained or retrained. However, labor too must be reorganized and tailored to the workers. Flexibility and the four-day working week must create jobs. Meeting social needs can also create jobs. Live differently: While in 1985, the official report on the Single Market predicted 5 million new jobs, the gap between the rich and poor has widened. This is proof of the failure of the traditional vision which holds that economic growth is a valid solution to the crisis. We advocate the creation of new "ecological" jobs, the four-day or 32-hour workweek, etc. 3. In Order To Slow Down Relocalizations by Businesses, Do You Support a Social Clause in Trade? CVP: The basic conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) must be applied across the board (freedom of trade union association, collective bargaining, ban on forced work, etc.). We favor positive measures, since negative measures lead too easily to protectionism. VLD: The elimination of Europe's internal borders has had a positive impact on the economy. Tightening up regulations cannot slow down this development. The development of homogeneous legislation in the various member states regarding the siting of businesses (e.g., legislation on the environment) will be much more effective. SP: The SP defends the social clauses of international treaties. Economic development and social progress must go hand in hand. Social clauses make it compulsory to respect the limits of social morality. Live differently: A European economic area which does not have a strong social dimension will increase imbalances and reinforce social dumping. We advocate the adoption of measures to prevent social and ecological dumping, such as the obligation to include the ILO social clause in all agreements. The Union must impose customs duties in order to compensate for differences in social and environmental protection [among different countries]. Revenue thus generated will be earmarked for development projects and the correction of factors responsible for creating social and economic distortion. 4. What Are the Broad Lines of Your Economic Policy? CVP: There are two essential paths: Coordinating action in the Twelve (like the overall plan), and developing actions at European level (continuing the construction of the Single Market, social dialogue within the Union, etc.). We must maintain the competitiveness of the European economy, without slipping into a permanent spiral of layoffs and downgrading of the people's well-being. VLD: The consistent increase in the German money supply is forcing the central banks to keep interest rates high. This, combined with our low productivity and harsh labor legislation, plunged Europe into the worst recession in the postwar era. The member states must lean toward greater economic and monetary convergence. Moreover, European labor legislation must be made more flexible. SP: The current problems are the result of the economic crisis. Social Europe was never given consideration. Some people recommend that we let competition have a free rein. However, this competition risks leading to a debacle in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Europe has a choice: egoism or solidarity. We are opting for solidarity. Live differently: The Maastricht Treaty is increasing economic competition among European states and regions. We support the development of economic policies that allow the weakest to catch up with those who are better armed. We do not support the uniform application of austerity measures. We advocate a regulation limiting speculation. 5. What Is Your Program on Immigration? CVP: Refugee rights to be protected, as guaranteed by the Geneva Convention, must be maintained or even extended to become a humanitarian status which grants temporary protection. We need a European policy to channel and curb refugees as well as combat the reasons for it (prevention of economic refugees). In addition, the situation of refugees who are not acknowledged but who have become integrated, must be regularized. VLD: There is serious tension in our society between various population groups. Some conceal these problems. Other advocate inhuman solutions. There is a third way: Integrating foreigners by having them adapt to our values and way of life (freedom of expression, the democratic decisionmaking process, equality of the sexes) SP: We want Europe to be a completely safe and welcome land for political refugees. Procedures and guarantees must be equal for everyone. A European regulation must be implemented for economic migrants. Europe must prevent and combat illegal immigration and illegal work. However, refugees fleeing famine, war, or natural disasters must also be taken in for a limited time. Live differently: Europe has to recognize that it is a region of immigration. A new European immigration policy (quotas) must replace the halting of immigration that has been in place for 20 years. Asylum procedures must be unified as must actions to combat illegal work. We advocate the right to vote for all immigrants who have been residents for five years. 6. What Are Your Three Priorities in Agriculture? CVP: 1. Food safety: sufficient and varied production. 2. Farmer incomes: Sound and well-structured farms must be able to generate a reasonable income. 3. The environment: Farmers have a mission to preserve nature. VLD: The VLD is opting for a liberal agricultural policy which is socially minded and which respects the environment. Liberal in that production is tailored to the interplay of supply and demand to avoid surpluses; aid from the public authorities must be selective. Social in that we advocate a maximum level of employment in the agricultural sector; the system of guaranteed prices should be advantageously replaced by a system of guaranteed incomes for productive farmers. SP: The Socialists want another agricultural policy, one which will help farmers have decent incomes for a qualitatively better production that respects the environment. We will have to put the emphasis on income supports, but this goes hand in hand with a reduction in production. The regions must be able to follow their own policies. Live differently: 1. Parity of incomes for farmers and other social categories. 2. Improvement in the quality of foodstuffs and safeguards for genetic diversity. 3. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy by abolishing export subsidies. Policies ensuring suitable prices for "ecological" farms.
