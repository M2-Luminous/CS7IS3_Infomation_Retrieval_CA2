That provocation, if the allegations of arrest of two guards of 70-Clifton is to be believed, has already been provided. In the meantime Mir Murtaza Bhutto, though still behind bars, has announced the formation of a parallel organisation to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party], called the Bhutto group. He hopes to attract to it the truly `sincere and dedicated' workers of the PPP. If and when the group takes off, it may or may not drain the mainstream PPP of its core, but it could certainly emerge as a splinter, capable of causing damage to the party in Sindh. The crucial factor in all this will obviously be the help and patronage of the Begum. Deprived of his mother's support the Murtaza faction could remain still-born. Therefore, the Prime Minister, in her own interest would perhaps try to keep her mother out of the divisive scheme that her brother has launched. She may try to acquire her mother's symbolic, if not actual, association with the main party. That of course, would not only be in the best interest of the PPP but also in the best interest of the evolution of a two-party system in the country. The split in the Muslim League has already done a lot of damage to that process. A split in the PPP would only aggravate that situation and would, in the days to come, make the forming of a stable government even more difficult. The truce, if it holds, is the first hopeful sign in damage control since the unceremonious ouster of Begum Bhutto from the Chairpersonship of the PPP. But it obviously does not mean the end of the rift. The Begum has opted not to speak out for the time being, but there is no indication yet of her having given an inch on her demand of being restored to the office of Chairpersonship. Even if she were to accept a symbolic office to salve her hurt ego and give up the quest for the big prize, Mir Murtaza having already launched himself on his course of sister-bashing, is not likely to give up. The Begum could thus be instigated again and again by him to choose between the son whom she considers the legitimate heir of his father's legacy and her daughter who kept the party together and brought it twice to power. It may not thus be just a triangular fight within the family for the PPP crown, but an emotional divide within the Begum herself. Because, unless Mir Murtaza decides to rein in his overweening ambition, the Begum will eventually have to cast her lot with one or the other of her siblings. [as published]
