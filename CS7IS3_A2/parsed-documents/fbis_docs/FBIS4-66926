As to the Palen test simulation program, it "would not suffice to ensure the development of new nuclear charges." The deputy also pointed to two other "controversial" issues: "The decision by the president of the Republic to keep active the ballistic missiles on the Albion plateau" and "the five-year delay in the M5 strategic ballistic missile program."
