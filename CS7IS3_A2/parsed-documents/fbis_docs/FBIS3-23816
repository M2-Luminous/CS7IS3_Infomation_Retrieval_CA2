The government forces, using arms, wiped from the face of the earth a military barracks in the center of a densely populated city. There were victims, including peaceful residents who suffered. And now the organizers and participants in this action will have to face the court. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan Isa Gambarov and the ministers of defense and internal affairs have been charged under two articles: 57-"prime," part 2, which indicates: "The use of armed forces against the people" and envisions prison sentences of from 10 to 25 years, and also the death sentence. The second article is less "terrible"--168-"prime"--exceeding one's authority. It envisions up to seven years of isolation from the society. Also charged under this article are the former procurator general, the minister of national security, and his deputy. This remains an open question so far: Were criminal charges brought against former president Abulfaz Elchibey and former prime minister Panakh Guseynov? But it is obvious that both of them are out of the reach of the investigatory organs. The former continues to live guarded by his supporters in his native village of Keleki, and the latter is on the run and, according to certain operational information, is outside the country.
