The central bank has set a target for inflation of 4.2 percent in 1994. The first five months have already seen inflation rising by 4.8 percent compared with the end of last year. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he had ordered the authorities to closely monitor building material prices to prevent significant impact on overall inflation. Siam Cement Co, the largest cement producer, has also been asked to hold prices to avoid raising the national inflation rate further. Chuan said the situation was not worrisome and recent increases in interest rates ought to slow down excessive spending. The Bank of Thailand earlier warned that commercial banks were extending excessive credit, especially for personal consumption. Banks' total credit extension grew 24.7 per cent in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year. The target set for 1994 is 21 per cent. Bank Governor Wichit Suphinit said there was no sign of a "bubble economy", a notion used for a high growth and overheated economy which collapses suddenly as witnessed with the recent economic trend in Japan. Yet, he admitted that the economy has seen a big month-to-month jump in inflation by 1.1 percentage points in May and the second half of 1994 was likely to see higher domestic spending. "The current weak monetary policy ought to be able to curtail inflation from rising too high. We are still at a deterrent state and there is no need to take tough action," he said. Informed sources said the current higher inflation rate is caused by three factors. The first is a 48 percent attribution from supply shortages -- especially of raw materials used in the production of industrial goods -- of commodities such as cotton, timber, fruit and vegetables (due to drought). The second, with a 40 percent weight, is what is described as the demand-pull factor, especially in services. The cost-of-production factor is assessed to have contributed 12 percent to the total weight of the current level of inflation. However, concerns about a possible bubble economy continue among top central bank officials, according to sources, especially if domestic spending should keep on rising. This is caused by the 7-8 percent rise in the wages of blue collar workers and 20-30 per cent increase in the wages of white collar workers and of civil servants. High export growth has also contributed to higher spending. Higher oil prices have also resulted in the current account deficit surpassing the 5.4 per cent target in relation to gross domestic product. It was 5.5 percent in the first five months. Sources quoted Wichit as telling the central bank directors that Thailand's inflation rate is higher than Singapore and Malaysia but lower than Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines. Foreign Liabilities of banks in May also climbed by Bt [baht] 31 billion over the previous month to Bt354 billion, or twice the amount at the end of 1993. Overseas loans have been used to support high domestic credit growth. Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman, disclosed that credit extended by foreign and local banks inclusive of offshore banking facility, grew a hefty 24.7 per cent in the first five months, but deposits grew only 14 per cent. As a result, the credit/deposit ratio reached a record high of 120.9 per cent. He described the five-month economic performance as satisfactory although credit growth was three percentage points higher than the target and total outstanding credit edged closer to Bt3 trillion. "We think that the credit system is still disciplined enough. We may have to closely monitor some institutions. With the capital adequacy floor rising from seven to 7.5 per cent now and to 8 per cent next year it should reduce the credit growth pressure on top of previous interest rate increases," said Phisit. The public sector reported higher cash surpluses in May with the total for the first eight months of the current fiscal year reaching Bt8.9 billion, and possibly reaching another Bt50 billion in the four remaining months of the fiscal year. Budget revenue is up 14.7 percent during this period compared with the target increase of just 12 percent. Expenditure is up 17.9 per cent which is close to the target. "The expected budget surplus of Bt60 billion this fiscal year will help to ease the inflationary pressure," Phisit said. The manufacturing index during this period grow at a slower pace in May to 10.5 per cent, with a private investment rate of 9.7 percent.
