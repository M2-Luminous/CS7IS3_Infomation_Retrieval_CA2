In a harsh note approved by all those legislators who were present, the PT bloc voiced its disagreement with the decision of the party leadership to ban their participation in the constitutional revision, and held the PT executive board responsible for any problems the PT's absence may cause for the social and individual rights attained by the National Constituent Assembly. PT leader Jose Fortunatti asserted: "If the executive board has banned us from voting, it has to assume the responsibility for this." According to Fortunatti, the entire federal bloc was upset by the executive board's prohibition, regarded as an inappropriate and authoritarian interference. Fortunatti commented: "So far, most of the bloc has maintained a cautious attitude." Fortunatti noted, however, that the unrest was obvious. From the cautious attitude -- many remain silent during a crisis -- the bloc decided to make public its disagreement with the party leadership. Fortunatti added: "The bloc unanimously rejects the executive board's decision to not participate in the constitutional revision." Senator Eduardo Suplicy sees no other alternative for the party leadership than to yield to the pressure being excerted by the PT bloc.
