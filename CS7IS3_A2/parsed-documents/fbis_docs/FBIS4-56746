Go ahead, Mr. President. [Endara] Thank you very much, Luz Maria. I am calling you to report that I have just made a decision, along with the minister of government and justice. I have decided that public workers will be excused from duty tomorrow until 1230. I just signed a decree stating that the public sector will not work tomorrow morning until 1230. This will allow workers to participate in the vote-counting process. I also want to take this opportunity to ask the private sector, particularly the National Council of Private Enterprise, Panamanian Chamber of Construction, Chamber of Commerce, Industrialists Association, and all Panamanian businessmen to follow suit. We ask them to allow their workers to report for duty tomorrow at 1230. Why? Because I think the people, in addition to witnessing the voting, must witness the vote-counting process. The vote-counting process must be absolutely aboveboard, and I want the people to see how their votes are counted. What we are experiencing today in Panama is something we have not seen for years. This opportunity will not present itself again for another five years. Therefore, I ask the private sector to excuse their employees from duty until 1230 tomorrow. It is worthwhile for the Panamanian people to see how their votes are counted, and it will allow us to know for certain who the real president of Panama is. I will relinquish power to that future president of Panama regardless of who he may be, but I want all the people to witness the vote-counting process. I thank you very much, Luz Maria, for allowing me to inform public workers of a decree issued excusing them from work until 1230 tomorrow. This will allow Panamanians to witness how their votes are counted. They must go to their voting tables and see how their votes are counted. [Noli] Thank you, Mr. President, for choosing TVN to make this announcement.
