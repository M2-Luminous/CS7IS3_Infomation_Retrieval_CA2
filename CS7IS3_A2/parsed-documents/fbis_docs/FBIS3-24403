All three countries have experienced quite strong pressure on the part of Moscow and could ultimately have been seeking an outside distraction, in any event, checking the extent to which the world is prepared to accept CIS countries outside of a Russian context. Of the three countries, Georgia is the most susceptible to Russian influence--acknowledging Moscow's direct impact on the course of the Abkhaz conflict and the possibility of freezing it, its official representatives have thus far been expressing regret at the fact that international organizations have been in no hurry to respond to the joint requests of Moscow and Tbilisi concerning formalization of Russian peacekeeping in the zone of the conflict. The fact that Shevardnadze discussed in Washington the possibility of the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping contingent to Abkhazia and obtained support has for himself one attractive circumstance--Georgia's prospects are still linked with him personally, and, supporting him, Western leaders are supporting the present regime and have an interest in its stabilization. All other prospects are more doubtful. Doubt number one--how long will it be necessary to wait for the prospects of a "firm political settlement," that is, for the parties to have reached a compromise which makes it possible to begin a peacekeeping operation without subjecting the soldiers to the unpredictable vicissitudes of the war. The appearance of "blue helmets" in a region stuffed with Russian arms in direct proximity to the troubled Russian borders is in itself a political problem. Russia is jealous not so much of the fact of the presence of UN soldiers as of the "outside" political influence on Georgia. The Abkhaz leadership could attempt to derive practical benefits for itself from the latent rivalry. Although it has no one from whom it can expect political recognition, enshrining the present status quo with the aid of its Moscow allies is possible. But Georgia, split not only along the line of the front but also divided into spheres of influence, would be even further from stability than now. Russia, even having signed the notorious cooperation treaty with it, played on its weakness. But Georgia will remain a weak country--with a financial system in a state of collapse and blocked lines of communication and cut off from energy supplies--until the internal problems are resolved and it becomes a self-sufficient state. Russia, despite all its ambitions, lacks the resources to "pay" for the corresponding political orientation--its "residual" influence has been sufficient thus far only for maintaining Georgia in a disorganized state. And Western investments would be spent on the war, as if on a glutton. Inasmuch as the main candidates for the role of peacemakers in the region--Russia and international organizations--have as of late been pushing disagreements more than seeking mutual understanding, the problems in their relations will be resolved at the expense of Georgia and Abkhazia. They can only be alleviated by a Georgian-Abkhaz compromise, but it, judging by the failure of the recent Geneva negotiations, is unattainable as yet.
