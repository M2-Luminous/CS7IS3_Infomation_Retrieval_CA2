Defiance of security measures and precautions was noticeable in both the Palestinian and Israeli sides. Two bus attacks in Israel--the most recent one yesterday, left six dead and many wounded--may give fodder to the pro-Israeli propaganda machine. Despite that, a careful analysis of the consequences of the Hebron massacre reveals a worrying fact. Extremists on both sides are currently trying to take the law in their own hands and impose their antipeace agenda on everyone else. The escalation in violence and bloodshed may at first glance appear to be a direct consequence of the Hebron massacre. But a deeper and more worrying reason is in play. The peace process has had a rough ride, not least because of the lack of commitment to the dates stipulated in the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza- Jericho agreement. It is no secret to anyone following the scene closely that the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho agreement failed to satisfy a significant segment of Palestinian and Arab public opinion, due to their failure to satisfy some Palestinian demands. Still, we have to remember that the existing agreement was just a starting point and that what matters is what follows this agreement in terms of comprehensive self-rule and the final status of the occupied territories. The Israeli side has introduced certain complications that resulted in the failure to meet the proposed date of full withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho: Wednesday 13 April, yesterday. It came and went without the withdrawal having even begun. This and other factors combined to produce the recent deterioration in the situation and to endanger the entire peace process. The peace process is in danger. Its jitters are due partly to the slow pace with which it is proceeding and partly to the fact that doubts about Israel's intentions are reaching a higher and more worrying plateau. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres promised, after the distressing bus attack in Israel two days ago, that they will not allow such incidents to hinder the peace process. Earlier, Prime Minister Rabin made a statement to the effect that no dateline is sacred concerning the practical steps involved in the peace process. At a time when matters have come to a head, it would be wrong to question the integrity of either side. But recent events, the general climate of the peace process, and the differences facing the implementation of the existing agreements are a cause for doubts, justified or imagined. Despite that, there are other statements by the Israeli prime minister disseminated in the media today. These statements are extremely important and give cause for some optimism amid the discouragement created by the recent acts of mutual violence and fomented by the slow and unsure pace of Palestinian-Israeli talks. Most important of the Israeli prime minister's remarks, which he made in a press interview, is his expression of willingness to remove the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories in return for a final agreement with the Palestinians. Rabin, however, pointed out that the security of the settlements should be guaranteed during the self-rule period. This Israeli statement leaves one question unanswered, however. Can guarantees for the security of the settlements be reconciled with the Palestinians' exercise of the self-rule authority in the commonly accepted sense of the word? Having said all this, we wish to make it clear that there is a dire need for a faster pace, a stronger commitment, and clearer positions on all tracks of the peace process.
