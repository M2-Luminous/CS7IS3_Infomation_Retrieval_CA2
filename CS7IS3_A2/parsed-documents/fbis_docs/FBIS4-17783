This assessment of Russia's new peacemaking initiative confirms the traditionally established idea that Azerbaijan is not even thinking about winding down combat actions and indeed is placing its bets on crude force. Meanwhile, let us recall that the Russian plan calls for discontinuing combat actions in the conflict zone, vacating Azerbaijani territories, and allowing refugees to return. Moscow proposes to disengage the conflicting parties within three days after a cease-fire and to spend an equal amount of time establishing a buffer zone where international observers are expected to be located. Ultimately the blockade of Armenia would be broken, Karabakh would finally get relatively stable security guarantees, and Azerbaijan would get back its territories seized by the Karabakh Defense Army solely in order to ensure the security of its lines and the civilian population. However, even this did not satisfy the politicians from Baku. They have now recalled that...Shusha also is among the "occupied" territories--incidentally, it is a city that is an inalienable part of Nagorno-Karabakh. If we adhere to the logic of G. Aliyev, we may also hear very soon that, for example, Mardakert is not mentioned in the Russians' plan.... As far as Lachin is concerned, according to Aliyev, it has also been "completely left out" of the new Russian plan. That is to say, the Lachin humanitarian corridor, Nagorno- Karabakh's only outlet to the outside world, should also be vacated by "Armenian formations." Thereafter, one would expect that Azeri soldiers will only have to conduct the last military operation in order to once again occupy the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, in its turn, and bring the population to its knees. It is hard to say whether these conditions of Baku are a ploy or complete lack of acceptance of existing realities, most likely caused by the quite understandable desire of the Azerbaijani leader to not share the fate of previous presidents of the state.... Be that as it may, Baku's reluctance to accept the world as it now is will not bring either Azerbaijan or the region as a whole more peace. President Aliyev invited people from Karabakh to visit Baku--this is yet another sensation of recent days. In the process he made it clearly understood that those invited are citizens of Azerbaijan, and must engage in dialogue with Aliyev in the capital city in a way befitting people speaking with the president. It is hard to understand why the leaders of Karabakh must set out for Baku for anything at all. Clearly they might as well engage in "constructive" dialogue with, for example, the leaders of Kyrgyzstan or Sweden. The list could be continued.... Yet another proposal by Aliyev confirms yet again that there are no political forces in Baku capable of evaluating the real situation in the region soberly; this means that a new escalation of combat actions should be expected, naturally, with all the peacemaking efforts, and not just those of Russia, being completely ignored. It is hard to say how much longer Baku will be able to play a duet alone, thus misleading the world community. One thing is obvious: Whatever the array of forces, Nagorno-Karabakh will never again be a protectorate of Azerbaijan. If a few more weapons emplacements of the aggressor need to be suppressed in order to ensure the security of the people of Karabakh, they have the means to accomplish this and support for these actions from commonly accepted norms of international law. If a weapons emplacement threatens the security of the population, it can be suppressed. This begs the following resume: If mistakes are not perceived today, their number may triple tomorrow. One cannot ride a tank or fly a bomber to peace and welfare in the region. If only all the sides understood this....
