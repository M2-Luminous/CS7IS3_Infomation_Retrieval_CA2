He clarified in an interview with the Middle East satellite television channel, MBC, that the war imposed on the Yemeni people has levelled the gunpowder, the bullets, and the shells to the heart of the unity and that the unity has been stabbed in the back. Pointing to those who committed this brutal crime, he said that this brutal crime did not only lead to the killing of the citizens in the peaceful villages and cities but it also directed a stab against the Yemeni people and to its history and future. He said: In this critical situation I call upon ... if we want to preserve something for the future, it is in the interests of Yemen that people are pledged to a logic rather than the logic of war. [sentence as heard] As for some, to put the invasion or the manipulation is the impossible which cannot be done. [sentence as heard] Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man reiterated that he that received reports from the war- mongers must know that they are [word indistinct]. He expressed satisfaction about the good intermediation efforts and said in this connection: Those who reject these intermediation under the illusion of achieving a military victory must wake up from their illusions, which I am afraid will hit them in their strongholds. [Al-Jundi] What is the purpose of your visit to Riyadh? [Al-Iryani] To discuss bilateral ties and explain the situation in Yemen. [Al-Jundi] Reports say that you personally were behind the failure of the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah in Oman. You reportedly said that the southerners offered proposals that contradict Yemeni unity. [Al-Iryani] Yes. This remains my opinion. I believe in it. [Al-Jundi] Can we say that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, as chairman of the Presidential Council, can issue a cease-fire order to protect Yemeni unity and, above all, Yemeni blood? [Al-Iryani] If the Armed Forces obey the authority of the state and the orders of the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, then I am sure he will. [Al-Jundi] The Presidential Council dismissed Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and the defense minister, while the House of Representatives dismissed Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-'Attas told the Voice of the Arabs that the decisions were illegitimate and that the House of Representatives and the Presidential Council had no right to carry out such dismissals. [Al-Iryani] Concerning the prime minister, the defense minister, and the oil minister, they were dismissed on the basis of a clear constitutional provision, namely, Article 111. The House of Representatives did not withdraw confidence from 'Ali Salim al-Bid, but from those who support secession and work against Yemeni unity. [Al-Jundi] Through your current contacts, is there a glimmer of hope for a settlement and calm in Yemen or will the war continue? [Al-Iryani] You cannot lose hope. I believe the fighting will not continue long, but that sense and reason will prevail. [Al-Jundi] Thank you. [Al-Iryani] You are welcome.
