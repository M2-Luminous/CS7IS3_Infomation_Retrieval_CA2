Are you satisfied, from this point of view, with the present state of affairs, and what problems do you see in this sphere? [Demirel] Turkey and Russia are the two great states of the region. I think that we are responsible for peace and prosperity not only in our region, but also in Europe and in the world. Our countries have maintained political relations for more than 500 years. In the past there were conflicts and wars between us, but enmity does not have to continue forever. I do not believe that any country could build its policy on the basis of enmity. We must shake hands with one another and save the future. The people of our country, I know, is also interested in good relations. This is why I appeal for the creation of relations of peace, prosperity and friendliness, both today and in the future. For several years I have advocated for us to have good relations with our northern neighbors--with Russia, with the former Soviet Union, irrespective of the regime existing in your country. Our cooperation must be based on mutual understanding, respect of independence, on non-interference in the internal affairs of one another, and on respect of territorial integrity. We do not want to interfere in your internal affairs, we respect your independence and territorial integrity, and we want to cooperate with Russia. It is obvious that during the past few years our relations have entered a new era in their development and are based on common interests in the spirit of cooperation. The Agreement on the Principles of Bilateral Relations signed during my visit in Russia on 25 May 1992 and our negotiations with President Yeltsin have been the cornerstone in this process. Since that time our relations have begun to develop satisfactorily in all spheres. We have the opportunity for international cooperation. We are trying to create an Organization for Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Countries. The director of this organization, who has just now been appointed (incidentally, he is a Russian) has come to Istanbul. And now this organization continues to develop its activity. About 300 Turkish companies are operating in Russia. One of the construction firms has reconstructed the White House. We are buying natural gas from Russia. Turkey is open for the development of business activities. We have good relations in many spheres, and I do not see any reasons that would prevent their being maintained. Both of our countries must very attentively strive not to darken our relations. On the government level we are acting in this manner. Trifles should not be given exaggerated significance. If something disturbs Turkey, we will communicate this to Russia. And if something calls forth the displeasure of Russia, it should tell the Turkish leadership about it. I think that friendship and cooperation between Turkey and Russia will be beneficial for both of our countries. [Gagua] For the first time in recent centuries Turkey does not have a land frontier with Russia. Now Turkey is bordered by new independent states--Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. What is the essence of Turkey's policy with respect to these countries? [Demirel] I think that if peace and accord are established in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, this will only be for the good of both Russia and Turkey. And if these countries are not at war with each other, this will be in the interest of both Russia and Turkey. I think that if peace is established in the Caucasus, including the countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Ccoperation of the Black Sea Countries, then this new type of interaction and cooperation can be developed. Yes, this is true, between our countries there is no land border, but we are located on opposite sides of the Black Sea. [Gagua] Today the idea of the restoration of the former Soviet Union is acquiring more and more supporters. What do you think about this? [Demirel] You know, after the recent elections, after the appearance of Mr Zhirinovskiy, one can talk about the fact that there are many people in Russia who are displeased with the collapse of the Soviet Union. They are displeased with the fact that the republics of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, and the countries of East Europe are no longer within the sphere of influence of Russia. They believe that a new Russia should be created withing the borders of the former Soviet Union. It is natural that this is a subject of anxiety of many countries, not only Turkey. If Russia is going to be an imperialist state, it will lose the trust it now enjoys. If this happens, then, without a doubt, it will be a blow to many countries, who will begin to see a threat in Russia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all started to talk about the fact that the world no longer is divided into two diametrically opposed camps, that now the arms race will yield to peaceful development. But if we preserve peace and cooperation, this will be good both for Russia and the other countries. You see, in this case we are working for the good and the prosperity of our peoples. But if we are at war with one another, we only inflict harm and misfortune on another, we condemn our peoples to poverty. [Gagua] What is your attitude to the agreement signed by Georgia and Russia, according to which Russia obtains military bases in Georgia? [Demirel] You know that by an agreement of the CSCE member countries, which many states signed, the quantity of arms in these countries must be under control. As far as the agreement between Georgia and Russia is concerned, this is the affair of these states, and we should not be worried on account of this. But Russia must observe the agreement on the quantity of arms in the region. [Gagua] What do you think about the situation that has developed around the Crimean Peninsula? [Demirel] The dispute over the Crimea is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. We are interested in the fate of the Crimean Tatars, there are quite a few in our country, too. A considerable number of them live outside the boundaries of Ukraine and Russia, they are found even in New York and in Romania. Our interests with respect to the Crimean Tatars are not political. All we want is for them to be secure in their homeland and for them to be treated like people, you see, they are our brothers. [Gagua] You probably know that Mr Nazarbayev, speaking at the United Nations, accused some Russian officials of conducting an imperialist policy. How do you assess this declaration? [Demirel] I think he is concerned about the declarations of Mr Zhirinovskiy. I know what he thinks, I suggested to him to maintain peace in Kazakhstan; you see, Turkey knows that a significant part of the population of Kazakhstan consists of Russians. And if such is the composition of the population, you already cannot call the Russians a minority. But they enjoy the same rights as the other peoples of Kazakhstan. Moreover, the prime minister of Kazakhstan is of Russian descent, although he was born in Alma-Ata. You know that the destinies of these two countries--Russia and Kazakhstan--are closely interrelated and interwoven. Nazarbayev knows how attentively Russia treats the 30-million strong population of Russian origin that is living outside the borders of Russia, and Russia rightfully is concerned about their security. Nazarbayev treats the local population with consideration, but, as far as I know, he is afraid of the Russian population, of the emigrants from Russia, he is afraid that they may separate from Kazakhstan. This is what he is anxious about. But he told me on January 20 in Davos: "First of all, I am a Kazakh, then a Russian, and then a Central Asian." He said that it is necessary to be very attentive so that Kazakhstan is not separated and torn away from Russia, because they have a great deal in common. I think that he is a sufficiently wise man, and I do not think that he will do anything that could call forth irritation in Russia or among the Russian population of the republic. I am not defending and justifying him, I am only explaining, since I am acquainted with his views, from his point of view, and I know what I suggested to him. [Gagua] There are rumors circulating to the effect that during the recent visit of Mr Aliyev in Turkey an agreement was signed, according to which an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan will go through the territory of Turkey. Is this true? [Demirel] No. In general, this is not a political, but an economic question. We would like for such a pipeline to go through Turkey, but we are not nudging and we are not pressuring other countries. Especially not those which have cultural and historical ties with us. All right, if such a decision will be in the interest of Azerbaijan. However, if this is only in the interest of Turkey, but does not benefit their country, we will not occupy ourselves with this. If this is useful to the people of Azerbaijan, we are glad about it, but, as I already said, this is not a political question. [Gagua] Mr President, today in the republics of Central Asia, after a period of some euphoria, a certain disillusionment is noticeable. It would appear, they expected more from Turkey. Can you say anything in regard to this? [Demirel] You know that these countries are our brothers, and for the duration of almost 70 years we have practically not had any relations with them. Two and a half years ago they became independent. We have concluded a number of agreements with them, we maintain telephone contact with them, they watch Turkish television broadcasts, there is a lively air traffic between our countries, citizens of ours are in these countries. About 1,000 Turkish companies are operating in the republics of Central Asia. We are encouraging these states to step out into the world arena, to become members of the CSCE, the United Nations, etc. We have opened our embassies in these countries, and students from these countries are being trained in Turkey. We have granted them credits in the amount of more than $1 billion. Some part of the credits has already been used by these countries. Moreover, we have made it clear to them that we do not intend to control these countries, that they must govern themselves. We only want for them to preserve and maintain their independence both within their countries and with their neighbors, for them to support the development of their countries. To tell the truth, we are not afraid of any disillusionment on their part. We meet, we discuss various problems. They need to take up the realization of concrete projects, but they do not have sufficient personnel for this. As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to continue to do everything possible for them. If they are ready to continue work on these projects in the course of 10 years, this would be very useful. [Gagua] Turkey reacted very sharply to the conduct of a Kurdish conference in Moscow. Do you believe that incidents of that sort can seriously complicate international relations? [Demirel] You know how concerned we are with the problem of terrorism in our country. Up to now, Russia, our friend and neighbor, has conducted a very cautious policy in this question. You see, Russians know how we are suffering because of this. Moreover, all countries, including Russia, are devoted to the idea of the condemnation of terrorism and support the countries fighting against it. Chechen, Tatars, and representatives of other peoples come to Turkey from Russia, and if their stay is undesirable in Turkey, Russia should not allow them to do this. We have businessmen who work in Kazan, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechnia, and our policy is that we do not incite anyone against Russians. To the peoples that live in Russia we say that they must have good relations with the Russians, since they are part of Russia. You see, if misfortune befalls them, no one will help them, simply no one can help. As far as the new independent states are concerned, such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan, we share the commonality of languages with them, the commonality of religion, and we tell these countries that they must have good relations with Russia. In no one's mind must the impression be created that terrorists receive any kind of support from Russia. I know the leaders of your country, Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kozyrev. These are very wise people, and I do not think that they will try to aggravate relations with Turkey in essence for nothing. [Gagua] The tendency of the internationalization of the Karabakh conflict is becoming increasingly more noticeable. Lately we have learned about cases of the participation of Afghan mujaheddin in battles on the side of the Azerbaijani army. What is the position of Turkey on this question? [Demirel] Turkey opposes any development of events that could lead to the internationalization of the continuing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In this conflict, Azerbaijan is the party whose territory is occupied, and this gives it the inalienable right to defend its territory against aggression. Of course, the CSCE countries agreed among themselves to seek ways of solving this conflict peacefully. Specifically for this purpose the Minsk Group was established, and it is the only forum where a just and long-term peaceful solution of the problem can be found. As far as the interference of foreign "volunteers" in this conflict is concerned, you should address this question to the parties involved in this. [Gagua] Turkey has accused Armenia that camps of Kurdish terrorists are located on its territory. Armenia, in its turn, has characterized these accusations as groundless and as being made to please the domestic Turkish opposition. Could you not talk about this in greater detail? [Demirel] Indeed, we are encountering signs of the presence of the RKK (Kurdish Workers Party) in various regions of Armenia and in territories occupied by Armenia. Turkey is continuing the conduct of investigations in regard to such information and is verifying the authenticity of this information. The authorities of Armenia have several times expressed their determination not to allow any activity of the RKK. However, it would appear, the government of Armenia does not have full authority and control in certain territories. I firmly believe that a clear-cut position taken against terrorism is a natural obligation for all states, and I am convinced that the authorities of Armenia will be attentive to the observance of this high obligation. [Gagua] From the very beginning of the Karabakh conflict, Turkey has undertaken active efforts to solve it. Does it not seem to you that the presence of diplomatic relations with Armenia and an embassy in Yerevan would facilitate these efforts. [Demirel] Turkey is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia if Armenia withdraws its troops from the territory of Azerbaijan and begins to fulfill the norms of international law after having put an end to the aggression against Azerbaijan. It should be remembered that Turkey is the first country which recognized the independence of Armenia and invited this country to take part in the creation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Countries as a founding member. We have told them many times that they are wrong. We have conducted negotiations with Mr Ter-Petrosyan and other leaders of Armenia, we have proposed to them to take practical steps. Our policy with respect to Armenia is not based on enmity and we do not intend to carry out any hostile actions in regard to Armenia. But if they want to exist in this region as an independent state, they must have good relations with Turkey. And then they can have access to Turkish ports and to Turkish highways, and they can make use of means of production in Turkey. Armenian representatives have come to me and said that they need assistance, that their population is starving. They asked for wheat and I promised them supplies, they asked for electric power, and I promised them a supply of electric power. But, you see, they continue to kill people! They continue to occupy the territory of Azerbaijan! We have stated to the leaders of the European countries that if the Western countries will publicly and openly support Armenia, and the Muslim countries will come to the assistance of Azerbaijan, a Muslim-Christian war will begin in the Caucasus. We are friends of Azerbaijan and when they turned to us: "Please, help us. We need your support and assistance, including military," we replied: "We can do this. But then what? You see, then the peoples of other countries will turn to us for assistance!" We want the settlement of the conflict within the framework of the existing state borders. I think, to a certain extent we will be successful. When I was in Moscow, I talked with Mr Yeltsin. We came out with joint declarations to the effect that we will promote the settlement of this conflict. But the opening of an embassy in Armenia will not help things from the point of view of our public opinion. At the same time, you know, Mr Ter-Petrosyan has come to Istanbul and to Ankara a number of times. What is more, several days ago representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan were here. We talked very openly with them. [Gagua] What is your view of the criticism being expressed by Western countries in regard to the violations of human rights in the south-eastern regions of Turkey? [Demirel] Human rights constitute one of the cornerstones of the new European and world order. We share the position according to which this is no longer an internal issue of the state, that this is the common concern of the world community. In the last few years a number of important initiatives in the sphere of human rights have been undertaken. An important improvement in this has been introduced by the Turkish criminal code, which allows arrested persons the presence of their lawyers at every interrogation. The same law provides for a significant reduction of the time in custody. Another significant event is the recent closing of all tribunals for extraordinary cases and the transfer of these cases to civil courts. Moreover, the courts are actively involved in the cases of the bureaucrats and officials who have committed human rights violations, and they will hand them a court sentence if their guilt is proved. The situation with human rights in Turkey must be assessed in the context of the terrorism that the country has encountered. Terrorism is the chief enemy of human rights. Terrorism is not only in and of itself the most serious and large-scale form of violation of human rights, but it is also an obstacle to progress in the sphere of human rights. Thus, Turkey, by taking all measures for the struggle against terrorism within the limits of the observance of human rights, is fully resolved to liquidate this evil in order to protect the rights of its citizens. [Gagua] Not long ago you advocated the abolition of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Do you thing that Irak has fulfilled all the conditions enacted for this country by the world community, or were you guided by some other reason? [Demirel] When I turned to the question of United Nations sanctions against Iraq, I expressed the view that the sanctions have not led to positive changes, but, on the contrary, have brought the people a great deal of suffering. I also mentionedd the very heavy burden which Turkey continues to bear because of the sanctions. However, I also pointed to the fact that Iraq continues to fulfill the requirements advanced by the United Nations in order to again occupy a place in the world community. I emphasized the significance of Iraq's return into the world community, both for Iraq itself and for the entire region. In what way this will be attainedd must be decided within the framework of the United Nations. In conclusion of our conversation I would like to say that my message to Mr Yeltsin, transmitted through our prime minister, contains the wish for the successful completion of the reforms in Russia. The attention of the entire world is now riveted on Moscow. If Moscow continues to be trusted, this will only be to its benefit and advantage. I wish Russia the successful completion of the transition from a communist state to a democratic state, from Marxist to a market economy. We know that this is not easy. But Turkey wishes Russia success, perhaps more than any other country in the world.
