The isolation process identifies problems in plant equipment during maintenance and requires extensive preparation and management. This system was designed to prevent errors from occurring during the isolation process, and to reduce labor costs and waste, and speed up data retrieval. This system can centrally control the isolation procedure and the reactor's equipment. It can also display the status of individual pieces of equipment on a workstation. This comprehensive and easy-to-use system greatly improves the reliability and efficiency of isolation management. Foreword With the goal of establishing a nuclear fuel cycle to ensure energy for Japan, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) is working on technological developments for uranium exploration, uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, and on developing next-generation advanced power reactors such as the fast breeder reactor (FBR) and the ATR. Construction of the Fugen ATR power plant (hereafter, FUGEN) prototype[.sup]1[/] began in 1970, and it has operated normally since full-scale operation began in March 1979. So far, there have been 10 scheduled inspections and a great deal of modification and maintenance work. When doing inspection or repair work on FUGEN equipment, valves on either end of the equipment to be worked on are shut off to isolate the equipment from the system, and power is shut off and operating switches disconnected to prevent accidental operation of the equipment. This is called isolation. In scheduled inspections of power plants, which are required by law to be conducted annually, this isolation affects operation and many systems in a complex manner, so controlling the state of the plant is an extremely difficult task. This involves tens of thousands of operations per year, and it takes a tremendous amount of labor and time to carry out the various work involved in isolation. For this reason, the introduction of a system aimed at reducing and accelerating the work and increasing reliability was desired. In this article, we will discuss in summary form the isolation support system that was developed for FUGEN in response to this need. Basic concept study and pilot system development began in 1983, and the first version of the system was completed and put to use in 1988. Subsequently, the system has been used in three scheduled inspections; several system performance upgrades have been instituted; and user interface was improved by introducing the S family workstation in 1992. Development Goals Isolation Isolation refers to work that is done during facility inspection or repair to isolate the equipment being worked on from the plant by shutting off valves around the equipment or cutting off power. This is extremely important in terms of preventing breakdown of other systems, protecting equipment and the facility and ensuring operator safety. Figure 1 shows an example of isolation. When pump X is to be inspected, valve A, which is upstream of pipes connected to pump X, is turned to the "shut" position from the "open" position (normal operation). This stops water from flowing to pump X. Next, valve B, which is downstream, is turned to "shut" in the same way, and pump X is isolated from the plant. This operation implements the isolation, and then the equipment to be worked on (pump X) can be removed and inspected. After inspection is completed, the above steps are reversed to lift the isolation and restore normal operation. Figure 1: Isolation The following are isolation duties, the series of steps involved in carrying out isolation: 1. Isolation planning 2. Drafting of isolation plan list 3. Drafting of isolation execution note 4. Isolation execution 5. Drafting of isolation release note 6. Isolation release 7. Verification of isolation notes 8. Isolation management When drawing up an isolation plan, the range and steps involved must be checked for possible interference with other isolation plans (in which a different status is planned for the same period). Using the earlier example, if pump X must be left "on" for another operation, the inspection period for pump X must be adjusted so as not to conflict with this operation. The isolation execution note is affixed to the equipment on which isolation steps will be taken during isolation execution. The note consists of a management number and isolation status, so that it is clear at a glance what kind of work is to be done on that equipment. This will prevent accidental operation of the equipment for other tasks. The isolation release note is carried when doing work to return equipment to normal operation and lift the isolation. The isolation release note consists of a management number and restoration status. Therefore, by comparing the isolation execution note and the isolation release note, it can be confirmed that nothing was missed or leaked out when lifting isolation and restoring the system to its normal state. Possible interference with the isolation of other operations must be checked before carrying out isolation execution or release. Figure 2 is a conceptual outline of isolation duties. Figure 2: Flow of Isolation System Goals Isolation duties are relatively easy if few isolations are involved, but in cases such as scheduled inspections or planned shutdowns, where there are multiple isolations, it takes a lot of labor and time for management and for drafting various documentation (in a year, several hundred isolation lists and several tens of thousands of execution and release notes are issued). For this reason, an isolation support system has been introduced for FUGEN, with the goal of achieving the following improvements by enabling on-line processing of duties extending from isolation planning to isolation execution: 1. Improve thoroughness of operational management by unifying isolation data management. 2. Rationalize isolation plan by reference to recorded data and standard data. 3. Reduce isolation duties by automating documentation output and bar code reading. 4. Accelerate access to information by unified management of plant-related blueprints and other data. Additionally, for FUGEN, a maintenance management system (MMS) has been developed and implemented since 1979, for storage and retrieval of record data and maintenance management including preventive maintenance and detection of malfunctions. Within the MMS, there are management systems for the priority isolation duties, such as the operation and breakdown management system and the equipment ledger management system, and by linking these systems, management of isolation duties from the viewpoint of maintenance duties as a whole is possible. System Composition Figure 3 shows the composition of the isolation support system. Figure 3: System Composition This system is composed of a multipurpose large-scale computer M770/6 as the core with various types of terminals and workstations linked by local area network (LAN). The system base was built with AIM/DC (advanced information manager/data communication) application of M770/6, with unified management of various masters. The system also is set up for automatic reference to databases such as the operation and breakdown management system and the equipment ledger management system which are built on the AIM. Isolation execution and release notes are printed on a serial printer dedicated to documentation, and isolation lists are printed on an office printer. Blueprints are printed by plotter and Post Script printer.[.sup]2[/] Terminals used in the system can be divided into general terminals (such as FM R.VDS[.sup]3[/]) and workstations (S-4/2GX). From the general terminals, the isolation support system can be used online from a screen using the PSAM (presentation service access method). From the workstations, the isolation support system can be used online from the diagram displayed by the ICAD/SX[.sup]4[/] using the workstation library. Access from workstations is accelerated by using Informix[.sup]5[/] Online to control various master data files. Figure 4 shows a general terminal system use screen. Figure 4: Online Screen System Functions The isolation support system is composed mainly of the following functions: Isolation Plan Function In processing the isolation plan, the operations, operators and period needed for the plan can be retrieved from the operational and breakdown management system database by inputting the isolation management number. Then, by clicking on the symbols in the plant diagram that is displayed by workstation CAD, the equipment numbers of the equipment to be isolated can be designated in order, and the isolation status, etc., is typed in by menu, in the same order as the steps to be taken in the isolation work. When using a general terminal, the isolation plan is input in interactive format by directly typing in the equipment numbers of the equipment to be isolated. Additionally, to carry out the plan efficiently, standard and past performance isolation data can be referenced and incorporated. When registering isolation plan data, the system can check for data on times and execution status of other isolation plans. At this time, the isolation list is automatically issued as well. Figure 5 is a sample isolation list. Figure 5: Example of Isolation Lists Isolation Execution/Release Functions The execution note or release note will be issued automatically when the scope of isolation execution or release is designated after typing in the isolation management number. The execution note is in the form of a seal, which is affixed to a base tag that is tied with string to the equipment. Figure 6 shows sample execution and release notes. Information from the issued notes are treated as records and are used to reserve execution times and prevent overlapping with other isolation plans. Figure 6: Example of Execution Note On-site isolation work implemented in accordance with issued execution or release notes can be conveyed immediately by telephone to a central management room, and the scope of the isolation execution or release can be typed in from this information, thereby updating isolation data. Additionally, the execution note that is collected after isolation release can be checked against the release note by a bar code reader for verification. When isolation release is displayed, one can check to see if the whole isolation under that isolation management number has been carried out. If completed, the isolation data can be stored in the system as a record of isolation. Isolation Temporary Release Function If it becomes necessary to temporarily lift isolation from some equipment, all isolation management numbers, operations, operators and periods involving that equipment are displayed by typing the equipment number into the system. The displayed screen will have a column to confirm temporary release of isolation, and when a command confirmed against all isolation management numbers is typed into the system, a temporary release note is issued automatically, the system is notified of the temporary release, and isolation information is updated. When temporary release of isolation becomes unnecessary, isolation information is updated by selecting the command for full-scale release or reinstatement. Isolation State Release Freezing Function The isolation state freeze is applied when alteration by other operations of the isolation that is currently underway, such as an isolation with test conditions, is not desired. The freeze on isolation release has been set up only for high priority isolations, and is used to ensure that isolation will not be released unless the command to lift the freeze is typed in. By selecting the isolation management number to be frozen or the isolation equipment number, other isolation operations involving that equipment can be prohibited. To lift the freeze, selection is made in the same manner. Isolation State Management Function When using a terminal, isolation state or operational history can be searched, displayed, or printed by selecting the isolation management number or equipment number. Also, each isolation plan or isolation state by plant system is displayed visually by change of color of symbols in the plant diagrams through workstation CAD. Figure 7 [omitted] is an example of state management using a workstation. Symbols that change to green indicate that the equipment represented by that symbol is "shut" or "off" and symbols that change to red indicate that the equipment is "open" or "on." Master File Editing Function Editing of the master file, which manages isolation equipment data and standard isolation data, can be done efficiently by interactive processing. For isolation equipment, data can be extracted from the equipment ledger database of the equipment ledger management system, and for standard isolation, data can be extracted from record isolation data. Diagram Management Function When inputting the plant diagram, pipes and wiring configuration can be input automatically in accordance with equipment configuration, thus reducing the work of diagram inputting. Also, the symbols representing equipment (valves, pumps, circuit breakers, etc.) often used in plant diagrams can be recorded easily using basic CAD functions. Equipment numbers can be attached to symbols displayed on the diagram and based on this information, isolation plan processing and status management can be carried out with CAD. Additionally, plant diagrams can be output easily by selecting the necessary diagram from the diagram table. Backup Function The latest isolation status is transferred to the backup computer. Thus the latest isolation status can be confirmed by printing the contents of stored data in the backup computer even when the system has been shut down. Results and Problems To Address in the Future The following are the results of running this system with FUGEN: 1. Unified management of various types of isolations has made it possible to quickly discover lack of smooth operation and human error by checking for interference, and this has helped to tighten operational management. 2. By using pre-entered data on standard isolations and past isolations, it has become possible to plan isolations swiftly, and this has helped increase operational efficiency. 3. Automatic issuing of execution and release notes and isolation lists (total of several hundred thousand notes and several thousand isolation lists) and collective verification using the bar code reader has eliminated the massive amount of writing and checking that has been done until now, and this has helped reduce work. 4. Unified management of plant diagrams has facilitated acquisition of diagrams, and this has helped to accelerate operations. As for problems to address in the future, we plan to add the following capabilities: Visual display of isolation scope on the plant diagram, automatic generation of isolation steps, and retrieval of data on other systems from the plant diagram. This will further reduce the workload, accelerate operations and increase reliability. Conclusion This system has been successful in three scheduled inspections since 1988. In April 1992, it received the Science and Technology Agency Director General's award in recognition of originality and practical use before any other plant. It would be gratifying if the results of this system and experience with its use can contribute to further improvement of safe and stable operation of nuclear power plants. Finally, we express our deep gratitude for the guidance and cooperation that we received in developing this system. Footnotes 1.
