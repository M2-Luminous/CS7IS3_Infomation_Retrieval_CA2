This was stated by Viktor Stelmakh, head of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers' and presidential press service on 12 January in an interview with the NOVYNY Television and Radio Agency. He pointed out: It is not difficult to predict that both issues of bilateral economic relations and nuclear problems will prevail at the meeting. As has been underlined by the U.S. and Ukrainian sides, it is time the dialogue was expanded and not reduced to problems of nuclear disarmament. Attention should be paid to economic cooperation and bilateral ties. Viktor Stelmakh emphasized that given the importance of issues to be discussed on 12 January by Presidents Kravchuk and Clinton, the Ukrainian-U.S. summit will be of great importance for building mutual understanding between the two states and for the entire world community.
