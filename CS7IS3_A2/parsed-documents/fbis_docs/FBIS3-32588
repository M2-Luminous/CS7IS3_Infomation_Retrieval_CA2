The 14 associations, including the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry [CCIH], asked General Raoul Cedras to go into retirement and President Aristide to appoint a prime minister and lift the embargo. They also asked the UN Security Council and the OAS to immediately lift the embargo that they refer to as genocide, and to recognize the damages that this embargo has caused the country. The employers' associations have further asked the Armed Forces to guarantee the security of all legislators and to work on the formation of a new police force and the law separating the Army from the police, as provided for by the Constitution. In their statement, the Haitian employers had a special message for Gen. Cedras and President Aristide: [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] The employers' associations which, with an open mind, brought their support to the president of the Republic in July 1993 are today requesting from President Aristide, in compliance with Article 136 of the Constitution, the appointment of a new prime minister as soon as possible, in view of assuring the regular running of the state; the withdrawal of his request to impose an embargo, in order to put an immediate end to the resultant disastrous consequences; and to initiate a policy of social appeasement. To the legislative chambers, given that the role of the legislative chambers is to study and vote on the necessary laws and provisions for the efficient running of the state; given that they have the duty to defend the superior interests of the nation, the employers' associations request from the legislative chambers, first: the immediate cessation of the empty-seat policy and utilization of all indispensible measures for the running of the parliament and application of the Constitution; second, that the law of general amnesty be voted within six working days; third, that they immediately begin the procedure for ratification of a prime minister as soon as he is appointed, as provided for by the Constitution; fourth, that they formally make a commitment to study and vote the law on the creation of a police force, as provided for by the Constitution. Of the Haitian Armed Forces, in order to create confidence among the legislators and the entire nation, and to allow for a definitive release of the dramatic situation that is gripping the country, the employers' associations are asking the Armed Forces command, first, to formally reassert their commitment to guaranteeing the safety of the legislators in the fulfillment of their duties; second, to work with all concerned parties on the creation of the police force provided for by the Constituion; third, in collaboration with national interests and the international community, to work on the formation of a police force and on modernization of the Haitian Armed Forces. Of Gen. Raoul Cedras, they ask for reassertion of his request for retirement, effective immediately following passage of the law on amnesty. Of the UN Secruity Council and the OAS, considering that the embargo imposed by the international community constitutes genocide against a poor, defenseless, voiceless population; considering that the imposed embargo is contrary to human rights, as written in the UN charter, unfeasible to life, work, health and social service; considering the inestimable damage caused by this embargo to the environment; considering that it is necessary to compensate for the harm done by this unjustified embargo; considering the necessity of stopping the increasing distrust of the Third World countries toward the superpowers and powerful internatonal organizations, the employers associations urge the UN Security Council and the OAS; first, to lift the genocidal embargo; second, to recognize the damages caused the Haitian nation through the economic sanctions and to make a commitment to compensating them as soon as possible through some means that will guarantee boosting the national economy; third, to formally acknowledge to the private sector its commitment to see democracy implemented in Haiti through means other than the genocidal embargo that is odiously and unjustly punitive, not only to the innocent national majority, but also to the entire nation. In conclusion, the employers' associations are convinced that the application of these provisions should without a doubt immediately disentangle the political crisis. The unquestionable good faith of all Haitians is indispensable to a definitive solution to the crisis. The involvement of all social sectors is also indispensable to a long-term resolution of the structural crisis of the country, all of which are essential conditions for a definitive state of law, adaptable to a newborn democracy.
