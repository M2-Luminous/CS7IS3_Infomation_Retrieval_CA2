N. Alekseyev, Zoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg; UDC 591.522:576.895.421] [Text] Since the time of publication of Ye. N. Pavlovskiy's study [9] regarding the natural nidality of transmissive diseases, it has been conventional to classify vectors as primary and secondary. No consideration has been given heretofore to the mutual influence of vectors on each other and on the properties of pathogens that they carry in zones of overlapping or noncoincidence of the territories of such vectors. Among others, this applies to vectors of the pathogens of tick encephalitis (TE) and Lyme disease (borreliosis): ticks of the genus Ixodes (I. persulcatus and I. ricinus) of the Palaearctic. On European territories there are both zones of sympatry of their populations, and zones where circulation of each of the aforementioned pathogens is spread by only one species of the genus Ixodes, i.e. territories where the populations of these species are completely allopatric in virtue of the action of abiotic factors. It is taken as established that the most active vector of both the aforementioned pathogens on the territory of Russia is the taiga tick I. persulcatus [7, 10] with territory totally coincident with the region of prevalence of strains of the TE virus that are virulent for man. In some areas, e.g. in Moskovskaya Oblast, there are territories where populations of I. persulcatus and I. ricinus--vectors of borrelias (Borrelia burgdorferi)--are both sympatric and allopatric. Studies of 482 ticks of both species collected in this region in 1991-1992 have revealed that I. persulcatus was infected with borrelias in 28.7 percent of cases, and I. ricinus was so infected in 18.5 percent of cases. The TE virus was never once isolated in a virusological study of the same ticks. To ascertain the role of sympatry in spreading circulation of Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks of the species Ixodes, all data of occurrence of I. persulcatus and I. ricinus, as well as borrelias in them, were plotted on a map of rayons of Moskovskaya Oblast. As we can see from Fig. 1, the occurrence of I. ricinus is relatively uniform in this region, whereas findings of I. persulcatus are confined to its northeastern half. It was to this region that nearly all cases of detection of borrelias were confined, i.e. almost all of them were in the zone of sympatry. All cases of detection of TE, which is spread mainly by taiga ticks, are also confined to this region (VI on Fig. 1). Taken together, this suggests that not only are cases of isolation of pathogens from taiga ticks and people associated with the major role of I. persulcatus, but isolation of borrelias from I. ricinus sympatric with this tick also depends on the presence and behavioral specifics of the primary vector: the tick I. persulcatus.

Plus--presence of infected ticks; plus-minus--presence of both infected and uninfected ticks; 0--absence of concrrent species; infection of ticks was not observed in 1988-1990. In regions where both species of ticks were encountered (Fig. 1), occurrence of the pathogen B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus ticks clearly depended on the presence of I. persulcatus on the same territories, both uninfected (more precisely not found to be infected), and, in particular, infected. As can be seen from Table 1, infected I. ricinus are found in zones of sympatry 8.7-9 times more frequently than where I. ricinus has no concurrent species (p > 0.999). Borrelias in I. ricinus were isolated from allopatric populations in only one out of 12 regions where it is encountered without I. persulcatus, namely in the southwestern part of the region. Conversely, in regions where I. persulcatus occurs alone, the populations of this species of tick were infected with B. burgdorferi in 50 percent of cases. The extent of infection of I. ricinus in the sole allopatric population was 12.5 percent, whereas it exceeds 30 percent in populations that are sympatric with the taiga tick. The extent of infection of I. ricinus reached a maximum (50 percent) in the most northerly rayon--Taldomskiy Rayon (1 on Fig. 1)--where 80 percent of the collected ticks were I. persulcatus and the rate of infection of the taiga tick is close to maximum (about 40 percent). The rate of infection of I. persulcatus is significantly greater than for I. ricinus: from 44 to 1014 borrelias in 250 fields of view as compared with 1-41 for I. ricinus. Clearly the taiga tick is a more active and independent vector of borrelias, and the reason that the vector I. ricinus when sympatric with the taiga tick becomes a more active carrier, and apparently a vector of borreliosis, is that I. persulcatus is present on the same territories. Taken together, this suggests that the taiga tick is the source of a more acarotropic and virulent pathogen for I. ricinus. And this in turn suggests the hypothesis of existence of two races, perhaps even subspecies, of borrelias carried by different species of ticks: B. burgdorferi persulcati with the taiga tick as host, and B. burgdorferi ricini with I. ricinus as the vector. And as we can see from Table 1, transfer of the former to I. ricinus is more easily accomplished than transfer of B. burgdorferi ricini to I. persulcatus. We believe that the transfer mechanism itself is linked to changes in the behavior of infected individuals in response to markers of the external environment, as occurs with ticks infected with the neurotropic virus of TE [1-3], the more so as B. burgdorferi is also neurotropic [11]. By using a T-shaped olfactometer to separate ticks with respect to behavior in response to the scent of poplar, it was established that more than half of ticks of both species react positively to the scent in cases where borrelias are subsequently found in them. And only isolated infected individuals reacted negatively. Positive responses to scent were somewhat more pronounced In I. persulcatus, which may be due to their more massive infection and the greater effect of the pathogens on their nervous system. It cannot be ruled out that more active intermixing of ticks on hosts within plant communities in which isolated plants are attractants for infected individuals constitutes a basis for more active proliferation of borrelias among vectors in their zones of sympatry. The epidemiological significance of this factor must be taken into consideration, as secondary specific vectors in such zones play a much greater role than on territories that are only endemic with respect to their own species. Such are the patterns of coexistence of vectors in zones of permanent sympatry. However, the phenomenon of sympatry may also be temporary in cases where man brings in the three-membered parasitic system in its entirety into a territory with secondary vector, thereby temporarily upsetting the normal existence of allopatric populations. The territory of Crimea, where only I. ricinus is encountered, was free of TE in consequence of ancient man-made transformation of the environment [5]. Favorable conditions were maintained by the absence of a virulent pathogen in spite of the presence of hosts for ticks, and vectors of the western variety of TE: Ixodes ricinus. This was the situation until July of 1980, when the first patient was reported with antibodies to the antigen of the TE virus of the far eastern strain Sofyin 181. The antibody to TE of this strain has been identified in birds, mouse-like rodents and humans, and the TE virus is from ixodid ticks [4]. By the mid eighties, the TE clinic had already noted the western variety of the disease. Hence a nidus of TE has developed again in Crimea with a strain of the virus of far eastern type that is gradually losing its initial highly virulent properties, apparently because 34 wild pigs were flown in from Primorskiy Kray in 1957 to reestablish the species that had disappeared during wartime. The pigs were not exterminated and were trapped during the peak of activity of I. persulcatus ticks in active nidi of TE. When they were released in a game reserve, they created a temporary sympatry of the two Ixodes species together with a reservoir of the pathogen. The I. persulcatus rapidly perished, having formed an ephemeral population for the Crimean climate, and thenceforth the virus was circulated by I. ricinus alone, gradually spreading over the territory of the mountain forest region of Crimea, losing the properties of the highly pathogenic eastern strain of the TE virus due to the new vector and milder climatic conditions, but remaining antigenically close to the initial far eastern strain. Temporary ``hand-made'' has given rise to a stable nidus of TE in an allopatric population of vectors of the western variety of TE: Ixodes ricinus. The foregoing draws attention to the importance of the phenomenon of sympatry (even temporary) of carriers and vectors of more virulent strains (races, species) of pathogens with vectors that are secondary for operation of nidi of transmissive diseases, and assessment of their danger for man.
