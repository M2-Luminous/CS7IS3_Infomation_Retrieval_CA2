Mr. Kruglov said also that a meeting of the Russian and Belarusian customs committee chiefs would take place next week, in which the Russian side is going to insist on adherence to the treaty. However, Mr. Kruglov thinks, "the unification of customs systems" is proceeding best precisely with Russia's western neighbor: Only joint efforts of the CIS countries' customs services will make it possible to stifle smuggling. The CIS council of customs agency chiefs, which was set up by nine republics last December, has already reached agreements on the prevention of the illicit export of cultural values and a framework agreement on cooperation in customs matters. A similar document is being drawn up on illicit drug trading. As it insists on the integration of customs systems, Russia is pursuing an even more serious objective -- it is simply unable to set up and to control on its own the border that has emerged with the near-abroad countries. Regarding the Baltic states, things stand much worse. According to Mr. Kruglov, Russia has begun to set up a "real border" with the Baltic states. Moreover, both the Baltic states and Russia have imposed "for political reasons" the unfavored nation status in trade with each other. This means that Russian tariff rates on the border with the Baltics will double automatically, a move that will scarcely boost foreign economic activity in the region. Anatoliy Kruglov said that, as far as he knows, no new changes in import tariff rates have been planned; he thinks that "the golden mean" needs to be found in setting tariffs so that they will be both protectionist but not "prohibitive." As a matter of fact, the customs committee is not going to deal with tariff policy, as it has delegated this function to the customs-tariff council that is being set up within the Russian Government. The fiscal side to the tariff policy, however, will still fall under the committee's jurisdiction. [passage omitted]
