[passage omitted contained in referent item] Moreover, the heroic and courageous hawks of the air in the forces of both unity and protection of the constitutional legitimacy carried out with precise and high efficiency and with devastating blows the missions assigned to them in a number of sectors where the gangs of rebellion and secession showed some resistance. On various axes, the units of our Armed Forces are still receiving officers, noncommissioned officers [NCO's], and soldiers joining the ranks of the forces of unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy and declaring their condemnation of the secessionist and rebellious gang which revealed its blatant and destructive hostility to the people, the homeland, and Yemen's present and future. These officers, NCO's, and soldiers also stressed their principled and courageous standing in the trench of the solid defense of unity and of protecting both the constitutional legitimacy and all the achievements and gains of the Republic of Yemen. The forces of both unity and the legitimate and constitutional democracy continue to carry out their missions in terms of chasing the enemies of both the people and their unity--the despots of apostasy and secession as well as the gangs mortgaged to their inevitable destiny. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will help (the cause) of God, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly. [koranic verse]
