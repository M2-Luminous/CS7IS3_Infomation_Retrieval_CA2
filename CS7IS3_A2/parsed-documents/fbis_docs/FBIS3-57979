According to the minister, "the statements made on Bulgaria, the Romanian people, the Baltic states, Finland, Turkey, and other countries are unaccceptable." Zhirinovskiy warned Germany -- which denied him an entry visa -- that he would launch a "Third World War" if he ever came to power in Moscow, according to the weekly WELT AM SONNTAG. Zhirinovskiy announced that he would send "300,000 Russian troops" to Germany if he became head of government.
