The accrued total of goods and services produced by the country during that year reached $446 billion, indicating a growth of 4.96 percent compared to 1992. The expansion represents a real growth of 23.54 percent compared to the GDP of 1980, which closed the expansionist cycle registered throughout the 1970's. During the same period, however, the population increased 28.2 percent, which means that per capita income fell 3.7 percent despite the improvement of 2.97 percent registered last year compared with 1992. The growth of the 1993 GDP, compared with 1992, was attributed to the recovery of the mean real productivity index, which grew nearly 10 percent, the stability of employment levels, and a 9-percent increase in industrial production.
