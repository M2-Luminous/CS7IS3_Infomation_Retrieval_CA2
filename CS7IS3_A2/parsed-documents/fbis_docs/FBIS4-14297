In last night's session, the Assembly ratified the foreign currency bill. Under the new law, all individuals and corporations will be allowed to retain all their foreign currency earnings [rather than convert it into Egyptian pounds]. Assembly members stressed that this law will boost confidence in the Egyptian economy, encourage foreign and domestic investment, and stimulate the national economy. Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and foreign trade, told the Assembly that the law will benefit both importers and exporters. The minister added that the $16 billion that the Central Bank has in reserves measure the extent of the success of the country's economic policy. There is an oversupply of foreign exchange in Egypt and the new law will help bring about a balance between the supply and demand for foreign currency, Minister Mahmud stated.
