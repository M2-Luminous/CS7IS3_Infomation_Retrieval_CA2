Tsai] [Text] Manila, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Monday [25 April] pledged to reduce import duties on Philippine products by an average 18 percent during the first year of its entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The commitment was made after just three hours of tariff- reduction negotiations with the Philippines held at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Manila. Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade, headed a 13-member delegation at the meeting. Lin said the meeting was harmonious, and that the two sides agreed to hold further consultations to work out details of the agreement. This was Taiwan's first tariff-reduction meeting with any Southeast Asian country. Taiwan has held similar negotiations with Australia, [words indistinct], New Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States. Lin and his delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Tuesday to conduct similar talks with Malaysia. Bilateral tariff-reduction talks with GATT contacting parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to the Geneva- based world trade regulating body. Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of the year.
