During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for which it was acquired, the grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by RDA; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use for other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by RDA. User charges should be considered, if appropriate. (c) Disposition of nonexpendable personal property. When the grantee no longer needs the property as provided in paragraph 18(b) of this exhibit, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards: (i) Personal property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The grantee may use the property for other activities without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds. (ii) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The grantee may retain the property for other use provided that compensation is made to RDA or its successor. The amounts of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to current fair market value of the property. If the grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the grantee shall request disposition instructions from the original grantor agency. (iii) RDA shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the Agency's requirements. If no need exists within RDA, the General Services Administration Federal Property Management Regulations will be used by RDA to determine whether a need for the property exists in other Federal *agencies. RDA shall issue instructions to the grantee no later than 120 days after the grantee request and the following procedures shall govern: ( 1 ) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the grantee's request, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse RDA an amount computed by applying the percentage of the grantor participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. However, the grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses. ( 2 ) If the grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this exhibit, the grantee shall be reimbursed by RDA for such costs incurred in its disposition. ( 3 ) Property management standards for nonexpendable personal property.
