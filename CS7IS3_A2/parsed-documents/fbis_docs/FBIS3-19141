For some weeks now the international crisis-management scene has become tangibly more lively, more active, and thus more complicated. The main reason: Moscow has started to gain profile as a new foreign policy figure. This can be seen from Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's virtually hectic activities in the Bosnian conflict and in the crisis between Israel and the PLO. This new role of Russia's already has obvious consequences. It has made the United States give up its so far very passive foreign policy role under Clinton and pursue a constructive policy. It has become visible in the Bosnian conflict and in the efforts to restart the negotiations between Israel and the PLO in the Middle East. No matter how limited Yeltsin's possibilities may be because of his serious domestic problems, this new foreign policy dualism has positive aspects for international affairs. Competition is the best means on the international political scene for overcoming budding isolationist trends in Washington. Therefore, today's meeting between the two foreign ministers, Kozyrev and Christopher, in Vladivostok is of particular importance. One can expect important decisions on the course and progress in the Bosnian conflict and in the Middle East. For the Europeans there is good reason to reconsider their own role in view of this development. It is high time for them to develop their own predictable foreign policy position. If this is not done, they will remain at the mercy of others instead of being partners in the new game of international political forces.
