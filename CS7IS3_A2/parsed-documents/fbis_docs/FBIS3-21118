This new laser operates at high temperatures at low current and emits in the 1.3� band with high reliability. Because the laser provides stable operation even at high temperatures, there is no need for a cooler to control the temperature, which will lead to greater compactness and lower costs. Sample shipments will begin in January 1994, and Mitsubishi plans to produce 10,000 units per month beginning in April. The sample price will be ¥10,000. The operating current at high temperatures is only about 70 mA, which is half the current required by previous semiconductor lasers, and the threshold current for laser emission is 20 mA, which is only three-fifths that of previous models. Thanks to this reduction in operating current, Mitsubishi says that the unit will maintain stable operation at 85�C with an optical output of 10 mW for an estimated 20,000 hours or longer. Semiconductor lasers are used as light sources in optical communications, but they get very hot from the heat produced by nearby electrical circuits. Because the semiconductor lasers used in intercity trunk line systems have operating currents exceeding 100 mA at high temperatures, the lasers deteriorate from the high current. Therefore, when a communications system with an optical fiber line running to each house is created in the future, a semiconductor laser with high reliability and low operating current will be needed.
