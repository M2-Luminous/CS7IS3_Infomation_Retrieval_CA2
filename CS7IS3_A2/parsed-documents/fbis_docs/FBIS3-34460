[First unidentified speaker] The essential idea in the head of state's address was his announcement that Algeria had a specific policy and a clear plan to deal with the political crisis, and that it was in control of that process and firm in implementing the policy. This means that we have moved from the stage of diagnosis to the stage of treatment, and that the latter no longer needs further explanation. However, explanations will be made within the framework of the dialogue process which remains a firm option. [Second unidentified speaker] It is true that the head of state's address included the aforementioned policy. It seems that the policy is based on an essential idea, namely that the new authority is convinced that the political crisis could only be resolved through dialogue and the participation of all the national political forces, without exception. This statement restores hope after the effective parties' boycott of the national conference, the possible effects of which on the authority's position was feared by many people. However, it has become clear now that the political line declared by the head of state when he was only defense minister represents a strong and firm non-circumstantial conviction. This means now is the time for serious and real work with the parties. We now have to wait for the reactions of political forces. [First speaker] That is clear from the head of state's mention of the parties to the dialogue which boycotted the conference, describing them as hesitant. This means that he was careful to maintain the dialogue bridges with those parties. He also gave assurance regarding the future of the dialogue when he said: We are determined to continue the dialogue in earnest, and earnest dialogue will inevitably be rewarded. The head of state made a commitment to returning to a democratic electoral path. [Second speaker] As it is known, one of the fundamental issues in the dialogue generally is the participation of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. We are aware that before the address, officials confirmed that contacts made with the FIS to achieve that aim produced positive and encouraging results. The speech confirmed officially but indirectly that that group was interested in serious dialogue as much as other parties when Zeroual talked about national political forces without exception. We note that the head of state used the term political forces instead of political parties, maybe to remove obstacles in the way of the expected dialogue. Naturally, the serious dialogue mentioned by the head of state and demanded by the political forces would require a host of measures. [First speaker] Although the head of state did not announce them in his address as most people expected, we conclude that these measures would inevitably be adopted within the overall framework of the dialogue. Generally, these measures will concern the state of emergency and the concurrent events and the aftermath of the security situation. Naturally, holding a dialogue without exceptions and linking it to the previously announced contacts with effective figures representing the FIS, will necessarily lead to adopting measures regarding that tendency. The constitution authorizes the head of state to make appropriate decisions to ensure the success of the defined policy and the clear plan in dealing with the political crisis which Zeroual stressed in his address. Without doubt, the sooner all the sides work for the restoration of security, stability and peace of mind the sooner the aforementioned measures would be adopted and the crisis would be resolved. [passage omitted] [Second speaker] The new head of state is now pledging to make efforts to implement the economic reforms and carry them out in practice. The result expected from the reforms is to rid the economy of administrative and other obstacles, remove the monopolies exercised by the state over the economic process and provide opportunity to public and private sector economic initiatives. Indeed, we shall find that many people would say that there is nothing new in this and that it has been repeated since the debate on economic reforms began but the same problems still exist. This is absolutely true and the reason is very simple, namely the reforms have never been carried out. [passage omitted]
