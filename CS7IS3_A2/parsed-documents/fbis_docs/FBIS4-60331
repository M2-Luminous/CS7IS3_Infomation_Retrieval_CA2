While Pakistan in the context of its security environment is more concerned with the short range Prithvi missile, it is the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) Agni, that has a range of 2500 km and can carry a heavy payload, which, to an even greater extent, underlines India's aggressive defence posture. A missile of this type, in the presence of a high degree of accuracy, is significant not least because of its ability to carry nuclear warheads over a long range. This has caused even countries well beyond the region to question India's intentions. However, given the unfortunate history of conflict between India and Pakistan, the latter has felt more compelled to take defensive measures with regard to India's ambitious missile programme. Apart from attempting to develop indigenous missile technology to the best of its ability, Pakistan has incurred a small number of M-11 missiles from China. It has argued in response to US pressure on this score that the acquisition of these missiles does not violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCRL). However, the real issue here is that if Pakistan perceives a major threat to its security as a result of the imminent deployment of the Prithvi missile, it is bound to take steps that provide it with the minimum necessary level of deterrence. The matter is further aggravated when India's activities in this realm are seen in tandem with its ambitious and secretive nuclear programme. It is in this context that the Foreign Office spokesman has expressed legitimate fears. It is time for India to consider the cost of a prohibitively explosive race in the realm of missiles and nuclear weapons for the extremely deprived masses of the region. Neither country can really afford to enter into such a race. Certainly, Pakistan is already having to spend far too much on defence primarily because of India's continual enhancement of its already formidable defence capability as well as its aggressive stance, not just towards Pakistan, but the countries of the region, in general. Finding a solution to the nuclear issue in South Asia remains a difficult task not least as a result of India's intransigence in this regard. But, meanwhile, it would be eminently sensible if a beginning could be made on the missile front. If India were to restrain the production and deployment of missiles, it would contribute in bringing down the level of tension between the two countries and score an important confidence building measure that could possibly pave the way for progress on the more complex nuclear issue. Perhaps US policy-makers could take up the matter with the Indian prime minister on his upcoming visit to the United States. It would be even better, of course, if India were willing to make the issue a subject of meaningful bilateral negotiations with Pakistan.
