Unlike his predecessor, Gen. Tellefsen gives the impression of being a real soldier for whom the "Holy Bible" is the performance of his orders. In a steadfast military atmosphere, backed by a framed tourist propaganda advertisement for Macedonia and the horns of a reindeer from his homeland, we had talks with the general. He is far more retired from the public than his predecessor, but Gen. Tellefsen considers the preventive mission of the UN peacekeeping forces in Macedonia to be a very wise solution. From the discussions he has held with the state authorities of Macedonia, he concluded that they also consider the UNPROFOR presence to be a stabilizing factor in the country. [Tellefsen] The development of the UN mission so far has been very positive and I am really glad to inform you that the situation in the regions of the borders with Serbia and Albania is calm and stable. [Damovski] Knowing the Macedonian neighborhood, there are continual scenarios for the spread of the war. Is Macedonia threatened with war from any direction? [Tellefsen] For the time being, I can see no signs of a possible military threat to Macedonia from the regions under our observation. The challenges and problems we are facing are related to the border with Serbia. Lately, we have noted increased military activity on the Serbian side of the border. The Macedonian authorities have been informed about all that on a timely basis, as well as our Command in Zagreb. We have noted small groups of soldiers of the Serbian Army moving around the Macedonian border region. This is something that worries me. Stabilizing Factor [Damovski] In your latest statement for Macedonian Television, you said that there are 140 km of border between Macedonia and Serbia that are disputable. At least for now, both sides, that is the Macedonian authority and the previous UNPROFOR commander for Macedonia have said that only some minor sections of the border with our northern neighbor are disputable. Why do you think that such a great part of the border is disputable? [Tellefsen] The peacekeeping forces in Macedonia operate on the border in conformity with the border that was agreed as an inter-republic border in the former Yugoslavia in 1945. We started our operation knowing that only a small part of that border was disputable. However, our observations say that, until now, 140 km of the border has been infringed by Serbian soldiers. In that context, I visited Nis [in Serbia] recently, for a second meeting with the Serbian military representatives, in order to ask about the Serbian activities on the border. We had a really fruitful discussion with the Serbian military commander, who told me they were holding military exercises of the reserve staff. According to what he said, the presence of the reserve staff, who do not know the terrain well, was the reason for an increased number of border incidents. Nevertheless, it is clear that those exercises are not meant for any kind of preparations for military activities in Macedonia. Therefore, according to those incidents, it emerges that 140 km of the border are disputable. From my point of view, as well as from the point of view of the Macedonian authorities, there is only a small section of the border that is disputable. We reported all such border incidents by the Serbian soldiers on time, but our mandate does not give us the right to arrest those soldiers, therefore we only followed them and then we reported in detail to the Macedonian authorities. Of course, the fact that the border line has not been marked represents a problem to my soldiers, too. Our task is to avoid any critical situation on the border. We also agreed that the Serbian commander will inform me about any military activities in the border region on a timely basis. [Damovski] Did you inform the competent Macedonian bodies about this meeting? [Tellefsen] Yes, the Macedonian defense minister [Vlado Popovski] was informed about it, before and after the meeting. Perhaps we shall have to meet the Serbian side on other occasions. The military exercises are still under way, and if they do not stop soon I shall go to Nis again to ask about the exercises and about the possibility of establishing telephone contact. [Damovski] If you agree with the assessment that there is a great difference between the assignments of the peacekeeping forces on the territories of former Yugoslavia, what is your opinion about a change in the UNPROFOR mandate for Macedonia? [Tellefsen] The ways we operate in Bosnia, Croatia, and Macedonia are based on resolutions. The first resolution implied a traditional peacekeeping mission in Croatia in four zones, then the humanitarian operation in Bosnia followed, and then the preventive assignment, to stop the spread of conflicts to Macedonia. If we are looking for possible successes, I consider that we have learnt a lot from the UN operation in Macedonia. We have learnt that this is perhaps the ideal way of solving the problems. At the same time, a UN operation in former Yugoslavia without particular mandates would have its advantages -- the possibility of moving troops from one area to another, if necessary. For instance, every week, we send military observers from here to Bosnia, depending on the situation. Our mandate here is to be a stabilizing factor and to demonstrate the presence of UN forces. The presence of the multinational structure of UN soldiers in Macedonia demonstrates to the world and the neighboring countries that the world community wants Macedonia to be independent. Therefore, our stay here represents a great experience for us. [Damovski] Have the Macedonian Government or UNPROFOR Command proposed a change to the mandate of the peacekeeping forces in Macedonia? [Tellefsen] We are holding continual discussions about the mandate, particularly before the end of the six months' period of the agreement with the country. The last time was in March when we extended the mandate of 1 April in conformity with the situation in Macedonia -- by Article 12 of Resolution 908, Mr. Akashi has the authority to use his "good services to contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in this republic." This is a somewhat broader than the operation of the military forces on the borders with Serbia and Albania. From my meetings with representatives of the Macedonian authorities, I can conclude that their opinion is that the mandate should remain unchanged. I Do Not See a Threat From Greece [Damovski] We have heard several requests by the Democratic Party of the Serbs in Macedonia for the arrival of Russian soldiers within the framework of the UN forces in Macedonia. What is your opinion about this request? [Tellefsen] According to the present UNPROFOR mandate in Macedonia, the present number of troops is quite sufficient. The combination of the troops from the Nordic countries together with the U.S. contingent, from what is probably the most powerful military force in the world today, is really good. I do not find it necessary to change the configuration of the UN force. [Damovski] The same party recently released some "confidential information" about the arrival of 2,000 Turkish troops in Macedonia, again under the command of the United Nations!? [Tellefsen] Nobody has discussed that with me. I have no information about that. [Damovski] I can conclude that, for you, it is very important to maintain the multinational structure of the blue helmets in Macedonia. Yet, after the arrival of 500 U.S. troops, that structure has been quite disturbed. [Tellefsen] That proportion has been now balanced -- we have around 500 U.S. troops and the same number of soldiers from the Scandinavian countries. We should maintain that proportion. [Damovski] Are there any problems with the U.S. troops in the coordination and command? [Tellefsen] No. I am impressed with the way the U.S. troops succeeded in fully accomplishing the UN peacekeeping mission. Usually, a soldier is trained for work in war conditions. However, it is even a greater challenge for each soldier to operate in a peacekeeping mission. [Damovski] With the arrival of the U.S. troops there were rumors about the establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia. The great size of the U.S. military delegations just heated these stories. Is there any truth in these rumors? [Tellefsen] As far as I know -- no. After taking over the command in Macedonia, I have had meetings with quite a number of U.S. delegations. We never mentioned such a possibility during those discussions. [Damovski] Do you find it necessary to construct a NATO base in Macedonia? [Tellefsen] Knowing the situation here -- no. Tension should be decreased here, not increased. [Damovski] Does it mean that, in your opinion, the establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia would increase tension in the region? [Tellefsen] In the present situation -- yes. [Damovski] Why? [Tellefsen] Aware of the fact that the 250 km of the border with Serbia is related to a state that does not recognize Macedonia, the construction of a NATO military base here could be taken as a threat. We know that the Macedonian military forces are not capable of facing the Serbian military.... Therefore, I think that it would not be a wise action. As far as I know, the Macedonian authorities are directed toward the CSCE and to Macedonia's membership in the European structures. [Damovski] Macedonia has not been recognized by Greece yet. Does it mean that military threats can be also expected from that side? Have you ever viewed the possibility of shifting a number of your soldiers to the Macedonian-Greek border? [Tellefsen] No. I see no military threat from Greece. So far, there have not been any discussions about shifting the peacekeeping forces to that part of the border. I see the problem with Greece as an economic problem and a problem related to the name and flag. Such problems should be solved by diplomats and politicians, not by soldiers. [Damovski] Here is a hypothetical question. If Macedonia is attacked militarily, what will your orders to your soldiers be? [Tellefsen] If I am the commander in such a situation, I would like to see another kind of UN military forces. However, today we are a tiny blue line drawn alone the border region with Serbia and Albania. We are here to observe and inform, not to arrest, fight, or defend the borders of Macedonia. If we are faced with such a situation, then some other UN military forces will be present here. I cannot see anybody preparing to attack Macedonia. If there are such preparations, there will be many signs of that. However, for the moment, there are no such signals. Any attack against Macedonia would also mean killing soldiers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the United States, and from 25 other nations.... Everybody should take that fact into account!
