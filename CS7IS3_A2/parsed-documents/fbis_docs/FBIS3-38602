The risks of "skidding" off course appear to be diminishing. How can a country so far removed from the diplomatic and economic criteria of the European Community serve as a center of initiatives during its Presidency of the European Union? During an official visit to Athens today, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe would like to be given some assurances. Admittedly, the strong anxiety prevalent in Brussels regarding the six-month term of Greek administration has diminished somewhat. After several explosive statements -- aimed primarily at German Chancellor Kohl -- the government under Andreas Papandreou is now displaying a spirit of conciliation. Greece must serve as a "bridge" between the Balkans and the Twelve, assured newly elected Socialist Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou on 23 October 1993 during his inaugural speech before the Parliament. Words, uttered in the wake of an impassioned electoral campaign, matched by statements on the "defense of national integrity and the consolidation of Hellenism." Which ultimately boils down to the Macedonian question, and the quarrel regarding the name of the Republic of Skopje. The establishment of diplomatic relations by the Twelve at the end of December, just before the Greek Presidency, will in fact have helped to defuse the situation. Andreas Papandreou has just announced his desire to resume negotiations with Skopje, and the nationalist virulence has dropped a key. The de-escalation is such that the conflict has almost deteriorated into deciding the question of flags. On Track for Enlargement Consequently, the pact of stability sought by France to stabilize the respective borders and protect the relevant minorities -- the conference has been scheduled for May -- should be well received. Anyway, Athens remains pro-Atlantic above all, and their U.S. ally is particularly cherished -- even if only to checkmate Turkey. Joint actions in the name of common foreign and security policy are also planned, vis-a-vis South Africa or Russia for example. Furthermore, formal accession to the WEU [Western European Union], the armed wing of the Union, is well on the way. The main concern in the treatment of more specifically "European Union"-related dossiers is enlargement, i.e., the candidacy of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Athens subscribes to the main principle, namely that the Community's achievements should be respected. The Greek Presidency also intends to accelerate negotiations aimed at keeping to the 1 March deadline. The only point of friction is the Greek Government's decision to create a committee of wise men to lay the foundations for the major institutional reform planned for 1996. Paris fears it will proceed along false trails and come up with formulae favoring the...small countries. The "large" countries are currently drawing up a strategy aimed at avoiding any drifting or impasse. Germany, France, and Spain, which will follow Greece with their subsequent presidencies, intend to constitute a triumvirate in an attempt to ensure that the chosen strategies are continued in the long term. When it comes to the respective interests of the two capitals, Alain Juppe has no particular grievances. The Greeks are rather firm when it comes to launching protective procedures, and agriculture does not really lend itself to a row. So should he allow himself to be seduced by Greek goodwill? Alain Juppe will test its robustness in the course of his talks. Incontestably, the international image of the Greek Government and of its leader is not very strong. When he last left office, Andreas Papandreou left behind a virtually bankrupt country, merrily flouting any budgetary discipline. Financed primarily by the European Union -- the net transfers from Brussels represented approximately 20 percent of Greece's net foreign currency receipts -- Athens ought to undertake to respect a European code of good conduct. At least until the end of June.
