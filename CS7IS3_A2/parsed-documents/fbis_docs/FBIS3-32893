Mendiandua: "Territorial Self-Sufficiency"] [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Self-sufficiency in animal protein and increases in agricultural production in the municipalities are other alternatives that Cubans are testing to increase their consumption and improve the quality of the food supply. The project's goal is to foster a broad self-sufficiency program in agricultural products in each administrative political unit. The programs will be under the supervision of the people's councils, the power organizations in each territory. In the short term the goal is to achieve 24 grams of animal protein for each inhabitant as a complement to the nation's production system. This is in addition to developing agrarian exploitation in marginal areas, according to what Humberto Muniz, agriculture and fishing director of the Academy of Science, explained to PRENSA LATINA during an interview. This level of protein, superior to those currently existing in most Latin American nations, should be obtained by mixing the natural resources available at each site. This is particularly true of those that serve as the basis for animal feed, added Muniz, identified as one of the program's organizers. The search for territorial self-sufficiency arose as a strategic need of the nation in the event the island were militarily blocked during a war and the possibility of receiving supplies from abroad decreased to zero. Given the sudden crumbling of the European socialist bloc, with which 85 percent of economic trade was carried out, Cubans were left without supplies of fertilizers, pesticides, and feed that originated from that area. This produced serious setbacks in local production and foreign trade. Faced with this situation, the nation had to step up efforts and initiatives aimed at replacing foreign supplies and reactivate its production. This was particularly true of agricultural production as a source of food and industrial raw materials. Territorial self-sufficiency, adapted to the current special period in peacetime, is an alternative to the nation's production system, and its results will directly benefit the people in the region where it is applied. The project is based on the state-of-the-art use of the natural resources in each area of the nation and the use of idle areas. In the economic aspect it is based on applying incentives for work productivity, the agriculture engineer indicated. There are places where self-sufficiency in milk is being achieved with the construction of small dairy farms (microvaquerias), while pisciculture is encouraged through the delicate reproduction of tilapia [African fresh water fish], "tecnas," or other river, lake, or dam species by making use of industrial residues. This last alternative serves the productive goals and removes contamination from the environment. This benefits the area and strengthens the incentive system on which the project's success is based. Each region draws up its own strategy in keeping with its possibilities, production potential, or eating traditions and only receives technical assistance from the state's central levels. The project leaves room for individual or collective initiatives and for creativity in searching for ways to meet the food supply demand within the municipalities, allowing savings in transportation, fuel, and material resources in general. This encompassing movement proposes to stimulate and include the self-sufficiency systems that exist in the schools, state enterprises, and with small producers. The goal is to make rational use of the natural resources available on a regional level. To achieve this perfection, research is conducted on the current variables such as raising pigs outdoors, porcine enclosures, collective pig raising farms, raising chickens in backyards, and raising fish in ponds. There is also work on the use of agricultural waste, food recycling, and using all sources of food available, together with a broad dissemination program. Seed production and animal breeding are also part of the program in each region as a basic element to guarantee the whole system. Likewise, there is hard work to eliminate the traditional dependency on fuel by using animal transportation, renewable power, and non-conventional sources. With regard to organization, the method consists of achieving an adequate balance between what is produced and what is for direct or social consumption by the people, thereby stimulating efforts made by each region in keeping with the increase in their levels of production. Although the whole project is based on craftsmanship methods of production, many initiatives are encouraging incorporation in the scientific and technical fields to seek efficiency and better economic results, according to its organizers. Currently, while the project's implementation progresses, the most diverse technical systems and the most adequate distribution methods are being studied, and the exchange of information among territories is encouraged. Some of the most commonly asked questions are: How do we make popular and develop community farming? How do we get the maximum use out of various animal species? What organizational structure should be given to the self consumption activity in each municipal or people's council.
