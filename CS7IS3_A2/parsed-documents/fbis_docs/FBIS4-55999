This is their fourth meeting, but this time it is an informal meeting. Mr. Berisha and his wife welcomed President Gligorov and his wife in the governmental residence of Pogradec city. The two presidents dwelt mainly on cooperation between the two countries and the situation in the region. Later, Berisha and Gligorov made statements for the press. Considering the meeting as very warm and friendly, Berisha said that: "Our conversation was open and friendly. We especially discussed cooperation between our two countries and agreed to make efforts to develop this cooperation further. We discussed the broadening of communication links and the establishment of the airline as a success in this relation. Both parties consider as necessary the signing of a series of other agreements, such as that of commodities' and passengers' transportation and that of connecting the two countries by a railway. Albania is ready to offer and has offered facilities to the Macedonian party for deposits up to 1,5 million tons of fuel in the Albanian ports as well as facilities for one million of other commodities. We also consider as very important the lifting of visas on both border areas at a distance of 20-25 kilometres, as it will be judged by the experts and this will be a first step towards the complete removal of visas. "The signing of a series of other agreements on economic cooperation, on guaranteeing investments will help the two countries promote cooperation and develop friendly relations. "We also discussed political relations and the situation in the region. I personally hail President Gligorov's efforts in realizing the census and materializing the law on the census in Macedonia. Also, I hail his efforts in broadening the freedoms and rights of Albanians in this republic. The daily publication of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, the determination to enlarge the mass media, the opening of the faculty for teachers in Skopje, the enlargement of the middle school system, will increase the role of the Albanian factor in the stability and development of Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of the Albanian political forces to the stability of Macedonia and governmental coalition. "As regards developments in the region, both countries are determined to work for their integration into Europe and the European and West institutions. Both countries are resolute to overcome difficulties through dialogue. Cooperation between Albania and Macedonia is not only a bilateral but also a regional contribution." Macedonian President Gligorov spoke at first on possibilities to develop cooperation between the two countries and stressed that "It is not normal for the two countries not to be connected by a railway. This way of transportation as well as the possibility offered by the Albanian party for the exploitation of its ports, will help develop cooperation between the two neighbouring countries." President Gligorov declared before the reporters the predisposition of the Macedonian state to sign agreements between the two countries. "The agreements, he said, will consist in economic cooperation, guarantee of each other's investments, removal of double taxation, cultural cooperation and joint care for safety in the border, which allow the citizens of both countries to move freely to each other." Concerning the Balkans, Gligorov said that "We have many reasons to try to maintain stability and peace in the region. It is to our merit that Albania and Macedonia were not involved in the conflict." President Gligorov considered the realisation of the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a possibility for removing any kind of disagreement and considered the census as indispensable. He assessed the cooperation between the two countries as "Successful and with sure prospects." After the dinner, Presidents Berisha and Gligorov, together with their wives, went for a visit to the city of Ohri.
