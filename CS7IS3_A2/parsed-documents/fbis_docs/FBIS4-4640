FBIS4-4640 "dreas064_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 South Korea Reaction to UN Security Council Statement Noted Reaction to UN Security Council Statement Noted Papers Comment on Statement SK0204084894 SK0204084894 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 2 April commenting on the UN Security Council's adoption of a president's statement on the North Korean nuclear issue. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Aftermath of the 'President's Statement." The editorial first describes the president's statement as the "first stick," because the statement contains the UN Security Council's "clear will" to demand that North Korea receive nuclear inspections. The editorial adds that North Korea must know it will be a "loser" if it thinks it still has time to "maneuver." The editorial writes: "If North Korea continuously uses its nuclear card, the international community will become more and more wary of North Korea. North Korea must be trustworthy if it wants economic cooperation with the international community. North Korea has given rise to nuclear suspicions and, thus, tarnished its image. This is tantamount to destroying a basis for economic cooperation." The editorial continues that it is time the government sincerely goes through a reexamination, writing: "It must no longer be lured by optimistic or romantic approaches." The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "Aftermath of the UN Security Council President's Statement." The editorial first advises that North Korea "will not ignore" the statement on the grounds that the statement is nonbinding. The editorial then asks North Korea to "pay attention to" the UN Security Council recommendation that North-South negotiations be resumed to implement the joint denuclearization declaration. Referring to the U.S. media report that it is all right even if special envoys are exchanged during or after the DPRK-U.S. talks, the editorial writes that "this idea will only satisfy North Korea, which pursues a policy of thoroughly excluding South Korea from all negotiations." The editorial finally asks the ROK Government to "maintain consistency" in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, instead of running about in confusion. The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "UN Security Council Statement." The editorial writes that as a result of the adoption of the statement, the "ball is again in North Korea's court." It says: "It is clear that the UN Security Council will seek the adoption of a resolution on sanctions against North Korea if North Korea does not receive nuclear inspections. Therefore, time will not always be on the North Korean side. Because North Korea's efforts to indefinitely resist the pressure has its limits, it must know that the sooner it decides to receive nuclear inspections and resume North-South dialogue, the more beneficial it will be." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "It is Time China Persuades North Korea To Receive Nuclear Inspections." The editorial first expresses its discontent over China's excessive protection of North Korea regarding the nuclear issue and refers to China's responsibility for this issues. It writes: "China preferred the adoption of a statement, a moderate approach, at the UN Security Council, while insisting on dialogue, and our country and the world accepted China's idea. Therefore, complying with the spirit of the statement, China must persuade North Korea to accept the international community's demand before the UN Security Council resumes deliberations and adopts a resolution on sanctions." The editorial concludes: "North Korea will not be able to go scot-free [musa halsu opta] without ensuring nuclear transparency. It would be wise to accept the UN recommendation and China's persuasion." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "Government's Chaotic 'Solution' to the Nuclear Problem." The editorial first describes the chaotic situation regarding the North Korean nuclear issue due to the ROK Government's frequent changes in policies. Referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry's remarks that the United States would prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons even if it requires that the United States wages another war on the Korean peninsula, the editorial asks who will pay the price for such a war. Commenting on the government's position that the statement will express the international community's view on the North Korean nuclear issue to North Korea, the editorial asks the ROK Government to solidify its basic policy on the North Korean nuclear issue.
