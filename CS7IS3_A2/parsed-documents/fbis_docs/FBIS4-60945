He also approved the main directions of the program for this study. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this today by the press service of the president of the Russian Federation. According to this information, the main directions of the research program comprises six sections, the priority one being the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation following the adoption of the new constitution of the Russian Federation. It was noted that first and foremost it was necessary to ensure that such principles of a rule-of-law state as the state being bound by law, the supremacy of law, the guarantee of human rights and freedoms, the division and mutual restraint of powers are consistently executed in the constitutional and present legislation of the Russian Federation. Preparation of a whole package of legislation on social and legal protection for citizens is urgently needed now that Russia is a social-oriented state. This is said in the section called "The Individual in the World Today -- State Guarantees of Constitutional Status" of the document on basic directions. It stressed that confirmation of the individual, his rights and freedoms, is a supreme value in the Russian Federation. This, along with the recognition that the state's main obligation is to protect the rights and freedoms of the individual and the citizen predetermine the necessity to perfect existing legislature and to work out and adopt new normative acts (which are either directly envisaged by the constitution of the Russian Federation, or are implied by them). Further work on a federal anti-crime program is considered extremely important along with the adoption of a new criminal and civil procedure code, of a code on abuse of office, of laws against organized crime and corruption - needed to protect the individual from criminal arbitrariness. The research program draws attention to the fact that the institute of president, of head of state in Russia has acquired new state and legal substance. A parliament - a Federal Assembly - has been formed. The legal status of the Government, its place in the division of power, has been fundamentally changed. Judicial reform is under way, aimed at transforming the court into a genuinely independent "branch" of state power. One of the priority tasks of legal reform is to make federal state power an institution in legislation. In this sphere, it is necessary, it says in the political and legal research project, to work out and adopt such acts as a Law on the Government of the Russian Federation, a law, or general clause, on federal ministries, state committees and other federal bodies of executive power (including territorial), laws on the bases for setting up executive power bodies within the components of the Russian Federation, on federal bureaucracy, the judicial system, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and a number of other laws. Seeing Russia as a federative state based on the principle of the unity of the basic parts of the state system, on the principle of equality between the entities of the Russian Federation, of the supremacy of federal law, it is proposed that we also work out and adopt a number of laws, in particular, on the procedure for changing the constitutional status of an entity of the Russian Federation, on forming a new entity of the Russian Federation, and on registering a new entity in the Russian Federation. The authors of the program believe the Russian Federation should set out in legislation the principles for delimiting the areas of authority and the terms for mutual delegation (transfer) of power "along vertical lines," from the federation to entities within the federation and the other way round. The idea has been put forward of transforming the territory of the former USSR into a single humanitarian area, where the rights of the Russian-speaking population - in countries of the "near abroad" - are guaranteed. Such an area would help solve the problem of forced migration. A Eurasian Commission for Human Rights and a Eurasian Court of Human Rights could serve as instruments supporting such a legal structure, the authors of the basic directions believe. They also say a Eurasian Charter (Convention) of human rights and rights of peoples should be prepared and adopted. The research program also attributes importance to the Russian state's economic role and to Russia's role in the world community.
