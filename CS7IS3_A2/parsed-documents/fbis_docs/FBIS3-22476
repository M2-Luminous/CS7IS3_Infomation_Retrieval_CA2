Dr. J.S. Dakora, Director of the University Health Services, told me here yesterday, that "the situation is perfectly under control and there is no cause for alarm." He said two students who were admitted to the Contagious Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Kumasi, following an attack by the disease, had been treated and discharged. Dr. Dakora was convinced that the affected students, both freshmen who hailed from Accra and Cape Coast and resident at the Independence and Unity Halls, might have contracted the disease at home. As a routine and part of measures aimed at checking the spread of the disease, all the halls of residence had been fumigated, he said. Food vendors operating at the campus had also undergone medical screening to weed out those with chronic and contagious diseases. In addition, factory inspectors had been taxed to ensure that food vendors operated under proper hygienic conditions.
