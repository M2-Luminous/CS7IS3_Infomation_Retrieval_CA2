This year's anti-corruption drive will be more firmly and thoroughly carried out, said Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Party Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Wei, also a member of the party's Politburo and Secretariat, made the remarks at the opening of the commission's third plenary session, which lasts for a week. He said that leading officials at and above county (division) levels must strictly follow the rules concerning the building of a clean government made by the party Central Committee and the State Council. At today's session, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection set a package of five requirements for leading officials to keep clean and honest: -- No-one is allowed to violate regulations and buy or change to imported and luxury cars, or use power to change with and borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units, or collect money from them for buying cars; it is not allowed to buy cars for leading officials with loans, money gathered from people and funds for special projects; party and government administrations and units above county level which still owe wages to staff are not allowed to buy cars. -- No-one is allowed to run against the regulations of the State Council on reforming the housing system and buy houses at prices lower than promulgated, or use power to provide preferential treatment for spouses, children, relatives or friends, or decorate private houses lavishly with public funds. -- Leading officials should attend domestic public activities in a simple manner; their accommodation should not exceed the local criteria for reception and no special dance parties should be organized for them. -- No-one is allowed to organize lavish activities and spend without restraint at occasions of marriage, funeral, change of jobs, birthday and moving to new housing, either for oneself or family members. Using public money and materials for such activities or earning money through these occasions are especially forbidden. -- No-one is allowed to mis-use power and refuse to return public money, or buy or build houses with public money for oneself, relatives and friends, or engage in profitable activities. Addressing the meeting, Wei Jianxing said that China has made big headway in the struggle against corruption since the holding of the second plenary session of the commission last August. However, he pointed out, the fight against corruption remains a protracted and arduous task that should be unremittingly carried on. He said investigation into and crack-down on major cases involving corruption of leading officials at various levels will still be put on top of the agenda in 1994. The commission will known [as received] to the public typical cases of corruption. Efforts will be made further to check unhealthy tendencies of random collection of fees and using public money for overseas tours. Problems such as officials and employees acquiring cars and computers through unfair means will be probed, while burdens of farmers will be further alleviated. While stepping up the fight against corruption, Wei said various discipline inspection bodies should strengthen supervision over enforcement of the law.
