Laar affirmed that the government has repeatedly analyzed the decrease in retired persons income due to inflation and price rise, and has prepared a bill on increasing retirement benefits that should reach Riigikogu by April 1. At present the pension is approximately 300 ($21) kroons, depending on the years of labour, per month. Prime Minister said that increase of pensions would demand an additional 200 million kroons (about $14 million) to increase pensions by 50-60 kroons ($4). He said that the situation could possibly be solved by dividing the social tax, which at present is 20 per cent for companies, between the employers and the employees, a move, which is not supported by the social committee of the parliament. Also turnover tax or excise duty on tobacco and alcohol could be increased a couple of per cent or the tax payment control increased by Tax Board, which, however, demanded higher budget for the board. Prime Minister added that it might be possible to substitute the retirement benefits by pension insurance in the future.
