FR940603-2-00138 FR940603-2-00088 Research and Special Programs Administration [Preemption Determination No. PD&hyph;7(R); Docket No. PDA&hyph;12(R)] Maryland Certification Requirements for Transporters of Oil or Controlled Hazardous Substances AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of Administrative determination of Preemption by RSPA's Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. APPLICANT: Chemical Waste Transportation Institute and National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. STATE LAWS AFFECTED: Code of Maryland Regulations 26.10.01.16.D and 26.13.04.01.F. APPLICABLE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS: Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq., and the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR), 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180. MODE AFFECTED: Highway. SUMMARY: Maryland regulations requiring certification of operators of motor vehicles loading or unloading oil or ``controlled hazardous substances'' in Maryland are preempted by 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2) as they apply to operators of vehicles transporting hazardous materials not domiciled in Maryland. These requirements are stricter than operator training requirements promulgated under the HMTA, and therefore are obstacles to accomplishing the full purposes and objectives of the HMTA. As applied to operators domiciled in Maryland, the requirements are not preempted. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles B. Holtman, Office of the Chief Counsel, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001, telephone number (202) 366&hyph;4400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Application for Preemption Determination On April 19, 1993, the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI) and the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) jointly applied for a determination of preemption pursuant to 49 CFR 107.203. The CWTI/NTTC application seeks an administrative determination that the HMTA preempts State of Maryland certification requirements for operators of vehicles loading or unloading oil or ``controlled hazardous substances'' in Maryland. On May 19, 1993, RSPA published a Public Notice and Invitation to Comment, providing for comments until June 23, 1993, and rebuttal comments until August 29, 1993. 58 FR 29322. Eight transporters of oil, hazardous waste or hazardous materials, one transporter association and one environmental services firm submitted comments supporting preemption of one or both sets of certification requirements. The Maryland Department of the Environment, Waste Management Administration (MDE), submitted comments opposing preemption of the requirements for operators of oil transport vehicles, but took no position on the requirements for operators of controlled hazardous substance transport vehicles. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Hazardous Materials (MassDEP), submitted comments opposing preemption in part. CWTI/NTTC submitted rebuttal comments responding to those of MDE and MassDEP. A. Maryland Requirements for Operator Certification The two provisions of Maryland law for which CWTI/NTTC request a determination of preemption impose certification requirements on operators of motor vehicles used to transport oil or ``controlled hazardous substances.''
