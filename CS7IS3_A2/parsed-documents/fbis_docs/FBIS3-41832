The negotiations concluded successfully, Londono assured PRENSA LATINA at the end of his visit to the island, which lasted from 2 to 11 January. Londono said the agreement signed with his Cuban counterpart, Julio Teja, could double the initial amount involved before the end of the first half of 1994. We predict that these purchases will double or triple within the next two years, Londono added. Although the minister gave no details, he suggested that such acquisitions of medicine and services could help Cuba pay its debt to Colombia, which unofficial Colombian sources estimate at about $45 million. Londono pointed out that this form of payment would "give way to a revolution, to a debt-for-health swap, which I think would be a major innovation in Latin America." In addition to these purchases, Londono added, we also reached agreements on exchange and technical assistance programs by which Cuban specialists will cooperate in primary care services, epidemiological programs, and medicine control. The Colombian minister pointed out that his visit surpassed his expectations because the host party was more willing to negotiate and cooperate than he had expected. Londono added that they identified a number of possible joint ventures that will create an aggressive and positive exchange system. The minister said he hopes the ties that were established will prove durable and will lead Colombia to adopt the advantages of the Cuban health system under conditions applicable to that country. As for the agreement that was signed, Londono emphasized that "he expects a successive link of strong trade relations in the health sector, as well as in the economic, industrial, and agricultural sectors." The Colombian minister described his visit to Cuba as very enriching for Colombian society because he acquired detailed information about the operation of the local health system and about the things that could be useful to his country.
