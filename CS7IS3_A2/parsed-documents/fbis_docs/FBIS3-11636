The president visited this newspaper and affirmed that no means of communication will be closed nor censure imposed during his government. Wasmosy visited ABC COLOR at 0745. At that time, company employees were commemorating the 10th anniversary of the closing of the newspaper and the 5th anniversary of the day it was reopened. The president brought his greetings to our newspaper and said: "In the consolidation of democracy, I think that freedom and democracy are closely linked. Therefore, without your needing to ask me about it, I can assure you that I have broad shoulders and consider criticism positive, even though I sometimes think it unfair. The best way to consolidate democracy is to respect total freedom of the press." Referring to press freedoms in our country, the president said: "Time and the readers will have the final word in choosing which is the most credible source. This is like passing through a fine sieve, because the truth moves slowly, but it prevails in the end. I thank you for your constructive criticism. That is the best way to cooperate with the government." The president said: "In a democracy, responsibility does not lie on a single person's shoulders; in a democracy everyone is responsible. We must agree on the kind of Paraguay we want, and work for it. We must avoid doing things that are not very clear and which perhaps seek transitory victories, or revenge, or somehow distort what we really want for our country." "Newspapers must help the public form an opinion. We must be conscious that our rights end where other people's rights begin. I think there is no better way to solve our problems than through dialogue and consensus," the president said. In metaphorical language the president then added: "I will take advantage of this opportunity to say that democracy is like the decreasing water level of a lake. At first you do not see what is below. For instance, we cannot see what is lying on the bottom of Ypacarai Lake. We might find stones or mud. As soon as the water level starts dropping the problems that were always there and accumulated through time start coming to light. Today, thanks to the fact that people can talk, we can launch full investigations into all those problems." In an forceful voice, the president then said: "Therefore, and without needing to ask me about it, you may rest assured that the press will not be censured, and no newspaper will be closed during my administration. You are witnesses that today no radio or television station is harassed, and I believe no journalist is being persecuted." "When someone asked me for help and protection for a journalist in Pedro Juan Caballero I ordered that protection. We gave him all the guarantees. So you can rest assured. I have come here to give you this message so that you may rest assured. During my government no freedom will be curtailed," the president concluded. It was a short but very important speech. Asked about his attitude with respect to the Chapultepec declaration, which was signed by some heads of government such as Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Guatemalan President Carlos de Leon Carpio, Wasmosy said that he would sign it with pleasure, because he considers freedom of the press to be essential for democracy. Without it you cannot govern, Wasmosy said.
