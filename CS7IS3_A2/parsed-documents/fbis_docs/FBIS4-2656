JACE is one of Japan's four most influential economic organizations, with heads of major enterprises among its members. JACE puts great emphasis on economic cooperation and exchanges with China and has sent several delegations to China, Rong said during the meeting. Rong believes that JACE's current visit will help strengthen bilateral economic exchanges and friendly relations. Watanabe said JACE is ready to conduct regular exchanges with China's state economic and trade commission to help cultivate Chinese modern entrepreneurs. Rong appreciated Watanabe's move, saying that facing an economy which is growing "continuously, quickly and healthily," China is in urgent need of talents. Though China will train qualified personnel by itself, it heartily welcomes foreign friends to lend a hand for this purpose. Rong expressed the hope that China and Japan will improve their mutually beneficial cooperation in economics, which is an impetus to the two countries' economic growth. Praising China's achievements in fostering economic growth and maintaining domestic stability, Watanabe expressed the confidence that a large group of outstanding entrepreneurs will crop up in China in the wake of the thriving economy.
