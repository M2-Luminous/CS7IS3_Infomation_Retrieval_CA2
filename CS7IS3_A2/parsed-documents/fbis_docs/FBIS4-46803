We were able to acquaint the reader with fragments of the return message of the president of Afghanistan. Today we have an opportunity to publish a more detailed text obtained from the staff of the president of the Republic of Armenia: "Your Excellency, I have received and studied your message concerning the involvement of certain irresponsible Afghan persons participating in the war in Nagornyy Karabakh. The Afghan side recognizes the feelings of the Armenian leadership. I want with great regret to inform you and, through you, the people of Armenia that some groups of adventurers undermining social and political stability in Afghanistan are, truly, for financial backing for their aims accepting Afghan underlings of the former Soviet Azerbaijan in order to cause a deterioration in relations between Armenia and Afghanistan. "Your Excellency! The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan, recognizing the UN Charter, express their protest against aggression, from wherever it emanate. "We view the roots of the contradiction between Armenia and Azerbaijan as the consequences of a conspiracy of the former Soviet leaders. The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan advocate peaceful coexistence and are following a strategy of peace and Afghanistan's friendly relations with the two countries: Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the light of this we do not approve of the participation of Afghan citizens in the armed operations in Karabakh. We support a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the recently formed countries. "Your Excellency! The participation of certain mercenaries going by the name of mujahidin cannot cause a deterioration in the friendly relations between Afghanistan and Armenia. The Afghan side will endeavor in every possible way to prevent this inhuman business, which is being conducted by extremists using their income from this to increase instability in Afghanistan. Afghanistan will try to put an end to this business as soon as possible. "Your Excellency! Availing myself of the opportunity, I wish you and the people of Armenia success, good health, and happiness."
