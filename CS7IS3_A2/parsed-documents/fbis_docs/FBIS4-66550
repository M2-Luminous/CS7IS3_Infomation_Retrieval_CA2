The first 100 days of Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, who had filled Madhya Pradesh with his promises and declarations, are not enough to evaluate his effectiveness. However, it appears that the chief minister who rides on the shoulders of the masses is busy, but everything around him is in a mess. He had the image of a macho chief minister when he arrived in this state. Even after innumerable efforts, they have failed to change his image to that of the sole leader of the state. Instead, Digvijay Singh has the image of a servant in this state of three super chief ministers--Arjun Singh, Kamal Nath, and Madhavrao Scindia. Digvijay Singh was the candidate from the Arjun Singh camp last December when the leader of the Congress legislative group was elected. In the power struggle between the Arjun Singh and Shukla groups that climaxed at the polling booth, Digvijay Singh defeated Shyamacharan Shukla and became the chief minister from the Arjun Singh camp and from the Arjun Singh political family. However, during the first 100 days, the roles of the main characters in the state political drama have changed. The most interesting and shrewd scene is that in which the chief minister is in the Arjun Singh camp as are his most eloquent detractors. The political wild game hunt of these two Thakurs [warrior caste] has not only thrown the remaining factions of the Congress Party in the background, but also has put a question mark on their political existence. The names of followers of Madhavrao Scindia and Ram Charan Shukla can be counted in the latest episode. Digvijay Singh is a `Macho chief minister' because throngs of people surround him seeking his help until 2:00 am. He puts one hand on one person's shoulder, listens to a second person, respond to a third person, and smiles at the fourth person. Members of the Congress Party arrive from all over the state. They have submitted more than 50,000 requests for transfers and new jobs and have made Digvijay Singh feel that he is the super leader sitting at the peak of his popularity. It is surprising that Digvijay Singh is using this crowd as a standard to measure his popularity. This style can work for the state Congress president, however, it does not work for someone in the role of [state] Congress president and chief minister. Digvijay Singh has been mostly the state Congress president during his first 100 days. Perhaps, during the next few months he will emerge as the real chief minister. Amidst all kinds of assumptions, Digvijay Singh is trying to maneuvour maintaining a balance between Arjun Singh and Kamal Nath. He does not want to defy or anger either of these leaders. In this game of keeping balance, Digvijay Singh appears to be alternately leaning towards the camp that puts more pressure on him at a given time. Still, the change that is visible is Digvijay Singh's efforts to stay away from Arjun Singh, the human resources minister at the Center. Only time will tell how many leaders in his own camp and from other groups will support Digvijay Singh. If we review the visits by state Congress leaders, especially Central Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh and Central Forests and Environment Minister Kamalnath, then we can see the increasing warmth between Kamalnath and Digvijay Singh. Digvijay Singh has publicly declared that Kamalnath played an important role in his election to the chief minister's position. He has not given a similar statement about Arjun Singh. The relationship between Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh has been seen to be both hot and cold. These state leaders occupying central government positions have only strengthened their power bases instead of empowering the chief minister. Their agenda, speeches, and methods have divided the Congress workers. They are also creating doubts. Five Congress (I) power bases in the state, with varying degrees of influence, are present. These power groups are led by Arjun Singh, Kamal Nath, V.C. Shukla, Madhavrao Scindia, and Shyamacharan Shukla. As for the Shukla brothers, the state government will not try to openly oppose V.C. Shukla because of his position. However, central Water Resources Minister V.C. Shukla is quiet. The former Chief Minister Shyamacharan Shukla is waiting for an opportunity. The group that is baffled most is that of Arjun Singh's supporters inside and outside of the government. They had considered Digvijay Singh a foot soldier in Arjun Singh's camp at one time. One cabinet member who had gone to see Arjun Singh off at the airport on 14 March after his visit to Moni Baba [holy man] said, "How long will he be able to run the government without the support of King Arjun Singh?" This is the most complicated issue in the state politics now. Madhya Pradesh is the umbilical cord from which Arjun Singh acquires strength just like some mythological characters. The supporters of Arjun Singh cannot stop expressing their feelings seeing the decline in his prominence in that state for the first time. Important leaders believe that a power struggle is going on between Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh. If we look closely, Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh, and Kamal Nath have basically the same views, but are telling different things to the prime minister and the party president. Another major change has been noticed in Arjun Singh's supporters. They appear to have fully submitted to the prime minister. It could be that this change was forced on them. He is the same person who used to mentioned the prime minister as a villain during the Surajkund conference. He drools when showing respect for him now. It should be remembered that in addition to these challenges from within the Congress (I) Party, there is the challenge of the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]. The first Vidhan Sabha election held after Digvijay Singh became the chief minister was for the Satna seat. The election for this seat was held later because of an Election Commission order. The chief minister was so impressed with his own proclamations that he announced before the voting that, "the people will give me their mandate in Satna." The opposite happened; the BJP won. The second major challenge is the Rajgarh Lok Sabha seat. The atmosphere is now getting heated up after the march of former Chief Minister Sunderlal Patwa and responding march by the chief minister's brother Lakshman Singh. The first 100 days of Digvijay Singh's rule have hurt the people more than the party according to one interpretation. Some leaders within the Congress (I) Party and the cabinet have emerged who are speaking the language of Bahujan Samaj Party's [BSP] Kanshi Ram. These attacks made from public platforms, however, were mostly because of political pressure. These attacks are made sometimes [in a bid] for the the presidency of Madhya Pradesh Congress Party, and sometimes just to undermine the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. The effect of this on the people is such as never seen before. The fact that Chief Minister Digvijay Singh never forgets to pay homage to Kanshi Ram during this visits to Delhi is entirely another matter. This has made the Congress members who have never practiced the politics of casteism before restless. They practiced politics keeping the state in mind. Except for a few districts, there is emphasis on castes as is in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP was active in the 1989 vidhan sabha elections, however, it could not make its presence known until the 1993 election. However, the BSP did not achieve the success that the Congress and the BJP were afraid of before the elections. The BSP leaders now have the excuse to use their party as a threat. This has led to the rise of caste sentiments in many districts, including Vindhya Pradesh, Chhattis Garh, and Bilaspur. The chief minister of the state had started to add the issue of caste to every announcement from the beginning. He has softened now that he was accused of using the caste issue as a weapon. These accusations are still being levied. Some ministers and Congress leaders seem to be in a competition to give the most instigating speech. They target the high caste people directly or indirectly. The latest example of is of Tanwant Singh Kir, minister of administration in Digvijay Singh's cabinet. There was a divisional conference of Ujjain division's sanitary workers on 6 March. A part of Mr. Kir's speech in that conference went like this: "The scheduled castes and the backward groups have not taken over the responsibility of cleaning and picking up trash. Now, whoever makes the mess will have to clean up. In the future, 20 percent of the jobs for sanitary workers will be reserved for high caste people. Both God and I like the sanitary workers. The high caste people, the traders, and the Brahmans just do not understand it all. All citizens have equal right for upward mobility. I will not allow any discrimination and bias against these castes." There was a sharp reaction to Mr. Kir's speech both inside and outside of the Vidhan Sabha. The turmoil inside was so intense that Chairman Srinivas had to cancel the assembly activities and remove the verbal assaults from the proceedings. That day, former Chief Minister Kailash Joshi was seen to be upset when coming down the stairs of the Vidhan Sabha. He said, "How did he become a cabinet member? What kind of language does he use?" It was Arjun Singh who started this new practice of providing or demanding positions based on caste in Madhya Pradesh. On the evening of 5th December, the election heat was sharp in both the election camps--Shukla's and Arjun Singh's. Digvijay Singh proposed his name with the help of Kamal Nath in Arjun Singh's camp. At that time, Arjun Singh's "dummy" candidate Subhash Yadav had to withdraw. However, when Arjun Singh stood up to speak in the legislators' meeting, Sushil Kumar Shinde, party supervisor for elections, stopped him from speaking. Arjun Singh left the meeting in anger. He issued a statement from his residence 15 minutes later. He said that the world would not have come to an end if he had had the opportunity to speak to the legislators. He wanted a Harijan or tribal to be elected to the state's leadership. All he wanted was to make an appeal. It is important to remember that in 1980 when Shivbhanu Singh Solanki ( a tribal) had more votes in the Congress legislative group, Arjun Singh had become the chief minister by usurping Solanki's votes with the support of Kamal Nath. The population of tribals and Harijans in the state was the same at that time. Later, central Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh came to Bhopal on 4 January 1994. He said that he was still firm on the opinion he had given at the time of election of the legislative leader. He wanted one of the tribals to be elected leader. According to knowledgeable circles, Mr. Singh wanted the leader of the state Congress Party to be of the same group and from his own camp. Thus, Ajit Mukherji emerged as the choice and he went around the state giving statements asking for first being elected chief minister and later, the state party president. Interestingly, except for some of Digvijay Singh's cabinet members, the Congress members viewed this demand differently. Most of them belonged to Arjun Singh's camp and had lost in the election. All the coalitions that were either stagnant or defunct suddenly became revitalized and there began a series of conventions. On 4th January, Arjun Singh requested Governor Mohammed Shafi Qureshi in the presence of Digvijay Singh on the platform to decide on enlarging the Baba Saheb Ambedkar National Institute of Social Sciences. The work on this institute had been discontinued since 1984 and Arjun Singh could have made work possible by giving a grant before 4th January. He had announced a grant of five million rupees for this purpose. Another statement was issued after Digvijay Singh was elected chief minister on the advice of Arvind Netam, central minister of state for agriculture. In the statement issued on 5th January, he said that the demand to elect a chief minister from scheduled castes, tribals, or backward groups was not honored. Parasram Bhardwaj, president of the Joint Legislative Council, said from Bhillai that in addition to administrative positions, the scheduled castes and tribals have not gotten proper representation in public service programs, municipal committees, and other places. Because of this pressure, two deputy chief ministers, Subhash Yadav and Pyare Lal Kanwar, were appointed for the first time. Subhash Yadav's speech made in the Yadav group's meeting in Indore on 26 January was also discussed. Mr. Jogi said on 1 February in the scheduled castes and tribal groups' meeting in Bhopal, "We will fight only over burning issues. We will not make any more requests, it will be the higher caste people who will do that now. Reservation of quotas is our right. We will pass this quota to 15 percent of the people. We will not tolerate those leaders who were elected with our votes any more." Mr. Jogi told the reporters after the conference that he thought just like Kanshi Ram, however, they were on different platforms. His efforts won 25 cabinet positions and two deputy chief minister positions. It was Jamuna Devi, the minister for welfare of women, who put a stop to Ajit Jogi's statements. She said that, "Ajit Jogi who is talking about scheduled castes and tribals, should first look at himself and tell us who he is. What has he contributed to the party? Ajit Jogi's statements and actions were making the government and the chief minister unstable. Ajit Jogi appears to be a subversive politician. He started to oppose the state government with a conference in Bhopal and such action is intolerable." Jamuna Devi demanded expulsion of Ajit Jogi from Congress and action against the cabinet members who took part in that convention. Thus continued the routine of caste-based politics. On 4th February in Bhopal's Ravinder Bhawan, a backward-classes meeting was held. They demanded in this meeting that the president of the state's Congress Party should be a backward class member, a tribal, or from a scheduled caste. In addition to that, they demanded that 50 percent of positions in the Congress organization, public programs, and municipal committees should be reserved for these groups. Rajmani Patel, the president of this organization, is a former cabinet member and belongs to Arjun Singh's camp. Similarly, Bansilal Dharitlehre, another former cabinet member, has also demanded that the presidency of state's Congress Party should be given to a member of these groups. Mr. Dharitlehre himself is also a candidate for this position. The caste equation that is changing the the face of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Party does not appear to stop here. There is no opposition to it within the party, and no one has the courage to come forward to oppose it. However, a statement issued by Kamal Nath from Tikamgarh is of significance. He announced in his speech during the closing ceremonies of the Amar Singh Rathaur volleyball tournament that it does not matter whether the president of the Congress Party is from a backward group, that person must be qualified for the position, and then he added, "We do not want to make Madhya Pradesh another Uttar Pradesh."
