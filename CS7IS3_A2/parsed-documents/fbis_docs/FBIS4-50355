During their cordial and friendly conversation, Jiang Zemin extended welcome to the delegation and said: "I have met the leaders of your party on several occasions in Beijing and Tokyo. I think senior leaders of our two parties should maintain regular contacts which are very important for promoting understanding and friendship. I hope your party will regard this visit as a new starting point and continue to promote the development of Sino- Japanese relations." Jiang Zemin said: China and Japan are close neighbors. Developing the two countries' good neighborliness and cooperation not only is in line with the interests and aspirations of Chinese and Japanese people, but also is in the interests of peace and development in Asia and the rest of the world. China and Japan should make continuous efforts to promote their good neighborliness and reciprocal cooperation. Jiang Zemin spoke highly of SDPJ's perennial efforts in preserving and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that, over the years, the SDPJ has made important contributions to normalizing Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and promoting the healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations. Wataru Kubo said: "SDPJ always attaches great importance to its ties with China. We maintain that approaching history correctly is an important issue in Japan-China relations. We always advocate that Japan should follow the course of peaceful development and should preserve and promote Japan-China friendship. The purpose of my current visit to China is to further promote the development of Japan-China friendship through marking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of ties between our two parties." Jiang Zemin said: The discordant tone which recently appeared in Sino-Japanese relations runs counter to history and the feelings of Chinese and Japanese peoples and so it was bound to be condemned. "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future." Only when we approach history correctly and insist on preserving Sino-Japanese friendship can the peoples of our two countries be friends for generations to come. Wataru Kubo indicated that the SDPJ, no matter whether it is a ruling party or not, will continue to have friendly contacts with the CPC and the Chinese people, and will also strive for peace and development for Japan and China, as well as Asia and the world. Li Shuzheng, head of the CPC Central Committee International Liaison Department, was present at the meeting. On the morning of 16 May, Li Shuzheng and members of the delegation had working discussions on the development of the two parties' relations and other issues. Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met and feted the delegation at the Diaoyutai State Guest House this evening.
