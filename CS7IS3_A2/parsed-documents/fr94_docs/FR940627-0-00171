FR940627-0-00171 FR940627-0-00019 1. Executive Summary This section must include a brief description of the general results and conclusions for the tier(s) included in the report (i.e., Tier 1 and/or Tier 2), emphasizing information and test data which provide evidence for potential adverse health and/or welfare effects. 2. Test Substance Information This section must include a detailed test substance description, including (as applicable) base fuel parameter values or test fuel composition (if other than base fuel), and test additive composition. The base fuel description must include the types and concentrations of base fuel additive components and values for each of the parameters specified in the base fuel definition for the applicable fuel family. Similar parameter values must be identified for test fuels other than base fuels. 3. Tier 1 Summary This section is intended to provide an overview of Tier 1 analyses. Detailed procedural descriptions, tables, and other outputs are to be included in the appendices. a. Literature Search. The search methods must be described, including the identity of data bases and time periods accessed. Any in-house and/or other unpublished studies included in the literature search must also be described briefly. The results and conclusions of the literature search with respect to potential health and welfare effects of the subject fuel or fuel additive must be summarized. If test documentation provided by the literature search is used to satisfy some or all of the other program requirements, the relevant studies must be discussed and their adequacy to fulfill the specific purposes of the associated program requirements must be justified. Finally, the person(s) or contractors conducting the search are to be identified. b. Emission Generation and Characterization. This section of the summary report must identify the vehicle selected and describe the procedures followed in vehicle/engine preparation and maintenance and in the generation, storage, and processing of emissions for testing. For group submissions, the report must include a complete description of the group representative used in the generation of emissions. A description of the analytic methods used to characterize the F/FA emission products must also be provided. Problems encountered in generating and/or characterizing the emissions must be discussed, including attempts to resolve the problems and their potential effects on testing outcomes. The laboratories performing these procedures must be identified. c. Exposure Analysis. This section must include a qualitative discussion on the potential exposures to the general, area-specific, and/or special at-risk population groups based on the production and use of the particular fuel or additive in question. For group submissions, the analysis must consider potential exposures due to all members of the group. When available, EPA recommends the use of existing modeling data to support the exposure analysis. 4. Tier 2 Summary For each study, the objectives, principles, and general procedures must be outlined and the findings and conclusions summarized. Discussion must be included regarding problems encountered during the performance of the tests and the methods used to resolve them. This discussion must include the impact which such problems may have had on the study outcomes. 5. Conclusions Further testing needs must be identified or else a discussion must be provided explaining why the results of Tiers 1 and/or Tier 2 should not trigger Tier 3 testing requirements. C. Appendices Detailed information in support of the general discussions contained in the summary report are to be submitted as appendices to the report. In regard to the literature search, the appendices must contain (1) summary tables of existing studies regarding health and environmental effects, including such information as the type of study, species/strain used, exposure concentration(s), duration of study, endpoints evaluated, results (incidence and statistical significance), and references, (2) a complete copy of reference lists and associated abstracts obtained from data base searches (in printed form or on 31/2 inch (IBM compatible) computer diskettes), (3) complete documentation of in-house studies and other unpublished information sources, and (4) complete documentation (e.g., copies of journal articles) of previous studies which are being cited in satisfaction of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 test requirements. Appendices to the emission characterization section must contain detailed protocols, copies of all relevant laboratory reports, a list of all speciated emission products and their emission rates, and documentation and results of calibration/verification procedures. For the section that discusses potential exposures, an appendix must be provided for detailed background information on the production volume and market distribution data used in the exposure analysis. If exposure models are used, background calculations and/or model data must also be included in an appendix.
