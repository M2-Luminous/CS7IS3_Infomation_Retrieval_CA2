FBIS TRENDS-04APR94-JAPAN-U.S. Japanese Government, Private Sector View Market Opening Steps Japanese Government, Private Sector View Market Opening Steps SUMMARY The Japanese business community and the Japanese media have sharply criticized the market opening package that the Japanese Government released on 29 March--and by implication the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa--for failing to include concrete measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus and ease trade tensions with the United States. Japanese press reporting suggests that a number of Japanese Government officials are concerned that this criticism--along with that of Washington- -may further weaken Hosokawa's increasingly shaky domestic political standing. These officials appear to be trying to limit the damage by portraying Prime Minister Hosokawa as favoring bolder steps and trying to shift the blame for the package's weaknesses onto a recalcitrant bureaucracy. Public comments on the package by senior Japanese leaders, meanwhile, have suggested that the government remains divided over how to flesh the package out in follow-up measures promised for June. END SUMMARY Japanese business leaders and the Japanese press have for the most part expressed disappointment in the Japanese Government's market opening package. Either directly or in somewhat veiled terms, they have criticized it for its lack of detail and its failure to address some of the measures that they believe are needed to jump-start the floundering Japanese economy and reduce trade tensions with the United States. For example: -- According to a 29 March Kyodo report, Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, described the package as containing "little substance." -- Tadashi Okuda, president of Japan's largest bank, Dai Ichi Kangyo and chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, also reportedly complained about the lack of detail in the package, stating that "almost all the main parts" were left to be fleshed out in the follow-up package promised for June. According to a 29 March Kyodo report, Okuda warned that unless the package is fleshed out quickly, it will do little to alleviate bilateral trade tensions. -- Although Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Japan's largest business organization, reportedly praised the intentions behind the package, he criticized it indirectly by indicating that the government needed to include concrete proposals for a three-year tax cut and a significant 100 trillion yen increase in public works spending in the follow-up program (Kyodo, 29 March). Press Commentary Much Japanese press commentary has also criticized the package, often calling on the government to take measures similar to those being sought by the United States in its negotiations with Japan. In an unusually blunt editorial on 30 March, Japan's most influential economic newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, criticized the package for failing to present effective proposals to reduce bilateral trade tensions, for delaying until June concrete proposals on deregulating the Japanese economy, and for offering only vague promises, couched in phrases like "attempts will be made to further improve" and "plans will be drawn up," about its plans to reduce Japan's trade surplus. The paper argued that Japan was "at a stage where it must pay serious attention to 'results'" and that achieving good trade results has become a priority task for Japan itself." It concluded by calling on the government to devise concrete measures to reduce the trade surplus. Similarly, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest newspaper, described the package as "not a satisfactory answer to the United States" and criticized it for failing to spell out "concrete measures to ease regulations" and for delaying until June a decision on tax cuts and increased public spending. The paper added that it was "imperative" for the government to draw up "substantial market-opening measures" by the end of June. Press commentary on the market opening package has not been entirely supportive of measures sought by Washington, however. Both the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun editorials criticized the United States for demanding the setting of numerical targets to measure Japan's trade performance. Nihon Keizai Shimbun described Prime Minister Hosokawa's refusal to accept such targets at his February summit with President Clinton as "the right answer to the demand" and characterized the "results-oriented trade policy" of the United States and the strategy adopted by Washington to achieve it as "worrisome." Asahi Shimbun stated that if Japan and the United States "try to increase dealings forcibly by setting targets in trade talks, there will be distortions in economic activities." The paper added that while Japan needed to increase imports by boosting domestic demand and reducing market barriers, it "has to reject unreasonable demands." Some of the press commentary on the package may help to further erode public confidence in the Hosokawa cabinet because it either blamed the government directly for the package's weaknesses or highlighted Hosokawa's ineffectiveness in the face of bureaucratic opposition and infighting within his coalition. The 30 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorial, for instance, criticized the government for failing to move beyond its refusal to accept U.S. demands for the setting of objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance and "prepare an alternative" to present to Washington. In a 30 March editorial, Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's most widely read newspaper, questioned Hosokawa's leadership, suggesting that he had failed to get many of his "political decisions and ideas" included in the package. The paper argued that in the absence of "political decision-making on key issues," the market-opening package was bound to be weak. Similarly, a 30 March Sankei Shimbun article portrayed the prime minister as almost completely paralyzed by bureaucratic opposition. It quoted a Ministry of Finance official as asserting that, during negotiations over the market opening package, "the Prime Minister's Office was isolated." Concern About Political Repercussions A number of Japanese officials have reacted to the criticism of the package in somewhat defensive terms, suggesting that they are are trying to avoid further exacerbating friction with the United States and limit the domestic impact of the criticism. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who was closely involved in brokering the package, reportedly responded to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's criticism of the package by stressing that more measures would be forthcoming in June. According to a 30 March Kyodo report, Takemura stated that it was "enormously important for the Japanese Government to put all its energy into compiling such measures in June, because the U.S. is focusing on our June package." According to another 30 March Kyodo report, an unidentified government source countered Ambassador Kantor's criticism by claiming that the package was in fact a "significant step" in trade negotiations with the United States, adding, like Takemura, that fuller measures would come in June. Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama told Nihon Keizai Shimbun on 29 March that Japan had "to make (the United States) understand that this is not a one-shot effort" (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 30 March). The tone of some of the comments some officials made to the press suggests that officials around the prime minister may be particularly concerned about the domestic political impact that criticism will have on Hosokawa's government, and may be moving to try to minimize it. For example, an unidentified government source described the prime minister as having been forced "by opposition from bureaucrats . . . to give up all of his ideas and delay formulating a program." The source went on to describe the prime minister as having been in favor of many of the measures called for by Japanese business, the Japanese press, and Washington, including significantly increased public investment, a long-term income tax cut, and a commitment to reduce Japan's trade surplus by a specific target. The source asserted that bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) resisted the prime minister's proposals and the prime minister was "at the mercy of the bureaucrats in MITI and MOF." Similarly, an unidentified senior government official reportedly told the 30 March Yomiuri Shimbun that some of the positive features of the market opening package, including the projection that Japan would reduce the ratio of its current account surplus to its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994 to 2.8 percent, was included only at the insistence of Hosokawa's office. Continued Government Divisions Judging from the public comments of senior Japanese Government officials on the market opening package, the government remains divided over how far it must go to flesh out the package in the June measures. According to a 29 March Kyodo report, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii sought to minimize the scope of the current package, telling the press that the projection for reducing Japan's current account surplus to 2.8 percent of GDP was "not a numerical target." He added that he remained opposed to using construction bonds to finance the increased public works spending that is under consideration for the June package- -raising doubts that the government will be able to agree on a significant increase in time to include it in the enhanced package. Repeating a standard argument used by the Ministry of Finance to oppose spending increases, Fujii argued that such bonds would incur public debt and be a burden for future generations. According to another 29 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report, EPA Director General Manae Kubota also told a news conference on the 29th that the 2.8 percent figure was not a "promise or target," and indicated only that the government would "make efforts" to achieve it. Outlook Prime Minister Hosokawa's government is likely to have difficulty reaching a consensus on how to flesh out the market opening package because parts of his ruling coalition and the bureaucracy continue to oppose some of the proposed measures. In addition, Hosokawa's continuing political problems--including the allegations that he was involved in a questionable financial dealing and the difficulty he is having in getting the fiscal year 1994 budget through the Diet--may weaken the prime minister to the extent that he will be unable to exert the authority necessary to break the deadlock over the package. Despite the attempts of those around the prime minister to distance Hosokawa from the weak points of the market opening package, domestic criticism of the package may further compound Hosokawa's political problems, contributing to the growing impression that he is ineffective and further eroding public confidence in his government.
