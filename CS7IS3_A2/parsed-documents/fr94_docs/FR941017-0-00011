FR941017-0-00011 FR941017-0-00003 The potential effect on breeders of llamas and alpacas in the United States depends on the demand elasticity of the market. Independent of this rulemaking, the domestic price for llamas and alpacas has been decreasing during the past few years, and we expect prices to continue to fall. Current market values for females range from $5,000 to $8,000, but have gone as low as $2,000. These prices are down from the 1989 values of $7,500 to $10,000. Prices for males used as pets or pack animals have remained relatively steady at $500 to $1,500. Prices for stud-quality males were not available. Current figures are not available, but in 1989 approximately 99 percent of the llama and alpaca breeders in the United States were believed to be small entities. With prices decreasing and llama and alpaca births rising annually in the United States as a result of forces unrelated to the regulatory changes made in this document, we do not expect our rule to significantly affect a substantial number of breeders. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
