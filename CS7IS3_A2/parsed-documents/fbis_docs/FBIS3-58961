The EC's executive European Commission said ECU12 million (13 million dollars) would be made available to such organisations as trade unions, media bodies and human rights monitoring organisations. To be eligible, they must work with similar bodies in the European Community on projects to "promote the concept of democratic societies governed by the rule of law and the expressed wishes of free citizens," an EC official said. The first pilot democracy programme, launched in 1992, attracted 350 applications for a share of ECU5 million (5.5 million dollars). Some 52 projects from East Europe were finally selected. The second programme for which applications are now being invited has been expanded to include countries of the former Soviet Union. A third and larger programme is expected to be announced later this year.
