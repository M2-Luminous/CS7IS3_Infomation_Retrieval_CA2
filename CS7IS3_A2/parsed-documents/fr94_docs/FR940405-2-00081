FR940405-2-00081 FR940405-2-00043 Office of the Secretary [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3038; FR&hyph;2736&hyph;N&hyph;11] Regulatory Waiver Requests Granted AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Public notice of the granting of regulatory waivers. SUMMARY: Under section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Reform Act), the Department is required to make public all approval actions taken on waivers of regulations. This Notice provides notification of waivers granted during the period from March 1 to September 30, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For general information about this Notice, contact Myra L. Ransick, Assistant General Counsel for Regulations, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410; (202) 708&hyph;3055; (TDD) (202) 708&hyph;3259. (These are not toll-free numbers.) For information concerning a particular waiver action, contact the person whose name and address is set out for the particular item in the accompanying list of waiver-grant actions. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 106 of the Reform Act amended section 7 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(3)) to provide: 1. Any waiver of a regulation must be in writing and must specify the grounds for approving the waiver; 2. Authority to approve a waiver of a regulation may be delegated by the Secretary only to an individual of Assistant Secretary rank or equivalent rank, and the person to whom authority to waive is delegated must also have authority to issue the particular regulation to be waived; 3. Not less than quarterly, the Secretary must notify the public of all waivers of regulations that the Department has approved, by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. These Notices (each covering the period since the most recent previous notification) shall: a. Identify the project, activity, or undertaking involved; b. Describe the nature of the provision waived, and the designation of the provision; c. Indicate the name and title of the person who granted the waiver request; d. Describe briefly the grounds for approval of the request; e. State how additional information about a particular waiver grant action may be obtained. Today's document notifies the public of HUD's waiver-grant activity from March 1 to September 30, 1993. The next Notice, which will be published in the near future, will cover the period from October 1 through December 31, 1993. For ease of reference, waiver requests granted by departmental officials authorized to grant waivers are listed in a sequence keyed to the section number of the HUD regulation involved in the waiver action. For example, a waiver-grant action involving exercise of authority under 24 CFR 24.200 (involving the waiver of a provision in part 24) would come early in the sequence, while waivers in the section 8 and section 202 programs (24 CFR chapter VIII) would be among the last matters listed. Where more than one regulatory provision is involved in the grant of a particular waiver request, the action is listed under the section number of the first regulatory requirement in title 24 that is being waived as part of the waiver-grant action. (For example, a waiver of both ยง811.105(b) and ยง811.107(a) would appear sequentially in the listing under ยง811.105(b).) Waiver-grant actions involving the same initial regulatory citation are in time sequence beginning with the earliest-dated waiver-grant action. Should the Department receive additional reports of waiver actions taken during the period covered by this report before the next report is published, the next updated report will include these earlier actions. Accordingly, information about approved waiver requests pertaining to regulations of the Department is provided in the Appendix to this Notice. Dated: March 24, 1994. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.
