Lyukin, who will leave the post and return home to serve as chairman of the parliament's international affairs committee, said the Russian people were very disappointed with U.S. efforts to help their country, the ASSOCIATED PRESS reported. "I am not so insistent and urgent on advice from my foreign friends on how to behave either toward my country or their country," Lyukin said. His comments on personnel affairs stemmed from the rising U.S. concern over the departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov, both pro-Western, from the new Russian cabinet. Lyukin said Washington should care less about "which gentleman in our country should become minister of trade, minister of finance, minister of something else." He criticized the apparent U.S. position that "three or four charismatic personalities will personify all this democracy." "If it is the American understanding of what democracy is, it is strange for me," Lyukin said. At the U.S. State Department, spokesman Mike McCurry said "it is less the personalities at issue and more the policy that is reformers who is of utmost concern to the United States." Acknowledging that "those reforms who most associated with the policies of reform...might have been in the best position to carry out those policies," McCurry said Washington will "wait to see" if the new Russian administration would continue to fight inflations and ease pains for the ordinary Russians. During today's interview, Lyukin also criticized Washington's trying to dictate "where to deliver, whom to deliver" the assistance. He insisted that economic aid should be government-to-government rather than to specific ministries that the west "consider progressive and not to those they consider less progressive." Lyukin has been ambassador to the U.S. for about two years.
