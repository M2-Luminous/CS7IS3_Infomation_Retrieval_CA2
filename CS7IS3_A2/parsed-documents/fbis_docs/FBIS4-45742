Household wastes are now increasing at an alarming rate. In the developed country Germany, for example, the amount of garbage per capita doubled from the 1950's to 1990's, and the amount of garbage per capita in West Germany in 1989 was 239 kilograms. It is no wonder that people have exclaimed that "mankind will drown in the garbage it has created". China is a developing country and reform and opening up have spurred rapid economic development. As production develops and people's living standards improve, we similarly will face heavy pressures from growing amounts of solid wastes. Statistics show that industrial residues reached about 700 million tons in 1991 and per capita household garbage in urban areas has now reached 440 kilograms and is growing at an annual rate of eight to 10 percent. [passage omitted] The Chinese Government has consistently advocated the rational and full use of resources and protection of the environment is an established basic national policy. The government has conducted broad-ranging propaganda in this area that has now effectively aroused people's environmental consciousness. However, our countermeasures and measures would seem to be ineffective, especially in the areas of using administrative legislation to strengthen restrictions on the generation of solid wastes and in their recovery and utilization, where we lag far behind the developed countries. Thus, it is essential that we strengthen legislation to increase restrictions on the generation of solid wastes and require their re-use to the greatest possible extent to protect resources and the environment, avoid taking the winding path of the developed countries, and deal with the matter of creating prosperity for generations of our descendants as quickly as possible. [passage omitted] China is now in the process of making a transition to a market economy, and improving packaging designs is an essential way for enterprises to make their products more competitive. Thus, in shortening the useful lifespans of products and improving packaging designs, enabling resource utilization and recovery is a question that is very deserving of attention, but it is ignored by most enterprises at the present time. Because of the growing amount of solid wastes arising from packaging and the continual renovation that is going on now, many countries have formulated specialized decrees to restrict the generation of solid wastes from packaging and help expanded reproduction and utilization. Thus, formulation of the related decrees is the key step, especially in the future when China's enterprises become independently managed legal persons and the government's use of legislation will be an important way to implement macro management.
