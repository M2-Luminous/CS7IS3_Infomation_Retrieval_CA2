He Guanghui, vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that governments of various province-level areas have also decided to choose a number of local enterprises this year to try out the joint-stock system in an effort to invigorate them. Experimentation with the shareholding system is part of the Chinese Government's effort to institute a modern enterprise system, he said. China will continue to try out the shareholding system this year, but will not introduce the system on a large scale, he said. He said: "The shareholding reform is still in the experimental stage because China lacks experience in this respect." Furthermore, as China has a large number of state-owned enterprises, it is both impossible and unnecessary to turn all of them into joint-stock companies, he said. The vice-minister described the shareholding system as an "important form" for the introduction of the modern enterprise system, adding that joint-stock companies serve as a major channel for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets. With progress in instituting a modern enterprise system, there will be more and more shareholding companies in China, mostly limited-liability ones and limited-liability joint-stock ones, he added. "I think there should be a small number of listed companies in China, as in developed Western countries," he said. The Chinese Government will continue to control the number of businesses issuing shares to the public, and listed companies. When companies issue stocks in China or in other countries, priority will be given to major state-run enterprises involved in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw materials industries, he said. "Meanwhile, we shall continue to restrict the number of financial institutions and real estate agencies issuing stocks, and we do not encourage large numbers of commercial businesses to issue shares to the public," he said. Government statistics show that shares issued by listed companies were worth five billion yuan in 1993, and the value of shares to be issued this year is projected to rise moderately. The vice-minister said that the Chinese Government will encourage more enterprises, including large state-owned companies, to issue stocks in Hong Kong and the United States and to be listed there, he said. Last year, six shareholding companies, including the Qingdao Brewery in Qingdao, Shandong Province, and the Shanghai Petrochemical Corporation, issued shares in other countries. Since China began to try out the shareholding system in 1984, the number of joint-stock companies has risen to 11,560, with shares totalling 314.7 billion yuan in value. Of these, 3,261 are limited-liability shareholding companies, with total shares valued at 259 billion yuan; and 8,299 are limited- liability companies, with shares totaling 55.6 billion yuan. Of these, 63 percent are collectively-owned enterprises and 22 percent state-owned companies. According to He Guanghui, shareholding companies are ahead of other enterprises in transforming the enterprises' operational mechanism. He said that the joint-stock system has enabled companies to operate independently and assume full responsibility for their profits and losses. Under the shareholding system, companies have introduced a new labor system and performance-based wage system, and have improved their economic returns markedly, he added. To facilitate the introduction of the shareholding system, it is necessary for government departments to change their functions, improve the country's securities market structure and reflect the state industrial policies, he said.
