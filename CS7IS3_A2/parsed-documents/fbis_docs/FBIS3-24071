Luzhkov: `Moscow Without a Market Is Doomed'"] [Text] As we have already reported, a few days ago the mayor of the capital gave a report on the government's work last year and the program for the present year. I think Muscovites will be interested to read excerpts from Yuriy Luzhkov's statement. We cannot boast of the fact that last year industrial production was stabilized, but the rate of decline has slowed and it is substantially lower than for Russia as a whole. The food industry increased production volumes by 4.7 percent. The extremely large Kreker dry cereal plant has been launched, a large brewery is near completion, and 12 bakeries and many sausage shops and small breweries have been built in the microrayons. The main goal is to bring "food" closer to residents and employ at least 30 percent of the working-age population in food processing and other small-scale production. The capital's government fulfilled the promise given to Muscovites and had more than 3 million square meters of housing commissioned, including 1 million in free municipal housing. We will continue to refuse to consider abandoning people on the waiting lists, as has been done in many regions of Russia and the CIS countries, which "bid farewell" to the lists. Last year 26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12 polyclinics, and 4 hospitals were opened in the new housing developments. The capital's government implemented a targeted structural policy on social protection of those Muscovites who found themselves in a most difficult position upon the change-over to a market basis. Spent for these purposes were 93 billion rubles [R], which were used to support 3.5 million Muscovites: pensioners, disabled persons, children, war veterans, and other categories of citizens. This year the social orientation of city programs will be bolstered even more: in the first stage alone the city will allocate R450 billion for social needs. We intend to systematically index compensation payments to Muscovites, which will allow us not to lower the level of their support and to prevent tragedies. Unfortunately, we can only dream of anything beyond that. I want to emphasize especially that talk of daring decisions in the field of reforming the economy without supporting those people who are in a difficult position through no fault of their own is simply unacceptable and all the reforms are doomed. In the past year market structures have continued to be vigorously developed in Moscow. As of now, about 40 percent of industrial production, 85 percent of transport, and 90 percent of trade and domestic enterprises at the municipal and city levels are no longer state-owned. Operating in the capital, not counting branches, are 350 commercial banks and many business houses, exchanges, and insurance companies. The small business sphere produces 15 percent of the city's volume of consumer goods. All this is the reality of market transformations. Without them, and I say this with all responsibility, Moscow would not have survived 1993. We will continue to develop and qualitatively improve market relations and conduct privatization, but not in the Chubays way where enterprises are sold not as objects for expanded reproduction but as ordinary real estate. Otherwise, it may happen that small groups of people buy up these enterprises and do not work on production but sell them at speculative prices, having acquired them virtually for kopecks. We intend to leave certain elements of property at the municipal, city level, while privatized property will be sold, replenishing the federal and capital treasuries. Public law and order is a painful issue for Moscow. It has always been a focus of attention of the capital's government. Not because of our allegations, but by announcement of the leaders of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, last year the city did more for the law enforcement organs than in all the years of Soviet power. About R40 billion were allocated and 40 special purpose integrated objects with contemporary equipment were built to develop the law enforcement organs' material-technical base. Much equipment was bought for GAI [State Automobile Inspectorate] to do operational work, as well as special devices for operational brigades in the fight against organized crime. And now, not just in the future, we have a right to demand of the militsia that they fundamentally change their work and provide reliable protection of Muscovites and commercial structures from different kinds of criminals. We promised last year to put in order and pave 15 million square meters of Moscow roads, streets, and courtyards with asphalt, but 3.5 million beyond that has been done. In terms of volume of road repair, Moscow is at the level of the largest capitals of the world, but we are justifiably criticized for the lack of quality, just as we are for the poor job of cleaning up the city and the work of the law enforcement structures. This year should be a critical one on these issues. Although we entered 1994 without a budget deficit, the economic situation is very bad. The federal government did not pay its debt of R142 billion to Moscow. The situation is not clear in terms of tax deductions and compensation payments for expenditures for fulfilling the functions of a capital city, and up to this point the embassies, representations, and various state institutions have not paid the city for land and buildings. We are asked to pay R3.4 trillion to maintain and develop the capital's subway system, but even here the federal government has not kept its promise, putting everything on the city's shoulders. Moreover, I recently found out from a solid, reliable source that Russia's Ministry of Finance aspires to somehow balance the budget by abolishing all subventions to Moscow for it to perform its functions as the capital. Just what kind of sense does it make to try to make ends meet in the budget by ignoring all expenditures which the state is committed to make both in the regions and in the capital? Or do the functionaries from the Ministry of Finance want very much to impress the State Duma? And the last thing, the food supply of Moscow. Without relying on anyone, the capital's government and its appropriate departments established close contacts with many Russian regions and foreign firms, so that the food situation last year was calm, just as, we hope, it will be this year. In short, the course of the Moscow government is the same: to develop the market, bolster social protection of Muscovites, stabilize industry, and augment construction of contemporary housing while providing free housing to people on the waiting lists on a mandatory basis.
