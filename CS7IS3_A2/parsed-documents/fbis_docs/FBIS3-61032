It seems that the republic is unable to maintain its armed forces at full strength. National-state ambitions do not allow cutbacks in the armed forces. As a result, certain military-commercial hybrids have appeared in the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. For example, military-transport aviation, equipped with IL-76 airplanes, is being turned over to the control of commercial structures! MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has learned that the 37th Military Aviation-Transport Regiment (military unit No. 54918, commanded by Colonel Bayev), stationed in the city of Artsiz, is at the service of the commercial firms "Atlanta" [Atlanta] and "Yuzhnyy bereg Kryma" [Crimean South Shore]. They are financing the planes' maintenance, buying aircraft engines and fuel, and organizing the retraining of crews for international flights. After that, the military pilots will carry out orders from the businessmen, hauling cargo. As is commonly known, army airplanes cannot fly certain international air routes. In order to avoid complications, the Ukrainian entrepreneurs are repainting the military airplanes to resemble "civilian airliners." However, this does not alter the essential state of affairs. It turns out that the crews of military-transport airplanes, whose chief mission is to drop assault forces on enemy territory, have begun overflying the airfields of foreign countries. In international practice, this is nonsense. A noteworthy detail: A deputy commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, seeking to justify the commercialization of military-transport aviation, said: "The international flight experience being gained by our crews could come in very handy for us in the event of war, since the pilots will master international OVD [joint military operations] and test the technical facilities of many foreign airfields. In addition, we will be able to invigorate the branch of military intelligence associated with air traffic." The Ukrainian military aviation chief is not bluffing. Indeed, few military crews get a chance to overfly the airfields of a "likely adversary." And special equipment installed on the pseudocommercial airliners will make it possible to obtain unique intelligence data. We should point out that a similar air regiment stationed in Krivoy Rog has already begun making "commercial-intelligence" international flights.
