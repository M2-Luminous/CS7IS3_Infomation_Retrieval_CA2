"What we do know from reliable sources is that the Contact Group is in a dilemma about whether certain areas should be defined as gray zones or divided cities," said Krajisnik. "Neither is acceptable for the Serbian side, because our standpoint is that only clear-cut solutions can be a guarantee for lasting peace," Krajisnik said, recalling that during the contacts so far with members of the Contact Group, especially with the French and British, the Serbian side made this stand perfectly clear. Commenting on Christopher's and Kozyrev's statements in Brussels, Krajisnik said that the aim of such statements was to exert pressure on all the sides in the conflict to accept the proposed solutions, while the main pressure was put on the Serbian side. "The imposed solutions do not, however, lead toward peace and it is, therefore, justified to exchange arguments to see which sides are interested in which of the controversial areas in order to establish whose demand is more justified. Here I refer first of all, to areas in western and eastern Bosnia, and in Posavina," said Krajisnik. He recalled that the international community must bear in mind the fact that Serbs in former Bosnia-Herzegovina already have a compact state territory, while efforts are being made to achieve the compactness of the Muslim-Croat federation by means of encroaching upon vital Serb interests to the detriment of Serbian territorial integrity. "We accept that the Muslim side should explain why it insists on the enclaves that seriously effect the compactness of our territory, and if their arguments prove to be well-grounded and realistic we will acknowledge them," said Krajisnik.
