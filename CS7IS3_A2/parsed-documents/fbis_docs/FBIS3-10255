The police reported that during the demonstration some 2,000 students of the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo detonated homemade bombs, destroyed several vehicles, and threw rocks at security units. University Rector Roberto Santana said the students oppose reforms established by university statutes because "they resist change and continue to live in the past." For the past two years, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo has been among the centers showing the strongest opposition to the regime of President Joaquin Balaguer. This has caused frequent confrontations between students and the police.
