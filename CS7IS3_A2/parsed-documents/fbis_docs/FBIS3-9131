The risks are the uncertain development in the former USSR, aggressive nationalism and its demonstrations, and the advance of organized crime, the chairman said. According to Suman, the war in former Yugoslavia may serve as an example that border changes cannot be achieved by force. Yesterday, at a meeting between the Committee deputies and the command officers of the 4th Air Defense Division, Suman described joining NATO as a necessity for the Czech Republic because, according to him, it is the only way to withstand these risks. He considers "playing" with other possibilities to be irresponsible toward the citizens.
