What remains?" in view of the cheque phase of privatisation ending on Thursday. Giving the Russian property committee's positive appraisal of the privatisation phase, the newspaper points out at the same time that the evaluation is "in sharp contrast" to other points of view. Generalising them, the newspaper writes that privatisation "has not brought the expected results either for the work collectives, the state or main social groups of the population". Referring to extreme estimates, the newspaper notes that only "a comparatively small group of corrupt officials and members of shadow-economy and criminal outfits closely connected with them" benefitted from it. Nevertheless, the newspaper favours taking into consideration a "more weighed conclusion: the qualitative (or formal) results of the privatisation are impressive. The privatisation cheques, while not resolving many problems, still substantially promoted the formation of a stock market". Although a widely representative class of genuine proprietors has not yet emerged, "privatisation has expedited the formation of a market mechanism". PRAVDA runs a report, headlined "The Moscow voucher (privatisation cheque) will die somewhat later", on a Moscow government decision to extend the privatisation period in the country's capital until January 1, next year. At the same time the newspaper maintains that "136,000 privatisation unclaimed by Muscovites will be used for the purpose of providing the social protection of citizens. [sentence as recieved] Besides, another two to four million privatisation cheques are kept by Muscovites who could not decide where to invest them. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports Tuesday's meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and foreign companies' executives whom he assured that "a favourable investment climate has taken shape in Russia". The newspaper quotes him as saying that the notion of Russia as a country with a high degree of political risk "has already become out-of-date". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) summarises remarks by President Yeltsin, supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces, and Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a reception of military academies' graduates in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on Tuesday. The newspaper points out that more than 7,000 young officers will join the Russian Army and Navy. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, runs a report under the headline "From now on Russia and NATO headquarters will maintain friendly relations", on Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's Tuesday meeting with visiting General George Joulwan, NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and an accord reached that the Russian Defence Ministry will open a permanent mission at the NATO allied headquarters soon and NATO will send its representatives to the Russian Defence Ministry. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with General of the Army Makhmut Gareyev, Dr. of military sciences, the author of a number of books and 200 scientific articles conveying his views about nuclear weapons and their place in ensuring Russia's military security. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that 3,000 children from the Chernobyl disaster-affected areas left by air for Denmark and Norway for medical treatment last Sunday. The report is headlined "The first Russian landing party at a NATO airfield". Although more than eight years have passed since the tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, "children are born and grow up in contaminated areas in Bryansk, Tula, Kursk and other regions. Chernobyl kids have in their organisms the radioactive legacy of 1986". The press highlights materials concerning Russian-Indian relations and the forthcoming official visit of Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The visit begins on Wednesday. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carry Rao's interviews in which he points that despite the changes which have taken place in the two countries in recent years, "the traditionally close friendship between India and Russia remains unchanged." India seeks to revitalise traditional contacts with Russia, the Indian prime minister emphasised. TRUD on the presidential election in Ukraine: The postponement for almost 24 hours of the Central Electoral Commission's official communique, announcing whom the electorate preferred out of seven contenders for the presidency, is indicative of a "rather acute and uncompromising struggle between candidates and between their supporters". As a result of the first round of elections, the Ukraine's incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk is ahead of ex-premier Leonid Kuchma. PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent scientist Vladimir Gorshenin who voiced the conviction that the Soviet Union would re- emerge but in a different form, of course. A reunification of our peoples is "the primary condition for independence. Almost everyone has already come to realise that..." Gorshenin said.
