FR940628-2-00054 FR940628-2-00042 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Public Meeting The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the following meeting. Name: Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project. Time and Date: 10 a.m.&hyph;3 p.m., July 13, 1994. Place: Weston Plaza Hotel and Convention Center, 1350 North Blue Lakes Boulevard, Twin Falls, Idaho 83301. Status: Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. Purpose: Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living off site of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associate (SC&A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&A will discuss project progress and responses to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions faced by SC&A's project team. Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. Contact Person for More Information: Leeann Denham, Radiation Studies Branch, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, NCEH, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway NE., (F&hyph;35), Atlanta, Georgia, 30341&hyph;3724, telephone 404/488&hyph;7040.
