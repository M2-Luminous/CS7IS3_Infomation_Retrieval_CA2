The newly appointed Yasushi Akashi's representative in Macedonia, Hugo Ansen, in his statement for NOVA MAKEDONIJA, pointed out the Macedonian Government and UNPROFOR should consider such border violations as serious. Indeed, he said, there are no dramatic incidents, but these are clearly cases of border violations. Serbian troops have entered into a territory which we regard to be Macedonian by all means, Ansen said. He also confirmed the reports of a Serbian plane having flown over Macedonian territory a fortnight ago, intercepting an UNPROFOR helicopter. No shots have been fired thus far. Sometimes, Serbian soldiers do point their guns at targets on this side of the border, but that is all there is to it, Ansen said.
