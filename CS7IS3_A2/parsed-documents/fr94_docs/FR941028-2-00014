FR941028-2-00014 FR941028-2-00007 Government Owned Inventions Available for Licensing AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Government Owned Inventions Available for Licensing. SUMMARY: The inventions listed below are owned by the U.S. Government, as represented by the Department of Commerce, and are available for licensing in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research and development. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Technical and licensing information on these inventions may be obtained by writing to: Marcia Salkeld, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Office of Technology Commercialization, Physics Building, Room B&hyph;256, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; Fax 301&hyph;869&hyph;2751. Any request for information should include the NIST Docket No. and Title for the relevant invention as indicated below. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The inventions available for licensing are: NIST Docket No. 90&hyph;031 Title: Detecting Polymer Solidification During Injection Molding. Description: New NIST technology makes it possible to determine the optimum time for opening a mold during an injection molding process. The invention indicates the solidification of a polymer through changes in the fluorescence radiation from a dye which has been doped into the polymer. NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;058 Title: Perflourinated Ionomer Membrane Invention. Description: This NIST invention describes a perflourinated ionomer membrane having improved transport characteristics. A surfactant species is added to a polymer mixture prior to film casting. The resulting membranes have a measurably altered membrane microstructure and improved transport characteristics over prior art membranes. This NIST invention describes the method of producing the improved membranes. The membranes of this NIST invention are useful in a number of separation processes, including the separation of NH 3 from gaseous and liquid mixtures, in the production of NaOH and Cl 2 gas from the electrolytic dissolution of NaCl, in the separation of toxic and radioactive metals from aqueous streams, and in solid polymer electrolyte H 2 O 2 fuel cells. NIST Docket No. 94&hyph;028 Title: Cable Arrangement and Platform for Stabilized Load Lifting. Description: NIST researchers have designed a cable arrangement and platform that completely stabilizes a load during lifting. The invention is attachable to both boom and tower cranes, and is useful for tasks such as loading cargo onto ships and moving materials at construction sites. Dated: October 24, 1994.
