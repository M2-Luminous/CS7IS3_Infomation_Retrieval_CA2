Southern states that the tariff sheets identified below were filed in compliance with the Commission's orders in Southern's restructuring proceeding in Docket No. RS92&hyph;10&hyph;000 and the procedures set forth in Section 31 of the General Terms and Conditions of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1: First Revised Second Revised Sheet No. 15 First Revised Second Revised Sheet No. 17 First Revised Second Revised Sheet No. 18 Second Revised Sheet No. 29 Second Revised Sheet No. 30 Second Revised Sheet No. 31 Southern states that the purpose of this filing is to set forth additional known and measurable GSR costs which have been paid or incurred by Southern since the filing on December 1, 1993 of its first GSR cost recovery filing in Docket No. RP94&hyph;67&hyph;000. Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on February 1, 1994. Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.8 million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with the reformation of two gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989 which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86&hyph;63&hyph;000. Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon Southern's jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.
