FR940902-0-00078 FR940902-0-00010 Section 628.510(e) describes the requirement for service providers to refer eligible applicants or participants who cannot be served by its program back to the SDA for further assessment, if necessary, and suitable referral to other appropriate programs. Several commenters questioned whether there is a requirement for centralized intake. There is no such requirement. The requirement is that the SDA put in place a system that works independently of an individual service provider. This ``system'' would also cover situations described by commenters in which the SDA administrative entity does not perform intake. In other words, an SDA must have some mechanism by which an eligible applicant or participant can be considered for enrollment in all of the services available through the SDA, not just those of a single service provider. The Department believes that this is a program design issue for local discretion and that there will be a number of effective approaches to meet these requirements. The intent of the regulation is simply to assure that participants will be exposed to the full range of available services and that they will have a fair opportunity to receive services appropriate to their individual needs. The States and/or SDA's will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the targeting requirements of sections 203 and 263 of the Act and to determine actions to address noncompliance with the requirements. Many commenters questioned how compliance would be calculated. Some noted that a strict reading of the Act would provide that any ``participant'' (i.e., any individual who has been determined eligible and received a service, including objective assessment) could be included in the calculation to meet the targeting requirement. Others observed that while assessment was an important activity, it did not necessarily constitute a training or employment service that would result in a measurable outcome of the effectiveness of the program. In considering the comments, the Department recognizes that, at the suggestion of individuals identifying implementation issues, it was determined that only individuals enrolled in an activity subsequent to objective assessment would be included in performance standards calculations. The rationale for that decision was that many individuals had not made a final decision to participate in the program and have dropped out before any meaningful intervention. Therefore, for consistency, the Department has determined that the 65-percent requirement also is to be calculated on those participants who receive services or training subsequent to the objective assessment. Section 628.510 is revised to add a new paragraph (f)(2) to this effect. Objective Assessment Objective assessment should be a continuous, customer-centered and flexible process. The objective assessment should not be viewed as a discrete activity that begins and ends early in the stages of program participation, but rather as one that will continue throughout participation in JTPA. Several comments received on the front-end design of the JTPA program discussed the assessment process. All supported the concept and the intent of individualized program services. A few commenters expressed concern over staff development needs for implementing assessment. Many commenters requested guidance in the development of assessment and service strategies. While the Department expects that States and SDA's will retain authority for program design, technical assistance has and will continue to be provided on assessment and development of the ISS. The Department encourages use of funds for the capacity building of staff (see §628.325), including staff training in objective assessment techniques; however, the Department declines to establish credentialing standards as one commenter suggested. The Department believes that staffing and standards should be a State and local decision. A few commenters addressed confidentiality issues arising in the intake, assessment and referral processes. The same kinds of concerns over disclosure of information were expressed in connection with the discussion of §627.463. The Department has not addressed confidentiality in §627.515 because confidentiality issues are not new. The Department thinks that traditional standards of professional conduct on confidentiality issues should be continued. Further, the Department expects that protections against the disclosure of information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as permitted by section 165(a)(4)(B)(i) of the Act, will protect the confidentiality of customer information. A number of commenters expressed confusion over the determination of when an applicant becomes a participant, how much assessment could be provided at the intake/ eligibility stage prior to enrollment of an eligible applicant and to which cost category this would be charged. Costs incurred on behalf of an applicant, including intake, eligibility and suitability determination (which may include some limited assessment of an applicant), and any assessment necessary to facilitate the eligibility determination, consistent with the provisions of §627.440(d)(3)(i) are to be charged to the training-related and supportive services cost category. Once an applicant is determined to be eligible and the decision made to enroll the applicant, a full objective assessment may begin and the applicant may receive other program services. As specified in §627.440(d)(1)(i), assessment at this stage may be charged to the direct training cost category. Receipt of objective assessment or other services would confer participant status consistent with the definition of participant in section 4(37) of the Act. The Department believes that the preoccupation with participant status may be misplaced because the principal issue of program credit has been addressed in the context of when the performance standards are to be applied.
