Certain business leaders who are concerned that the rapid appreciation of the yen on foreign exchange markets on 14 and 15 February may further harm corporate business results and economic conditions are beginning to express the criticism that "it is wrong to just say no to numerical targets and not come up with any measures to reduce the surplus." Other economic leaders, such as Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], express support, saying "The breakdown in the summit talks was inevitable as a result of our opposition to managed trade methods." The situation is such that future developments in the yen exchange rate and U.S. retaliation against Japan may adversely affect "support for Hosokawa." Discussions at the meeting of Nikkeiren's [Japan Federation of Employers Associations] policy committee on 15 February concentrated on how to deal with the yen's appreciation. Some members lamented, "We have to prepare for 85 yen to the dollar" or "We cannot continue if the exchange rate goes beyond 110 yen to a dollar." Tadao Suzuki, president of the Mercian Corporation, who attended the meeting, criticized the helpless government and prime minister: "It is said that Japan and the United States will have a `mature relationship.' Yet, to merely say no to numerical targets is acting like a spoiled child. We need to come up with certain concrete measures, such as accepting numerical targets for government procurement, or we must work on the various industrial sectors to indicate voluntary targets for market liberalization." Hiroshi Hamada, president of the Ricoh Company, Ltd., also expressed his misgivings, saying: "It is easy for anybody to say no and to make the relationship bad. But making the relationship better is what diplomacy is all about, isn't it?" Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., pointed out that "Japanese politicians for more than 10 years have paid too little attention to the task of reducing the current accounts surplus. An exchange rate level like this one will deal a fatal blow to Japan's manufacturing industries." On the other hand, many business leaders voice their support for the prime minister. Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the NEC Corporation, said, "Rejecting the numerical targets, which were plagued with contradictions, at the Japanese-U.S. meeting was the right thing to do. The ongoing `unwarranted yen appreciation' will not help reduce Japan's surplus." Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Inc., argued for the need for self-help efforts. He said: "It is true that we are suffering from the yen's appreciation. However, it is wrong for business operators to blame the prime minister or the government without doing what they need to do."
