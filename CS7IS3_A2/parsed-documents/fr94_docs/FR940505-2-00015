FR940505-2-00015 FR940505-2-00009 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Air Force Public Scoping Meeting, Griffiss AFB, NY The United States Air Force (AF) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of portions of Griffiss AFB, NY. The meeting will be held May 19, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Common Council Chambers, Rome City Hall, 200 Liberty Plaza, Rome, New York. The purpose of this meeting is to: (1) Identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support base disposal and reuse; (2) solicit comments on the proposed action; and (3) solicit potential disposal and reuse alternatives for consideration in developing the EIS. In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the AF will consider all reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state or local government agency, and any federally-sponsored or private entity or individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Griffiss AFB. To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal alternatives to be included in the EIS, the AF recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming meeting or forwarded to the address below by August 1, 1994. The AF will, however, accept additional comments at any time during the environmental impact analysis process. Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to: Lt Col Gary P.
