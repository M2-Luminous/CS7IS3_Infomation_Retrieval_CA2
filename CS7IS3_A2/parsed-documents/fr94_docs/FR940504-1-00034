FR940504-1-00034 FR940504-1-00010 1.7␣Suspension. The USPS may immediately suspend the permit holder's use of a permit imprint if the permit holder or its agent fails to provide information as specified in 1.6. 1.8␣Revocation. A permit is revoked for use in operating any unlawful scheme or enterprise, for nonuse during any 12-month period, for refusal to provide information about permit imprint use or mailings, or for any noncompliance with the standards applicable to using permit imprints. If revocation is for nonuse but the permit holder plans to resume mailings within a 90-day period, the permit may be continued for 90 days. The permit holder may appeal the revocation in writing to the postmaster within 10 days of receipt of the notice. Further appeal may be made through the postmaster to the district manager of customer service and sales or to the RCSC if the initial decision was made at the district level. * * * * * 2.0␣Preparing Permit Imprints. * * * * * 2.4␣Placement. The entire permit imprint indicium must be aligned parallel with the address of the mailpiece and placed in the upper right corner of the address side, of the address area, or of the address label, subject to these conditions: a. The indicium must not encroach on reserved space on the mailpiece (e.g., the OCR read area) if such a standard applies to the rate claimed. b. The position (but not the format) of the indicium may be varied so that data processing equipment can simultaneously print the address, imprint, and other postal information. * * * * * 3.0␣Permit Imprint Content. * * * * * 3.5␣Company Permit Imprint. A company permit imprint is one in which the exact name of the company or individual holding the permit is shown in the permit imprint indicium in place of the city, state, and permit number. A customer may use a company permit imprint indicium if: a. For 2 years after the last date of mailing, the permit holder keeps records for each mailing paid by company permit imprint for USPS review on request. These records include (for each version of what was mailed, if applicable) a complete sample mailpiece; the weight of a single piece; the total number of pieces mailed; the total postage; the date(s) and post office(s) of mailing, and other records required by the rate of postage claimed or the method of payment used. b. Each mailpiece bears the complete domestic return address of the mailer or the mailer's agent, that address being the physical location at which the records listed in 3.5a are available for USPS review. On unendorsed bulk third-class mail, the return address may be below the permit imprint. 4.0␣Formats. [Renumber existing 4.0 as 4.1, and Exhibits 4.0a-c as 4.1a-c; amend and add new 4.2 as follows:] 4.1␣Basic Standard. Unless prepared under the option in 4.2, permit imprint indicia for ordinary mail, official mail, and Mailgrams must be prepared in one of the formats shown in Exhibit 4.1a, Exhibit 4.1b, and Exhibit 4.1c, as applicable to the rate claimed or type of mail. 4.2␣Optional Format. Permit imprint indicia may be prepared in a format other than the basic format described in 4.1 subject to these conditions: a. The rule that forms a box around the content of the indicium may be omitted if the content remains as specified in 3.0 and Exhibits 4.1a-c. b. The indicium content specified in 3.0 is placed within a clear area no smaller than 1/2 inch high and 1/2 inch wide, no more than 1-1/2 inches below or left from the upper right corner of the mailpiece, of the address label, or of the address area, regardless of the processing category or the postage rate claimed. c. No printing appears in the indicium area other than the information required or allowed under 3.0. d. No printing appears above or to the right of the permit information. e. The permit information is printed in no smaller than 4-point type. f. Any decorative designs intended to be part of the permit imprint indicium design appear below or to the left of the permit information in an area extending no farther than 4-1/2 inches to the left of the right edge, and 1-1/2 inches below the top edge, of the mailpiece, address area, or address label, as applicable. Such designs must not resemble or imitate a postage meter imprint, postage stamp, postcard postage, or other method of postage payment. No words or symbols are included in a decorative design used by the USPS to identify a class of mail, rate of postage, or level of service, unless such words or symbols are correctly used under the applicable standards for the mailpiece on which they appear and the corresponding postage and fees have been paid. g. All other applicable standards in 1.0 through 5.0 are met. * * * * * 5.0␣Mailings. * * * * * 5.3␣Preparation of Mailing. All pieces in a permit imprint mailing must be faced (i.e., have the address facing in the same direction) and meet the preparation standards applicable to the rate claimed. Mail claimed at a rate where postage varies by zone must be separated by zone when mailed unless authorized by the USPS. 5.4␣ Place of Mailing. Mail must be deposited and accepted at the post office that issued the permit, at a time and place designated by the postmaster, except as provided for plant-verified drop shipments. * * * * * 5.6␣Prepayment. Payment must be made for each mailing, either in cash or through an advance deposit account, before the mailing can be released for processing. Funds to pay postage must be deposited as prescribed by the USPS. If the funds paid or on deposit are less than that necessary to pay for a mailing, the difference must be paid or deposited before it or other permit imprint mailings can be accepted. Credit for postage is not allowed. Postage may not be paid partly in money and partly by postage stamps unless permitted by standard. * * * * * P200␣Second-Class Mail * * * * * 3.0␣Key Rate. * * * * * 3.5␣Termination of Key Rate Option. New authorizations to use key rates may not be granted after September 30, 1994. Publications already authorized key rates may continue to use them until March 31, 1995. Effective April 1, 1995, use of key rates is eliminated and 3.0 is deleted. An appropriate amendment to 39 CFR 111.3 to reflect these changes will be published if the proposal is adopted. Stanley F.
