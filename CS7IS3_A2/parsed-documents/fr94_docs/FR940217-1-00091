The Secretary proposes to amend parts 668 and 682 of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 668_STUDENT ASSISTANCE GENERAL PROVISIONS 1.

Section 668.1 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §668.1 Scope. (a) This part establishes general rules that apply to an institution that participates in any student financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA program). To the extent that an institution contracts with a third-party servicer to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program, the applicable rules in this part also apply to that servicer. An institution's use of a third-party servicer does not alter the institution's responsibility for compliance with the rules in this part. * * * * * 3. Section 668.2 is amended by adding definitions of ``Designated department official'', ``Initiating official'', ``Show-cause official'', and ``Third-party servicer'' to paragraph (b) in alphabetical order to read as follows: §668.2 General definitions. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* Designated department official: An official of the Department of Education to whom the Secretary has delegated responsibilities indicated in this part. * * * * * Initiating official: The designated department official authorized to begin an emergency action under §668.83. * * * * * Show-cause official: The designated department official authorized to conduct a show-cause proceeding for an emergency action under §668.83. * * * * * Third-party servicer: An individual or a State or private, profit or nonprofit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible institution to administer, through either manual or automated processing, any aspect of the institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary considers administration of participation in a Title IV, HEA program to_ (1) Include performing any function required by any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation, such as, but not restricted to_ (i) Processing student financial aid applications; (ii) Performing need analysis; (iii) Determining student eligibility and related activities; (iv) Certifying loan applications; (v) Processing SARs or output documents for payment to students; (vi) Receiving, disbursing, or delivering Title IV, HEA program funds, excluding lock-box processing of loan payments and normal bank electronic fund transfers; (vii) Conducting activities required by the provisions governing student consumer information services in Subpart D of this part; (viii) Preparing and certifying requests for advance or reimbursement funding; (ix) Loan servicing and collection; (x) Preparing and submitting notices and applications required under 34 CFR part 600 and subpart B of this part; and (xi) Preparing a Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP); (2) Exclude the following functions: (i) Publishing ability-to-benefit tests.
