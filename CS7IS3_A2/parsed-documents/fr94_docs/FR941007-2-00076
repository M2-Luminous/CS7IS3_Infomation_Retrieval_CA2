SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In November of 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy by empowering HUD's employees to more effectively serve these customers. In implementing these objectives, the Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program officials at Headquarters. On April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), the Department published a Notice revoking and redelegating program authority to meet the objectives of the reorganization for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. The Notice redelegated to Directors and Deputy Directors of Public Housing in HUD field offices and to Administrators of Field Offices of Native American Programs all powers and authorities necessary to carry out Office of Public and Indian Housing Programs within their jurisdictions. This document supersedes the April 15th redelegation, and provides further guidance to field staff concerning their specific functions and responsibilities under the programs for which all powers and authorities are hereby redelegated. Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing supersedes the prior redelegation and redelegates authority as follows: Section A. Authority Superseded The redelegation of authority contained within the revocation and redelegation of authority (FR&hyph;3696), published on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), is hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation of authority; the redelegation contained within the January 11, 1994 memorandum entitled ``Redelegation of Regional Approval Authorities'' from the Assistant Secretary for PIH to the field offices is also hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation of authority.
