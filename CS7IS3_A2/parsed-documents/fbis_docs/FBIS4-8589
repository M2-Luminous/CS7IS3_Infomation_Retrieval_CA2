Much has been said and written in the press and in public about this tragic murder that shocked the Cekini family, Unfortunately, according to what witnesses have written, my brother Selami Cela was involved in this tragedy. I know that Selami was not at the Democratic alliance meeting on 14 January, nor in any group involved in breaking up this meeting. While the meeting was taking place in the Midjeni Theater, he was with his friends in a cafe in the Rus quarter. A policeman found him there, and asked Selami to take him in his car to the Migjeni Theater. Selami agreed; when his car reached the front of the theater, he saw the participants in the meeting emerging. From the published testimonies of relatives of the late Gjovalin Cekini, I have learned that Selami traded harsh words and insults with the people coming out of the theater. Somebody hit him in the jaw, and he began to turn back toward Radio Shkoder. He also drew his revolver but did not fire it, continuing to move backwards while facing Gjovalin Cekini, who was begging him not to shoot. It was at this moment that Gjovalin Cekini was shot down and killed. Everyone believes this sincere testimony of one of Gjovalin Cekini's relatives, who saw the events of 14 January with his own eyes. I too believe it, not simply out of relief that my brother was not the killer, but because it is the testimony of one of those most affected, who was at the scene of the crime. As for the relief, I want to say that my family and I remained distressed that one of us was involved for no reason at all in a quarrel that came to a tragic end. The fact that he was slightly drunk, as his friends have told me, is no excuse. Many people know what I have just written, but what I am about to write is known only to one or two of my close friends. I want everybody to know, because everybody should know. What happened after Gjovalin Cekini's murder? On 17 January, three days after the incident, Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj summoned me urgently to Tirana. I was somewhat surprised. I had been unemployed and without pay for about 18 months. This minister had not replied to my requests for a meeting, for a job, and for an explanation of why I had been left in the lurch. Nevertheless, I went to the ministry. In the presence of two or three other people, Mr. Musaraj very courteously lamented the fact that I had been left unemployed and immediately suggested that I should start work at once as a lecturer at the Police College. I was in great need of work, but the circumstances under which the suggestion was made floored me. All Shkoder and the entire press were mentioning my brother as implicated in the murder of an innocent lad from an ordinary, poor family. It was at such a time that I was being offered work in Tirana. Agron Musaraj blithely went on to make me another proposal, without imagining that he was offending or dishonoring me. In exchange for a lecturer's job, he told me to hand in my brother, implying that the matter of 14 January would be smoothed over. I did not know where my brother was, and had not even seen him. Only our mother had seen him just before he left home. Minister Musaraj did not want a reply there and then in his office, but gave me three days to think about it. However, he did not wait three days. On the following day, 18 January, he arrived in Shkoder and asked me to go to the police station. This man who disgraces the office of minister, together with ShlK chief Fitim Meta, asked me for something that day that I would never have believed if I had not heard it with my own ears. They told me that my brother had been wounded, and had committed the murder in self-defense. My flesh crept. My mother had told me that Selami was not wounded, and in fact nobody had threatened his life opposite the Midjeni Theater. How could I agree to such disgraceful bargaining over the blood of an innocent, just-buried victim? Fitim Meta, thinking that I had failed to understand the trick, put it bluntly: "We will wound Selami, and then bring him to trial, where it will be demonstrated that he killed in self-defense. We will put him inside for a little while, then release him, and that will be an end of the matter." This is not the language of human beings, but of criminals. They wanted us to take upon ourselves a blood-score. They wanted to conclude the murder of 14 January in such a disgraceful fashion. The two people who planned this were highlevel officials of this state and members of this government for which I too had voted as a Democratic Party deputy. The earth almost gave way beneath me. At that moment, it became clear to me that my brother was not the direct murderer. It was clear to me that Gjovalin Cekini's murder really did have a political hue. The public order minister and the ShIK chief were trying to cover up this murder in a criminal fashion, and they did not turn a hair at involving another person, even offering me a good job in Tirana. I left these unscrupulous people. I did not and did not wish to see their faces again. I thought I was rid of them, but this was not entirely the case. They manage and govern with incomparable hypocrisy, and people who trust them do not know how wicked they are. I knew, and now had proof that was poisoning my life as long as I kept it to myself. I could not refrain from telling a few close friends, and thus word began to get around. Then these "angels" revealed their true faces, and used someone from Kukes to try to liquidate me in an attempted assassination. However, I did not wish to vanish without telling the truth, which is very bitter not only for myself who experienced it, but for all Albanians who do not wish to see their country setting out on the path of crime and in the hands of such immoral and unprincipled people as Agron Musaraj. The truth will require me again, but I am no longer safe here and I cannot entrust my life to criminals invested with power. I am therefore leaving Albania with a broken heart, but with the hope that justice and genuine democracy will not be long in coming.
