However, in the shadow of the beast of prey, a civilian cat, for whom experts predict a splendid future, was developed by the Tiger producer Eurocopter, a young Franco-German helicopter enterprise. The seven-seat aircraft, whose proper technical name is EC 135, is to replace the legendary Boelkow hit Bo 105, which has been in constant use as a police, rescue, and supply helicopter since its maiden flight on 16 February 1967. The first civilian helicopter jointly developed by the Germans and the French incorporates proven features of its predecessor: The four rotor blades are fed by two engines (which is not common in the class of light helicopters, but which offers additional safety); two rear flaps allow quick loading at the rear (this made the Bo 105 the optimum vehicle for rescue operations). "In addition, like the Bo 105, the new aircraft is fitted with all possible technical innovations," Elmar Compans, project manager of the EC 135 at the German Eurocopter headquarters in Ottenbrunn near Munich, stressed. The most important features are: Main rotor without bearings whose four 10-meter-long blades seem to be firmly connected with the motor shaft where other aircraft have complicated oscillation gears. The trick that makes possible the rotor inclinations required for the flight is the material. The blades are made of compound fiber materials that are self-oscillating. Thus, the material never fatigues or breaks. For this reason, there was no need for bearings or oil at the rotor, and the number of the required parts was reduced from 70 to nine. "We are flying with a dry head," the test pilot Helmut Rueckert stated. Fewer parts also mean less wear and maintenance. Project manager Compans is convinced that the EC 135 will be the most easy-to-service aircraft worldwide. "It has been common practice so far to replace certain parts even when they are still in perfect order. We have succeeded in constructing the aircraft in such a way that the parts will only be replaced if this is really necessary." Two types of engines are being offered (PW 206 B by Pratt and Whitney and Turbomeca Arrius-2B). Because a lower machine weight allows a higher payload, sheet steel and steel have been replaced by light compound fiber materials wherever possible. No other civilian helicopter contains more of this extremely strong future-oriented material. The two Eurocopter bosses Jean-Francois Bigay and Siegfried Sobotta, who gave invitations for the world premier in Bavaria today, are convinced that the EC 135, which will first be delivered in series in 1996, is not only the most modern product of its kind but, according to the current state of knowledge, it will also be clearly cheaper in its daily use than the MD 900, the U.S. eight- seat aircraft offered by the competitor McDonnel Douglas, which has been undergoing tests for one year.
