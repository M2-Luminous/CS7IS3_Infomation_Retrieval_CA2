The source declined to specify the amount produced. Endowed with rich gold deposits, this east China province has for the past 18 years led the country in gold production. Its annual growth rate in gold produced has been more than ten percent since 1986. Most of the state-owned, large gold mines performed well despite a shortage of funds and cost increases which affected many Chinese enterprises last year, according to sources.
