Following the deepening rift among the coalition parties, the House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed Thursday not to convene a plenary session on Friday to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on April 8. Political sources said the inauguration of a new cabinet may be carried over into next week. All the coalition parties other than the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned the SDP's demands to play down the wording on tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a new cabinet, the officials said. At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] told the SDP, the largest party in the eight-month alliance, that they will not accept SDP demands. The SDP demands that the term "national consensus" be inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is Shinseito head and regarded as the most probable successor to Hosokawa, told reporters that a raise in the indirect tax is necessary. Earlier in the day, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told party executives, "Please be aware that we may have to pull out of the coalition." The SDP earlier told its partners it would never drop its demands for abolition of the consumption tax and security policy coordination with China in the event of a military conflict on the Korean peninsula over the nuclear inspection row. At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition." Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also ruled out a compromise with the SDP, but hinted at efforts to bring together all forces ready to endorse the coalition's proposed policy document. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace (Foreign Minister Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we will definitely fall into confusion in two to three months." "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa declared. The standoff has revolved around two key policy fields. The non-SDP camp called for inserting into the policy document an indication of its readiness to hike the consumption tax from the current 3 percent, while the SDP demanded that a term of "public acceptance" be inserted as a prerequisite for the hike. The non-SDP camp rejected this condition, saying it would make it virtually impossible to hike the rate and secure revenues to fund increasing welfare outlays for the elderly. The SDP also demanded the insertion of wording calling for China's consent to any Japanese compliance with a possible U.N. Security Council resolution on economic sanctions on North Korea. Ozawa and Ichikawa told the coalition meeting that if China vetoed the resolution and expressed dissatisfaction over Japanese cooperation with U.S. forces, such wording could deter Japan from taking defensive military action in the event of fighting on the Korean peninsula. Ozawa earlier urged coalition partners to recognize the need for legislative preparations to empower the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to provide logistical support if U.S. warships conducted a naval blockade of North Korea. In the face of rejection, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo has asked for time to persuade other SDP leaders to rethink the issue. The secretaries general of the non-SDP camp agreed to reconvene their meeting at 8 P.M. [1100 GMT] after letting Kubo make another effort at reconciliation, coalition sources said. Kubo and SDP executives were scheduled to meet at 6 P.M. to decide whether to accept the stance of their coalition partners, the sources said. If they can reconcile their differences, the coalition allies will call a meeting of party heads to endorse the policy tenets and select Hata as their candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
