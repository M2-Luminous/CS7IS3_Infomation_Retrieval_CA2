Along with the opening-up and economic growth of the Tibet Autonomous Region, more and more overseas Tibetans are coming back to visit relatives, to sight-see and to resettle. Last year more than 100 families came back to settle down. Tibetans living abroad have helped promote their hometown economies and improved local school and hospital facilities. Tibetans are welcome to return to visit their relatives and settle down and they are free to come back and to leave again, Basang, a regional government official in charge of the reception of returned Tibetans, said at the gathering.
