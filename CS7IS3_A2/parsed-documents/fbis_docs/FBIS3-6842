It said no senior ministry officials who have retired since January went to any of the 59 major construction companies affiliated with the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors or smaller companies outside the federation. Figures released by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi after a cabinet meeting showed that the 20 retired lower-ranking who did find jobs in the industry went to smaller firms. The figure compared with the 163 former ministry employees who found employment in the construction industry after retirement in the whole of 1992. None of the 20 had seniority higher than section chief, compared with four above that rank for the same period in 1993. Since most staff retire from the ministry in April, ministry sources say the number of staff announcing their intended retirement by then differs little from the total for the year. In August 1993, the then Construction Minister, Kishiro Nakamura, officially discouraged the practice whereby its employees found postretirement positions in companies with which they had had close dealings while serving in the bureaucracy. The practice was criticized as a cause of corruption. Nakamura was arrested March 11 in a bribery case. Meanwhile, the Tokyo district court extended for 10 days the period of detention of former Construction Minister Nakamura, who was arrested on suspicion of bribe taking. The court approved the prosecutors' request for Nakamura's detention for an additional period from Wednesday to April 1, court officials said. Nakamura, 44, is suspected of receiving a 10 million yen bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. as a reward for helping quash the filing of a criminal charge by the Fair Trade Commission in connection with a bid-rigging affair in Saitama Prefecture in 1992. Since his arrest on March 11, Nakamura has refused to answer questions from prosecutors, investigative sources said.
