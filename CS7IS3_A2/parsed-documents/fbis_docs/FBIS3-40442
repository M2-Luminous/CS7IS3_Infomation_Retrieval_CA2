Launched in July 1991 as the result of a contract between Airbus Industrie and Federal Express Corporation involving 25 firm orders accompanied by 50 commitments to buy, the A300-600F program is the first aircraft of this class to be ordered in large numbers. This first aircraft turned out by the plant comes four months after they began to assemble the first sections at German Airbus in Hamburg. This first aircraft will soon embark on a campaign of test flights lasting 45 hours. The objectives: to, of course, verify its aerodynamic properties, the good working order of its systems... but also--and especially--to evaluate the performance of the FADEC [Full Authority Digital Engine Control] of the General Electric CF6-80C engines. This last-named point is important for Airbus Industrie, which is using the GE CF6-80C with FADEC for the first time in its aircraft series. In addition to the flight tests, a certain number of ground tests are planned to validate the freight-loading systems, air conditioning.... The verification and fine tuning of the "multiple choice" freight-loading system with its forward door area and rear area for handling containers have already been the subject of a certain number of tests in Breme. Furthermore, the aircraft is scheduled to be sent back to Hamburg in February, where the recently developed upper loading deck systems are to be installed. This first A300-600F is then supposed to return to Toulouse in March 1994 to be prepared for certifications of the type DGAC [General Directorate of Civil Aviation], LBA [Germany's equivalent of the FAA], and FAA [Federal Aviation Agency] (the respective certification authorities of France, Germany, and the United States), which it is expected to jointly receive in mid-April, just before it is delivered. The second aircraft of the series is at present in the middle of the assembly line in Toulouse, while the third and fourth are in different stages of production. Airbus Industrie plans to produce five or six aircraft a year. According to the manufacturer, some customers have evinced interest in the aircraft, but no more orders have been reported. "Freight is a very specialized market that represents only a very small part of our line of products. Today, most air freight is transported in the baggage holds of commercial airliners."
