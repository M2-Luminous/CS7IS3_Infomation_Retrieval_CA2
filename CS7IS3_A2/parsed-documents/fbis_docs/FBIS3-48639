Forces listed as missing or killed in the Korean war (1950-53), a United Nations Command spokesman said Thursday. It was the first meeting between the two to discuss returning and identifying the remains of U.N. Forces killed in the Korean war, the spokesman said. The contact has aroused widespread interest as the North Korean nuclear problem is nearing resolution, although the return of remains is a humanitarian matter. The two agreed to continue to meet to exchange technical information whenever necessary and to discuss forming a joint North Korea-U.S. investigation team. More than 10,000 U.N. soldiers are listed as dead or missing in the Korean war. Although 194 purported sets of remains have been returned by North Korea, there has been little progress in identifying them.
