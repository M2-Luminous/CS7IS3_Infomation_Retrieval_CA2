Security Council. Testifying at the Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, Han said a draft resolution is being worked out and would take shape around next week. "We don't feel the need to promote sanctions against North Korea outside the frame of the United Nations at the moment," the foreign minister said. With regard to China's posture, Han said China's emphasis on dialogue does not necessarily mean that they are against a Security Council resolution. "Their efforts to resolve the matter through dialogue do not run counter to ours either," he said. He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin clearly said in his recent talks with President Kim Yong-sam that his country would cooperate with South Korea in the nuclear question. On the reported plan of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to visit Pyongyang, Minister Han said he believes that given the time, his visit would be of not much help. "Now that the visit has already been planned, however, we intend to make his visit helpful," he said. "We will let him know about our position and will make him tell the North Koreans about the consequences they would face once the nuclear issue goes unsettled." Han said that the United States' policy is not to tolerate any possession of nuclear arms by North Korea. "If North Korea had nuclear weapons, the United States, U.N. Security Council and other countries will not tolerate it under all circumstances," he said. The minister said there are no unusual military movements in North Korea presently. "But, it will be a necessary and responsible act for us to secure full military deterrence especially at this time when North Korea threatens to regard any sanctions as a war declaration against them," Minister Han said. Saying the door to dialogue remains open, the minister said the situation is such that various dialogues including South-North talks can take place depending on the attitude of North Korea.
