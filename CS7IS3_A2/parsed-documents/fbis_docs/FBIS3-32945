Ever since man set foot on this earth, homo sapiens has had to be watched over and punished. Not only are the Ten Commandments a guide, but also a form of prevention and a warning to those who do not follow them. National laws, those set forth by man, are in a sense a modern replica, ever harsher but, unfortunately, apparently increasingly ineffective. All of them, starting with those handed down during the time of Moses, have pursued a single purpose: to protect morals. In this struggle, violators fall almost daily, while others escape. And yet--nor is this a purely Colombian phenomenon--immorality continues to spread and it is very frequently the high-ranking officials who are involved in cases of corruption. In our country, the list is long. However, the most disturbing fact is that these cases occur in the very institutions responsible for ensuring that justice is served and, furthermore, that justice is done. We have recently been surprised by cases such as the one involving the prosecutor responsible for overseeing the Judicial Police, Guillermo Villa Alzate. Now, the deputy prosecutor general's private secretary, Orlando Caceres Henao, is accused of extortion, apparently on the basis of conclusive evidence. All of which makes the average citizen think of the old saying to the effect that "when even salt loses its taste," we face the danger that bad examples are spreading. That is why we believe that cases of high-level corruption must be investigated most rigorously and, when the crime is proven, harshly punished. We said yesterday that the sex education so essential in our schools should be accompanied by healthy information provided to children by their parents at home. The same is true of morals and ethics. It is likewise the responsibility of fathers and mothers to teach the necessary notions so that, as adults, those children will base their conduct on the strictest standards of morality.
