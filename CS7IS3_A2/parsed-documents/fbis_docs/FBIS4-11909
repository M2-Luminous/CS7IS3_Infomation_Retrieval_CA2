We are not worried about aid that could be withheld because of such a decision or by the drug list itself or any other similar lists. What is important is who and what is behind this decision. The U.S. press a few days ago explained who is behind the decision when it revealed that certain named elements rejected a recommendation by a competent body within the U.S. Department of State to lift Syria's name from the drug list and insisted on keeping it. These elements are well known for their loyalties and bias toward the other non-Arab party in the Arab-Zionist conflict. Their stands have often obstructed the peace process to serve the Israeli party. The fact that these elements are behind this decision, indicates that the issue is not an issue of drugs or Syrian efforts to put an end to the production and distribution of such a blight. Indeed, it is a means to exert pressure on Syria to influence its stands. But Syria's stand cannot be bargained over in terms of a comprehensive and just peace in the region or the legitimate bases on which this peace should be founded. If the concern of those elements was really to combat the blight of drugs, then this concern would have been compatible with Syria's concern. Moreover, fairness would have prompted them to admit the fact sensed by every citizen in Syria and Lebanon, and even by every honest observer, that Syria has exerted serious efforts and enacted deterrent legislations aimed at uprooting this blight -- in terms of production, distribution, and addiction. However, was real the motive of those who have insisted on keeping Syria on their list to expose Syria's stand on combating drugs or to undermine Syria's stands on the issue of a just and comprehensive peace? The answer is clear by defining who is and what is behind that decision. We, in Syria, did not and will not pay heed to this list or other similar lists. We will persevere in our efforts and sustain our stands toward uprooting the blight of aggression and occupation from our occupied territories just as much as we are seeking to uproot the blight of drugs. This is in order to have security, stability, peace, and tranquility prevail in this region and to provide all necessary conditions conducive to unleashing the potential of the sons of this Arab region. As for the U.S. Administration, which has, on the issue of this list, adopted the stand of those elements well known for obstructing the Middle East peace process, we deem it our right to ask: If unfairness on such an obvious issue as combating drugs has reached this point, then how can one trust that this administration will be a fair, unbiased, and honest partner on issues that deal with the fate of the region as faced in the peace process?
