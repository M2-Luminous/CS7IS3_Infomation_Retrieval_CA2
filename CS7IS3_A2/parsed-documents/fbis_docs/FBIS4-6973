SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama said his party will do whatever it can to enact the fiscal 1994 national budget when he said at a news conference early Tuesday [26 April] morning that the party will leave the coalition. However, rough going is expected in Diet deliberations on the budget, political sources said. Murayama told reporters the SDP will consider a recent coalition agreement on tax reform, including a hike in indirect tax, "with a clean slate." This indicates discussions on tax reform may hit a snag, making it difficult for the Hata administration to pass the 1994 budget bill through the Diet before the July summit of the Group of Seven economic powers in Naples, Italy, political analysts said. They forecast the SDP may be strongly opposed to a hike in the 3 percent consumption tax to finance 6 trillion yen worth of cuts in income and residential taxes for the current fiscal year.
