"The reactions of Muslims, Croats and Serbs have left little room for optimism" Italy's diplomatic chief said here during a debate on the ex-Yugoslavia, adding how they seem more "prone to military confrontations" than accepting the European plan for three-republic confederation. The Muslims, he added, appear to have now also adopted the negotiations as a tool to buy time to re-conquer lost territory, and gaining influence among them were "external" forces and local "fundamentalist tendencies." Also taking part in the debate, organized by the Rome vicariate, was Cardinal Roger Etchegaray who underscored how a peace based on land swapping could not be a long lasting one. In Geneva, the self-proclaimed Serb and Croat republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina announced how they had hammered out an agreement to "sign a long-lasting peace" and establish "official relations...in the interest of promoting economic and political ties" adding how "no bilateral problems exist which cannot be resolved through peace means." The official negotiations in Geneva on Bosnia, mediated by the European Union and the United Nations, were postponed today until February 10, with the European Union's chief mediator, David Owen, underscoring how "the situation is very dangerous and serious" and that negotiation must continue.
