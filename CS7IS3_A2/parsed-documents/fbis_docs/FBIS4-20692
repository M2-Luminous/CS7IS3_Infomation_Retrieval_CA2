Miura and K. Harada of Sasakura Engineering Co., Ltd., Nishiyodogawa-ku, Osaka 555, Japan] [Text] The various types of concentrators have been adopted as one of the main components of product line at various kinds of systems in the industrial field. Sasakura has developed the unique concentrator to utilize it for not only process components but also for the components of treatment process of industrial waste water. Sasakura's concentrator of which type is horizontal tube evaporator with vapor compression system has significant unique design which was developed from the know-hows and experiences obtained at the desalination field. The Sasakura's concentrators are generally classified in two types in accordance with the equipment used for the compression of released vapor, one is electrical motor driven turbo blower and the other is steam jet ejector. These types of concentrators will be applied individually or jointly in series depending on the type of waste water and, therefore, can meet the wide requirement of various types of waste water. Furthermore, during the concentration process in the evaporator, evaporated vapor will be extracted from the system as product water which has sufficient quality to reuse after proper post treatment for intended service. The major features of Sasakura's concentrator are as follows. 1. Stable operation with simple control. 2. Compact design requiring small installation area. 3. Economical design with lower cost of operation and maintenance. 4. Available for wide range of plant capacity. In future, it is expected that any industrial waste water will not be allowed to discharge outside even after the neutralization to avoid the environmental disruption. Under that circumstance, we believe that Sasakura's concentrator originated from the experiences of desalination technology by way of evaporation can surely contribute to build up new reuse system of various kinds of waste water on commercial base. This paper explains the introduction of these concentrators and examples of installed experiences of waste water treatment. Case 1. Waste Water Treatment at Demineralization Plant Previous Condition Whole waste water after regeneration of ion exchange resin was sent to the outside for specific treatment to dispose. Direct discharging of waste water after neutralization may not be allowed to avoid the environmental pollution by the highly concentrated chemical components in it. Improved Condition Sasakura's concentrator, reheat type evaporator with steam jet ejector, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity by 90 percent of original one before sending it outside for disposal. The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused and recycled as the industrial fresh water. Eventually, the remarkable cost saving of waste water disposal had been performed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Waste Water Treatment at Dry Cell Battery Manufacturer Previous Condition Whole waste water, major chemical component is 5 percent sodium nitrate (NaNO[.sub]3[/]) was sent outside for specific treatment to dispose. Improved Condition Sasakura's concentrator, vacuum vapor compression type with turbo blower, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity by 87.5 percent of original one before sending it outside for disposal. The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused as the industrial fresh water. On the other hand, sodium nitrate concentration at the concentrator increases up to 40 percent and it is possible to recover the NaNO[.sub]3[/] from that concentrated waste water on commercial base. And actual plant to recover NaNO[.sub]3[/] is constructed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Waste Water Treatment at Electro Deposition System It is essential for the manufacturer carrying out the electro deposition to make the whole waste water in closed cycle and no waste water is allowed to discharge outside to avoid the environmental pollution. The waste water is mainly the washed water of metal surface before electro deposition and the rinsed water of resin at demineralization plant. The Sasakura concentrator, vacuum vapor compression type with turbo blower, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity, by more than 95 percent and the remaining 5 percent or less waste water was sent to drum dryer to solidize the waste for disposal. The dryer's size was remarkably reduced with the above concentrator. The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused as the industrial fresh water. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

Waste Water Treatment at Condenser Manufacturer The waste water was planned to recover for recycle use since the waste water contains hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrate and aluminium with its TDS is around 13,400 mg/l. The evaporator type concentrator was adopted for that purpose and its vapor release rate was determined at 1,250 kg/H. The concentrator, double effects reheat type evaporator with steam jet ejector, was particularly designed so that the heating steam from boiler may not be mixed with recovered hydrochloric acid nor concentrated waste water. At the concentrator, the purified hydrochloric acid (approx. 4 percent solution) at the distillate side and aluminium rich concentrated water (2.5 times of that in feed water) at the waste water side can be separately obtained. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.
