With this vote, they set an impressive signal -- a signal that shows that they believe in the European idea, a signal of confidence in the European Union that has become the central stability anchor of this continent, and a signal of determination that they want to participate actively and with commitment in the European peace work and Europe's new orientation. With great pleasure and encouraged by this clear plebiscite, the Austrian delegation has just signed the accession treaty. We have come a good way. Numerous friends throughout Europe have accompanied us on our path and have supported us. I would like to convey cordial thanks to all of them at this festive ceremony -- for their understanding, their assistance, and the conviction of so many Europeans that European unification is ultimately not possible without Austria. Without being presumptuous, Austria considers itself the central country in a larger Europe -- a country that can look back on a century-old tradition of actively shaping European policies. Its historical experience has led to a deep skepticism of nationalism, hatred, and intolerance, but also to a special openness for larger European structures. It is a country that has for decades belonged to the family of highly developed West European democracies because of its stability and efficiency. On this foundation, Austria has developed an extensive social network and high environmental standards. One of the goals of our participation in the European Union will be to make these achievements a yardstick for the whole of Europe. However, our experiences have also taught us a lesson about the obligations of democracy -- that its institutions must be made even more unambiguous and that they must be brought closer to the citizens. The European Union has repeatedly proven its willingness for further development and its ability for change in an impressive manner. We Austrians hope that we will be able to make an all-European contribution with our support for federalism and subsidiarity. Austria is also a country of bridges and crossings. This leads to a special understanding for the colorful variety of the cultures and traditions and a close relationship with the young democracies in our neighborhood. After decades of dictatorship, it is finally possible for them to share the values of freedom and democracy with us. They are eagerly waiting for their participation in the process of integration. I am convinced that Austria is the ideal location from where the European Union can continue its future all-European efforts. Integration and solidarity are the most effective foundations of this large peace work. Ladies and Gentlemen, more than all other European countries, the Republic of Austria saw the historic changes in Europe at close range. Its citizens know their security will continue to be indivisibly linked in the future with Europe's security. They are strongly interested in the development of an all-European system. Thus, we are looking forward to our participation in the European Union with great pleasure and confidence. We have prepared ourselves well for membership and are determined to take part in Europe's restructuring and unification to the best of our ability. May we all be granted luck and happiness.
