That figure is from the WHO, which estimates that 90 percent of the cases at the start of the next century will occur in the developing countries. Brazil alone will have 87,000 new cases over the next two years. During that period, 85,000 people will die of HIV. [passage omitted] Of the 43,964 cases recorded in Brazil so far, 10,198 were detected in 1992 alone. "One feature of AIDS is its spread to other groups. Its incidence among women and children is rising," Lair explained, and she also mentioned the growing use of drugs by young people. In an attempt to reverse the AIDS situation in our country, the Federal Government will spend $250 million on prevention campaigns over the next four years. Of that total, $160 million will come from an agreement signed with the World Bank. "The rest of it--$90 million--will be Brazil's share," says Minister of Health Henrique Santillo. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AIDS Cases in Brazil | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cases From 1980 to 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Region |Number | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Southeast |33,901 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |South |4,294 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northeast |3,523 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center-West |1,765 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |North |481 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |43,964 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |States most affected | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |State |Number | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sao Paulo |25,617 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rio de Janeiro |6,208 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rio Grande do Sul |2,149 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Minas Gerais |1,683 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parana |1,212 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bahia |970 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Campaign To Alert Young People Worried by the steadily rising incidence of AIDS among young people between the ages of 13 and 25, the Federal Government chose yesterday -- the World Day of Struggle Against AIDS -- to launch a nationwide campaign targeting young people and aimed at preventing the disease. In addition to two films that will be shown through the 12th of this month to inform young people about AIDS, the Ministry of Health has also begun distributing six million condoms throughout the country. "The main means by which the AIDS virus is transmitted to the young population are basically sex and the use of drugs," says Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the National AIDS Control Program. Showings of one of the films began yesterday on a national network. It shows a girl putting condoms in her purse before going out to meet her boyfriend. "You lose nothing by using a condom. Not even pleasure," says the film at the end. Another video that will also be shown shows a naked man taking a shower. As he steps out of the shower, he sees a trail of condoms leading to the bed where his girlfriend is. "The films are suggestive and encourage people to use condoms," says Lair Guerra. But even though the number of drug users as a percentage of all AIDS cases in Brazil has increased from 2 percent from 1986 to 26 percent this year, Planalto Palace vetoed a part of the campaign showing drug users how to sterilize needles and syringes. Considered "too strong" by President Itamar Franco's advisers, that 30-second video explained how to wash the syringe: twice in cold water, twice in bleach, and twice again in cold water. At the beginning of January [1994], the Federal Government will launch a new campaign aimed at the general public.
