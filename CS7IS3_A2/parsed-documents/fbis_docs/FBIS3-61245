They Called Out in Russia, They Responded Everywhere, in Ukraine Too. For the Elections Are Close at Hand"] [Text] Kiev-Moscow-Kiev--With assistance from the "East-East" program and the international Restoration fund, I was in Moscow on 12 December and the night before, and I can attest to the fact that if fascism or revisionism came to power there, it was surprisingly quietly. Or, as the observant poet would say, to the sound of snow falling on Moscow streets, transforming certain of them, uncleaned probably since the beginning of perestroyka, into an impassable muddy quagmire. It is as though the white snow covered up the surface with a calming shroud, but the next minute everything clumsy and uncouth, nasty and disfigured, could be seen clearly through it. Just as the real free elections showed how much darkness there is in the souls of Russians and in the attitudes of decent citizens and what they can say when there is nobody standing behind them, watching them.... The night before the "great day," only the Russian anarchists gathered, following tradition, in front of the monument to Pushkin; they rallied, and they handed out to passersby appeals that clearly "cast down" a plague on all Russian political houses: "The December elections will do nothing for us; they will merely legalize the dictatorship of the apparatchiks and the new rich speculators. But today's `communist,' nationalist, and `democratic' opposition is no better. The struggle among the politicians is not for freedom and democracy, but for power, for the right to grab more, to decide which of them will plunder and steal....but if everyone has already understood that no elections or referendums will change anything--do not go to the elections, do not vote--resist!... The parties are fighting to control the people; we are for having the people control themselves!" But the Russians did go to the polls, the elections did take place, and their results, in my opinion, are of significance for all former Union republics where elections are still to be held and particularly, of course, for Ukraine. First Lesson: Zhirinovskiy Did Not Win--the Democrats Lost Even Leon Trotsky called Hitler's Fascist Party a "party of counterrevolutionary despair," because the brownshirts came to power using populist slogans as, incidentally, the Bolsheviks also once did, playing on the atmosphere of government instability and attitudes of no confidence either in the present or in the future on the part of the majority of simple citizens. Vladimir Volfovich's political formula was also simple: If you want power, press on the sore spots, on the "pet corns" of the Russians, who are suffering from nervous exhaustion, promise them a "great Russia" and expose their "traitors" and enemies. And it is desirable to do this frequently, persistently, and simply enough for a moron to understand. Zhirinovskiy did this. And today it is not so important that even before the session of the State Duma he abandoned the majority of his propositions. The magic of simple-calming, optimistic-encouraging words had done its work. I was told about the following episode at an election precinct. One young person was asking another: "Who did you vote for?" "For Zhirinovskiy," was the answer. "What do you mean?!"--the first one was surprised, making a gesture as though the other were crazy. "And why not, look at what this will do to the country," the second one defended his position. And this is instructive: Zhirinovskiy was operating in a strange mixture of hope and hopelessness, belief in the possibility of change and disbelief in the idea that any of the current leaders would do anything real. And the Russian democrats? They, unfortunately, as we know, were unable to join together. Possibly in fact they, as Gaydar said, are capable of doing this only two hours before the shooting starts, but this is the most important lesson for Ukrainian reformers: They need unity. I returned to Kiev with a Ukrainian businessman who has an office and a firm in Berlin, works through Moscow, and expects Kiev to provide stability and certainty. He explained the Russian situation to me in his own way: "If you need a razor to shave, you go to the store. And if you see many good razors there but they are all of the same kind, differing only in appearance, you might not choose any of them but buy one somewhere where the selection is simple but there is only one choice." Thus the esteemed democrat reformers "a la Ukraine" as we already know today are offering us a diversity of political views with various nuances. The main mistake of the Russian democrats was in tactics: Along with their personal ambitions, they were counting on the idea that by separating they could offer the voters various versions of the democratic option (thus, if Gaydar does not suit you--vote for Shakhray or Yavlinskiy), but the voters demanded clarity. The democrats of Russia did not take into account the low level of political sophistication of the electorate. And there is one more thing which, in my view, requires no commentary. Even on the day before the elections, the executive committee of Russia's Choice wrote: "It is already possible to sum up certain results of the brief but noisy campaign (election--V.S.). It is obvious to everyone that it took place according to the pattern of '12 against one.' One was the Russia's Choice bloc and 12--the other participants in the political race. ....The methods of the battle between the `people's defenders' and the `strict reformers' was the same as before: accusations bursting from the television screens but not confirmed by anything, insidious hints anonymously released to the mass media, appeals to the very worst instincts." And so, esteemed participants in the Ukrainian race, if you really believe that Ukraine needs reforms, agree on which specific ones and allow as little ambition and underhandedness as possible and encourage as much analysis and tolerance as possible. The Second Lesson: Reforms Are Needed in Any Case The strangest phenomenon in Ukraine after the elections in Russia might be the appearance of attitudes indicating something like this: You see where the Russian reforms led--first of all, the people were impoverished and then, against this background, the fascists came to power. Of course, such assertions make a certain amount of sense. But on the other hand: Have the people in Ukraine been any less impoverished? Probably much more so; our standard of living is considerably lower than the Russians'. And herein lies the basic and principal distinction between the Russian and Ukrainian situations. "Gaydareconomics," which is based on "shock therapy," actually did lower the standard of living of the people, but it launched the reforms and so it gave them a light at the end of the tunnel, namely--hope of improvement. But in Ukraine the standard of living has declined without any reforms. The external appearance of reforms has frequently even discredited the very idea of reforms when they are discussed, and property is being quietly stolen under a barrage of verbiage. But this kind of "reform Ukrainian-style" should in no way deter the future political elite from reforms. The only thing that can really be learned from the Russian experience, in my opinion, is this formula: as little shock as possible and as much therapy as possible. If, of course, this is possible under our present conditions. And our voters too must make a certain choice and not make a mistake. For we too could have our own Zhirinovskiy. But he would capitalize not on the idea of a "great Ukraine" but on the need to impose order with a strong hand. Both orthodox and turncoat communist-socialists of Ukraine fit this role better than others. The Third Lesson: If You Help the Democrat, You Will Have To Deal With His Opposite In Ukraine people have been saying frequently that it is necessary to join forces with real Russian democrats because, they say, herein lies the guarantee of our independence. And even based on Vinnichenko's definition of the Russian democrat, which ends where Ukrainian independence begins, this assertion has been true. It seems to me that perhaps we should have been more oriented toward Russian pragmatists, but we had to find political partners among those who, because of various convictions, have recognized Ukraine's uniqueness to one degree or another. And this had to be done persistently and concretely. Then we would not have had today's deficit of the Ukrainian-Russian trade balance, which is not in favor of Ukraine, such an immense amount of indebtedness, and such a lack of regulation of the mechanism for mutual settlements. But, as our president says, we have what we have. But joint actions among democrats will become considerably more crucial after these elections. Because the Russian Government will inevitably have to take into account the attitudes of the political forces represented in the State Duma of Russia. And we know what Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, et al think about Ukraine, so economic and political pressure on Ukraine will increase. Therefore, official Kiev must prepare for this even today and in some way or another be concerned about how we will pay for Russian energy sources in January. I personally would be in favor of reforms, freedom of the producer, free exports, which would provide the necessary freely convertible currency, concrete negotiations with Russia, and a business alliance with its healthy political forces. But I am a journalist, and our leadership, perhaps, has learned different lessons....
