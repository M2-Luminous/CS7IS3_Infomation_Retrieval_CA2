Addressing a public rally, Klaus said that the way of thinking of DEU members was close to what they themselves called "anti." "The DEU looks into the past and believes that this way leads somewhere," Klaus said. "The rear mirror of a car cannot be bigger than its front wind screen. I am afraid that Mrs.Hromadkova and people in her vicinity have not understood this at all," he said. "We live in a democratic society where freedom of assembly and forming organizations is guaranteed and the appearance of such a party is thus natural," Klaus said. The DEU, constituted on June 18, calls in its manifesto for barring former higher communist party officials, agents of the secret police (StB) and members of extremist parties and movements from civil service. The manifesto says that the DEU will seek the enactment of the non-proscription of the crimes of communism. Alena Hromadkova, DEU chairwoman, is a sociologist and economist by education. She had never been a member of any party. She signed the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and was one of its spokeswomen in 1991. At a press conference on June 23 Hromadkova said that the DEU wanted to attract to its ranks those Czechs who feel deceived or disappointed by political developments.
