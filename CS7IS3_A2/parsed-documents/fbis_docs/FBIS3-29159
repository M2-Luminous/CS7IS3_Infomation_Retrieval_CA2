In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the budget proposal sets aside 882 billion yen to acquire front-line weapons, including four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767 AWACS reconnaissance planes, officials said. The purchases will double the number of AWACS planes, which could be used to detect a possible firing of North Korean missiles or an intrusion by Russian jet bombers or missiles into Japanese airspace, the officials said. In view of "still unstable security factors surrounding Japan," the government sanctioned a Defense Agency request to purchase new radar for its Patriot antimissile system and sophisticated computer software to enhance the intercepting capability of Japan's armory of 320 Patriot missiles, an official said. Under the current five-year defense buildup plan, officials said, Japan is trying to expand the Patriot armory from 16 to 26 firing units -- or a total of 520 Patriots to be fired from 130 mobile launching vehicles. The fresh Patriot radar and firing control system will cost 33.5 billion yen, while a set of Patriot parts and computer software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said. The software will raise the capability of eight of Japan's Patriot units to the level of the PAC-2 Patriot missiles -- the same models used by U.S. troops during the 1991 Gulf war to knock out Iraqi SCUD missiles, they said. One firing unit comprises five mobile launching vehicles, a phased array antenna, 20 missiles and another radar vehicle. But unless Japan acquired the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system -- an improved version of the PAC-2 Patriot -- it would not be able to shoot down North Korean Nodong-1 missiles, which are reportedly capable of delivering nuclear warheads, they said. North Korea is now under international pressure to allow inspections of suspected nuclear weapons plants in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Yoshiaki Hotsuki, special assistant for the defense buildup program of the agency's defense policy bureau, told reporters, "the PAC-2 Patriot system cannot repel the Nodong missile, so we are watching how far the United States has developed the TMD system." The Defense Agency had originally pushed for purchases of the AWACS and Patriots to counter the threat of Russian jet bombers and missiles, whose longer ranges are seen placing a greater limit on Japan's intercepting time and capability, the officials said. Now the agency says the North Korean missiles have given it another headache. The 1993 defense white paper warned, "the Nodong missile will be able to reach most parts of Japanese territory if Pyongyang deploys it to specific areas on its soil." The fiscal 1994 defense budget accounts for 0.948 percent of Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994. Meanwhile, the budget boosts its allocations toward the costs of U.S. Forces in Japan by 8 percent to 432.4 billion yen. Of this sum, 123.4 billion yen is to pay 75 percent of the labor costs of some 22,000 Japanese employees at U.S. bases in Japan, utilities and other costs.
