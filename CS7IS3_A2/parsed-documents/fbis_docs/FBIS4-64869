The president of the Generalitat [autonomous community of Catalonia], Jordi Pujol, maintains in his many contacts with the government leadership that this is the key in undertaking the drastic remedy which the current situation requires. "Anything that is not like this, or similar to it, will make general elections inevitable," Pujol commented. Jordi Pujol does not ask for anyone to resign, at least not publicly. His position reaches to the very top of the government and claims to protect Felipe Gonzalez from opposition attacks, primarily from the People's Party and the United Left [IU], but also, according to some of his collaborators, from the government ranks. Yesterday, Pujol came out against the People's Party and IU proposal calling for Felipe Gonzalez's resignation if the Socialists are to form a new government. "Such a government would be more fragile than one led by Gonzalez," Pujol argued. Pujol feels that bringing the elections forward in order to get out of the current situation of "confusion and commotion," would be a "fiasco." "At this time, elections are neither a logical solution nor the best one," Pujol said yesterday morning at the Barcelona stock exchange, speaking to several hundred businessmen. In the afternoon, Pujol stressed that the CiU [Convergence and Union] was continuing to support the government because the only alternative would be to call new elections. "There is no other alternative, either arithmetically or politically, to our policy but to call elections," at which point he said, "the time has not yet come." Pujol reiterated that, given that there are to be elections in Andalusia and European elections, the general elections could not be held within the next six months. Pujol, who said everything in the conditional tense, repeated his thesis that if there is not a quick reaction from the government regarding the corruption problem, the political situation could make it advisable to call elections. Although he said that we cannot know what will happen in the coming months, he emphasized that preventing the elections from being moved forward is up to "the ruling party, which has the parliamentary seats and the power." He added that the country's ability to be governed "does not depend on the CiU, which, in any case, plays a complementary role." Pujol, who affirmed that the "responsibility of a politician is put to the test during the tough times, like the current period," appealed to the government to "calmly" tackle the current political crisis.
