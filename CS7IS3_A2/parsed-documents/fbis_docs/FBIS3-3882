The Japanese are here to discuss Japan's reparations to Taiwan soldiers drafted by the Japanese Government to fight abroad during World War II, when Taiwan was still under the Japanese occupation. Big differences remain between the two sides, with the Japanese side only willing to discuss six issues, including the amount of the soldiers' back salaries, their bank deposits, and insurance payments still due them, Liu said after the meeting. Given that the Japanese Government has said it would compensate only 20 times the face value of the bank deposits, and the Taiwan side is demanding a 7,000-fold return, more rounds of talks will be needed to bridge the huge gap, Liu said.
