The khaki clad and heavily armed rightists had camped at the Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] air strip for most of the day. Shortly before 4.30pm, there were up to 400 vehicles filled with the right wingers at the air strip and they finally formed a long convoy heading towards the South African border and the Western Transvaal. The rightists were all gone by shrtly before 6pm, according to reports. The rightists had made it difficult for journalists covering the crisis in Bophuthatswana to interview them -- or even approach the BDF air strip. It was not immediately clear what prompted the final departure -- but there was speculation in Mmabatho the retreat was prompted by the arrival of SA Defence Force troops whose task, in conjunction with the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, is to restore order in the strife-torn territory. At least three of the invadors were killed execution style after being ambushed by Bophuhatswana security force members.
