Our correspondents Ivana Anyzova and Milan Repka have been following today's developments there. [Repka] The speaker of the Polish Sejm, Jozef Oleksy, said after the talks with Czech parliament speaker Milan Uhde that Polish and Czech views of the integrational process into European structures and of basic principles on which a united Europe should be built were identical. Jozef Oleksy went on to say that some media claims that the Czech Republic did not favor regional cooperation within the Visegrad Group were regarded as issues of no lesser importance and that the Polish side expected to receive an answer to these issues. Oleksy added that the explanation the Polish delegation received in this respect was satisfactory. Asked by Czech radio whether the Partnership for Peace project was also discussed during the meeting with the Czech parliament speaker Milan Uhde, Jozef Oleksy said that this issue was discussed, too, and that, in his view, the Czech side's approach to the signing of this agreement, which was already signed by Poland, was rather cautious. In this connection it is noteworthy, however, that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus is to sign this agreement on 10 March. Answering a question by a Polish journalist as to whether the Polish delegation discussed also requests related to the return of property to Polish associations, Speaker Oleksy replied that he discussed this issue during all his official talks with the Czech side. [Anyzova] Regarding this issue, Czech Parliament Speaker Milan Uhde told Czech radio that he did not recall that this topic had been brought forward during his talks with the Polish Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy in the Czech parliament today. Milan Uhde then told Czech radio that although this issue has not been officialy addressed, he himself was aware that some Polish, mostly cultural associations active within the Polish national minority, were claiming back the property, which was once Polish, including the property of various legal entities which was first of all confiscated from these associations by the Germans. These associations claim that this property has been returned neither by the Czechoslovak nor the Czech Government. According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, it is not absolutely clear whether this issue goes back before February 1948. In conclusion, Milan Uhde added that nobody on the Czech side has considered this issue in detail so far.
