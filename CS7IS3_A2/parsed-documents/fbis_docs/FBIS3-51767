In an article that appeared in the TRABAJADORES weekly, Leon Cotayo based his appraisal on Watson's statements during recent meetings with a sector of the Cuban community in Miami. The columnist referred specifically to the 6 January meeting which was called by the high-ranking State Department official "to render accounts to a Cuban group on the U.S. Government's policies regarding the island." In this respect, Leon Cotayo asserted, Watson defended the continuation of the blockade; supported the so-called Torricelli Law, which intensifies the blockade; and conditioned the cessation of this policy on a change in the Cuban political and economic system. The columnist added that Watson had predicted the collapse of the revolution in the Caribbean nation as if such predictions had not been made since the blockade was intensified in 1990. In Leon Cotayo's opinion, "it was another demonstration of Watson's commitment to the right-wing representatives of the Cuban community established in Miami." It showed, the Cuban columnist added, Watson's inclination to back "the most varied, loud, and illusory conservative demands presented by this group and to handle the issue not as a foreign policy issue, but as an internal U.S. affair." According to Watson's logic, Leon Cotayo indicated, if Cuba is basically an internal problem, it is not unrelated to the electoral process, and, therefore, the positions of the Cuban groups must be taken into account, especially the positions of those with more financial resources, political influence, and a clear loyalty to Washington's interests. Nevertheless, it is still surprising that "high-ranking officials of a government that wants to systematically hold the reins of the world are, somewhat abjectly, willing to travel to a southern community in their extensive country to explain their policies to frustrated annexationist groups." Leon Cotayo concludes: "Watson must assume the sad image which mixes a buffoon -- and, indeed, a buffoon of a town rather than a court -- with a vulgar vote grabber who is working the streets of Miami."
