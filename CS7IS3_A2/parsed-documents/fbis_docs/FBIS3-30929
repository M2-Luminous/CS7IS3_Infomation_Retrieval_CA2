That is why I would like to clarify for our public the conclusion reached at the meeting. We concluded that a cease-fire should go into effect on the Sarajevo front tomorrow [10 February] at 1200 [1100 GMT]. At 1200, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] patrols should proceed to the following locations: Zuc, Golo Brdo, Borije, Vidikovac, Grbavica, that is, the Brotherhood and Unity Bridge, and Dobrinja to establish whether the cease-fire is being observed, so that we can proceed to the next phase, which is collecting heavy Serbian weaponry. We will collect all the heavy weaponry -- that is, all of the Serbian weaponry over a 12.7-mm caliber. According to our estimate, this phase would, according to today's agreement, last some five days, after which the weapons would be immobilized; therefore, demobilized, rendered useless, ammunition and artillery pieces would be sorted out into separate groups and would be placed in a row of barracks where it could be efficiently controlled by UNPROFOR, or rather where efficient control would be possible. The enemy has accepted these conditions and, therefore, they came; I think that their delegation was headed by their chief of staff, General Milovanovic. [sentence as heard] Prior to beginning the talks, they announced that they had been fully authorized for this meeting pertaining to the withdrawal of heavy weaponry. If this agreement is not implemented, we will consider today's agreement invalid. [Babic] Generals Jovan Divjak and Mustafa Hajrulahovic contributed additional clarifications. [Divjak] We exclusively discussed the cease-fire and decided that UNPROFOR should set up control posts in order to establish if the cease-fire is being violated. What is important is the fact that the Serb army must withdraw its artillery in the next five days and place it in those areas where UNPROFOR forces will be able to control it. General Rose implied that during the next phase -- since this agreement will be carried out in phases -- we will discuss other provisions of Resolution 824. However, this is conditioned by the withdrawal of the artillery and its being placed under control as requested by our delegation. [Hajrulahovic] I believe that we should stress that we know in detail the number of chetnik weapons and artillery pieces around Sarajevo; we know all the coordinates of these weapons -- artillery pieces, that is -- so, in order to avoid a regrouping of the forces, we proposed submitting a complete map with all the [word indistinct] weapons and artillery pieces. This would serve to prevent the aggressor's side from regrouping the weapons on some other part of the front in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Babic] One of the questions for President Izetbegovic pertained to what the Bosnian side intended to undertake if the Serbs should violate the cease-fire. [Izetbegovic] We believe that as of 1200 tomorrow, and in the course of the next five days, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the establishment of the locations to which it should be withdrawn should begin. Therefore, we shall consider that the agreement has been violated if the Serb side refuses to withdraw the heavy weaponry, if in the meantime an attack, a bombardment of the city should occur, and if the snipers do not refrain from their activities. We will then consider the agreement invalid. [Babic] In response to what would happen to the Bosnian weapons, Izetbegovic said: [Izetbegovic] All this is being done in accordance with Resolutions 824 and 836, according to which we are not under any obligation to put any type of weaponry under [UNPROFOR] control. This does not mean that we are not ready to place our heavy weaponry under control. However, we are under no obligation to do so, but this does not exclude our readiness to do so. We will probably do so, providing the Serbs place their weapons under control. However, this is the first task that needs to be accomplished.
