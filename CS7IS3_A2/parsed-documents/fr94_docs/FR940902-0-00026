FR940902-0-00026 FR940902-0-00010 Definitions The interim final rule at ยง626.5 added a significant number of definitions of terms used throughout the JTPA and regulations. Definitions of the terms ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'', ``family'', ``family income'', ``obligations'', ``stand-in costs'', and ``vendor'' received the most comments. Commercially available off-the-shelf training package. At the outset, the wording of the term being defined is changed. In the interim final rule the term was ``commercially available or off-the-shelf training packages;'' in the final rule, the word ``or'' is dropped so that the term being defined reads ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages''. The reason for this change is that both the Act and the definition require that a training package be both commercially available and available at off-the-shelf prices. Practically, availability at off-the-shelf prices is subsumed within the broader concept of commercial availability. Several commenters submitted comments on the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'', contained in ยง626.5. The basis of this definition is the definition of a commercial product found in part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). First of all, the Department acknowledges that there is a degree of uncertainty regarding which training packages and their providers fall within the meaning of commercially available off-the-shelf. The term, as defined within ยง626.5, relies generally upon whether the package is provided in a commercial market in which it is available to the public. This was the origin of the language ``sold to the public'' and that related to ``catalogue or market prices''. These business concepts are indicators of the training package's availability to the public, e.g., a catalogue available to the public or a public, advertised price shows that the entity is seeking to engage in commerce. The Department believes that most parties understand the basic meaning of whether any package is ``commercially available.'' Some related areas of the definition are discussed further below. A second area of inquiry pertains to the contents of the package. The training will consist of classroom and related practical instruction, which may include hands-on experience. It may consist of the development of occupational or education-related skills. For example, a package may provide occupational training to a participant as a nurse practitioner, as a maintenance mechanic, or in computer design, in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or may provide basic skills in reading and computation. The package may consist of a necessary assessment of interests, aptitudes, and abilities, as well as counseling and guidance related to participant progress and employment prospects. Such a training package will not normally consist of the kind of assistance typically provided within the meaning of a JTPA supportive service, but may include fees, books and other materials needed for participation and completion of the package. In other words, if an organization offers training to the general public which consists solely of a practical training course in a particular occupation, it is that course, without any other placement or assessment services, which may be purchased as a commercially available training package. On the other hand, if the organization offers assessment or placement services to the public as part of its training course, those services will be a part of the commercially available package. A key indicator, however, is whether the contents of the package are generally available and generally the same for all participants, not just JTPA participants. Finally, commenters raised questions about the type of entity that might provide the commercially available package. A variety of entities may be the source of a commercially available package; however, the characteristics of the package, that is, whether they meet the tests of commercial availability at off-the-shelf prices, are more of an indicator than the entity that provides it. Such entities may include those that provide computer-based instruction in a variety of occupational and educational topical areas, or they may be public and private schools, academies or other entities that offer training that is commercially available, as discussed above. A few commenters requested that the phrase ``performance criteria'' be defined, and the definition now includes language that addresses the reference to ``performance criteria''. ``Performance criteria'' may generally fall into two or more areas that reflect the necessary components and features of the package that is to be delivered, such as (1) grade requirements, knowledge, skills, and competencies which may be expected to be attained by students, and (2) where appropriate, participant attainment as manifested by job placement. This latter component is contingent upon whether the service is regularly offered and may be reasonably included in the package. A few commenters were concerned with the requirement that the packages be unmodified. They indicated that, in many instances, a commercially available training package may be modified to some degree to reflect the special needs of the JTPA population, without changing its basic content. A strict reading of the regulation would prohibit contracting for commercially available packages which are modified in any way, regardless of whether the package remains substantially the same. In addition, this strict reading would prohibit the JTPA program from taking advantage of a discounted price that might be offered in connection with multiple purchases of the package. The Department does not intend that a local program be prohibited from purchasing a commercially available package at a discounted price. In order to respond to this comment, the Department further conforms the definition to the concepts in the FAR, and the word ``unmodified'' is removed. This change recognizes that some modifications may be made to a package to meet special JTPA requirements, just as a commercial entity would offer to other customers, while the package remains substantially similar to that regularly offered. A test for whether the package remains substantially the same as that regularly offered is whether the modification does not involve an increase in the catalogue price. An increase in catalogue price would indicate that the package is not substantially the same. However, a price decrease due to such things as volume discounts or good negotiating is not, in itself, indicative of a modified package. Another test is whether the same training components continue to be offered in the package. A difference in the training components would indicate that the package may not be substantially the same. All of these tests should be considered in determining whether a training package meets the definition. Further, JTPA funds should not be used to make any modification to a training package. Should training packages be modified in order to conform to JTPA requirements, they may be considered commercially available off-the-shelf only if they comply with the remaining requirements listed in the definition. Thus, while some modification is possible, the definition is not intended to include ``customized training,'' training designed solely to meet the special needs of an individual or group of JTPA participants.
