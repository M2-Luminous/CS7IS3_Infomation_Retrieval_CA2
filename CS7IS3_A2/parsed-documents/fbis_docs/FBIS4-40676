During the conversation the problems of a peace settlement of the Karabakh conflict were discussed. The Armenian position on the matter is unequivocal: There is no alternative to peace in the region. But a forced confrontation has reached such a level that guarantee of peace cannot be achieved without bringing in disengaging forces and international observers in the conflict zone. There is practically no contradiction between the Russian and CSCE peacemaking programs. It is now up to Azerbaijan's good will.
