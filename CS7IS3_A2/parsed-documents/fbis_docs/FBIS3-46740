FBIS3-46740 "dreas003_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-003 Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition To Amend Provision on Miniparties OW0501121994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1203 GMT 5 Jan 94 OW0501121994 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The ruling coalition agreed Wednesday [5 January] to modify a proposed legal requirement that the Diet refuse to allocate House of Representatives seats to miniparties that failed to muster 3 percent of valid votes cast at the most recent national election, coalition officials said. The agreement came at a meeting of the executives of seven coalition partners at the coalition's political reform headquarters, the officials said. Both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] have been demanding that the controversial provision be removed from a government-proposed package of four political and electoral reform bills. The electoral bill calls for replacing the current 511-member lower chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat constituencies and proportional representation system with an additional 226 seats distributed on a nationwide basis. The so-called "3-percent requirement" would oblige the Diet to deny miniparties that failed to win 3 percent of eligible votes any seats that would be appropriated to bigger parties that met the requirement in proportion to the number of votes they had mustered in single-seat constituencies. The provision also means that unless a party has the record of winning 3 percent of votes in the most recent national election, it is not qualified to receive an official subsidy to finance its political activities from a proposed fund of 30.9 billion yen. Earlier in the day, Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, first dropped the hint that the coalition may accept an opposition demand to soften the 3 percent requirement. The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would undermine the diet's ability to translate into national policies the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes. Yamahana told the House of Councillors' special committee on political reform, "The most crucial thing is to legislate the package. We will do our utmost by responding sufficiently to arguments between the ruling coalition and opposition camp." The committee kicked off the new year's first deliberations after an eight-day recess, but the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) boycotted the session. In a meeting of committee managers earlier in the day, the LDP demanded that the resumption of debates be postponed until Thursday, parliamentary sources said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the committee session that reconvened in the morning the LDP's boycott is "very regrettable." "It is our heavy responsibility to settle the political reform matter in order to revive public trust in politics," he said. The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to complete debate on political reform at the committee "by January 14" even if the LDP continued to boycott the committee sessions, coalition officials said. The package cleared the House of Representatives on November 18, but deliberations had stalled since then due to a parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a payoff scandal involving Hosokawa. The LDP has alleged Hosokawa took a 100 million yen unreported payoff from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. Hosokawa dismissed the allegation, saying it was a mere "loan" he claimed he had repaid. Hosokawa has staked his political career on enactment of the reform package in the current Diet session, due to end January 29. Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist, told a meeting of the executives of Shinseito, of which he is co-leader, that the coalition should seek to push the package through the upper house "by January 20, even if its passage were delayed." "If parliamentary proceedings went without hindrance, we would be able to secure its passage through the House of Councillors plenary session on January 17," he said. "The most serious point would come on January 20 if its passage were delayed," said Ozawa, who is widely regarded as the most powerful behind-the-scenes figure in Hosokawa's coalition government.
