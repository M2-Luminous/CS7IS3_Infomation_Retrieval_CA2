FR941102-0-00080 FR941102-0-00021 (3) The conditions under which fading could be expected. (4) Whether there is any reason to believe that acrylic lenses are more subject to this type of degradation than polycarbonate lenses. (5) Whether the commenter has observed faded lenses in service and, if so, what views the commenter has about the cause of the fading. (6) Whether the three-year test of SAE J576, conducted in Florida and Arizona, is sufficient to identify plastic materials prone to fade in color. (7) The kind of test procedure that would be effective and practicable for testing lenses or plastic materials used in lenses to detect any propensity to fade significantly in service. Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, Trucklite, and Thomas Loughran. The commenters believe that the three year weathering test of SAE J576 is adequate to identify plastic materials that are prone to fading. Acrylic materials do not appear to have a greater tendency to fade than polycarbonate materials. Peterson has observed that dyes used in acrylic material darken slightly as a result of sustained exposure to sunlight. TSEI reported that the only faded lenses in service which have been observed by its membership have been identified as made of noncomplying materials. Mr Loughran suggested that faded lenses result from the practice of blending virgin and reground material with additional dye at the time of molding. Ford suggested that a modified xenon accelerated weathering test would be effective for testing colored plastic materials for their propensity to fade in service. This test would be configured to correlate with the three year weathering test. The object of accelerated testing with xenon lamps would be increased productivity rather than increased accuracy of detection. The comments were unanimous in supporting the existing rule as an effective and sufficient test for dye loss of lamp and reflector materials. However, it appears from Mr. Loughran's comment that the uncontrolled use of reground material and added dye can create noncomplying plastic material to a greater degree than the lamp industry recognizes. NHTSA believes that the fading problem observed by the petitioner is the likely result of lamp manufacturing practices brought to its attention by Mr. Loughran. Accordingly, there appears to be no reason to change the present weathering test. With respect to Mr. Loughran's comments, NHTSA takes this opportunity to present its views on the obligations of a manufacturer of reflex reflectors. The haze requirement is imposed by S5.1.2 upon ``plastic materials used in optical parts''. SAE Standard J594f ``Reflex Reflectors'' January 1977 as incorporated into Standard No. 108 at 3.2 references the plastic material test of SAE J576. This imposes an obligation upon the manufacturer of a reflex reflector to use plastic materials meeting J576. Thus, the manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that its acts do nothing to negate the conformance of the raw material with the tests of J576 when it is fashioned into reflectors. A weathering test performed by NHTSA and comments to the docket suggest that lamp manufacturers need to take care that their coating practices actually meet the specifications used by plastic manufacturers to certify material properties. NHTSA's test included coated and uncoated ``Lexan'' samples exposed in Florida and Arizona. The uncoated samples failed the test visually as well as by the development of more than 7 percent haze before the end of the first year at both exposure sites. At the end of the second year, the coated Arizona sample had developed slightly less than 7 percent haze, but haze was plainly visible. The coated Florida sample had failed in both respects with 10.5 percent haze after a two-year exposure. Its uncoated mate had developed 10.3 percent haze in one year. At the end of the third year, the large haze reductions of the coated specimens, seen after one- and two-years exposure, had disappeared. Both Arizona specimens had slightly less than 20 percent haze and both Florida specimens had slightly more than 30 percent haze. The 24-month results were available at the time of the NPRM and were placed in the docket.
