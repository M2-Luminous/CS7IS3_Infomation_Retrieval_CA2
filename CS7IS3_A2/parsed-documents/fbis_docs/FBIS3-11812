On landing at the Mexico City International Airport, Chretien said that Mexico becomes more and more important for Canada. "It is truly a pleasure for me to have arrived in Mexico for my first official visit, from which I expect good results for both countries," he said. According to a Foreign Relations Secretariat report, bilateral trade between Canada and the United States amounts to $3 billion annually and will soon total $5 billion. The document says that, in the framework of NAFTA, the delegates in charge of debating antidumping and subsidies as related to the agreements between Mexico, United States, and Canada are expected to determine the corresponding codes prior to 31 December 1995. The document adds that in the next five years the three countries will spend approximately $30 million in a three-nation program to improve the qualification of human resources in Mexico and the technical level of the country's universities and industries. "Through an enterprise council, the private initiative will participate in the creation of training standards." In addition, Canada wishes to explore the possibility of creating a technical and scientific cooperation sub-group in the Mexico-Canada Ministerial Commission, similar to a sub-group recently established between Mexico and the United States. The sub-group would attend to matters related to scientific exchange programs between the two countries, human resources follow-up, technology transfer, and environment protection and improvement programs. The two countries approved the creation of the sub-group, which is expected to meet at the next Ministerial Commission's session, according to the Foreign Relations Secretariat. It has also been reported that a new proposal for a memorandum of understanding on fishing cooperation that the Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans presented to the Mexican Fisheries Secretariat is still being negotiated. According to bilateral agreements, Mexican inspectors at Canada's request would travel to eastern Canadian provinces in the first week of April 1994 to conduct phytopathological inspections of apple orchards. The Canadian Government's request to lift the current tariffs on wheat and barley exports to that country is also being studied. Several enterprises consider the possibility of investing in energy and mining. The enterprise Canada World Construction will spend 300 million new pesos to mine granite and limestone in Izucar de Matamoros. Campbell Resources will prospect for and mine gold. In this first visit, the prime minister will attend the closing of the industrial and services exposition, Canada Expo-94, where more than 450 enterprises are represented and which is Canada's largest commercial venture abroad. President Salinas reportedly had dinner with Chretien yesterday. The prime minister today is scheduled to meet with Salinas at the Los Pinos official residence. Chretien will meet with Mexican congress members and offer a reception at the Banco General de Canada. He will also meet with Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez, will stand at attention at the Homeland's Altar, and hold a news conference at the Canadian Embassy.
