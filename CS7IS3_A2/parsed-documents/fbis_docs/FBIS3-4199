This was the consensus and a hot topic among deputies at the recently closed session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). Most of the deputies held that the persistence of social stability has promoted the reform and economic progress. And in return reform and economic progress are helping maintain long-term stability in the country. "This is the fundamental experience of the 15 years of reform and opening to the outside world in China," they said. The maintenance of social stability in this huge country with a population of 1.1 billion while facing an arduous and complicated transfer of the economic system is regarded as a miracle by many foreigners. While carrying out the reform, China attaches importance to its own conditions and has adopted different methods for different stages. The reform first started in rural areas, and new reform measures are usually taken after experiments and then spread step by step. The pursuit of the reform has never been conducted at the cost of lowering the living standards of the people. Over the past 15 years the national economy has made a sustained and rapid development. The gross domestic product increased from 358.8 billion yuan (about 44 billion U.S. dollars) in 1978 to 3,138 billion yuan (about 404 billion U.S. dollars) last year. The per capita income of urban residents went up from 343 yuan a year in 1978 (38.5 U.S. dollars) to 2,337 yuan (262.5 U.S. dollars) last year; and the per capita income of rural residents increased from 145 yuan a year (16.29 U.S. dollars) in 1978 to 921 yuan (103.48 U.S. dollars) in 1993. Consequently, peasants' living standards have been improved greatly. Color TV sets, video-recorders, washing machines and refrigerators have become common appliances, no longer luxury goods, for most Chinese. The country's markets are brisk, with adequate supplies, and the cultural life is now more colorful. With the deepening of economic reform, democracy and legislation efforts have been greatly enhanced in state political activities. The people's congress and multi-party democratic consultation systems have been much improved. The Chinese people now enjoy much more democracy and freedom. At the recent session of the NPC and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, deputies offered more than 1,000 proposals and opinions on key state tasks, and political, economic, cultural and diplomatic affairs. China's top leaders attended each delegation's discussions to listen to their opinions and criticisms. The Chinese people are deeply involved in the country's reform and construction, and cherish the current social stability. 1994 is a key year for China to carry out a series of new reforms in finance, taxation and enterprises. The Chinese Government pledged to adopt measures to ensure the progress of reform and economic development under conditions of social stability. The Chinese Government has set the economic growth rate at nine percent for 1994, in the bid to avoid inflation caused by excessive investment and construction scale. The financial reform will be centered on strengthening the functions of the central bank. The implementation of the financial reform stage by stage will suit the needs of various enterprises, especially state major industrial enterprises. China's taxation reform hinges on a tax-revenue sharing system between the central and local governments, while carrying out readjustment of taxation structure. The tax reform has given full consideration of the interest of both the state and enterprises, and the central and localities which are supported by some transitional policies. The tax reform is now proceeding very well, said Jin Xin, deputy head of the State Taxation Administration. The enterprise reform will lead to corporatization of the majority of state-owned enterprises. A number of enterprises will be closed down and merged during the reform, but that will not lead to widespread unemployment, said officials of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. As the country's social insurance system has begun playing its role, the unemployed will obtain social relief funds in time and get retrained through job centers. Some people were at the first worried about introducing a single exchange rate in the country. However, facts have proved that after unifying the foreign exchange rate against the renminbi, the foreign exchange market has been stable, with the U.S. dollar exchanging for about 8.70 yuan. That is about the exchange rate at the swap market late last year. China used to have two exchange rates for foreign currency -- the officials rate and the swap market rate. Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic work, said that after a series of reform measures have been adopted this year, the prices, markets and society are stable. "That has convinced us more about the correctness of the direction of reform," he said. Years of practice have proved that development is the target, reform is the motive and stability is the guarantee and prerequisite for China. These three aspects are linked and influence each other.
