Olga Bolmatova, FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, Analyzes New Draft Laws on Foreign Investment"] [Text] Specialists from the RAMSIR [Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development], the Ministry of the Economy, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations have developed a draft of the Law "On Amendments and Additions to the Law of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic 'On Concession Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign Investors.'" The Law "On Foreign Investment," which was passed on 4 July 1991 and reflected the view of the world as of late 1990, has become hopelessly obsolete. Much debate has developed concerning the draft of a new redaction: Should national or special treatment be granted to foreign investors? Should a "grandfather clause" be introduced, and for whom? Who should be considered a foreign investor? As a result, the old wording of the legal treatment has been kept in the redaction which is now being considered by the government: no less favorable than national treatment. The definition of a foreign investor has been broadened in amendments and additions to the law: Now not only foreign individuals and legal entities, states, and international organizations may be granted this status, but also "foreign economic units without the status of legal entities" (that is, a group of companies or persons) and citizens of Russia permanently residing abroad in the event they import to the country monetary funds, property, and property rights. In keeping with the draft of the law, now not only "all types of property assets" will be considered foreign investment but also the rights to them and intellectual property rights. The law specifies that foreign exchange and the currency of the Russian Federation, which according to the Instruction of the Central Bank "Opening of Ruble-Denominated Accounts by Nonresidents," is credited to type I (investment) ruble-denominated accounts, can be used for investment purposes. The inclusion in the law of a "grandfather clause" has become a more serious step to accommodate foreign capital; the clause guarantees enterprises in which the proportion of foreign investment comes to no less than 30 percent of authorized capital that for three years from the moment of registration of the enterprise, legislation will apply to it that was in effect at the moment of registration in the event that "conditions for investment activities deteriorate." If the contribution of a foreign investor amounts to at least $100,000, the clause will apply for 10 years. Interestingly, the law thus gives foreign investors a guarantee against changes in tax treatment, which is not common in world practice. To be sure, the procedure for implementing this clause is not spelled out in the draft law. It is interesting to note that the "grandfather clause" in investment legislation is an absolute muddle: We read in the Edict "On Perfecting Work With Foreign Investment" of 27 September 1993, which apparently performed the function of reassurance following Edict No. 1400: "Newly issued regulatory acts (?) which govern the conditions for the operation of foreign enterprises and joint ventures (?) on the territory of the Russian Federation shall not apply for three years to enterprises that exist as of the moment said acts take effect." Further on it is explained that the provision in question does not cover the introduction of more preferential conditions. At the RAMSIR, where they called this edict harmful and inexpert, they are apprehensive about thousands of enterprises proclaiming themselves "joint ventures," having found any, even questionable, investors who would agree to invest at least one dollar in their authorized capital. Another document which likewise appeared during the period of the legislative change of seasons, the Edict "Issues in Production-Sharing Agreements in the Utilization of Minerals," says that if norms are established in Russia "that worsen the commercial results of the activities of an investor," amendments shall be made to the agreement which ensure the old level of profitability for the investor. However, this edict will remain in effect only until the relevant law comes out, but according to the latest redaction of the of the draft Law "On Concession Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign Investors," amendments shall be made to the agreement only in the event of a change in legislation which "substantially worsens" the position of the investor. New rules for registration of enterprises with foreign investment are yet another change which is planned to be included in the law on foreign investment. A limit will be established: Enterprises in which the volume of investment does not exceed $100,000 will be registered at the level of republics, krays, and oblasts. Larger enterprises, as well as those engaging in the extraction and processing of coal, oil, and gas, will be registered at the RAMSIR. According to the draft, foreign companies will no longer have the right to create branches in Russia; branches already in existence will undergo repeat registration. A total of 40 amendments are being made to the law on foreign investment, which consists of 42 articles. Obviously, under the circumstances a new redaction of the law rather than amendments and additions should be at issue. The law on concessions has been in preparation for a year now. As early as 21 July of last year the Supreme Soviet passed the Law "On Concessions and Other Contracts Signed With Foreign Investors," which described concession contracts, production-sharing agreements, contracts for the provision of services, contracts for long-term leases for state-owned facilities, "and other contracts." At the time the president did not confirm it. Apparently this was the reason why the aforementioned edict on production-sharing agreements appeared during the period of phased constitutional reform (it is not ruled out that it was due to the need to move along the "up-in-the-air" Elf Aquitaine project). In its last redaction the law is entitled "On Concession Contracts and Production-Sharing Agreements Signed With Foreign Investors." The RAMSIR said that the law will be of "cognitive significance" to the regions and of practical significance to foreign investors, who will understand that "we are drawing close to worldwide norms." The law specifies the jurisdiction of the center and the regions in drawing up lists of facilities offered for the signing of contracts with foreign investors and outlines the content of such contracts. The draft laws on concessions and on foreign investment will be among the first submitted to the Duma. For now, the government is discussing the draft Edict "On Incentives for the Attraction of Foreign Investment to Priority Sectors of the National Economy."
