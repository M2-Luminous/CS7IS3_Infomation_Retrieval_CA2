Scientists fear the plague may prove as devastating as that which wiped out most of England's elm trees 20 years ago and is now killing the new elms that sprung from the root systems of the old. Fungi is believed to be attacking the alders' roots and causing the branches to die back, but experts disagree over the seriousness of the disease. The most alarming case is at the National Grid Company's environmental education centre near Canterbury, Kent, which includes a 20-acre nature reserve built around a water filled former gravel quarry. Tony Harman, the centre's manager, began noticing two years ago that the tips of alder branches were dying, particularly at the top of trees. "Since then it has got a lot worse," he said. "We reckon we have now lost about 40 percent of our alders." Some of the trees, their roots weakened, toppled over into the water and others have been turned into leafless skeletons. Some had to be cut down because falling branches endangered school children visiting the reserve. Alders account for up to 30 percent of tree cover on riverbanks. Georges Dusart, a senior lecturer in ecology at Christ Church College in Canterbury, said: "Alders not only look attractive; they are also important for fish life by providing river shade and food in the form of insects that fall from their leaves. "I have been walking along riverbanks for 25 years and I have never seen so many alder deaths before." In an article in Farmers Weekly earlier this summer, Dr. Dussart asked farmers with diseased alders to telephone him. He soon received calls from all parts of England. The Forestry Commission is more cautious about the extent of the disease. David Rose, a tree pathologist at the commission's Alice Holt research station near Farnham, Surrey, said: "There does appear to be a recurring fungal problem with alders. It is locally serious, but there is nothing yet to indicate we are facing a national epidemic on the scale of Dutch elm disease." The preliminary results of analysis of tree samples from the Canterbury site suggest that the fungus attacking the roots of the alders belongs to the phytophthora family, which also cause potato blight, Mr. Rose said. The fungus may have migrated northwards from sub-tropical climes. Dutch elm disease destroyed 25 million elms, including 90 percent of those in southern England in the 1970's. The fungus which attacked them was spread by bark beetles. The fungus is still present in the roots of the destroyed trees and new elms that have grown from the remains of the old are now mature enough to sustain populations of the beetles which renew the attack.
