NATO military action would expose the Czech troops to retaliatory strikes, for which they are not equipped, he said. "Czech soldiers did not go into that area to make peace but to ensure peace," he said. The Czech contingent is stationed in the Serbian enclave of Krajina in Croatia near the border with Bosnia and about 200 km west of Sarajevo. Opatril said the CMSS agreed with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's statement on Thursday [10 February] favoring an internal settlement of the conflict rather than external intervention. The CMSS has eight members in parliament.
