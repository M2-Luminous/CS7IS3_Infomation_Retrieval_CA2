In addition to Zepce, Kiseljak, and West Mostar, Livno is now the fourth town in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, the state of Bosnian Croats, in which Croats have destroyed all Moslem religious objects. Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who fought bitter battles for territories since the spring of last year, especially in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed an agreement on a bi-national federation early this year under strong pressure of Washington. As agreed, the federation would later enter into a confederation with neighbouring croatia. Despite the signed agreement, Croat-Moslem relations are still tense. This is evident also in the limited freedom of movement for Moslem civilians and Moslem-owened vehicles in certain parts of Croat-controlled Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two sides also disagree on the issue of who will be the first president of their common state, although the deadline for this has long passed. The Croatian side demands that the first president be a Croat, but is willing to agree to a compromise solution -- that the president be a Moslem (Haris Silajdzic) but not Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who has been nominated for this office.
