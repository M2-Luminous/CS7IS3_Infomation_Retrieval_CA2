The sanctions "are inflicting suffering on the people and not the regime," they are destroying the market economy and compromising the democratic idea in a society where "there has been no democracy for half a century," said Kostunica, the leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, in an opening address at the party's convention. The draconic U.N. sanctions, clamped on Yugoslavia in May 1992, have brought the population and 500,000 refugees to the verge of destitution, depriving them of the most basic foodstuffs and medicaments as well as of fuel for heating homes, schools, hospitals and refugee camps. The attitude of the Democratic Party of Serbia to the world's power-wielders is "neither pro-Western, nor anti-Western," said its leader. Party Vice-President Vladeta Jankovic said that the party was giving "unreserved support" to Serbs outside Serbia in their just struggle for securing space for independent life, and added that the party considered as justified the aspiration that the Serbs' ethnic space should be united in one state. He said there was no danger of the party getting bogged down in primitive ultra-nationalism, because it had never viewed with understanding the inflicting of suffering on civilians, unnecessary destruction of towns and cities and demolition of religious and cultural landmarks. The party will work for bringing to justice the handful of war criminals who have donned the uniform of the Serb soldier, he said.
