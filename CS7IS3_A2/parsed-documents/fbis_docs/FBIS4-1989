Yan Haiwang said, in the course of studying and implementing the spirit of the national conference on propaganda and ideological work, we must incorporate the realities of our thinking and work, must deepen our understanding of the spirit and guiding significance of the speeches made by the central leading comrades, including Jiang Zemin, and must strengthen the sense of pressure and responsibility in doing a good job of our work. All localities should properly perform the various tasks in propaganda and ideological work. Yan Haiwang said: It is imperative to exert efforts to grasp work in several aspects: First, it is imperative to grasp the study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three firmly and well as a basic ideological foundation and consciously guide all our work with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, it is imperative to do a good job in propaganda and ideological work on the presentation of important reform measures centering around quickening the pace of building the socialist market economic structure and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and giving play to the mass enthusiasm for reform. Third, it is necessary to augment education in ideology and morality with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the core, and enthusiastically promote the spirit of emancipating the mind, being bold at blazing new trails, the spirit of taking the bull by the horns, and struggling hard amid difficulties. We must do away with the practice of avoiding contact with the outside world; instead, we must advocate the spirit of opening up in a comprehensive way. We must promote building material as well as spiritual civilization across Gansu to mount another new plane. Fourth, it is necessary to go all out to do a good job of the Fourth Chinese Art Festival to ensure the further success of art and literature. [passage omitted]
