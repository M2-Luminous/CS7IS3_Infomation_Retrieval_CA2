The resolution was published on 25 February, and on the 26th, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov and others emerged from detention. [passage omitted] Yegor Gaydar, of Russia's Choice, was one of the few who voted against the political amnesty. [Begin Gaydar recording] I am absolutely convinced, no shadow of doubt, that this decision is a step towards destabilizing the situation in Russia. I am absolutely convinced that the people just released from prison will in the coming months take charge again of forming armed gangs who will hit the Moscow streets. I am absolutely convinced that their conduct will lead to bloodshed. I would like Russia to recognize who are its heroes, and who is leading it along this path. [end recording] [Announcer] Now the opinion of those whom we approached for their comments. Mikhail Gorbachev is the ex-president of the former USSR, the former general secretary of the former CPSU, and a witness in the SCSE case. [Begin Gorbachev recording] (?Regarding this decision), I feel that the State Duma is of course entitled to make it. That is its prerogative, as in the Constitution. So everything is clear from the legal standpoint. Secondly, an amnesty is not an acquittal. It is clemency. This has to be kept in mind. The main aspect of it is that if three-fourths of the deputies equate Russia's current situation to one of grave crisis and conclude on the need to abandon all that drives us apart, if in this situation such a majority decision is reached by deputies, then I am ready to agree with them. So in the given situation, I would say this: I agree with the decision as understood in my first point. Recriminations must not be allowed onto the scene. This is a signal, the alarm, that we have to abandon secondary considerations. Given that, I am in favor of the State Duma's decision. But if it is a move back to the previous strife, recriminations and tension in the country, then I condemn those who want to use the State Duma in this way to provoke civil conflict.
