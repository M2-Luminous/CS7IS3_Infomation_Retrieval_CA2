That was the distinct impression left by Economic Affairs Minister Edmond Alphandery on Friday 18 February when he appeared as a guest on "Forum RMC-L'EXPRESS": It's clear the government has no intention of sitting on its hands. "After UAP, which is already in the pipeline, we will announce other privatization projects in the weeks to come," he indicated. Commenting on the separation of Renault and Volvo (LE MONDE of 19 February), the minister added that "the way was now open for privatization of Renault." "AGF and Renault are definite candidates," confirmed Mr. Alphandery, explaining that the government "likes to keep several irons in the fire." No reference was made during the program to Bull Group, the computer manufacturer whose new CEO, Jean-Marie Descarpentries, had announced the previous day plans to open the group's stock to the public this year. A visibly irritated Bercy [i.e. the Economic Affairs Ministry] issued an official clarification in a communique Friday evening. "No decision has yet been made" on the timetable or modalities for [privatization of] the computer builder, the ministry said. The privatization commission has not yet considered the Bull dossier, it also noted.
