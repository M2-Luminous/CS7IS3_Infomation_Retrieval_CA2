Palestinian and Israeli sources said the current round of talks is being held in a positive atmosphere. They noted a common desire to achieve progress. Hasan 'Usfur, deputy head of the Palestinian delegation in the Security Committee, told MENA that in yesterday's session, the negotiators completed discussion of a number of issues, notably the deployment of the Palestinian police force in the Palestinian autonomous regions, especially around the Israeli settlements. Joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols on the side roads (which link the Israeli settlements with the main Gaza road leading to Jerusalem) and on the road between Gaza and Jericho were also discussed, he said. Those subjects, he added, were discussed within the scope of the joint security draft agreement reached in Taba during the recent round of negotiations. 'Usfur said the size of the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho will be discussed today. It should be noted that the Palestinians want the force to consist of 10,000 personnel, while Israel want it to be around 6,000 strong. A compromise of an 8,000-strong force is expected. 'Usfur said the negotiators also discussed yesterday a general amnesty for Palestinian detainees in accordance with a timetable ending before 13 July, the date when the implementation of the actual self-rule plan begins. Representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Israel and the occupied territories on Wednesday submitted to chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th a list of 9,400 Palestinian detainees. The Palestinians are also demanding the return of 68 Palestinians deported by Israel during the Palestinian intifadah. 'Usfur said the Civilian Affairs Committee postponed discussions of the transfer of water authority from the Israelis to the Palestinians and on water sharing to the next round because the Israeli water expert did not attend the talks. 'Usfur said discussions on the transfer of authority on antiquities have been completed. He stressed the importance of transferring this power to the Palestinians and also the importance of transferring the authority on government lands and the property of absentees to the self-rule authority. The negotiators also discussed town organizing and planning within the transfer of the public works authority. They also discussed the transfer of the general communications authority. Palestinian sources in the Civilian Affairs Committee stressed that tangible progress has been achieved in the current round. They noted that to date the transfer of some 30 authorities to the Palestinians has been achieved. The Palestinian sources said the next round, which will begin in Taba on Monday, will be decisive because it will tell whether a final round can be held in Cairo with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin signing the executive agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho first. The current round of Palestinian-Israeli talks opened yesterday morning under the chairmanship of Palestinian President's adviser Nabil Sha'th and Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff General Amnon Shahaq. This round is expected to conclude tomorrow, Wednesday.
