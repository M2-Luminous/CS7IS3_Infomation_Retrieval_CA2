As We Improve Relations With the North Atlantic Alliance, May We Not Damage Them With China"] [Text] To this day, mutual relations between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance have not been conceptually substantiated by either side. Two significant questions are being left out of the scope of all discussions of this topic underway in Russia: the key historic task Moscow is now facing and Russian interests in Asia. The issue of whether Russia will join NATO or not may also be resolved once answers to these questions have been set forth. It is obvious that it is necessary to overcome, as soon as possible, the state of a humiliated great power with a dilapidated economy and a disfigured national self-awareness. The main historic task follows from this--to turn within a short period of time into a great multinational democratic state with a market economy which has a worthy position in the world. The strategy of blending into the world economy should be implemented in the areas where this runs into the least resistance and begets the greatest cooperation. In other words, centers of economic power which, for objective reasons, are interested in the least discriminatory cooperation with Russia are its natural partners in the outside world. Geographical neighbors who, proceeding from considerations of their own security, are interested in the preservation of at least a stable Russia may be classified as such. Taking into account the Eurasian affiliation of our country, it is easy to understand that in the European area, all of the above refers primarily to the European Union and its core of integration, France and Germany. In the Asian area, it is primarily China which is quickly growing into an economic giant. Therefore, a simultaneous and parallel, primarily economic rapprochement with both West Europe and China should form the foundation of a foreign policy strategy. It will become clear that there is no alternative to friendly relations with our Asian neighbor if we take into account that Russia has the longest land border with China, that China is a state with a population of 1 billion, and that it has nuclear potential. It may be said without exaggeration that now that the threat of a nuclear world war has disappeared, relations between Russia and China are more important than relations with the United States from the point of view of ensuring Russia's security. The role of China in ensuring Russian interests associated with economic security is also great. The Chinese leadership is striving to modernize its armed forces. At present, when many defense enterprises in Russia are on the brink of economic demise, even insignificant purchases of armaments by China and military-technical cooperation with it are helping the survival of our plants, which concentrate the elite of the scientific-technical intelligentsia and workers, along with unique high technology and experience. Without a doubt, the possible admission to NATO will deal a blow to the good-neighbor relations between Russia and China. We would like to recall that a joint Russian-Chinese declaration signed during the visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 said directly that the sides undertook to refrain from participation in military-political alliances aimed against one another. The Chinese will most likely view Russia's membership in NATO as a direct violation of these agreements, as a powerful association of European nations against Asian nations. It is also beyond a doubt that, reacting to Russia's membership in NATO, China will take measures in response--it will begin to wind down economic cooperation and will boost the military budget and the strength of Chinese troops concentrated at the Russian-Chinese border. Therefore the proposal concerning possible NATO membership for Russia, lucrative at first sight, actually brings about a perceptible deterioration in its security conditions in Asia, complications in the course of economic reforms, and restrictions on independence in foreign policy. Russia's membership in NATO is not in line with its strategic interests. However, this is not at all to say that Russia should give up cooperation with NATO in the course of ensuring European security. Certain frictions and contradictions, including territorial disputes, exist between the former socialist countries of Central and East Europe. The possibility of armed conflicts developing between them, i.e., in the vicinity of Russia's western borders, cannot be ruled out. It is impossible to do without drawing NATO and Russia into the settlement of these conflicts. This is why care should be taken in advance to create a mechanism for interaction between Russia and the alliance, possibly through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Conflicts should be settled under the mandates of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, with both NATO and Russia being brought in. Participation of other CIS member states is also possible. In the process, Russia should act as a partner of NATO on an equal footing rather than a member, with not only the peacemaking forces but their command being joint. The American Partnership for Peace program lays a foundation for this. As far as security guarantees to the former socialist countries in Europe are concerned, Russia should encourage their rapprochement with the European Union and the Western European Union--the defense structure of West Europe. In the process Russia should firmly argue for its negative attitude toward their possible admission to NATO. This approach will gain support from Europists, i.e. proponents of restoring the erstwhile role of Europe as the center of world civilization, the leadership of the European Union and the Western European Union, and Germany. This approach will ensure the much-desired Western security guarantees for former socialist countries. The signing of a treaty on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union which is planned for this year and its implementation will dispel apprehensions existing here with regard to the possible isolation of Russia from the West. On the other hand, with this strategy in the Western area, freedom of actions in Asia is retained in full, in particular, an opportunity to maintain good-neighbor relations with China. In turn, the transformation of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe from an amorphous forum into a strong international organization, with its own Security Council and peacemaking forces capable of preventing and extinguishing armed conflicts quickly, should become the main avenue for creating a common European security system.
