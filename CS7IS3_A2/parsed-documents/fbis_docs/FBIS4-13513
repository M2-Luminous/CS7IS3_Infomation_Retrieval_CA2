Muhammad Dahlan, in charge of the prisoner file in the talks, said 11 deportees would return to the occupied territories Thursday, following six self-exiled PLO militants who went back on Tuesday. The two sides are negotiating a general amnesty for all Palestinian militants wanted by Israel, a Palestinian source said. Israel has expelled 1,700 Palestinians since the 1967 Middle East war and more than 450 have been allowed back. Of the 486 deported since the uprising started in December 1987, 415 were expelled to south Lebanon for a year in December 1992, but have been allowed to return. Dahlan said Israel had also reaffirmed its commitment to free 5,000 Palestinian prisoners after the signing of an overall autonomy accord. The pledge was in line with an agreement reached last week, but the PLO Tuesday accused Israel of refusing to set a date for freeing 1,000 of the prisoners. Israel's chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq returned to the talks Wednesday, after a brief trip to Israel where he informed Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the progress of the negotiations. Peres is due to meet PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest Thursday and said the agenda would depend on progress in Cairo. In addition to discussing the return of deportees and prisoner releases, the two sides were also seeking agreement Wednesday on water sharing and jurisdiction in the future autonomous areas of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. In the past few days Israel has arrested several hundred Islamic fundamentalist suspects in a bid to break up the Hamas network and halt bloodshed. Security officials said the crackdown would continue in the coming days and offices used by the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas would be closed. Palestinian sources said nearly 500 had been detained since last Friday. Police Minister Moshe Shahal told parliament 362 Palestinians had been arrested since Monday in the swoop, which follows the killing of 12 Israelis in suicide bombings by Hamas on April 6 and 13. Dahlan said Israel had adopted a tougher line following the attacks. "The Israelis fear that without a Palestinian authority the release of detainees will have negative effects on Israeli security," he said.
