"The Bulgarian Government made several remarks that will have to be reviewed by both sides, however, the problem is the formulation of the Macedonian language," said Gligorov. "Our stance is clear -- the Macedonian language cannot be controversial and it is not up for negotiations. These are two completely different languages and I think that we will make some progress in further talks." Gligorov feels that President Zhelev has an understanding for this matter, it is simply a reality that has to be accepted like any other reality.
