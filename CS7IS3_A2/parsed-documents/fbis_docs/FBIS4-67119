According to I SIMERINI's information, the swindlers are using various methods and machinations to make their dirty money legal. In their efforts they use Cyprus as a transit point. The following is their most favored method: First, they choose a country that is considered a suitable place for laundering dirty money. This country is used as a transit station. The final destinations are Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The money reaching those countries comes from all over the world. Afterward, the swindlers choose a tax haven such as Cyprus for their "shop windows" and to legalize their dirty money and, in this case, acquire the seal of the Republic of Cyprus. An offshore company is registered in Cyprus in line with government legislation and Central Bank regulations. The company is given a name that is approved by the office of the Companies Registrar and an external account is opened with a bank to facilitate the export of foreign exchange. Millions, usually in foreign currency, are deposited in the bank account while the offshore company issues some insignificant capital. Later the company legally exports its foreign exchange while it has its name registered in Cyprus. In most cases, the foreign swindlers cooperate with Cypriot economic circles, who help them in their transactions.
