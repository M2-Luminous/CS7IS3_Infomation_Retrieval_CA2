According to sources, in recent years, some intelligence agents from other countries have gone to the Chinese mainland especially to collect information by using investment and business opportunities, and this has caused great losses to China. In order to prevent leakage of state secrets, the departments concerned in mainland China have been intensively monitoring and eavesdropping on the telephones, faxes, and correspondence of foreign-funded enterprises. At the same time, they are also keeping watch on the external communications of people who have access to various types of state secrets in important state organs. At present, when mainland officials discuss confidential issues, they must try to avoid being tapped by other people. The sources said: After Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang and bank official Tian Ye were found guilty by the courts, the relevant mainland authorities tightened up the management of confidential documents in various state organs. People are strictly prohibited from leaking any documents to outsiders classified as "top secret," "confidential," and "secret," and even some internally circulated documents that are not classified as state secrets. The scope of control has been expanded. If it is discovered that any government officials have connections to external communications, they become surveillance targets of the State Security Ministry. The sources also said that people have found that many international telephone calls have been tapped. When double voices are heard on the telephone, this indicates that the phones has been tapped. Some mainland officials now do not dare to discuss important and sensitive matters using telephones or faxes and prefer to talk about such things in personal meetings. As a number of mainland people have been sentenced to stiff prison terms because they revealed state secrets to Hong Kong reporters in the past few years, people who have access to "state secrets" are very careful about coming into contact with people from outside the mainland. They are afraid that talking with people from outside the mainland may lead to the leakage of "state secrets" and that they may thus be jailed.
