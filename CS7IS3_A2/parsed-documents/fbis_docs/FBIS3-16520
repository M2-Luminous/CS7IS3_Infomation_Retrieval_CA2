The faction won't take any decisions on the ratification of the draft agreement before all deputies acquaint themselves with the text of the documents, Berzins said. The ratification of the agreements depends on whether President Guntis Ulmanis will sign them and on the course of events in Russia, Berzins noted. Concord for Latvia's Edvins Kide said his faction favored the agreements because "if there is no agreement there is no instrument to press on Russia if it does not withdraw its troops." The Homeland and Freedom faction, however, claims that the government delegation violated the law on ratification of interstate agreements, faction head Maris Grinblats told reporters. The faction proposes to organize a public opinion poll May 29 on the functioning of the former Soviet radar installation at Skrunda. The date coincides with the local government elections. The poll should include only one question: "Do you agree to the functioning of the Skrunda radar after Aug. 31?" The factions of the Farmers Union, the Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union Party have not discussed the withdrawal agreement yet.
