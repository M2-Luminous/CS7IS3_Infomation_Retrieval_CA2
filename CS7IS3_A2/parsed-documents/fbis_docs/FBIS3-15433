Almost all the issues I discussed with Oleg Soskovets [Russian deputy prime minister] were resolved positively. Thus, a credit of 4.5 billion rubles, previously planned for 1993, has now been officially registered. Another credit of 20 billion rubles will be registered in the near future before the end of March. Boris Yeltsin has issued an instruction that this credit of 20 billion rubles should be registered. I would like to say a few words about the gas issue. We raised a the question of gas supplies from Russia. This issue is under consideration at present and I believe it will be resolved positively. We will find it more profitable because it will cost us less than that from Turkmenistan. However, it does not mean that we are going to stop receiving gas from there. [end recording]
