The two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability. He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's development. China hopes that African countries will realize peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations. Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build themselves according to their own situations. If big powers really care about Africa, they should not fill out a prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer aid to Africa to promote its economic development. Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in Angola. He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and economic support that his country has received from the Chinese Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on one side. Following major changes in the international situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together. Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand that there is only one China, and that it will never develop any official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that economic relations and trade between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.
