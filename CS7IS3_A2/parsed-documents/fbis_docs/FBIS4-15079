"Therefore, the extension of the state of emergency in some areas by another two months is a necessary measure. Russian peace keepers are the main guarantor of security in the conflict zone," he added. Kozayev noted that the North Ossetian leadership is very concerned over the safety of machine operators engaged in spring sowing: Several cases were registered when tractor drivers were blown up by mines. The temporary administration and the republican Interior Ministry came forward with an initiative to station mobile patrols in localities, which now exercise control over spring sowing in areas bordering Ingushetia. According to Kozayev, the key issue for the republican leadership is the comprehensive solution of the problem of refugees as well as their housing. He said that a residential area out of prefabricated houses mushroomed in the village of Zavodsky in a Vladikavkaz suburb. It will house refugee families from the Prigorodnyy district (it is divided between North Ossetia and Ingushetia), Georgia, the Chechen Republic and Tajikistan. The list of future residents was determined by a commission of the industrial district administration together with the republican migration service. The migration service now works on the lists of refugees to be housed in the Mozdok, Sovetskiy and Leninskiy districts of the Republic.
