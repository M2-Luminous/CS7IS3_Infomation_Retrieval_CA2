Schnehage] [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The arrival of additional high-ranking observers from more than 30 member countries makes the Commonwealth Observer Group to South Africa (COGSA) the largest election observer group yet assembled by the Commonwealth. COGSA will be headed by former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley and will include political figures, parliamentarians and election experts. The group's deputy chairman, former New Zealand Governor General Sir Paul Reeves, told reporters in Johannesburg on Monday COGSA would concentrate its efforts on the Natal and PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions -- the two ?reas most likely to be problematic during the election. Sir Paul said COGSA's main task would be to submit a report on whether or not the election was free and fair. A core group of 60 additional observers would join Commonwealth personnel already on the ground, including members of the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa. According to a statement issued at Monday's informal news briefing, COGSA would "observe all relevant aspects of the organisation and conduct of the elections in accordance with the law". The group would act "impartially and independently" to form "an independent judgement as to whether conditions exist for a free expression of will by the electors and if the result of the election reflects the wishes of the people". A preliminary COGSA report would be submitted before the announcement of the election results whereafter a final report on its findings would be submitted to Commonwealth Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku. The final report would be forwarded to the South African Government, political parties and commonwealth heads of governments.
