The balance sheet was viewed as positive, although some questions are still pending, as [Economy] Minister Edmond Alphandery explained to Norbert Navarron: [Begin recording] [Alphandery] Today's meeting reinforces our feeling that we are on the right track. Above all, we must not let our guard down, and I am very happy to see that all my colleagues, the finance ministers of the franc zone, are well aware of the need to continue making the effort, in particular with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with France's support. [Navarron] What matters still need to be settled urgently in the franc zone following the devaluation? [Alphandery] There are matters to be looked at, and my colleagues noted in particular the problem of medical supplies, which greatly concerns them and it is a question that we are going to look at with them. [Navarron] Does this mean that operational decisions will be made very quickly? [Alphandery] Such decisions have already been made. We have not been idle. Mr Roussin [development minister] has, moreover, taken a great deal of trouble to follow the progression of events in all of the countries following the devaluation, and we are naturally continuing to follow the progression of events very closely. I would even say we are following events on a day to day basis in each of the countries. [end recording]
