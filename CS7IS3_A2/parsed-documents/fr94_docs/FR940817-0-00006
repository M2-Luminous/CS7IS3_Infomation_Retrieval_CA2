FR940817-0-00006 FR940817-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;216&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8973; AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects a typographical error that appeared in a reference to a service bulletin called out in the above-captioned airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 36932). A typographical error in the service bulletin reference resulted in a reference to a service document that does not exist. This action is necessary to ensure that certain necessary repairs are performed in accordance with appropriate service instructions. DATES: Effective August 19, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 19, 1994 (59 FR 36932, July 20, 1994). The incorporation by reference of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992, as listed in the regulations, was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register of November 2, 1992 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wahib Mina, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;121L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5324; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;15&hyph;02, amendment 39&hyph;8973, applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 36932). Among other things, that AD requires inspections to verify the installation and tightness of the shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center pylon thrust link, and repair, if necessary. As published, paragraph (a)(3) of that AD contained a reference to McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, as a source of service information related to accomplishing a repair of the shear pin retainer and attaching parts. Due to a typographical error, the issue date of that service bulletin was listed as ``June 3, 1994,'' rather than the correct date of ``June 3, 1993.'' (This date was cited correctly, however, in other portions of the rule that contained references to this same service bulletin.) As a result, the service bulletin referenced in paragraph (a)(3) of the published AD does not exist. Since it is essential that operators perform repairs in accordance with appropriate and available service instructions, this document changes the issue date of the service bulletin cited in paragraph (a)(3) of AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;02, amendment 39&hyph;8973, to read as: ``June 3, 1993.'' The effective date of the rule remains August 19, 1994. Since no other portion of the regulatory information has been changed, the final rule is not being republished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on August 11, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
