FBIS4-30160 "dreas122_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 North Korea CPRF Memorandum on ROK Nuclear Development CPRF Memorandum on ROK Nuclear Development SK2406040194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 23 Jun 94 SK2406040194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 23 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] A news conference was held at the People's Cultural Palace yesterday [23 June] in connection with the South Korean authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons development. Participating in the news conference were reporters from the publication and media organizations in Pyongyang, such as NODONG SINMUN, the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee; foreign correspondents; and publication- related functionaries at various foreign embassies in our country. At the news conference, Ho Hyok-pil, vice director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], first of all, issued a memorandum of the CPRF exposing the truth that nuclear weapons development has been pushed for in South Korea. The memorandum pointed out that South Korea has accelerated nuclear weapons development in a planned way and systematically abrogated the joint declaration on denuclearization, while possessing reprocessing facilities, and extracting and bringing in plutonium in an illegal way. The memorandum pointed out as follows that South Korea's post-irradiation test facilities [chosahu sihom sisol] are reprocessing facilities disguised as experimental ones: Although South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test facilities in Taedok as peaceful atomic facilities, it can be confirmed by all data that they are reprocessing facilities. Above all, the post-irradiation test facilities have been built for reprocessing purposes. The post-irradiation test facilities are reprocessing facilities of extracting plutonium in terms of their structure and operational process. South Korea is extracting plutonium directly from spent nuclear fuel by making use of post-irradiation test facilities. According to obtained data, the South Korean authorities extracted plutonium after taking 4 meter-long 2,148 nuclear fuel rods, 12 bundles, to the post-irradiation test facilities at the atomic research center from the Kori No. 1 Power Plant alone on 24 May, 1985, in accordance with an agreement with the United States. Nuclear material is being diverted in an undisguised way in South Korea. In cahoots with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the South Korean authorities have systematically reprocessed, and extracted huge amount of plutonium every year from, spent nuclear fuels--which they did not burn completely at, and extracted from, the heavy-water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor--after taking those fuels to the post-irradiation test facilities. The total amount of it is 50 kg according to the data-- which have been rudimentally obtained--alone. The memorandum pointed out that South Korea is trying to legalize the introduction of plutonium from abroad and bring it in in large quantity. The memorandum pointed out as follows that the South Korean authorities have created artificial obstacles to the implementation of the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which the North and South sides adopted and effectuated, reflecting the unanimous aspirations and wishes of all countrymen: The present South Korean authorities have launched maneuverings of abrogating the North-South joint declaration of denuclearization in a planned and systematic way. Meanwhile, they are even advocating the theory of nuclear sovereignty and that of counter-nuclear development [taeung haekgaebalnon]. The South Korean authorities ought to scrap the post-irradiation test facilities--the reprocessing facilities--while making public the plutonium which they have illegally obtained. We present--and strongly protest against--to the aboveboard public opinion of the world the fact that the IAEA is applying a double standard. He made remarks on the issuance of the memorandum. He said that the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution on 10 June for discontinuing the agency's cooperation with our Republic, adding that this is a wanton infringement upon our Republic's sovereignty, an unfair act, and an integrated expression of the agency's application of a double standard. He pointed out that those who have pushed for nuclear armament [haekmujanghwa] on the Korean Peninsula are the South Korean authorities. He laid bare that the post-irradiation test facilities in the Taedok Complex in South Korea are extracting plutonium from those facilities, while saying that they are the reprocessing facilities of extracting plutonium in a thorough-going way in view of the purpose of their introduction, structure, and of the process of realistic diversion. He also pointed out that South Korea has illegally brought in huge amount of plutonium from abroad, exposing that it is applying spurs to the development of a fast-breeder reactor today to make its introduction of plutonium legal. He stressed: Nonetheless, the IAEA has never taken issue with this. We bring a charge against the agency's unjustness to the public opinion of the world. At the news conference, Vice Director Ho Hyok-pil and (Paek Hyon-su), a responsible researcher for the fatherland's reunification, answered the questions raised by reporters. They said that South Korea, which is said to undergo the IAEA's inspections, is extracting plutonium through the post-irradiation test facilities, adding: The IAEA has conducted more than 2,000 cases of inspections on the average every year since the Nonnuclear Proliferation Treaty took effect. This notwithstanding, the agency has never exposed even a single case of the nuclear materials being used for military purposes. They said: In particular, the IAEA has conducted nuclear inspections of South Korea. But, it has turned its face away from South Korea's nuclear weapons development and even from its introduction of nuclear raw materials [haek wollyo]. They stressed: The South Korean authorities have intentionally publicized to the public that all of their attempts for nuclear weapons development up until now have been given up. This is nothing but a smoke screen to cover up their nuclear armament. They disclosed: The world's social circles strongly call for exposing, and taking issue with, the maneuverings for nuclear armament in South Korea. Because even those inside South Korea have begun exposing the authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons development since last year, the South Korean authorities have been put in an awkward situation and have placed the public opinion under their sway in a deceitful way with a view to coping with this. They pointed out in a concrete way: Because their development of a fast-breeder reactor has faced strong protests and denunciations at home and abroad, the South Korean authorities are trying to bring in plutonium by any means [kioko] under the pretext of developing an improved light-water reactor; and have invited an agency team for inspections and safety examination to cover up their relations of conspiracy with the IAEA and to continue to apply spurs to their nuclear armament behind the scenes of conspiracy. In conclusion, they said emphatically: It is necessary to raise the voice of justice, on a worldwide scale, of denouncing the South Korean authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons development.
