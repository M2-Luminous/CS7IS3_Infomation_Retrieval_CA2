Contrary to claims by certain circles, Ciller announced that the government, in doing this, will act with courage and determination, without any ulterior motives, will consider only the future of Turkey and the prosperity and happiness of the Turkish nation. In a written statement issued today, Ciller stated: From the day we established the government, I seized every opportunity to announce our determination to end PKK terrorism as well as the terror in the economy. It is known that we have displayed this determination without any consideration for party congresses or elections. [passage omitted] Ciller added: Only yesterday, our brave Turkish Armed Forces conducted the biggest and most comprehensive operation of the past 10 years and destroyed the Zhalah PKK shelter, 110 km from our border. Ciller announced that as a result of this operation the PKK sustained great losses from the viewpoint of administration, militants, weapons, and ammunition. The support of the Turkish people for these efforts aimed at eliminating PKK terrorism is well known, Ciller stressed, noting: Friendly countries and our allies have also demonstrated through their recent decisions and attitudes that they are on Turkey's side on this subject. She said: Given these facts and the support of the people for the elimination of both kinds of terrorism, I personally fail to comprehend the logic alleging that bombing the Zhalah PKK camp was aimed at veiling the adverse affects of the decisions concerning the money markets. Advocating such a logic would constitute an injustice to the government, to the Turkish Armed Forces, and to those who are trying to restore the economy by taking steps to continue the free market economy. In our opinion, the recent economic operations launched in the money markets as well as yesterday's Zhalah PKK camp operation are great successes. Both operations were necessary. The two are not related in any way from the point of timing. The government weighed and used its political will and did whatever was necessary in both cases. Our government will take the necessary steps to eliminate both the economic and PKK terrorism. Contrary to the allegations of certain circles, the government, in doing this, will act with courage and determination, considering only the future of Turkey and the prosperity and happiness of the Turkish nation.
