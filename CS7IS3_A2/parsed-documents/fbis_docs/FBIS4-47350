Specifications and features of existing systems of automatic chemical monitoring systems are examined. Key problems to be resolved in the design of such systems are minimization and optimization of the area occupied by instruments and software development. A table presents specifications of automatic chemical monitoring devices produced in Russia. Sample handling techniques and possible resultant errors are described. A schematic of a chemical-technological monitoring system is presented. Operations carried out by the system are listed. The prospects for the use of ion chromatography are outlined.
