FR940822-0-00034 FR940822-0-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;39&hyph;1&hyph;6507; FRL&hyph;5022&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Texas; Revision to the State Implementation Plan Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Programs AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP narrative entitled ``Revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Control of Ozone Air Pollution_Inspection/Maintenance SIP for Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso, Beaumont/Port Arthur, and Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Areas,'' and Regulation IV, 31 TAC 114.3, entitled ``Vehicle Emissions Inspection and Maintenance Program,'' as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone in all four nonattainment areas and carbon monoxide in El Paso. On November 12, 1993, and on March 9, 1994, Texas submitted SIP revision requests to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7511a(b)(4) and 7511a(c)(3) and Federal I/M rule 40 CFR Part 51 subpart S. These SIP revisions will require vehicle owners to comply with the Texas I/M program in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse which includes El Paso also classified as nonattainment area for carbon monoxide. This revision applies to the Texas counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty, Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller. On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public comments were received on the NPR; therefore, the EPA is publishing this final action. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on September 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittals and the EPA's technical support document (TSD) are available for public review at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 6, (6T&hyph;AP), 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733. Also, Texas' submittal is available at the TNRCC, Mobile Source Division, I/M Section, P.O. Box 13087, Austin, Texas 78711&hyph;3087. Interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day. In addition, a copy of today's revision to the Texas SIP is also available for inspection at: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James F. Davis at (214) 655&hyph;7584. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) required any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal'' (pursuant to section 181(a) of the CAA) or worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was required by the 1977 Amendments to the CAA to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program up to the level required in past EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more stringent. All carbon monoxide nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or previously required programs to this level. In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or an enhanced I/M program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition, Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP for all areas required by the CAA to have an I/M program. Ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``serious'' or worse with populations of 200,000 or more, and CO nonattainment areas with design values above 12.7 parts per million (ppm.) and populations of 200,000 or more, and metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast ozone transport region were required to meet EPA guidance for enhanced I/M programs. The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The 1980 population of the Beaumont/Port Arthur area was less than 200,000. The El Paso ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following four counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The designations for ozone were published in the Federal Register (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437. In addition, a segment of El Paso Texas has been designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide (CO) and classified as moderate with a design value below 12.7 ppm., under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). Based on these nonattainment designations and populations, basic I/M programs are required in the Beaumont/Port Arthur and Dallas/Fort Worth urbanized areas, while enhanced I/M programs are required in the El Paso and Houston/Galveston urbanized areas. Response to Comments On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action By this action, the EPA is approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable. The rationale for the EPA's action is explained in the NPR and will not be restated here.
