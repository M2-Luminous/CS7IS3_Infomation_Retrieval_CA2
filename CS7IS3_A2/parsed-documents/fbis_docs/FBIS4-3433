Co-hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and British Airways, the business mission representing six major U.K. consumer goods retailers and manufacturers visited Hong Kong and factories and retailers in the Pearl River Delta last week to explore business opportunities. "We increased our buying during this visit but have also received an unexpected bonus by ending up with actively selling our products," said David Oxham, director of Automated Security (Holdings) Plc, the largest security system company in Britain. The boom in China's retail market has resulted in the need for complementary services such as shop surveillance systems, he said. Marketing director of Britain's largest eyewear retailers, Dollond Aitchison Group Plc, Ian Johnson, said "it is encouraging to see a consumer market on the mainland and not just infrastructure opportunities." "This visit has encouraged me to consider returning to attend trade fairs in this region rather than only visiting those in Europe. The Hong Kong optical fair in November could provide fresh opportunities," Johnson said. Other areas in which the group saw business potential was in service development and management training for Chinese enterprises. Hong Kong would have an enormous role both directly and as middle-man for foreign partners in these sectors, the British delegation members commented. The delegation also expressed interest in the potential for establishing joint ventures in China, but considered it necessary to have the involvement of a Hong Kong partner. "Hong Kong is necessary for our business to facilitate areas such as banking, quality control and communications - this assistance outweighs its costs," said the merchandise director of a major mail order house, Empire Stores Plc, James Skelsey. "Most of what we buy in China is sourced through Hong Kong," he added.
