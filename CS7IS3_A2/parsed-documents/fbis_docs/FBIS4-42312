This will be mainly through cooperation and material support, Bernd Neumann, parliamentary state secretary in the German Research Ministry, said on Deutschlandfunk Berlin on Thursday [2 June]. The aim of the aid is to ensure that Russia's research potential, which is in some areas considerable, does not deteriorate completely. Neumann, who is now in Moscow, said many research institutions there are threatened with collapse because salaries can no longer be paid and there is no money for energy and material.
