FBIS4-27948 "dreas109_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea Atomic Energy Department Sends Letter to IAEA Atomic Energy Department Sends Letter to IAEA SK0706055194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0532 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0706055194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["General Director of DPRK General Department of the Atomic Energy Sends Letter to General Director of IAEA" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-nam, general director of the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter to Hans Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, on June 6 regarding the wrong "conclusion" of the IAEA Secretariat that the technical possibility of later measurement of fuel rods at the five megawatt experimental atomic power plant in the DPRK was lost. The letter says: I very much regret to know that you made a "hasty conclusion" that the agency could not provide assurance about the non-diversion of nuclear material, alleging as if the technical possibility for later measurement of core fuel rods would have been lost at the 5 mw experimental nuclear power plant. We have agreed, a few days ago, to the agency's deputy director general's proposal on the consultation by exchange of telexes in respect of the refueling campaign and requested the agency to provide us with a scientific and technical answer to the manner proposed by us for preserving the technical possibility for later measurement of fuel rods. Nevertheless, you have not yet answered our proposal and transmitted to the UN Security Council an unreasonable report in which facts were misrepresented, speaking ill of us as if we had not yet replied to the agency's letter. Moreover, what we cannot but make an issue of is the fact that you have ignored our unique status based on the suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty]. This our unique status has been created and recognized by the USA and IAEA. For these reasons, they agreed to the inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge, and so far the agency has conducted not the routine and ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement, but the inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge. At present, the refueling campaign, too, is being conducted in the presence of the IAEA inspectors and under the IAEA surveillance and containment on the basis of the above-mentioned principles. The IAEA inspectors, too, who are present during the refueling have recognized that there is no diversion of nuclear material from the reactor. Speaking of the verification of the core history alleged by the agency, the matter will be resolved automatically if our unique status will be removed. At present, we are conducting the refueling campaign preserving the technical possibility for later measurement of fuel rods on the assumption that our unique status will be removed. The fuel discharge operation has been carried out channel by channel, channel group by channel group in sequence, and 40 rods from 4 channels have been discharged into one basket. All the operations of core discharge including the identification numbers of baskets and channels, sequence of rods in a channel, and the position of baskets in the spent fuel pond have been kept on the accounting and operating records by operators and confirmed by the IAEA inspectors every day. This shows that the refueling operation is conducted in such a manner as preserving the possibility of reconstructing the channels of fuel rods and the sequence of rods in the channel, if necessary. The adequacy of the manner of preserving the technical possibility for later measurement has been proven not only theoretically but also experimentally. This is the only rational method suitable to our unique status. All the facts show that the agency can verify whether the nuclear material from the reactor has been diverted in the past, at the time when our unique status is removed. Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that "any future measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because they would have to be based on operators' records which are unverifiable and also because it would not be possible to reconstruct the configuration of fuel rods in the core." This shows that you seem to have no interest in a fair solution of "our nuclear issue," in keeping with your prejudiced political view in advance. Our practical experience from the past agency inspections shows that the more we accepted IAEA inspections with our maximum goodwill and generousness, the more artificial obstacles the agency made to the solution of our issue, leading us to serious situation, in attaching an unreasonable condition to us every time. We made our position clear during the February board meeting in 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified if the agency verifies the fuel rods from the core during the refueling campaign. However, at that time, the IAEA Secretariat objected to our proposal, alleging that the inconsistencies could not be resolved in such a manner and made the board adopt the resolution of "special inspection of two ordinary military sites". After the last March inspection, the IAEA Secretariat transmitted to the UN Security Council the matter of the "non-completed inspection activities" alleging that it is indispensable for the agency to carry out the smear taking from the glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building 3 at the radiochemical laboratory in order to verify non-diversion of nuclear material, upon the return to Vienna by the agency inspection team that had completed the activities for the continuity of safeguards knowledge. When we permitted the agency to conduct "non-completed inspection activities" as a special exception, the agency this time said to us that it is indispensable to measure the fuel rods from the core, which was a matter already denied by the agency in the past. On one hand, the agency inspection team cancelled the agreement on the archive samples for clarification of the inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other hand, the agency says that it is indispensable for the agency to make "special inspection of two ordinary military sites" to verify non-diversion of nuclear material. This shows that the IAEA Secretariat continues to join the USA in their hostile policy towards the DPRK to make our ordinary military sites open one by one under the pretext of the inspection. The current development of the refueling campaign bears resemblance to the IAEA's pressure campaign at the beginning of 1993 when the agency cooked up the non-existent "inconsistencies" on the basis of the false intelligence information provided by a third party and imposed on us the so-called "special inspection of two ordinary military sites", on the basis of the "inconsistencies." I think such unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented events in the history of safeguards. I would like to remind you that, for these reason, we could not but withdraw from the NPT last year. In the light of the above, we cannot but doubt whether our nuclear issue can, indeed, be resolved through further consultations with the IAEA. Recently, the IAEA Secretariat has laid obstacles to our normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at the beginning of the campaign, intentionally avoiding the presence of the IAEA inspection team. On the other hand, at present, they have added another obstacle to a smooth solution of our nuclear issue by making a hasty conclusion that the agency could not provide assurance about the non-diversion of nuclear material. All these are very irresponsible and hasty behaviour where by the objective reality has been intentionally misrepresented. Accordingly, the IAEA Secretariat will have to bear the full responsibility for all the consequences arising from such wrong conclusion and unreasonable behaviour. If the IAEA Secretariat takes our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council and continues to resort to only pressure on the basis of "hasty conclusion" that the technical possibility for later measurement of the fuel rods has been lost, widening its unfairness and partiality, we will not feel any longer the need that we are subject to the unreasonable binding of the IAEA Secretariat and cannot but go over to the next process of our peaceful nuclear activities.
