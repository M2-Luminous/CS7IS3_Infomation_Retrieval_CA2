The North Korean nuclear issue, therefore, is to be dealt with through the two channels of dialogue. The binary dialogue lines--one between North Korea and the United States and the other between North and South Korea--mean a structural change from the four-plus-three method (the three dialogue channels between the North and the South, between the North and the United States, and between the North and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in which four parties are involved) to the three-plus-two method in which the IAEA is not involved. The structural transformation of the dialogue method shows the probability that in-depth discussion will be held on practical problems. When the IAEA participated in an independent dialogue, technical problems concerned with safeguards of the continuity of inspection surfaced one after another, often shaking the overall picture of the dialogue. The upcoming North Korean-U.S. Geneva talks and the inter-Korean summit talks are likely to bring a considerable change in the contents of the dialogue as well. After North Korea declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March of last year, North Korea and the United States discussed ways to resolve the nuclear issue in the first and second round of high- level talks in June and July, respectively. However, while the United States placed the primary emphasis on the discussion of the nuclear issue, North Korea focused on the improvement of its relations with the United States and the U.S. assistance in the installation of the light-water reactor, preventing the talks from making tangible progress. However, in the upcoming third round of North Korean-U.S. talks, specific rather than principled ways for the complete return to the NPT, suspension of the present and future nuclear development, and the improvement of relations between the two countries will be discussed extensively. This may well bring about a certain degree of tangible results. The mode of connection to be maintained between the two lines of dialogue depends primarily on the North Korean intent. North Korea has so far placed emphasis on its talks with the United States, and acceded to the inter-Korean dialogue in a limited manner as a measure to complement the North Korean-U.S. talks. It is likely that North Korea will follow the same style. There are signs that North Korea will hold the North Korean-U.S. talks before the inter- Korean summit. In this connection, our government wishes to link the two lines of dialogue to maintain a balance between the progress in the North Korean-U.S. dialogue and the improvement of inter-Korean relations. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu did not outright link the two lines of dialogue, but said: "We need not attach substantial significance to which talks are held a few days before the other. Whether or not progress is made in the resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue will be appraised on the overall basis after following the process of the two sets of talks." Foreign Minister Han's remarks suggest that if the South directly links the two sets of dialogue, this could give an impression that the South is shackling the United States. Therefore, the South is avoiding this situation and trying to avoid the blame for the stalemate that could result in the talks by having one set of talks directly affecting the other. The North Korean-U.S. talks and the discussion for inter-Korean summit help suspend the discussion of UN sanctions and pave the way for dialogue. However, there are factors which may stand in the way of smooth progress of dialogue, including the conflicting interests among the North and South Korea and the United States. The assistance in the replacement of reactors with light-water reactors is one of the most controversial points. North Korea wishes the United States to make arrangements with an international monetary institution for the supply of funds to North Korea for the construction of light-water reactors in return for its freezing its nuclear development. The United States, however, is hardly able to give North Korea satisfactory assurances because of the limitation in its national treasury. By obtaining specific assurances for the construction of light-water reactors, North Korea intends to have the economic sanctions against it dissolved and resolve the hostile relations with the West as well. Therefore, North Korea is not likely to part with its nuclear-freeze card in exchange for a mere promise of assistance by the United States. Hence, how the United States deals with the issue of assistance in the installation of light-water reactors will be a key to the success of the talks. Another important matter connected with the success of the talks is how the two sides will conclude the issue of tracing the past nuclear history of North Korea. North Korea is also raising the issue of not using nuclear weapons against North Korea, and the United States is planning to deal with the North Korean development and export of missiles. Thus, there are quite a few difficult problems lying ahead, but since both North Korea and the United States are not concealing their desire to resolve the long hostile relations in the talks, we will watch with expectation the turn of events that will develop.
