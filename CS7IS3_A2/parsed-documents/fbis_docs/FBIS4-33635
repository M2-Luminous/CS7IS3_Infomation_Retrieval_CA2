"Searches are being conducted at the military checkpoints established in the area with the sole purpose of preventing the trafficking of weapons and explosives toward the conflict area," the National Secretariat of Defense stated. The Armed Forces issued a communique to deny media reports they had imposed "restrictions," "sieges," and "quarantines" in an area where the conflict that began on 1 January is being resolved. The Zapatist National Liberation Army concluded the first phase of a reconciliation dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, on 1 March. The dialogue took place amid a virtual truce in San Cristobal de las Casas, 200 km southeast of Mexico City, following the unilateral cease-fire ordered by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on 12 January. The communique revealed that "the National Secretariat of Defense stated categorically" that since the unilateral cease-fire, the Armed Forces "have and will continue to facilitate" the transit of residents, goods, and medical attention.
