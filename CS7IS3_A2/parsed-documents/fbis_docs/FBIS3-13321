The crisis and its after effects have mixed up politics and religion. Consequently, the political crisis has enveloped Islamic shrines. King Husayn has repeatedly cautioned and warned against mixing politics with religion. Further, King Husayn has on more than one occasion called for keeping holy places away from "political action". He said sovereignty over those shrines, be they on the land of Hejaz [Saudi Arabia] or in the Palestinian territories, should be for God alone and not for any political side or state, whatever its standing. It can be said that his majesty's performance of the minor pilgrimage on al-Qadr Night [27th of Ramadan] despite the political crisis overshadowing Saudi-Jordanian relations, was a practice of what his majesty has been preaching. Through his pilgrimage, King Husayn sought to deliver a message that sovereignty over holy shrines is for God and that the political dispute between Riyadh and Amman does not mean his majesty will remain deprived of his right to visit the land of Hejaz and the tomb of his great grandfather, Prophet Muhammad. Therefore, many observers viewed his majesty's pilgrimage trip as a political step in religious guise. This step was meant to separate holy shrines from politics, which always harms the value, importance, and sanctity of holy shrines. It can be further said that King Husayn's pilgrimage trip last week has laid down a new principle and important tradition in inter-Arab relations and in the link between religion and politics. This new principle ends "the monopoly of politicians over religious cards". It also opens the door wide to the prospect of turning holy sites into public property, away from the private standards set by the party holding monopoly over these sites, especially since these private standards are subject to change. Observers think King Husayn's step will mark a precedent that can be depended upon to devise a new formula for relations among brothers, based on a new principle stipulating that "political differences should not prevent the parties to the dispute from performing their religious duties. In fact, these duties could improve ties when politics is unable to play its role." Despite this image, which King Husayn's step created in the minds of observers the world over, government sources have told SHIHAN that when King Husayn decided to perform the minor pilgrimage he had no political gains in mind. His aim was to reestablish contact between himself and the land of Hejaz, with which he is inseparably linked, avoiding "political complexities and calculations." The sources pointed out, however, that they had expected a meeting to take place, on the sidelines of the visit, between His Majesty King Husayn and King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques. The sources said the religious mission could have made political achievements had the Saudis responded favorably. Information available to SHIHAN suggests Riyadh still rejects full normalization with Jordan. The reason is not an incorrect interpretation of Jordan's stand toward the Gulf crisis. Rather, it is the wrong interpretation of Jordan's role in bringing the views of the Yemeni parties closer and reconciling them in Amman in line with the accord document. Information also indicates that Jordan has refused over the past three years to make a public apology to Saudi Arabia because of its conviction that its stand toward the Gulf crisis and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was not biased toward Iraq, inasmuch as it was championing an Arab solution. Jordanian government sources told SHIHAN that Jordan did not at all ask for U.S. intervention to mediate with Riyadh. Jordan believes the natural framework to address the misunderstanding resulting from the Gulf crisis is an Arab framework, be it bilateral or trilateral. It is within this framework that an open and frank dialogue can take place to reach genuine reconciliation. An official thinks Saudi Arabia agreed to normalize relations with the PLO in response to a U.S. desire to strengthen the PLO's political and financial status in the wake of the Oslo accord. Saudi Arabia also agreed to normalize relations with the Yemeni Socialist Party -- Riyadh's archenemy before the Gulf crisis -- to take advantage of the dispute between President Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and to serve Saudi interests, which were completely neglected after the achievement of political unity in 1990. A Western diplomat in Amman thinks King Husayn's performance of the minor pilgrimage, without it being crowned by an official meeting with King Fahd -- not even a courteous meeting to show good hospitality -- is a clear indication that normalizing relations between the two sides is still far off and requires major political efforts by several Arab and regional, and perhaps international, parties. The special circumstances that opened the Saudi gate to the Yemeni Socialist Party and the PLO are still not available for Jordan, which the Saudi regime regards as a regional peer on all levels. This diplomat thinks, however, that King Husayn's pilgrimage trip has exonerated Jordan from any obligations that could be necessary to normalize relations with Riyadh, which is now asked to respond positively to this overture, one way or another.
