Convoys of artillery can be seen moving along the highways outside Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after a meeting with the U.N. Secretary General's Envoy Yasushi Akashi today that the Serbian side plans to complete withdrawal of heavy weaponry one day before the NATO deadline. He said Serbs have removed several convoys of artillery from around Sarajevo, and are continuing doing that. He said those weaponry which cannot be removed because of the snowing weather will be put under control of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Karadzic said that the U.N. side has promised not to let any other party get the upper hand following the Serbian withdrawal. Predicting peace in Sarajevo in the near future, he expressed the hope that the model of demilitarization in Sarajevo will be used in other parts of Bosnia. Yasushi said today that the UNPROFOR is monitoring the seven sites for concentrating weapons from both the Serb and Muslim sides. Serbian sources said the Serbs have so far submitted more than 100 heavy guns to the UNPROFOR. Yasushi said that the progress in weapon withdrawal is a good start and "We are moving towards a permanent ceasefire and the final goal of the demilitarization of Sarajevo." Both UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman and UNPROFOR Commander in Bosnia Michael Rose also confirmed reports of the ongoing Serbs' withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo. The Bosnian Serbs accepted a Russian proposal to withdraw heavy guns and in the meantime to have 400 Russian troops, now serving in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, sent to Sarajevo. Yasushi today also held a meeting with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic said after the meeting that the Muslim side will withdraw all of their heavy guns from around Sarajevo by February 19 and put a small number of their weapons under control of the UNPROFOR. He also said the Muslim side will strictly observe the ceasefire and will not violate the military demarcation line. Yasushi confirmed the statement by Izetbegovic. Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary general's spokesman Joe Sills said in New York today that Butrus Butrus-Ghali is very much "satisfied" with the process of weapon withdrawal from Sarajevo. Three thousand UNPROFOR soldiers are now being deployed in key positions across and around Sarajevo, mainly in the sites of weaponry submitted by both Serbs and Muslims, and along the demarcation line. Ghali has called for a reinforcement of 3,000 UNPROFOR soldiers to guarantee the peace plan. In the meantime, fighting is continuing with Serbs and Croats as one side, and Muslims as the other side in other parts of Bosnia.
