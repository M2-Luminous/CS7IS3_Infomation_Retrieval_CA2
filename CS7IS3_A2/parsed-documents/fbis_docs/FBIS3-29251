In a meeting with reporters at dawn today, our time, Foreign Minister Han, who is currently on an official visit to Canada, said that North Korean representatives stationed at the IAEA notified the IAEA that North Korea is willing to accept inspection of seven nuclear facilities which the IAEA is demanding for the continuity of nuclear safety measures. Foreign Minister Han also said that the government welcomes the move and that he hopes the nuclear inspection on North Korea will be carried out as agreed upon between the IAEA and North Korea. Foreign Minister Han said that it is unclear whether the nuclear inspection on North Korea will be carried out the day after tomorrow but said that there is a high possibility that the inspection will start within a week. Foreign Minister Han said that since the North Korean side is showing a developing attitude regarding nuclear inspection, he will meet with high-ranking U.S. working-level officials including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake when he revisits Washington on 17 February to hold full-scale discussions with the United States on reaching an agreement on dealing with the upcoming three-stage contact.
