The Russian foreign minister met Andrzej Olechowski in Krakow. Both politicians signed an intergovernment Polish-Russian agreement "on graves and sites of remembrance of victims of wars and repressions." The foreign ministers began their meeting with private talks, during which bilateral relations and issues of European security were discussed. Later, during plenary talks between delegations of the two states' foreign ministries, new forms of economic and cultural cooperation between Poland and Russia were examined. After the talks, the ministers signed an agreement in which both sides have undertaken, among other things, to finance protection on their territories of sites commemorating the death and martyrdom of citizens of the other state. During the signing ceremony, Minister Olechowski emphasized that reconciliation and friendship between the Polish and Russian peoples has become possible through mutual respect for the victims that both peoples suffered from the two totalitarian systems that raged in the 20th century. "In this spirit, the Polish people respect and protect the graves of the hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who fell and rest on our soil," said the head of the Polish Foreign Ministry, adding that the agreement confirmed the will to permanently respect the resting places of victims of wars. Kozyrev emphasized that the agreement was an expression of respect for historical truth and the memory of those who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom. The Russian diplomat handed over to Minister Olechowski photocopies of hitherto secret archival documents from the period of the [1794] Kosciuszko Insurrection and the Targowica Confederacy, including correspondence between Empress Catherine II and Count Ignacy Potocki. Commenting on the private talks, Kozyrev told journalists that in these they had raised "in private, confidentially and with mutual understanding," issues of European security and cooperation with NATO. The Russian minister said that at present we should concentrate on "Partnership for Peace," while NATO membership for new states is only one option. "Perhaps Russia too will join NATO, but perhaps there are other options for fashioning a security mechanism, including dialogue in the forums of the existing political organizations," Kozyrev added. Olechowski emphasized that perhaps in the future there will be no NATO, or perhaps both Poland and Russia will be members of the North Atlantic Pact. "These are options that would suit us best," said the Polish foreign minister, adding, "if it is not going to be possible to build a Europe without divisions, `Partnership' could lead to only some countries joining NATO." "I would like a democratic and affluent Russia to be one of the pillars of security and economic cooperation in the future Europe," Olechowski said, adding that this could be furthered by Europe's opening to comprehensive economic cooperation with Russia. The Russian foreign minister emphasized that he does not want the countries of East-Central Europe to be viewed as a battlefield for spheres of influence. He added that Poland is now an active participant in international politics. According to Kozyrev, in light of this, one could not say that Poland finds itself in a political vacuum. Referring to the plenary proceedings, Kozyrev said that the Polish side put forward a number of interesting proposals concerning economic and cultural cooperation. He also stated that the Krakow proceedings brought closer the implementation of agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Poland last year. "Polish-Russian relations are very good; they merely lack friendly everyday substance," Olechowski noted. He added that Poland and Russia, being neighbors, cannot be enemies. On the other hand, they must be partners even if they do not want to be. "The point is that now we want to travel the road from partnership to friendship, and the Poles intend to do this quickly," Olechowski added. Before meeting Minister Olechowski, the Russian foreign minister viewed exhibits of the State Art Collection at Wawel castle and visited the Wawel Cathedral. Asked by journalists about Polish-Russian cultural links, he said, "Our cultures have never been separated from each other, and this gives me hope. Culture is the spiritual basis on which we could build the future and good-neighborly relations and develop partnership." Stanislaw Ciosek, Polish Republic ambassador to Russia, told a PAP journalist that the Krakow meeting was important for both sides because it could contribute to "breaking through the temporary cooling down in relations." According to Ciosek, a breakthrough in Polish-Russian relations will not depend on a single act but will take place gradually. Ciosek emphasized that it would be easier to attain a political breakthrough rather than an economic one, which "costs a lot and has to be costed," while, for it to occur, there must be first and foremost meetings between the heads of governments, economics ministers, and industrialists.
