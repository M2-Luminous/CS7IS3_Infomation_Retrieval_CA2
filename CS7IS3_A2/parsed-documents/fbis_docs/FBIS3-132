That, plus another two centimentres, is what a ballot paper for the National Assembly election will measure. With 60 cm ballot papers, 10 different kinds of ballot papers and marking fluid all over our knuckles, the April election is going to be like no other. Our 80 million ballot papers will fill 10 jumbo jets when they wing their way to South Africa from London where they are being printed. According to the Independent Electoral Commission, no South African firm could handle the printing order and the London firm De La Rue, of Basingstoke, has expertise in printing bank-notes, ballot papers and official documents. Printing will be completed by April 17. The ballot papers will be flown to South Africa under stringent security and be transported to warehouses under surveillance and in the presence of political party officials. Three days before the election they will be transported to secure locations near the voting stations. Ten different types of ballot paper will be used -- one for the National Assembly (the 60 cm one giving details of each political party) and nine for each of the provinces for the provincial legislature elections indicating only the parties contesting the election in each province. On election day, voters will have both hands dipped into marking fluid which is invisible but shows up under UV lights. That means no one who has been "dipped" can vote again. The dye washes off after about seven days.
