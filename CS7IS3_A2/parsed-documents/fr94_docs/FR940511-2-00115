SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has prepared a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Oro Cruz Operation of the American Girl Project, a proposed gold mining operation on public lands in Imperial County, California. DATES: Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement must be postmarked no later than Tuesday, June 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Bureau of Land Management, El Centro Resource Area, 1661 South Fourth Street, El Centro, California 92243, ATTN: Thomas Zale. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Zale, Multi-Resource Staff Chief, telephone (619) 353&hyph;1060. PUBLIC HEARINGS: No hearings are presently planned. However, should public demand warrant, a hearing would be held by the BLM. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed action is a surface and underground mining project on unpatented lode and placer claims on public lands in Imperial County, California. About 2.5 million tons of ore and 8.5 million tons of waste rock would be mined from two open pits, the Cross Pit and the Queen Pit, during an estimated two year period. The Queen Pit would be backfilled upon completion of mining. Underground mining would begin in the Cross Pit and be conducted concurrently with surface mining. One-half million tons of ore and 65,000 tons of waste rock would be produced during a three year period. Ore produced by both surface and underground mining would be transported 2.5 miles by haul trucks to existing mill and heap leach facilities in American Girl Canyon via a proposed haul road. Waste rock would be disposed of in the Queen Pit, and on one large and three smaller waste rock dumps. Aggregate for use in stabilizing underground mine workings would be hauled from a quarry near the existing American Girl Canyon facilities to the Cross Pit along the same haul road. Surface disturbance resulting from the proposed action would total 191 acres. Dated: April 4, 1994. G. Ben Koski, Area Manager.
