His visit, at the invitation of Rangoon, comes shortly after Prasong finally obtained approval from the five other member states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore -- that Burma should be invited as a guest of the host country and not of the regional grouping. This will limit Rangoon's participation to attending the opening session and the official dinner, not the closed discussions. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had initially held "some reservations" about inviting Burma to the Asean conference. They have expressed concern over Asean losing credibility in the eyes of the world community and about strong criticism from the West, which has strongly condemned the Burmese military regime's heavy-handed policy against the democracy movement. They are also concerned that the problems of Muslim Rohingya refugees fleeing from military persecution in Burma's western Arakan State into Bangladesh are not yet fully resolved. Thailand, as chairman of the Asean Standing Committee, will host the ministerial meeting in July. The forum will be immediately followed by a meeting of Asean with its seven developed, dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the European Union and the United States. Informed sources said Prasong's acceptance of the Burmese junta's invitation and the date is being conveyed to Rangoon for final approval. The trip will last one or two days, depending on the programme arranged by Burmese authorities. Prasong will visit Burma as chairman of the Asean Standing Committee and as Thai foreign minister. The objective of the trip is to inform the Burmese regime what he has done in inviting Burma to the Asean meeting, and to assess the political situation and development in the country, said the sources. The Thai foreign minister has been criticized for his drastic shift of policy towards Burma. He earlier strongly criticized the government of then prime minister Anan Panyarachun for its ties with the Burmese junta and for ignoring the plight of the Burmese democratic forces. At that time he called for a change of policy and for sympathy and support for pro-democratic movement in Burma. Since his appointment as foreign minister, however, he has discarded his previous views and himself become involved with the military junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc). He travelled to Burma last September amid strong opposition from the Burmese dissidents to endorse the establishment of a new bilateral Thai-Burmese committee, which is to oversee trade and economic relations. Prasong has expressed his strong desire to include Burma as a member of Asean at the earliest opportunity. Rangoon has for the past three years shown interest in attending the annual Asean meeting, but lack of consensus among the Asean countries prevented its participation.
