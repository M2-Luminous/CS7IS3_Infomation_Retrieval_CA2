Mirko Galic is one of the best-known journalists in Croatia, a former editor of DANAS, and until recently a correspondent of VECERNJI LIST and VJESNIK. Thanks to his reputation as a superb professional, many believe he will contribute to opening up government television and blunting the attack of numerous European institutions on Croatian TV [HTV]. [Komadina] When did you first learn that you were being considered for director of HRT? [Galic] My name had been "in the pot" for some time, both for that and for certain other positions, which neither excited me nor interested me all that much. I am happiest when I can do my job as a journalist in peace, at present my job as a correspondent, unburdened by any kind of intrigues, especially those involving me and about me that are created by others without my knowledge. There have been such cases. They had me moved over to television before it was a serious consideration. And it became serious in the last two or three months, precisely since the Washington agreement. That is when the proposal was made to me, for the first time in Washington as a matter of fact, that I should help to create the kind of television Croatia needs. I did not accept at first, you can well imagine, because I am not sure I can do that, nor to what extent I will have the proper conditions. I examined myself, but also the circumstances, before I decided to accept. [Komadina] To whom did you talk, and what reasons decided you in favor of accepting that post? [Galic] I talked with those people with whom I had to talk about a decision like that. I did not manage to talk to everyone I wanted to, because some were away from Zagreb at the time. It seems to me that we agreed on what was most important for me--that my job has to do with the programming, not the technology or the finances of Croatian Television. That is all I would know about anyway: I have been a journalist for 25 years, I have gained some experience, I have certain ideas, I still have some determination and energy. The rest is not up to me. [Komadina] Is it true, as we have heard, that you talked twice to President Tudjman, who accepted your condition for precise delimitation of powers at HRT? [Galic] There is no secret or mystery about those to whom I talked. I do not see what the problem is. I did not arrange conferences with those people after every meeting. With Mr. Tudjman, those were really working conversations, they were really frank and open, exclusively about those conditions under which I would go to work in television. I received the guarantees I requested; they still need to be elaborated so that there are no misunderstandings. I have always believed that preparations are half of the job; that is why I endeavored to such an extent to have my rights and also my obligations and responsibilities defined. That part of the agreement is still not finished. There is time yet, the government has (only) appointed me, I still have not taken up my duties as director. [Komadina] From the French perspective, how do you see the continual and clear accusations of the work of HRTV by European parliamentarians? [Galic] Television is what is most visible in any country; it is a screen presented to the world. We should be aware that Croatia will be judged for a long time on the basis of its television. France can afford a television that ruins the picture of a democratic country; in one study, it was in only 25th place in the ranking of the freedom of the media (Belgium is first), and that is because of its television, which is more under commercial than political pressure. Croatia cannot afford that, first, because it needs an open and democratic television in order to develop a democratic culture and the culture of democratic thinking, and second, because television represents a part of its European test. The Council of Europe, as the first step, and the European Parliament, as the second, require a candidate to guarantee an independent and pluralistic television. If everything goes well, toward the end of this year Croatia could cross the first European threshold in Strasbourg. But when delegations of the Council of Europe come to Zagreb soon, I can imagine with quite a bit of confidence what they will ask: How does television express the pluralism of political life? How does the state exercise its influence on television (and more broadly on the media)? [Komadina] As future director of HRT, what is your comment on the fact that Croatia is one of the rare countries (if not the only one) in which legal private television stations do not exist? [Galic] I personally am an advocate of private television, I had taken that position in a study done a year ago, when my coming to HTV was discussed for the first time. Public television--I like that name more than the name government television--is still the backbone of public information; private television should furnish elements of competition and dynamism. But the conditions should be clearly defined for them both, so that we know what standards and quality have to be met, what are the relations between the domestic and foreign programming, what are obligations concerning the news, and so on. It has seemed to me, and it still does, that Croatia ought to have two public channels, the first more on the serious side and the second more on the entertainment side, one private national channel and several regional private television stations. Meanwhile, we ought to define the standards and the code, appoint a special independent council (the present one is too cumbersome) that would monitor how television, both public and private, is respecting its basic obligations as to objectivity, pluralism, and the distribution in programming. [Komadina] Do you think that HRT must be a "cathedral of the Croatian spirit"? [Galic] Croatia has its cathedrals, they should be given freedom to do what belongs to them. But let television be television. If you really want my slogan, I would say that it should be Croatian, democratic, and European. Incidentally, that is what I said in all my conversations. [Komadina] What is your comment on Mr. Vrdoljak's statement that you never would have been heard of, that you would have been anonymous, if it had not been for television? [Galic] Many have called my attention to that statement, some have asked me to react. As though it were offensive. I laughed when I read it. I do not know what else Mr. Vrdoljak said, maybe that statement sounds different in context. But I do not intend to prove to him nor anyone else that I am not an anonymous journalist and that I did exist even before television. It is true that television expands the borders of a journalist's (any journalist's) recognition, and that is exactly what I always wanted to avoid. With television, after all, one loses a portion of privacy. Vrdoljak's statement is probably an element of his style. As far as I am concerned, it will not affect collaboration. [Komadina] Please comment on the charges which have been made that you are "a man for all times," which allude to your work on DANAS and in the socialist system in general. [Galic] I heard that question once before, and my answer was the same as I make to you: Regimes come and go, the journalists remain! If, of course, they are professionals, if they are not too close to the regime, if they are not "regime journalists." What would it be like if the corps of journalists changed with every change? You are right if you are thinking that 1990 was not an ordinary change, because that was the beginning of the time of democracy, which contrasted with and followed the period of one-party government, that is, totalitarianism. But can democracy remove people, professional journalists? Especially those who in the period of one-dimensional thinking displayed courage in expressing other and different thoughts, even opposite thoughts. I am not certain that in citing DANAS you have chosen a good example: That publication, while I headed it (I am not talking about what it was before or afterward), was ahead of the times, precisely because it was disseminating a certain pluralism, because it was developing free criticism, because in the time of the "Croatian silence" it was defending certain threatened Croatian interests, from politics to language. It might seem to you today that that was not very much, but for that time, believe me, it was too much. My head was frequently on the block. [Komadina] Many consider you the most successful editor in the recent history of Croatian journalism. Why did you leave DANAS just when it had reached its peak? [Galic] I will let others speak to how successful or unsuccessful I have been. I will give you just two figures: When I took over the periodical, it had a printing of 43,000 (30,000 sold), and when I left the printing was 110,000 (more than 90,000 sold). I left because I was tired: It was not easy to run an editorial office that was markedly heterogeneous, to withstand the constant criticism from the Vjesnik establishment and the great threats from outside, which came even from the prosecutors. In 1988, the Journalists Society awarded me the annual prize for the editing of DANAS. The citation is worth reading today: The first sentence speaks about the good things I did, and the rest about mistakes, about failures. On the basis of that citation, I should have been punished, not rewarded. I knew the background: When some of the powers that be at that time heard that I had been given a prize, they made an uproar: How can you give an award to DANAS? Because the decision could not be changed, they changed the citation. I can say that most of the editorial staff was on my side, that within the establishment a certain stratification began into supporters and critics of DANAS, that there were allies and opponents even in Croatian politics.... But when I submitted my request to leave, no one said: Don't! Some were overjoyed. [Komadina] How would you describe the situation in Croatian journalism at the moment? [Galic] It is typical of the postcommunist period: There has been a stratification, everything is still at the halfway mark. If aggression against Croatia had not broken out, it all would probably have gone faster, from privatization of the media to definition of journalists. But even so, the changes are obvious, especially in the newspapers, which are moving over a broad front, from the papers that support the government and the incumbent party, and then papers which maintain a certain independence and nurture pluralism, to periodicals whose sympathies are oppositionist. That is democracy. One can only wish for it to go further and faster and for commercial interests not to smother serious journalism.
