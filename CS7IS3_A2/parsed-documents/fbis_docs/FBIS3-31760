It would have been naive to link the working visit of Andrey Kozyrev with a hope to "open a new chapter" in Polish-Russian relations, as was done by some Polish observers after the speech by Andrzej Olechowski in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Therefore, Kozyrev did not take us aback when on Wednesday [23 February] on the forum of the conference "In the Direction of a New Partnership," he presented rather vague principles for an all-European partnership and not a concrete vision of the Russian policy toward the states of Central-Eastern Europe, including Poland. In recent years, Poland has not taken advantage of the opportunity to change its geopolitical location by incorporating our country into the already existing European security structure. Now it is probably too late for that. After its unexpected success in Bosnia, when it presented its large potential by blocking the NATO action, Russia is even more reluctant to agree that a state located near its western border be a member of this organization. The visit of Minister Kozyrev to the Visegrad Group states (except Slovakia) was paid at a special moment: the moment of reconstructing the superpower position of Russia. What could be done by a minister of such a superpower, the position of which was not negated by anyone? Kozyrev had to act just as he acted. He had to behave like a professional diplomat, a friendly interlocutor, but also like a strong partner that no one can impose anything on. The Krakow meetings of both ministers, which, incidentally, were held in a good atmosphere, explained at least one thing: each party perceives the construction of a new all-European security structure differently. This, however, is no obstacle to developing bilateral relations, especially economic contacts. In this respect the heads of the Russian and Polish diplomacies were in agreement.
