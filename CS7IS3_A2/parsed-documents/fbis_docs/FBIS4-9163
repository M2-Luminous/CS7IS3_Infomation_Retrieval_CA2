But he did not change his mind on Rosati. Up to now, the president has successfully resisted attempts by the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who want to have their deputy ministers in the so-called Belweder ministries. "We cannot have a situation where every coalition will have its own ministers," Walesa repeated yesterday. SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski responded: "Does that mean you have nothing against this coalition's presence in MON, the MSZ, and the MSW?" "You are taking shortcuts," Walesa defended himself. But, in the end, he gave in and agreed to coalition deputy ministers being in MON and the MSW, but "using the MSZ as a model." That means that political deputy ministers from the SLD and the PSL will join MON and the MSW, but they will not administer the ministries. The SLD did not manage to get anything done regarding Rosati. Walesa reminded them again that Professor Dariusz Rosati, who is being promoted by the SLD for finance minister and deputy minister for economic affairs and who was rejected by the president, used to be on the governing board of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. "Do you want people to go around and say that he got the post to cover up the affair?" the president yelled. Marek Borowski, deputy chairman of the SLD club, asked the president bluntly: "Rosati is an honest man. Will you sign his nomination?" "I am not pressuring you [the SLD], so don't pressure me, either. If we are to return to anything, it should be you [Borowski]," Walesa replied. He also admitted that "even though I had quite a few disputes with Borowski, as far as his expertise is concerned, there are no reservations." While talking with GAZETA WYBORCZA, Kwasniewski did not rule out that, in this situation, the SLD might give up Rosati, but, until talks with the PSL, Rosati continues to be the coalition's candidate. "Of course, I would like Borowski to be finance minister, but you just don't enter the same river twice," Kwasniewski explained. Another SLD politician said it is not very likely because Pawlak does not get along with Borowski. We asked Borowski whether he would like to be finance minister again. "There are at least six reasons for which I would not agree. For now, it is enough to list one of them--no offer has been made to me," Borowski replied.
