FR940104-0-00004 FR940104-0-00001 The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 25 processors of navel and Valencia oranges who had been completing Form 38, taking about 0.33 hour to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on approximately 210 handlers who ship primarily by truck, taking about 0.40 hour to complete each report. About 80 handlers who ship by rail at some point during a season will continue to use Form 3, taking approximately 0.20 hour to complete the report. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register (58 FR 53112, October 14, 1993) will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 907 and 908 Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 907 and 908 are amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for both 7 CFR parts 907 and 908 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. PART 907_NAVEL ORANGES GROWN IN ARIZONA AND DESIGNATED PART OF CALIFORNIA 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 907, which was published at 58 FR 53112 on October 14, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change. PART 908_VALENCIA ORANGES GROWN IN ARIZONA AND DESIGNATED PART OF CALIFORNIA 3. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 908, which was published at 58 FR 53112 on October 14, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: December 27, 1993. Robert C.
