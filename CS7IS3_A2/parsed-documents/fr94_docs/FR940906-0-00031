FR940906-0-00031 FR940906-0-00017 Partridge (1983) noted that white sturgeon recruitment was intermittent and possibly decreasing from the mid-1960's to 1974. This is demonstrated by lack of white sturgeon from the 1965 to 1969, 1971 to 1973, and 1975 year-classes. Partridge speculated that the lack of recruitment was due in part to the elimination of rearing areas for juveniles through diking of slough and marsh side-channel habitats, and the increase in chemical pollutants (e.g., copper, zinc) in the river that may have affected spawning success. Based on the most recent annual mortality rate estimate of 0.0374 coupled with continuing zero recruitment in the future, BPA believes the population will further decline to an estimated 648 individuals by 1998, with only 17 to 33 females available to spawn annually (BPA 1993). Fish community associates include the burbot ( Lota lota ) and several native salmonids: westslope cutthroat trout ( Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi ), rainbow trout ( Salmo gairdneri ), bull trout ( Salvelinus confluentus ), kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ), and mountain whitefish ( Prosopium williamsoni ). Both burbot and spawning kokanee salmon populations have declined dramatically in the Kootenai River since the 1950's. The decline in burbot is not fully understood, but is thought partially due to the changing Kootenai River hydrograph. Several factors are believed to have contributed to the kokanee collapse, primarily a decline in the overall biological productivity due to system dam construction and operations and the introduction of mysid shrimp in Kootenay Lake, an efficient competitor with kokanee for prey (Ashley and Thompson 1993). Previous Federal Action On November 21, 1991, the Service included the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon as a category 1 candidate species in the Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804), based primarily on the results of field studies conducted by IDFG. Category 1 candidates are taxa for which the Service has on file enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to propose them for endangered or threatened status. On June 11, 1992, the Service received a petition from the Idaho Conservation League, Northern Idaho Audubon, and Boundary Backpackers to list the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon as threatened or endangered under the Act. The petition cited the continuing lack of natural flows affecting juvenile recruitment as the primary threat to the continued existence of the wild sturgeon population. Pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Service published in the Federal Register on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19401) a determination that the petition presented substantial information indicating that listing the sturgeon population as threatened or endangered may be warranted. Based upon the petition, status surveys, and other information on file, the Service proposed the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon for listing as endangered on July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36379). The proposed rule included information submitted by various agencies, including IDFG (Apperson 1992; Apperson and Anders 1990; 1991; Partridge 1983), MDFWP (Graham 1981; Graham and White 1985), the Service (Duke et al. 1990; Miller et al. 1991; Parsley et al. 1989) and the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Parks, Fish and Wildlife (Andrusak 1980). The proposal included a public comment period of 120 days ending November 4, 1993 and gave notice of one public hearing in Sandpoint, Idaho. To accommodate additional public hearings in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, and Libby, Montana, the Service published a notice of public hearing on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41237). The first comment period on the proposal, which originally closed on November 4, 1993, was extended to November 19, 1993 (58 FR 54549) to provide the public with more time in which to submit comments. The Service now determines the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon to be an endangered species with publication of this rule. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the July 7, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 36379), all interested parties were requested to submit comments or information that might contribute to the development of a final determination. The Service also gave notice of a public hearing to be held in Sandpoint, Idaho during the public comment period ending November 4, 1993. On August 3, 1993, the Service published a Federal Register notice announcing two additional public hearings to be held prior to the November 4, 1993 close of the comment period (58 FR 41237). Announcements of the proposed rule and notice of public hearings were sent to at least 156 individuals including Federal, State, County, and City elected officials; State and Federal agencies; interested private citizens; and local area newspapers and radio stations. Announcements of the July 7, 1993 proposed rule were also published in six newspapers: the Bonners Ferry Herald, Bonners Ferry, Idaho; Coeur d'Alene Press, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; the Idaho Statesman, Boise, Idaho; The Spokesman Review, Spokane, Washington; the Tobacco Valley News, Eureka, Montana; and the Western News, Libby, Montana. To accommodate requests for additional public hearings in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, and Libby, Montana, the Service published a notice of public hearings in the Federal Register on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41237). Three public hearings were held on the proposal: from 5 to 8 p.m. on August 24, 1993, in Bonners Ferry, Idaho; from 5 to 8 p.m. on August 25, 1992, in Libby, Montana; and from 1 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on August 26, 1993, in Sandpoint, Idaho. To provide the public with more time in which to provide comments, the Service published a third notice, on October 22, 1993, extending the comment period 15 days to November 19, 1993 (58 FR 54549).
