The five men were detained during a search of the Min Shi Liao 2753, a 127-ton fishing boat from China's coastal Fujian Province, which had been anchoring some 1.2 kilometers southwest of Yokoate- Jima, agency officials said. The five are alleged to have come ashore on Yokoate-Jima, a tiny uninhabited island in the Tokara Islands Chain south of Kyushu. A passing fishing boat had seen the men setting foot on the island and reported them to the agency. The suspects, who reportedly confessed to the allegations, were sent to Naze on Amami Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, for further questioning, the officials said. Crew members said the vessel stopped near the island because of engine trouble.
