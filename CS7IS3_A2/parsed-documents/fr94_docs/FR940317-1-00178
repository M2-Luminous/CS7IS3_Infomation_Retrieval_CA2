Communications must identify the notice number of this ANPRM. Background The management of the national park system is guided by the Constitution, public laws (Pub. L.), proclamations, executive orders, rules and regulations, and directives of the Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. The Act of August 25, 1916, otherwise known as the NPS Organic Act, established the NPS and serves as the touchstone for national park system management philosophy and policy. The Act created the NPS to promote and regulate national parks, monuments, and reservations in accordance with the fundamental purpose of said parks, monuments, and reservations, which is ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.'' (16 U.S.C. 1). Subsequent legislation further states that any authorized activity ``shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes'' of a park area or the national park system, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress. (16 U.S.C. 1a&hyph;1). Thus, ``unimpairment'' is joined by a responsibility to avoid derogation not only of the purposes of a park area but also the values for which the national park system and its individual units have been established. In 1987, the Congress enacted the NPS Overflights Act because it recognized that aircraft overflights can adversely affect national parks. The Act specifically found that noise associated with aircraft overflight at the Grand Canyon National Park was causing ``a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding safety of park users.'' (Pub. L. 100&hyph;91, section 3(a)). The Act mandated a number of studies related to the effects of overflights on parks. The studies have taken longer than was originally anticipated because many of the issues with which they deal are on the cutting edge of technical and scientific capability. Measuring degrees of quiet and perception of quiet is very different from measuring amounts of noise. Since the Overflights Act was passed, the adverse effects associated with the numbers and extent of commercial air sightseeing tours have continued to expand.
