FR940927-0-00062 FR940927-0-00008 The Director approves, as discussed in: finding No. 1, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(1) (b) and (c), concerning civil penalty for violation of chapter, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) (b), (c), and (d), concerning public hearings, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (5) and (6), concerning criminal penalties, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(1), (1)(a)(i), (1)(b) (ii), and (iii), concerning recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed abandoned mine land; finding No. 2, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(2), concerning informal conferences, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3)(e), concerning public hearings, and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28.1(6), concerning certification of completion of coal reclamation; finding No. 4, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(1)(a) and (3)(a), concerning delegation of authority for assessing civil penalties; finding No. 6, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8), concerning civil penalty for failure to correct violation; and finding No. 8, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(1)(b)(i) and (2)(b), concerning delegation of authority to waive fees and liens against reclaimed abandoned mine land. With the requirement that Utah further revise its statute, the Director does not approve, as discussed in: finding No. 3, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6), concerning appeals to district court. The Director is taking this opportunity to revise 30 CFR 944.20 to include the date Utah's plan was approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 944 codifying decisions concerning the Utah program and Utah plan, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program and plan amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs and plans into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Effect of Director's Decision Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight of the Utah program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Utah of only such provisions. VII. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs, abandoned mine land reclamation (AMLR) plans, program amendments, and plan revisions since each such program or plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. Decisions on proposed State AMLR plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.
