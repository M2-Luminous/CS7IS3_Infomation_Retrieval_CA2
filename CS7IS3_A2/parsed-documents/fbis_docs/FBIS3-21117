The center designed a unique system in which transistors are mounted on lasers (transistor-on-laser) and lined up 64 lasers in an array-formation in a cell that is a 480 micron square. Each laser has a built-in transistor as its driver. As a result, this accomplishment makes 10 gigahertz high-speed operations functionally possible and it will open up the way to the attainment of optical computers and optical switchboards. Innovations in the CPU [Central Processing Unit] and such have advanced the speed of computers. However, transmission delays become a problem when there is an interchange among them on networks. It has been pointed out that there are limits to the present method used to amplify the signal by converting optical communications into electricity. Therefore, there is a strong need for optical switches and such which will make ultra high speed circuitry possible for the switching of optical signals, without conversion, between optical fibers. The surface-emission laser is expected to be one of the basic technologies to make this possible. Although a chip has been developed which has integrated over a thousand elements in the surface-emission laser, the conventional product uses a matrix form of circuitry which needs a large electric current to change the frequency of the laser. Moreover, the circuit distance from the driver transistor is so great that it makes high-speed operations difficult. In this instance, the device developed by Matsushita Electric has 64 0.98 nanometer wavelength surface-emission lasers each integrated with a driver transistor. This structure uses a unique method of putting the transistor on top of the laser. By doing this, Matsushita made it possible to increase the high-speed operations to more than 10 times that of the matrix-type and also made it possible to increase the density and reduce the area to one third of the latter type. A special quality is that it is feasible to increase the speed up of 10 gigahertz and it is expected that this development will drastically promote the utilization of optical computers and optical switches.
