In 1993, he became the leader of the Socialist opposition. The tall and youthful 47-year-old SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader now hopes to become chancellor after the 16 October parliamentary election. [Picaper] After the presidential election last Monday [23 May] in Berlin, you said that the liberal party had discredited itself by voting massively for Roman Herzog. Helmut Kohl called you a "graceless loser...." [Scharping] While the Federal Assembly, which elected the president, was entitled to its decision, it did not take into account the will of a majority of the population. The liberals yielded to the chancellor's appetite for power. This is what I criticized, but my criticisms were directed at the Christian Democrats and their president, Helmut Kohl. [Picaper] Do you nonetheless accept Roman Herzog as president? [Scharping] Of course; this was a democratic decision. Any honest democrat will cooperate with the president. [Picaper] You enjoyed a considerable lead over Helmut Kohl in opinion polls. Today, he has caught up with you. [Scharping] This does not worry me at all. While the gap has been varying, the SPD remains in the lead. I am convinced that we will win the European election of 12 June. [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had to wait almost 10 years before he became chancellor. Will you wait this long? [Scharping] No. We intend to win the October 1994 parliamentary election. And the outlook is good. [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had rivals in his own party, in particular Franz Josef Strauss. Is Gerhard Schroeder a potential rival for you? [Scharping] We were both in the running for the position of SPD leader. Gerhard Schroder is a good minister-president in Lower Saxony, and we have no problem cooperating. Close cooperation between SPD minister-presidents is essential. Germany has 16 laender. We participate in the government in 11 of them, including nine in which we lead the government. Our NATO Commitments [Picaper] Do you have the full support of SPD members? [Scharping] I was elected party leader by referendum. More than half of our 900,000 members actually voted. It was the first time in the history of the party that such a procedure was used. This demonstrates our commitment to letting citizens shape political decisions, both within our party and throughout the republic. [Picaper] After the reunification, do you think that Germany's political and economic system should have been reassessed? [Scharping] German reunification was both an opportunity and a challenge. No one disputes Helmut Kohl's merits in achieving German unity, and no one will forget the support of our Western friends. However, since then, economically and socially, Germany has unfortunately been steered in the wrong direction, a selfish one, both by the government and the Bundesbank. [Picaper] Over the past 10 years, there have been differences within the Socialist International between French Socialist Party (PSF) leaders and SPD representatives, among other things with respect to European defense. What has become of these differences? [Scharping] All my visits to Paris proved to me that the strength of our friendship always allows us to achieve a joint position. It is essential that we promote growth and job creation, research and technology. On these issues, there are no disagreements between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard on the one hand, and Germany's Social Democrats on the other. There indeed were a few differences between France and Germany on foreign policy, including between the French Socialists and Germany's Social Democrats. The Elysee Treaty is over 30 years old. I consider that now is the time to make an evaluation and to identify in an addendum both the issues we agree on and future avenues for cooperation. Our friends and partners must know that Germany and France work together ever more closely on economic, monetary, and financial policy, but also on social policy and, I hope, environmental matters. If the Paris-Bonn axis thrives, Europe will make progress, and that is our common responsibility, which we must take on with commitment and passion. [Picaper] A member of France's current government said that Europe cannot be built together with the SPD, especially because you refuse to take part in non-NATO military operations... [Scharping] I think that Alain Lamassoure [French European Affairs minister] was mistaken, at least with regard to Germany's Social Democrats. In any case, we had a chat about that shortly after his statement. I think one should not meddle with internal debates going on in a friendly country. However, one may voice one's opinion. Mr. Lamassoure is entitled to his opinion, one among many others. After I was elected SPD leader, I chose Paris for my first visit abroad, although France can hardly be viewed as a foreign country any more. This was because, in my opinion, French-German cooperation and friendship are the key to European progress. I spoke with many French politicians: [President] Francois Mitterrand, [PS Secretary General] Michel Rocard, but also [Paris Mayor] Jacques Chirac and [former President] Valery Giscard d'Estaing. We have a strong common foundation for working together. Whatever government is in power in France or Germany, our relationship will remain good. Cooperation With France [Picaper] And yet, you will not deny that there was and is a neutralist and pacifist wing within the SPD.... [Scharping] Among the Social Democrats, among the Left, there has always been a pacifist wing. However, that alone does not make a state's foreign policy. The Constitutional Court will soon issue a ruling on military operations beyond our borders. My party has decided that it will honor our NATO and UN commitments. We also approved German cooperation with France within the WEU [Western European Union] and the Franco-German Corps. We approve of it without reservation. We want a European Germany, not a German- dominated Europe. [Picaper] If you win the elections, you will have to enter into a coalition with the pacifist Greens, since you will not have an absolute majority. [Scharping] No. Speaking of foreign policy, at their latest conference, the Greens have passed resolutions that are as silly as they are flawed, including winding up NATO and suppressing the Bundeswehr. This is no way to go about shaping national policy, and if that is the policy they want, the Greens will find themselves isolated. [Picaper] If you do not want to work with the Greens and since you cannot get along with the liberals, all that will be left for you to do will be to set up a large coalition with Helmut Kohl's CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. [Scharping] This is a prospect I reject. The SPD will be the dominant party and will find itself a partner. Until the parliamentary election of 16 October, we shall strive to win over as many voters as we can. And in the evening of that day, the supply of partners will exceed demand. Market economics tells us that the greater the supply, the lower the price and the easier the negotiation. [Picaper] In your debate with Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag on Friday [27 May], you censured him for only talking about the European Commission's white paper, but not implementing it. [Scharping] The white paper contains very good suggestions, which will remain attached to Jacques Delors' name, and I think it is a shame that they are not reflected in the German Government's policies. People start having doubts about a European economic policy which made over 20 million people jobless. Common Future [Picaper] What will tomorrow's Europe be like: a large free-trade zone with over 20 member states, or an integrated Europe? [Scharping] The enlargement of the European Union [EU] must not be an obstacle to its integration. Some people say that taking in Scandinavian countries and Austria will balance the EU. There is no truth to this, as it presupposes that there currently is some kind of imbalance. Truth is, Europe simply needs to be complete, by integrating the Scandinavian countries, Austria, and later the Central European countries. Enlargement must not compromise institutional reform, either. Francois Mitterrand, too, believes that a "multispeed" Europe is feasible. It is obvious that France, Germany, and Benelux will meet stated objectives in the areas of monetary policy, industrial productivity, or financial stability faster than, say, by way of example, Greece, or later, Poland, the Czech Republic, or Slovakia. [Picaper] What will be Germany's future status within Europe: a centrally located country open to all, or a country anchored to the West? [Scharping] There must never be any doubt anymore as to Germany's integration with Western democracies. Germany is a Western country. We neither want to be the center of all things nor to revert to the old Axis policies. We are blessed with peaceful relations with all of our neighbors. Germany must never again be tempted into going it alone in Europe. [Picaper] A few days ago, skinheads and neo-Nazis committed racist attacks in Magdeburg. [Scharping] The underlying causes of this phenomenon are poor education as well as a lack of vocational training and facilities affording them the opportunity to do something meaningful with their leisure time. Add to this a growing sense of despair. So we must invest in education and free time, not only to thwart the progress of extremism, but also to secure our common future. [Picaper] You have likened yourself to Bill Clinton. Do you think your fortunes will be similar? [Scharping] I believe that pressure for change in Germany has been growing. People want government policies to change. While Bill Clinton and Rudolf Scharping are different animals, they belong to the same generation. This can be an asset.
