FR940428-2-00061 FR940428-2-00038 [FRL&hyph;4879&hyph;3] Ozone Design Value Study of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Extension of comment period for draft report on the ``Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study''. SUMMARY: Section 183(g) of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires the Administrator to conduct a study of whether the methodology in use by the EPA, as of the date of enactment, for establishing a design value for ozone, provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA is directed to obtain public review of the study report prior to submitting the report to Congress. The focus of the Ozone Design Value Study is EPA's ozone design value methodology. A design value may be viewed intuitively as a concentration value used to quantify the degree to which the level of an air quality standard has been exceeded. With the wording of the ozone standard, the appropriate design value is the concentration with expected number of exceedances equal to 1. These ozone design values were used to classify areas as marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or extreme in accordance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This notice extends the period for public review and comment of the draft report of the ``Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study'' from 30 days to 60 days. DATES: Comments must be received by May 31, 1994. Availability of Draft Report Single copies of the report are available from the U.S. EPA Library (MD&hyph;35), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone number (919) 541&hyph;2777. Please refer to ``The Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study.'' ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to Mr. Warren P. Freas, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Data Analysis Section, Monitoring and Reports Branch, Technical Support Division MD&hyph;14, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27711.
