The judges decided to set Ceausescu free for the next six months, considering that he is suffering from illnesses that cannot be cured within the penitentiary system. The ROMPRES news agency reminds us that, in his capacity as commander of the Baneasa school of Romania's Ministry of Interior, in December 1989 Andruta Ceausescu participated in the repression of demonstrators, after which he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and reducing to the ranks, for attempted aggravated murder and the instigation of genocide.
