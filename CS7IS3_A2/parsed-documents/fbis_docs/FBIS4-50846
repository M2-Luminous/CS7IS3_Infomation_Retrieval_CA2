Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the meeting. He stressed: Army officers transferred to civilian work should be placed appropriately without any deviation in an effort to satisfy the army, the localities, higher levels, and the people. Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the meeting and offered his opinions on implementation of the guidelines of the meeting. Li Haifeng, vice governor of the province, also spoke at the meeting. Cheng Weigao said: The congratulatory letters sent by Comrades Jian Zemin and Li Peng on 3 April to the national meeting on placement of army officers transferred to civilian work have expressed the importance of the work of placing army officers transferred to civilian work and have clearly pointed out the orientation of this work. Party committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously study and successfully implement the guidelines of this meeting in order to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian work. Success in army building requires not only the efforts of military units, but the great support and coordination of local party committees and governments. Successful placement of army officers transferred to civilian work is of extremely great significance in stabilizing the army, consolidating national defense, and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the army. Today when we are carrying out reform and opening to the outside world with the purpose of quadrupling the 1980's GNP by the end of this century, what is most needed is stability. Failing in army building, there will be no stability. Party committees and governments at all levels must consider the placement of army officers transferred to civilian work as a major political task and grasp it in a resolute manner. In recent years, the province has achieved great results in economic construction. These results are inseparable from the fact that a large number of army officers who transferred to civilian work have become backbone forces on various fronts. Such officers have high political expertise, a strong sense of organizational discipline, a high level of education, and certain specialized skills and knowledge. So, we welcome the transfer of such officers. When talking about the placement of army officers transferred to civilian work in this and the past few years, Cheng Weigao said: Each year, We transferred two to three thousands of army officers to civilian work thanks to the hard work of personnel departments and organizational departments at all levels. Generally speaking, the work in this aspect has been good. At present, although we are faced with the tasks of streamlining organizations and expanding enterprises' autonomy in employment and personnel affairs, we still should try every possible means to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian work. Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, in placing army officers transferred to civilian work, we must handle affairs in strict accordance with state policies on placement of army officers transferred to civilian work. All localities and all units are banned from formulating policies of their own. In placing such officers, we should resolutely avoid such unhealthy tendencies as entering through the back door. We should satisfy the demands of such officers to the maximum in line with their respective characteristics and specialities. We should try every possible means to resolve their problems with regard to lives, houses, jobs, and schooling and employment of their children so that they can fully display their role in economic construction.
