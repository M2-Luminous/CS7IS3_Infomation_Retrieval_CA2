FR940317-1-00003 FR940317-1-00001 If this proposed rule is adopted, all areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties would be released from their classification as quarantined areas, and the area in Hillsborough County would be released from its classification as a survey area. If the proposed rule is adopted, citrus plants, plant parts, citrus fruit, and other regulated articles from currently quarantined areas would be allowed to be moved interstate to other areas in the United States, including commercial citrus-producing areas, and regulated articles would be allowed to be moved interstate through quarantined areas. Requirements which apply to survey areas would also be removed. We have determined that 237 individuals and businesses would be economically affected by the proposed changes. These individuals and businesses include: Lawn care companies (82), grove owners (74 persons who own 2,177 acres), retail nursery outlets (21), fruit processors (15), fruit harvesting contractors (12), fruit shippers (12), fresh fruit packing houses (11), nurseries (9), and seed extractors (1). APHIS believes that virtually all of these individuals and businesses are small entities. These individuals and businesses are all currently required to comply with the regulations. This results in inconvenience and in some cases expenses that are not encountered by similar individuals and businesses in other parts of the United States. It should be noted that the costs of compliance are, in many cases, minimal, and that the individuals and businesses affected by the regulations represent less than one percent of all similar individuals and businesses in Florida. One of the largest groups of affected individuals and business is grove owners. We estimate that this rule change would save each affected grove owner approximately $25 per acre, per year, by removing requirements for cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and personnel leaving their groves. These costs represent a small percentage of the owners' overall production costs. In addition, this proposed rule would allow grove owners to expand the areas into which their fruit could be moved interstate, in that they would be allowed to move fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. We anticipate that any impact from this rule change would be negligible, as approximately 90 percent of all of Florida's citrus production is for the juice market, and only about 10 percent is for the fresh fruit market. In addition to grove owners in the quarantined areas, truckers, packing and processing plants, and lawn services within the currently quarantined areas would no longer be subject to inspection and would no longer need to carry out activities now required by the regulations. This would result in financial savings to these entities. This also means that groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement, regulated trees, and regulated plants in the current survey area would no longer be subject to regular inspections for citrus canker. This change would reduce the burden on APHIS and State agencies, which currently provide inspectors to perform regular inspections in the survey area. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation. Accordingly 7 CFR part 301 would be amended as follows: PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 1. The authority citation for part 301 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 150bb, 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 161, 162, and 164&hyph;167; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c). 2. In §301.75&hyph;4, paragraphs (a) and (d)(1) would be revised to read as follows: §301.75&hyph;4 Quarantined areas. (a) The following States or portions of States are designated as quarantined areas: Citrus canker is not known to exist in the United States. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (1) Survey area. In the following area, inspections are conducted as required by paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), and (d)(1)(iii) of this section: Citrus canker is not known to exist in the United States. * * * * * Done in Washington, DC, this 11th day of March 1994.
