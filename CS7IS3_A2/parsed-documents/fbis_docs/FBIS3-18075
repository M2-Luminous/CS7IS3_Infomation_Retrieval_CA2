We interrupt our regular programing to report some urgent news on Bosnia. This morning between 0630 and 0700 [0430-0500 GMT], four Yugoslav Galeb aircraft were shot down by two U.S. F-16's. This was announced a short time ago by YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] Chief Admiral Khristos Limberis. The report was confirmed just a few minutes ago in a REUTER dispatch from NATO headquarters in Brussels. The news item from NATO is very brief. It reads: NATO has announced that four planes were shot down by U.S. aircraft. According to Admiral Limberis, the Galeb planes are two-seater training craft similar to the T-33. They can, however, be easily transformed into fighters. These planes were flying over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the zone that is restricted according to the UN resolution, 50 miles southeast of Banja Luka. News agency dispaches mention nothing more and offer no other information from Yugoslavia. We now have correspondent Stefanos Kasimatis on the telephone line from the Ministry of National Defense: [Kasimatis] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis has just completed a statement on the situation. His first comment concerned the downing of four Galeb-type planes that belong to the Serb Air Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This unfortunate incident confirms the correctness of the Greek position against any direct or indirect engagement by any Balkan country in the Bosnian crisis. The minister also noted that what impressed him was that the four planes shot down were mainly training aircraft. But Admiral Limberis, who interrupted his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, noted that these planes are easily transformed into fighter craft. Arsenis said they were informed of the incident by NATO headquarters in Naples and the British Embassy during the meeting with Hurd. There has been no other Greek reaction and the Greek side is waiting for developments. Answering a correspondent's question, Arsenis clarified that the Greek military personnel in Bosnia, who number about 100, are there within the framework of a European Union initiative, not a NATO one, so there is no possibility of Greece becoming involved. He reiterated the firm Greek position against engaging in the crisis in Bosnia. This is the news from the Ministry of National Defense.
