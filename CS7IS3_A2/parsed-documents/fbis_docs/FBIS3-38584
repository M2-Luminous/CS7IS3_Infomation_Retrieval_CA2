Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik expressed disappointment that Russia had not given a fixed timetable for withdrawing its 3,750 troops from the Baltic republic during talks between the two sides in Moscow that ended on Wednesday. "The round was not very successful," he said, because Moscow had gone back on its promise to submit a withdrawal calendar. But he added the hope that Moscow would stick to its August 31 deadline for pulling all its troops out. Luik said he saw the Partnership for Peace -- a blueprint for military cooperation between the North Atlantc Treaty Organisation and its former Cold War adversaries -- as a step towards full NATO membership for Estonia. "We consider it of the utmost importance that the three Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) start the process of integrating into NATO together with our neighbours from East Europe," he said. The U.S.-sponsored Partnership was formally announced at a NATO summit here on January 10. Poland, Lithuania and Romania have already signed up, and virtually all other countries of East Europe have expressed their intention to do so. Most have said their ultimate aim is full membership of NATO. But the trans-Atlantic Alliance has ruled out any immediate intention to take in new members from East Europe for fear of angering Russia. The Estonian minister stressed that his country wanted good relations with "a democratic Russia," but added: "Only countries that are sure of their security can be equal and relaxed partners to Russia." Luik said NATO security guarantees were essential for the stability of East Europe. He expressed alarm at statements of Russian leaders that they have a right of intervention in neighbouring countries -- "the near abroad." The minister said this doctrine was impeding the normalisation of Estonia's relations with Russia which has withdrawn all its troops from Lithuania but still has 20,000 in Latvia. Luik noted that Estonia had already made progress in aligning with NATO standards. The commander of the Estonian Defence Force, General Aleksander Einseln, is a retired colonel from the U.S. Army. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have announced plans to form a Baltic peacekeeping battalion for taking part in United Nations operations and NATO exercises. Partnership for Peace involves bringing countries of the former Soviet bloc into NATO military and political activities, but without giving them the security guarantees which would come with full NATO membership. The Partnership involves a menu of cooperation possibilities from which each candidate can choose, depending on its needs, capability and what it can afford. The options include joint military manoeuvres, peacekeeping, disaster relief, search-and-rescue, military communications, defence planning, training for democratic control of the miliary and the clean-up of old Soviet bases.
