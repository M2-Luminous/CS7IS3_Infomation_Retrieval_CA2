FR940805-2-00114 FR940805-2-00058 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34471; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;22] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments To Exchange Rule 103 August 1, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on June 15, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On July 11, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify which Exchange members would be affected by the proposal. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 See letter from Claudia Crowley, Special Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 1, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange is proposing to amend Amex Rule 103 to permit a member, while on the trading floor, to initiate a proprietary stock transaction while he has a position in a listed option overlying the stock. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Amex Rule 103 prohibits a member, while on the trading floor, from initiating a proprietary stock transaction while he has a position in an option overlying the stock, or while he has knowledge that any account in which his member organization or any other member, allied member or approved person in such organization is directly or indirectly interested has such an option position. Rule 103 was adopted in 1935 in response to a Commission request to each national securities exchange, and was intended to control various abuses in the use of options connected to the operations of manipulative ``pools'' during the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1977, shortly after the start of trading in listed options, the Commission reviewed the issue of whether the restriction should be eased with respect to listed options, and agreed to lift the restriction for regional exchange members, citing the small percentage of total orders in the underlying equity flowing to any one regional exchange. 2 Indicating a desire to progress very cautiously in this area, however, the Commission declined to permit a change in the rule at the primary markets, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and the Amex. The Commission did indicate a willingness to study whether specialists should be allowed to hedge in options on their specialty stocks, and a rule to that effect with specific hedging guidelines was ultimately adopted. 3 Such hedging by specialists is specifically permitted by Rule 103. 2 See Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets to the SEC, p. 870 et seq. (1978). 3 See Amex Rule 175 and the Guidelines for Specialists' Specialty Stock Options Transactions. Accordingly, the impact of Rule 103(a) is now limited to the Registered Equity Traders 4 and Registered Equity Market Makers (``REMMs''), 5 who are the remaining classes of members who initiate proprietary transactions on the floor in equities while restricted by Rule 103(a) from doing so if they hold a position in the overlying options. The Amex is proposing to lift the Rule 103 restriction with respect to listed options. The NYSE recently received Commission approval for similar amendments to its comparable rule. 6 4 See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 1. A Registered Equity Trader is an Amex member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the floor of the Exchange but who is not registered as a specialist or odd-lot dealer. See Amex Rules 110 and 111(f). Registered Equity Traders exist pursuant to, and must comply with the requirements of, Section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the Amex requires that 75% of a Registered Equity Trader's monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See Amex Rule 111(e). 5 A REMM is a Registered Trader who is a designated to act as a market maker in certain securities. REMMs are authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the floor of the Exchange and have an affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market. See Amex Rule 114(b). In addition, REMMs must comply with a complex series of rules about the price at which they can trade and the size of those trades. See Amex Rule 114, Commentary .02(c). 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34135 (May 31, 1994), 59 FR 29463 (June 7, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) (approving amendments to NYSE Rule 96 that permit an NYSE Floor professional who has a listed option position in a stock to initiate an on-Floor proprietary trade in that stock) (``NYSE approval order''). As the Commission noted in its order approving the NYSE rule change, this proposal may reduce the current disincentive for options market participants to act as stock traders, thereby increasing the capital committed to such market making activities and improving the depth and liquidity of such markets, particularly in times of market stress. Further, the Exchange believes that, similar to the NYSE, the Amex's surveillance and compliance programs would enable the Exchange to identify and investigate stock and/or options transactions which raise manipulative concerns, and to detect and deter intermarket manipulation and other fraudulent or abusive practices. Finally, the Amex also proposes to correct a cross reference in Rule 103(b) to Rule 175, which was not done when Rule 175 was last amended.
