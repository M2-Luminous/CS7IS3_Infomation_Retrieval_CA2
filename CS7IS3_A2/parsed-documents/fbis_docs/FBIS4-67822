The only alternative to them is a regime of total international confidence. This is stated in a report of the Russian delegation submitted to the 27th conference of the Japanese atomic industrial forum underway here. The report has been drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It believes that the Russian nuclear complex which is experiencing difficult times should export more electricity generated by nuclear power plants and should heavier rely on the export of technologies and a number of materials. It should be open to international cooperation. In view of the unstable situation in the world, while nuclear disarmament is in progress, the complex of nuclear arms is under certain obligations, says the report. More stable, easier verifiable and predictable strategic arms systems should be preserved while surplus, morally and obsolete provocatively dangerous kinds of nuclear arms should be eliminated. Russia spends up to one thousand billion roubles a year to dismantle such armaments, according to the information of the Ministry of Atomic Energy. The basic stocks of arms are worn to over 50 per cent. A large-scale modernisation is required in keeping with contemporary demands, also in order to dismantle and utilise nuclear arms. The Ministry of Atomic Energy regards as a way out a broader use of vast scientific and technological potential accumulated over the decades of the development of the atomic industry. ``In addition to large state investment, Russia's participation in the market of high technologies and scientific and technological progress with drawing foreign capital in reasonable and mutually advantage proportion would be useful to all sides,'' says the report. ``The ministry annually receives 80 million dollars of additional financing for scientific and technological projects. As a result of external financing of projects carried out at enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Energy with the subsequent joint use.'' The new generation of nuclear power and thermal stations with fuel recycling and deactivation of waste, including slow-neutron and fast-neutron reactors with the use of uranium-plutonium fuel and the uranium-thorium cycle also requires considerable outlays. These power plants will be much more safer because of features of their design including an uncontrolled chain reaction of nuclei. Russia views as an additional source of investment into the area the expansion of the export of electricity generated by nuclear power plants, of equipment and fuel for power plants, including products for the utilisation of weapon-grade uranium and plutonium, as well as rare-earth metals, medical isotopes and high-calory fertilizer which are produced in the framework in the nuclear complex. This investment will reach one billion dollars this year.
