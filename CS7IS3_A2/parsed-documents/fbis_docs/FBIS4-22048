FBIS4-22048 "jptot016__l94004" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 13 April 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Trang Governor, Police Official View Terrorism Precautions Trang Governor, Police Official View Terrorism Precautions BK1304081094 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in Thai 0530 GMT 13 Apr 94 BK1304081094 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network Thai BFN [Text] Trang Governor David Wichaidit has discussed the spread of terrorism in his province and Phatthalung Province. He said the government's intelligence is more broad and detailed than the media's. For this reason, Trang Province has stepped up precautions and measures to deal with the possibility of terrorism. Regarding a report that the prime minister's home might be the target of a bomb attack, Trang provincial officials will try to ensure security in all areas, although there is not enough manpower to cover every area around the clock. The province can only increase precautionary measures in likely target areas. The people can be confident that the province is doing its best to maintain security through constant coordination with the Fourth Army Region. Asked if he reported this information to the prime minister, the Trang governor said the prime minister did not pay attention only to Trang Province, but to the entire country. The prime minister did not ask anything specific. The province did not make any specific report to the prime minister because it regards this as taking normal security precautions. Asked if the situation might worsen, the Trang governor said he could not comment on other provinces, but he is confident that his province will not be affected much by the reported possibility of terrorist activities. This is because his province has had relevant intelligence reports for some time and has been constantly vigilant. He said no special police unit has been sent to protect the prime minister's residence because such a measure could frighten passers by. He also does not believe such a measure would be the correct security method. He gave assurances, however, that there are both secret and overt security plans as well as ad hoc security center in his province that he would rather not reveal to the public. Meanwhile, Police Colonel Phitsanu Bunyarat, deputy commander of the Railway Police, noted the security measures for trains operating on southern routes. He said the police department has made plans with the units concerned -- the military; the border patrol police; and the governors of Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat -- to prevent train sabotage. More railway policemen have been assigned to trains, particularly the Bangkok-Sungai Kolok train and the Sungei Kolok-Bangkok train, while they travel along the dangerous section between Hat Yai and Sungei Kolok. Four policemen have been added to these trains in addition to the previous four. They will be equipped with modern arms and communications equipment. This should be sufficient to protect passengers. Capable policemen have been chosen especially for this purpose. Phitsanu said several units have been assigned responsibility for overseeing the safety of sections of railroad track. There is a problem with inefficient intelligence collection, however, caused by religious and language issues. Officials do not have enough experience with these issues.
