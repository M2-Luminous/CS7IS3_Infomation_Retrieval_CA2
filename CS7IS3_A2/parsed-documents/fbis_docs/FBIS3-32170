In an interview he granted us he set as his prime objective the fight against poverty, while promising a policy of economic austerity . The leading crude oil power in Latin America, Venezuela has reached rock bottom. The state, up to its ears in debt and wholly disorganized, is now bankrupt with an estimated budget deficit of $6 billion. In four years, the dollar exchange rate has leapt from 38 to 108 bolivares, representing a serious de facto devaluation. Interest rates have risen from 12 percent to 70 percent. The recent collapse of the country's second largest bank, the Banco Latino, has forced thousands of anguished small investors out onto the streets of the capital and continues to threaten the whole financial system. The fall in the price of a crude oil barrel ($12) on the international market is a cruel blow for an economy that is already faltering. The growth rate was negative in 1993. According to experts, the spectacular growth rates recorded between 1990 and 1992 (7 percent on average) were mainly due to the very high interest rates and inflows of "dirty" money from Colombia, Panama, and the Cayman Islands -- drug money. Corruption is widespread and there is growing insecurity -- with 50 deaths every weekend in Caracas -- while the public administration is bloated and inefficient. Rafael Caldera, 78 years old, has inherited a country traumatized by the economic crisis and the two attempted military coups in 1992. The specter of a putsch still hovers and the dismissal of Defense Minister Admiral Radarnes Munoz has added to the concern. Certain military coup leaders were recently freed by the interim government of Ramon J. Velasquez. Colonel Chavez, however, leader of the uprising on February 1992, is still imprisoned. The question remains whether he too should be freed. `Free Chavez' "Without doubt he should," said Mr. Caldera. "The majority of the population wants him to be released. Peace will come to the country if we take this step. Everywhere during my electoral campaign I heard this popular appeal -- free the military rebels. As president I have the right to do this. I hope this decision will be accepted by all of the Armed Forces." The move risks being denounced by the generals, while the army has taken an increasing hold over public affairs since 1992. "That is as may be," Caldera replied dryly, "but I also believe that everyone accepts the need to reestablish the predominance of civil power." It is said that in September 1993 Washington again discouraged senior Venezuelan army officers who had gone to the United States to sound out the Clinton administration on "possible renewed military intervention in their country." Caracas diplomatic circles confirm that there is a very strong, even "insistent," North American "presence" in the Venezuelan capital. The new president stated: "The United States knows that our democracy has the value of being a test and a symbol for the whole of Latin America. It attaches a lot of importance to that fact. Moreover, the recent incidents in Argentina and Mexico -- the Chiapas revolution -- and the uprisings in our prisons are all warning signs of the constant risks of social explosion south of the Rio Grande. For this reason, I am convinced more than ever that our number one priority must be the fight against poverty and marginalization. We must revise and amend an economic policy that is too radical. This is one of the causes of the general malaise. You can see the same thing in Russia and in eastern Europe." `We Are No Longer a Country of Independent Means' Explain, negotiate, and convince, in Venezuela and abroad: Mr. Caldera's team has already started talks to renegotiate the debt (of which in theory only 10 percent can be rescheduled). The president stated: "Of course, but there are special mechanisms, not least because the crude oil market plays a key role in the structure of our debt. The World Bank has assured me of its comprehension and the international financial institutions know that we are in a serious situation. The Clinton administration knows it too. We must save our democracy and I have high hopes." Mr. Caldera considers that oil will for a long time remain the key motor of the Venezuelan economy, even though he is determined to favor a diversification of the source of foreign income which at the moment is too dependent on fluctuations in oil prices. "For a long time we were the Saudi Arabia of Latin America, but we are not any more. Previous governments speculated on a regular rise in the price of crude and dreamed of $50 per barrel. As a result, our budget has increased by a factor of 100 in 20 years. During my first term of office I was able to revalue the bolivar. Now, our currency is weakening all the time, and in 1993 we had inflation of 40 percent. Society must accept that we are no longer a country of independent means and that frantic speculation has done a lot of harm to our country." How can Venezuela find urgently-needed resources and make up the budget deficit? Mr. Caldera is a prisoner of his own electoral promises -- which he says he intends to honor -- but the commitments are specific. The Velasquez government decreed a 10-percent VAT [value-added tax] rate which recently sparked street riots throughout the country. The fear of another "caracazo" (the bloody uprising of February 1989 caused by modest hikes in public transport fares) is at the back of everyone's mind. Can Mr. Caldera perform an economic U-turn and cancel the Perez government's austerity plan of 1989? In any case, this is what the main sectors of society are expecting. The president pointed out: "Almost all the elements of the 1989 plan can be changed. Some things were right, such as the elimination of preferential exchange rates which were a source of corruption. We have to revise everything in a pragmatic way. I announced a policy of austerity and the government must lead by example. The presidential running costs will be cut by 30 percent. VAT, an unfair tax, must be canceled." VAT has already been suspended by the outgoing government in response to street demonstrations, and has been replaced by income tax. The problem is how to make people pay taxes in a country where this "custom" is more or less unheard of. Mr. Caldera does not pretend the difficulty does not exist, but at least he wants to try. "That will require very severe measures. We have started living in a protest culture. While VAT has become a symbol, even a taboo, the same is also true for petrol. It is almost impossible to touch it. However, public opinion must accept that price rises are inevitable. The sacrifices made will be sweetened by the compensations to be had. There again, this is a long-term task. After the attempted coup of February 1992, Carlos Andres Perez announced to Congress that everything was going to change. He was applauded just once -- when he said that the price of petrol would not go up." People say that Mr. Caldera is an authoritarian: "I do not think that is true. I am capable of changing my mind. If I am right, however, then I vigorously defend my point of view. I have acquired a false reputation: People have confused firmness with pride. Here there is a considerable risk that things could get out of control. I cannot promise miracles or prompt radical changes, except where assistance to the underprivileged is concerned.
