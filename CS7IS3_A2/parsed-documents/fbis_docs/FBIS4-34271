He said Congress has a solution to the readjustment. Ricupero pointed out: "Unfortunately the constitutional reform was not concluded and the federal government has no way to modify what is established in the Constitution or in federal laws." The minister explained that any minimum wage increase is directly conditioned to the need to dissociate the national minimum wage from the minimum pension paid by the Social Security Ministry. The government also wants a definition on the proposal that states and mayoralties of the poorest Brazilian regions be allowed to pay a different minimum wage. The two modifications should have been approved during the constitutional reform because the 1988 Constitution establishes that the smallest pension paid by the Social Security Ministry must equal one minimum wage.
