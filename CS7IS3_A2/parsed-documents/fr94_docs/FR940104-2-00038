FR940104-2-00038 FR940104-2-00029 Health Care Financing Administration [BPD&hyph;780&hyph;PN] RIN 0938&hyph;AG43 Medicare Program; Withdrawal of Coverage of Diagnostic Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Testing (Impotence Testing) AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Proposed notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the Medicare program's proposal to revise its national policy by withdrawing coverage for diagnostic nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing in the sleep disorder clinic. For all other settings, we are proposing to exclude rather than withdraw coverage because the Medicare program does not have a national policy that provides for coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in settings other than sleep disorder clinics. Public Health Service studies show that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence. Therefore, it does not meet HCFA's criteria for effectiveness. DATES: Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on March 7, 1994.
