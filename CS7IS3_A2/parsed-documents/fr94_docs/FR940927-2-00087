FR940927-2-00087 FR940927-2-00063 On the other hand, in the contractor-applicant and charter-conversion situations, the contractor is the ``true'' operator in an economic sense, and the purported contract bulk fare arrangements are the driving force behind the operation. Although the direct air carrier is responsible for the operation of the flight, the contractor controls the scheduling, allocation of inventory, and price, and bears that risk for marketing most, if not the total capacity, of the aircraft. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to distinguish these operations from those performed by a direct air carrier under a wet lease arrangement or by a charter operator under the Public Charter rules. More importantly, if the contract bulk fare operator should for any reason fail to remit collected funds, the direct air carrier nevertheless ultimately bears the responsibility to the passengers for either providing the air transportation or paying refunds. While this may not pose any undue risk in the case of a carrier with other substantial operations, in the situations described above, the amount of monies for which the direct air carrier could be held liable may be so great as to endanger its own economic viability and ultimately adversely affect its other customers. Decision We continue to believe that the contract bulk fare concept can be a valuable marketing tool for direct air carriers, and, where properly used, that the conditions imposed in our exemption orders provide adequate protection for consumers. However, when the Board originally granted_and we continued_the contract bulk fare exemption, it was envisioned that this authority would be used by existing scheduled carriers as a tool to expand their marketing capabilities, and that such contracts would be incidental to their other scheduled operations. It was not envisioned that applicants for direct air carrier authority could use the contract bulk fare mechanism as a means of ``jump-starting'' their proposed operations prior to being found fit, or that these arrangements would be used as a means of avoiding the Public Charter consumer protection requirements. Thus, it is our view that the two situations described above were not intended to be covered by the exemption granted by Orders 81&hyph;7&hyph;109 and 88&hyph;9&hyph;2. More importantly, the arrangements have the potential to create great risks for consumers, since they could be used to circumvent our fitness requirements or the consumer protection provisions of our charter rules. Therefore, we have tentatively decided to amend the exemption to require that the direct air carrier be, as discussed above, the ``true'' operator of the service in an economic sense and the contract bulk fare arrangement be incidental to that carrier's overall scheduled operations. The direct air carrier may not use a contract bulk fare arrangement as the only means of holding out its scheduled services, but must, in fact, be holding out on its own behalf the scheduled air services that are also being sold under the contract bulk fare arrangement. Practically speaking, this means that the direct air carrier would be responsible for holding out scheduled service in its own name through the traditional marketing mechanisms of the industry, such as listing its flights in the Official Airline Guides or major computer reservations systems, or using travel agents or advertisements. We do not wish to preclude the customary use by direct air carriers of the contract bulk fare exemption in the many resort or vacation markets in which they currently use it as an additional tool to expand the marketing of their scheduled service by selling seats to tour or cruise operators for packaging and resale. The direct air carriers involved in the these situations typically have extensive scheduled service operations elsewhere and the particular services involved in the contract bulk fare arrangement are under the ultimate economic control of the direct air carrier. We would consider these operations to be incidental to the overall scheduled operations of the direct air carrier even if it were to result in the sale of a large portion or even a majority of the seats in a particular market. In such circumstances, the contract bulk fare operations would not pose an undue risk to consumers or to the direct air carrier. While we have been considering a clarification of the existing exemption, we have taken no action against contract bulk fare arrangements in which contractors could sell up to 85 percent of the seats on each flight in the markets in question. 8 However, such arrangements would not be permitted in the future to the extent that they are inconsistent with the policies we are proposing here. We will, however, consider requests for individual exemptions in specific cases. Moreover, in reviewing applications to register trade names and for new scheduled authority, we propose to apply the policies expressed in this order. Thus, if we are convinced that the use by a direct air carrier of the trade name of a contractor would constitute an unlawful holding out under section 41101(a) or should there be a significant potential for, or actual, public confusion or other unfair or deceptive practices prohibited by section 41712, we would not register the trade name for the direct air carrier. Nor would we approve an initial scheduled service application for U.S. certificate or commuter authority which relies primarily on a contract bulk fare arrangement as the underlying basis for the proposed scheduled operations. 8 See, e.g., Orders 94&hyph;6&hyph;39, Mahalo Air, Inc., and 94&hyph;3&hyph;38, Great American Airways, Inc. In those orders, we also noted our concerns over the use of contract bulk fare arrangements as the primary means of marketing specific scheduled services, and indicated our intent to re-examine and clarify our policies with regard to such arrangements. Objections We will give interested persons 15 days following the date of issuance of this order to show cause why the tentative findings and conclusions set forth here should not be made final; answers to objections will be due within 10 days thereafter. We expect such persons to direct their objections, if any, to the policies proposed in this order. We will not entertain general, vague, or unsupported objections. If no objections are filed, we will issue an order that will make final our tentative findings and conclusions.
