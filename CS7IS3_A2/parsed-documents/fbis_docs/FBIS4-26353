This is a significant meeting for the overseas Chinese sector, and is also a great event which the returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and the vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad, numbering more than 30 million, have universally followed with interest. The convocation of this meeting is of vital significance to further mobilizing the vast numbers of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th Party National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and accelerating the development of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our warm congratulations to this meeting; our best wishes to the vast number of returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals residing abroad; our cordial greetings to the assiduous workers of overseas Chinese affairs; and our respects to the advanced collectives and individuals in overseas Chinese work, who will be commended at this meeting. Returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and the vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad have made tremendous contributions to China's revolution and construction in various historical periods and have written an epic and historic chapter on the prosperity of the motherland and the progress and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. During the new historical period, the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives are active in the posts of various trades and professions. With a lofty sense of mission and responsibility, they have enthusiastically devoted themselves to reform, opening up, and socialist modernization undertakings, have made brilliant achievements in bringing about economic development and social progress, and have played a positive role in the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad are the most enthusiastic supporters of China's open-door policy, its effort to develop foreign trade and economic cooperation, and its scientific, technological, and cultural exchange activities. Advancing hand in hand with the local people, they have performed substantial work for the prosperity and progress of the countries where they are residing as well as for the development of friendly ties between these countries and China. They have demonstrated utterly sincere feelings for the reform and construction of the motherland. The period between now and the middle of next century will be a great historic period of national rejuvenation and the realization of socialist modernization in China. In the 1990's, we will strive to achieve the second-step objective of quadrupling GNP ahead of schedule so that the people will be able to lead a relatively comfortable life, and the socialist market economic structure will be initially established. In line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, we will resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao as scheduled and will maintain long-term stability and prosperity there. We will also push forward the great cause of reunifying the motherland in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems." For these purposes, we must fully mobilize the initiative of the entire people, including the returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing abroad. They have the fine tradition of loving their motherland and home towns, and boast the advantage of extensive relationships with the people and rich information resources abroad. Hence, they are a major force in the country's drive for modernization and will certainly make greater contributions to the magnificent cause of rejuvenating and reunifying the motherland. This is a crucial year for China's socialist modernization process. "Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability" are the tasks on which the overall interest of the entire party and country hinges. The Overseas Chinese affairs work should be consciously subordinate to and serve this overall interest. Closely centering around this overall interest, we must seriously put into practice various principles and policies on Overseas Chinese affairs work in the new period, must extensively unite and mobilize the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to devote themselves to reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, must enthusiastically promote trade and economic cooperation as well as scientific, technological, and cultural exchange between the Overseas Chinese and the motherland, must maintain social stability, and must give impetus to economic development and comprehensive social progress. The vast number of overseas Chinese affairs workers should do all they can to forge ahead with one heart and one mind in a bid to initiate a new situation for Overseas Chinese affairs work. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is a mass organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese throughout the country under the party leadership, and is a bridge and link between them and the party and government. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels have exercised a significant role in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. The vast number of cadres of these federations have worked diligently and have made brilliant achievements. Under the new situation, they are faced with even heavier tasks, and their position and role are even more important. The federations at various levels should be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, should adhere to the party's basic line, should perform their work with an emphasis on economic construction, and should exercise their functions in a comprehensive way. They should exploit their own advantages and, through their effective work, further mobilize and unite the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives across the country to devote greater efforts to pushing forward the undertakings of reform, opening up, and modernization in China. It is necessary to fully exercise the role of the returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives in participating in the deliberation and administration of state affairs and in democratic supervision. Their legitimate rights and interests in the country should be protected in accordance with the law. It is also necessary to fully exploit the advantages of the federations of returned Overseas Chinese in conducting nongovernmental exchange and increasing contact with foreign countries. We should give enthusiastic assistance to the returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing abroad in their efforts to run cultural, educational, public health, and other social welfare undertakings in the country. Besides, it is necessary to bring into full play the role of the federations of returned Overseas Chinese in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and make further efforts to strengthen such building in their home towns. Through intensified reform and building, we should train a contingent of overseas affairs workers who have both ability and political integrity and who will enthusiastically serve the returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing abroad. The work of the federations of returned Overseas Chinese should be geared to the needs of the grass-roots units and should go deep into the realities of life. They should earnestly propagate and explain the party's principles and policies and the important measures on reform and opening up to the returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives, get acquainted with their aspirations, show concern for their weal and woe, and convey their views and demands to the party and government in good time. These federations should be built into vigorous and energetic "homes of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives" which are trusted by the broad masses. Deputies and comrades, the party and government always pay serious attention to the role of the returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals residing abroad in revolution and construction, as well as to the work of overseas affairs. Under the new situation, the party and government at all levels should further intensify and improve leadership over overseas affairs work, should give full rein to the initiative of the federations, and should enthusiastically show concern for and give support to their work. I profoundly believe that, after the current meeting, a brand new situation of unity and endeavor in overseas affairs work will certainly emerge. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, let us firmly seize the opportunity, do solid work, forge ahead, and make great efforts to build China into a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modernized socialist country and to safeguard world peace and development! I wish the meeting complete success!
