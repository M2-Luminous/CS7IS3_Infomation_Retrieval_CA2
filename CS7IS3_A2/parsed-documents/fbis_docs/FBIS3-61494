A special classification of synoptic situations was made based on observational data for more than 30 cities. It was found that there is a significant correlation between urban air pollution and some synoptic situations. Situations characterized by positioning of an anticyclone, ridge, trough and also the western periphery of an anticyclone over the investigated region favor the formation of regions of high air pollution. This is manifested particularly clearly relative to the stable ridge of the Siberian High, with which cases of low air pollution are never observed. The formation of regions with a low pollution level is associated with cyclonic situations, particularly with the rear of a cyclone and its cold northern periphery. A high pollution level is observed in regions of a warm front, and also in the warm sector of a cyclone. A cyclonic circulation accompanied by a front is observed twice as frequently in the case of high air pollution as in the case of low air pollution, and this despite the fact that in given situations factors (such as a strong wind and precipitation) may be operative which favor air purification. On this basis methods are proposed for predicting air pollution in cities and regions for a period from one to several days. Figure 1; references 20: 14 Russian, 6 Western.
