FBIS4-67928 "jptnd011___94051" JPRS-TND-94-011 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 16 May 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA TV Shows `Secret' Missile Test Center TV Shows `Secret' Missile Test Center LD2304125094 LD2304125094 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1800 GMT on 22 April on the `Today' program carries a report on the Plesetsk missile test center in the town of (Mirnyy) in Arkhangelsk oblast. The correspondent says the site is not shown on maps because it is where military missiles have been tested since 1957. He says the country knew nothing of these tests for decades, including the successes or failures. A film shows an aerial view of the town, a convoy of unidentified missiles on the road, and a missile transporter erector launcher [TEL] driving down a forest road. The correspondent says these scenes are being shown for the first time, adding that disasters during missile launches in 1973 and 1980 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people. Video clips then show an explosion, with two soldiers dragging a third past flames. The correspondent then interviews an unidentified lieutenant colonel in front of a memorial. The lieutenant says: ``I took part in organizing the funerals. Of course, it left a big impression. When I come here, I can see that moment.'' The correspondent continues: ``The Plesetsk range was not only a testing center. Events connected with the Cuban missile crisis in the 1960's form a special page in its history. Soviet missiles had been delivered to Cuba. The United States decided to destroy them from the air.'' A video recording shows TELs manoeuvring and being driven out of hangars and along a road. The video then shows Major General Nikolay Moroz, assistant commander in chief of the Missile Forces, identified by caption, who says. ``When it became known that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles with the range to reach America, this fact had a great influence on the politicians.'' The correspondent says: ``Some of these missiles were aimed at the United States from Plesetsk. Today there is a different atmosphere at the range. This is the secret computer center. Here they follow American missile testing. Moscow and Washington have agreed to exchange information on these kinds tests, and in accordance with the agreements the Americans have installed this equipment in PLesetsk. The Russian specialists have installed their own control instruments in the United State. Today the soldiers at Plesetsk are not only studying launches of other people's missiles; they are also developing Russian military missiles for the 21st Century. The Plesetsk state missile testing range. The fourth-generation Topol [SS-25] missile is being developed here'' [as heard]. The video shows the correspondent standing in front of an SS-25 road unit.
