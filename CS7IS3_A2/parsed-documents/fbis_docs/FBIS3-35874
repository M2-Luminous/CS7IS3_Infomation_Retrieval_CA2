We are interested in Belarus continuing on this course. We will cooperate with Vyacheslav Kebich's government and try to encourage this government to take up reforms. It is a long-term policy of the United States, said White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers during a briefing with journalists. The agreement on the liquidation of nuclear weapons provides for the allotment of $12 billion to former Soviet republics which will dismantle their nuclear weapons. It is a great financial stimulus for such countries as Belarus and Ukraine, she stated. According to the Belarusian Embassy in Washington, an official of the U.S. State Department held a briefing, during which he paid much attention to the political situation in Belarus. He stated that the United States is somewhat troubled by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet resolution of 26 January. At the same time, (Macary) referred to Foreign Minister Kravchanka's statement to the diplomatic corps in Minsk on 27 January, with regard to the continuity and consistency of Belarusian foreign policy, first of all, in the sphere of nuclear disarmament. We consider this statement to be of great importance, emphasized the U.S. official.
