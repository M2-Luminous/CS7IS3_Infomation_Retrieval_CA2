Clinton Delayed a `Present' Until the Day of the Defenders of the Fatherland"] [Excerpts] According to information received from the United States yesterday, after two years of surveillance the FBI has arrested Aldrich Ames, a CIS department chief with a 30-year service record, and his Colombian-born wife, Maria del Rosario Casas. The agents, charged with spying for the USSR and later Russia, face life imprisonment. The emergence of yet another "Rosenberg case" -- they were executed in the early 1950's for selling nuclear secrets to the USSR -- might well not have transcended the limits of the talk about the hard life of "cloak-and-dagger knights" were it not for a juicy detail. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from confidential sources that Aldrich Ames was detained 10 months ago, not this Monday. At any rate, for some reason it was decided to "expose" the agents precisely at this juncture. The Ames' May Have Been Given Up by an FIS "Mole" Boris Labusov, official at the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]'s press bureau, said in response to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's request that he comment on the report: "Under the Russian Law on Foreign Intelligence, this incident will not be commented upon." A trustworthy source close to the FIS spoke to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent about the actual mood that has reigned among FIS chiefs after the exposure of the Ames'. The atmosphere of shock and despondency at the loss of a very valuable agent has been compounded by a suspicion, which has already evolved into a firm conviction, that Aldrich Ames was given up to the Americans by an as yet unidentified high-ranking official of the FIS itself. "This is a `mole' we have been dug up from within," the KOMMERSANT-DAILY source claims. "Moreover, judging from the Ames case, the level of information he has had access to limits the number of potential traitors to a very narrow range of persons. It is at the level of Primakov's deputies." [passage omitted] Qui Prodest? The "spy passions" in relations between Moscow and Washington have been a common phenomenon, but it is unclear why it was decided, after two years of surveillance, to "expose" the agents precisely at this stage and with such a brouhaha. As a matter of fact, according to reports from FIS sources, the Russian special services' "catch" of Western spies in 1993 was worthy of being registered in the Guinness Book of World Records: It exceeded even the record high of 30 or so spies achieved under Vladimir Kryuchkov. And no clamor whatsoever! According to the rules of "the invisible war," however, if someone is caught red-handed here, this gesture is set to be reciprocated oversees. The only cause of "indignation" may be the "dumping" practiced by CIA recruiters in Russia: They pay virtually no "regular salaries," whereas "lump sum" payments usually do not exceed $30,000-40,000. The war of intelligence services has tended to climax in periods of chilliness in interstate relations. Evidently, they have presently decided in the United States that the time has come. Why now? There are a number of suggestions. The U.S. Congress has just started the consideration of the next year's budget, and the draft has not contained lavish financial promises to the CIA. So far. But what appears to be the actual reason is the emerging chilliness in Russia's relations with the West. Furthermore, a meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers will open on Saturday. The main question is the revision of the system of assistance to Russia. Washington has already hinted that if Russia "takes appropriate steps," the United States "will continue productive cooperation" (meaning the $2.5 billion of U.S. assistance). As a result of the chilliness, however, the as yet vague outlines of hostility toward the Chernomyrdin government may take on a more definite shape. And the former linkage of the assistance to the demand that "reform should continue" may be replaced by a more familiar rivalry with Russia. Of course, two arrested agents are not enough to change a climate. But they do spoil the weather.
