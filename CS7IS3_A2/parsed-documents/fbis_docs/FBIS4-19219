FBIS4-19219 "drweu073__a94030" FBIS-WEU-94-073-A Daily Report 15 April 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican City Loan Granted for Russian Natural Gas Pipelines Loan Granted for Russian Natural Gas Pipelines BR1404145794 Rome ANSAMAIL Database in English 1210 GMT 14 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1404145794 Rome ANSAMAIL Database English BFN [Unattributed article: "Megaloan for Italian Rebuilding of Russian Gaslines"] [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- SNAM SpA [National Gas Pipeline Company], the group in the public Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]) energy and chemicals holding company in charge of the natural gas sector, said it was greatly satisfied today with the completion of a package of 1.6 billion dollars in financing for Russia's Gazprom which will boost the flow of Russian natural gas to Italy. The operation to finance the restructuring of Russian natural gas pipelines by Italian companies, the first of its type for the republic, was managed by Italy's Mediocredito Centrale, Banca Commerciale Italiana and the West Merchant Bank. The loan will assure, said SNAM, an increase in imports of Russian natural gas within the terms of the agreement signed with Gazprom in 1969. The ENI company also said the signing of the loan will further consolidate relations between Italy and Russia in this sector through a contract valued at 1.9 billion dollars for rebuilding and upgrading gaslines in Russia over the coming five years. Mediocredito Centrale said the construction work will be done by the Tragaz Consortium made up of the ENI companies Nuovo Pignone SpA, planning and construction of the plant for the oil and chemical industry, and Snamprogetti SpA, another engineering company working in the fields of mining, chemicals and petroleum plants. The work will lead to additional supplies of natural gas, estimated at 5.5 billion cubic meters, not now economically recoverable. The financing, said Mediocredito, "is the most important completed in support of Italian exports" and the funds made available by the markets came to more than two billion dollars, as compared to the target of 1,615,000,000 billion dollars. The loan, at the fixed rate 5.71 percent, will be underwritten by the three sponsoring banks plus 40 credit institutes in 10 nations. The Italian Export Credit Insurance Agency (SACE) has provided coverage of 95 percent of the financing with the remaining share covered by the exporters. The funds will be earmarked for the Russian Federation purchase of Italian machinery, materials and services for the reconstruction of the gasline leading from Russian territory to Italy. Since the signing of the 1969 contract, Italy has imported some 160 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas and, at present, SNAM brings in 15 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas which account for 27 percent of the volume marketed here by the ENI company. Russia also supplies Germany with 37 percent of its natural gas requirement and France with 21 percent. SNAM natural gas sales last year came to 50 billion cubic meters and estimates of the nation's requirement by the year 2000 put the figure at 75 billion cubic meters annually. The share of Italy's energy market accounted for by natural gas rose from 8 percent in 1967 to 25 percent last year.
