(Richard Blake), business service director of the U.S.-China Trade Commission, believes that the decision will increase tension between the two countries and that there is nothing good about the decision for U.S.-China trade and economic ties. He worries that the unilateral U.S. decision could cost China over $1 billion in economic losses; that American agriculture, especially the cotton export trade, would be the first to feel the impact by becoming a target of Chinese retaliation; and that U.S. high technology might not escape unharmed. Chinese textile products and garments are very cheap in the U.S. market and are much welcomed by American consumers. U.S. statistics show that last year China exported its quota of $4.6 billion of garments and textile products to the United States. Tens of thousands of American consumers will be hurt if the United States reduces the Chinese textiles quota. (Rece Marlin), chairman of the National Federation of American Retail Industry, stated the federation would urge the U.S. Government to solve the problem by negotiating with China and he hoped that this move was only a negotiating tactic. (Laura Jones), executive chairman of the American Textile and Garments Import Association, expressed anger at the U.S. Government's trade sanctions and threats, seeing this punitive move against China as a means to placate the American textile industry and their supporters in Congress. Jones worried that China might adopt corresponding retaliatory action. Mr. Wu Zheng, vice president of the newly founded U.S.-China General Chamber of Commerce, expressed regret at the decision, saying that the U.S. decision would affect both U.S.-China trade and Hong Kong. He believes that the decision exposes the rise of trade protectionism and that the American textile industry is a "sunset" industry which is incapable of competing with the East. Trade expansion between the United States and China benefits both parties and is the current trend. Both sides should replace confrontation with talks in order to settle differences over textile trade. This move by Washington has had a great impact on businessmen of Chinese nationality, who play an important role in Sino-U.S. textile trade. Peng Choutian, secretary of the American Chinese Importer and Exporter Association, said: "The quota is insufficient as it is, and is more so now with the drastic cut."
