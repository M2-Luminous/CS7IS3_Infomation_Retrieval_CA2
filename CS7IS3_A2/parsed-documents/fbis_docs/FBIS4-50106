Syria attaches great importance to Christopher's visit and President Hafiz al-Asad met with the U.S. secretary of state immediately after his arrival. According to diplomatic sources here, the U.S. official will convey an Israeli reply to ideas and proposals raised by Syria in connection with the Israeli peace proposals. The Israeli proposals, the sources said, focus on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights in three stages lasting between six to eight years, security arrangements and the start of a normalization of relations between the two countries. The sources noted that though the Syrian and Israeli positions are wide apart, exchanges by the two sides entered a new phase to discuss substantive issues such as peace, security arrangements and creation of a favorable atmosphere for resuming bilateral peace negotiations in Washington. Christopher will try to bridge the gap between the Syrian and Israeli positions and to encourage both sides to negotiate peace. Syria is said to be insisting on a complete and immediate Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before discussing issues of peace, normalization of relations and security arrangements as demanded by Israel. A Syrian official source said his country will renew its demand for an Israeli commitment to complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights, adding that Syria is not willing to enter into either protracted talks or partial settlements because in that way it will only prolong the duration of Israel's occupation. The source disclosed that Israel proposes to devise a strategy for security arrangements, preliminary steps toward peace, formation of a joint committee and creation of contact channels with Syria away from the bilateral Syrian-Israeli negotiations. In the meantime, political observers here say that Christopher's difficult assignment may prompt him to travel back to Damascus from Israel if Israel's response to Syrian demands is encouraging. Although Syria has repeatedly pledged commitment to negotiate peace with Israel, Damascus has recently made strong criticism of the U.S. Administration for its listing of Syria as a country supporting terrorism. Syria believes that publication of the report was meant as a means of twisting Syria into offering more concessions in the peace talks with Israel.
