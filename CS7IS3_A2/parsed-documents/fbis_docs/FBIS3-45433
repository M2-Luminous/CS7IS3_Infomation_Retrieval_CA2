Although many people are sceptical, the Ministry of Electronics Industry is determined to foster some electronics giants in this country. This will be an arduous task, but an urgent one as well. Currently, most of the country's 18,000 electronics factories will suffer from their weak competitiveness and many of them will be closed," said Lin Yuanfang, deputy director of the ministry's Department of Economic Operation and Structural Reform. The value of China's electronics production last year exceeded 130 billion yuan ($14.94 billion). However, the figure is only 26 percent of Matsushita's annual revenue. China has set up more than 200 electric groups, but they are still fledglings. None can be called a giant. Shanghai Audio and Video Ltd Co, organized by the city's four television makers, is now the country's largest electronics firm. But is annual revenue last year, about 3.5 billion yuan ($402 million), is just 0.7 percent of Matsushita's sales. One important reason that no large enterprises have emerged in this country is that investment in the industry has been so scanty, said Shao Huiwen, deputy director of the ministry's Department of Overall Planning. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90), the government injected only 7.1 billion yuan ($816 million) into the industry for technical renovation and capital construction, less than 1 percent of the government's total investment in the economy. The government promised 13 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) for the industry during the 1991-95 period, but that still lags far behind demand, Shao said. The amount is less than what many big-name foreign companies spend each year on developing new products. To make matters worse, such meagre investment must be divided among many projects around the country. Thus, Shao said, no project will get enough capital for renovation and expansion. To improve China's competitiveness in the world, the ministry has proposed setting up some large electronics groups in the country. "We hope that these biggies would help rationalize the distribution of resources and steer the development of the whole industry," said Lin Yuanfang. As the first step, the ministry plans next year to set up several electronics groups each with annual revenue exceeding 5 billion yuan ($575 million). By the year 2000, there will be three to five big names in China with annual revenue surpassing 30 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) each. The ministry will also select some promising enterprises and, through preferential treatment, help them expand into large groups. A detailed programme on how to generate China's Sony or Matsushita will be disclosed very soon.
