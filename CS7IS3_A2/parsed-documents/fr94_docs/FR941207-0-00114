FR941207-0-00114 FR941207-0-00019 (d) A discussion of environmental and other considerations which led to the selection of the particular site and, if relevant, the particular facility; the nature and extent of any unavoidable adverse environmental effects; and any alternative sites of facilities which have been or might reasonably by considered. The information submitted in the EA shall be factual (not argumentative or conclusory) and concise with sufficient detail to explain the environmental consequences and to enable the Commission, after an independent review of the EA, to reach a determination concerning the proposal's environmental impact, if any. The EA shall deal specifically with any feature of the site which has special environmental significant (e.g., wilderness area, wildlife preserve, natural migratory paths for birds and other wildlife, and sites of historic, architectural or archaeological value). In the case of historically, significant sites, it shall specify the effect of the facilities on any district, site, building, structure or object listed in the National Register of Historic Places, 39 Fed. Reg. 6402 (February 19, 1974). It shall also detail any substantial change in the character of the land utilized (e.g., deforestation, water diversion, wetland fill, or other extensive change of surface features). In the case of wilderness areas, wildlife preserves, or other like areas, the statement shall discuss the effect of any continuing pattern of human intrusion into the area (e.g., necessitated by the operation and maintenance of the facilities). The EA shall also be accompanied with evidence of site approval which has been obtained from local or federal land use authorities. To the extent that such information is submitted in another part of the application, it need not be duplicated in the EA, but adequate cross-reference to such information shall be supplied. An EA need not be submitted to the Commission if another agency of the Federal Government has assumed responsibility: (a) for determining whether their facilities in question will have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment and, (b) if it will affect the environment, for invoking the environmental impact statement process. Section III_Question-By-Question Guidelines The section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for AM, FM, or TV broadcast stations. Question 1(a). Licensees of noncommercial educational and commercial radio and television broadcast stations are required by Commission regulation (47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080) to afford equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction therewith, every station with five or more full-time employees must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender, race, or color and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612. In addition, all AM, FM, and TV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report (FCC From 396) with their renewal application. The EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not employ five or more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such cases you need only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form). Question 1(b). Each noncommercial educational broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete ownership report (FCC Form 323&hyph;E) with its station's renewal application. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.361(d). In such cases, the question should be answered affirmately. However, if the Form 323&hyph;E submitted with the station's last renewal application is ``up-to-date'' and has been amended, a new ownership report need not be filed with the current renewal application. The applicant should then answer the question negatively and supply the filing date of that report and the call letters of the station for which it was submitted. An ``up-to-date'' Form 323-E ownership report is one that is current for each question on that report. A commercial broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete ownership report (FCC Form 323) once each year on the anniversary of the date that its license renewal application is required to be filed. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3615(a). Licensees of multiple commercial broadcast stations with different renewal anniversary filing dates may elect a single date to submit information, but the ownership reports may not be submitted more than one year apart. If no charges have occurred, the licensee may submit a written certification to that fact, instead of filing a new Form 323 each year. In addition, where the licensee is a partnership composed entirely of natural persons, the annual reporting requirements does not apply. Similarly, sole proprietorships are exempt from the requirement to file annually. All commercial broadcast station licensee that are not exempt from the annual reporting program are required to file Form 323 SEPARATELY from their renewal applications. The annual ownership report (Form 323 or written certification), accompanied by its requisite fee payment for each station covered by that report, should be sent to the U.S. Treasury lockbox bank at the appropriate address and in the manner specified in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing Guide.'' Additional information regarding the submission of this report us set fort in the Commission's Public Notice of June 6, 1990, entitled ``Broadcast Annual Ownership Report.'' Question 2. A licensee must maintain certain documents pertaining to its station in a file which is usually kept at the station's main studio or other accessible place in the community of licensee. The file must be available for inspection by anyone during regular business hours. The documents to be maintained generally include applications for a construction permit and for licensee renewal, assignment or transfer of control; ownership and employment reports; and quarterly lists of the community issues most significantly addressed by the station's programming during the preceding three months. In addition, commercial television licensees only are required to maintain a make available to the public certain records regarding children's programming and the amount of commercial matter aired during the station's broadcast of children's programming. A complete listing of the required documents and their mandatory retention periods is set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 734.3526 and 73.3527. Question 3. This question should be completed only by a commercial radio or television renewal applicant. Licensees for these stations should not that anytime it finds it necessary to cease broadcasting it must notify the Commission's Washington, D.C. office, by letter, not later than the 120th day of discontinued operation. Further, if a licensee finds it necessary to cease broadcasting in excess of 30 days, it must, no later than the 30th day of the station being silent, submit a letter request (no filing fee is required) to the Commission's Washington, D.C. office for temporary authority to remain silent. The request must include the date the station ceased broadcasting; a detailed explanation of the reason why it was necessary to take the station off the air; efforts being made to restore service; and the date by which resumption of operation is anticipated. The request must also include a certification relating to Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (See, as an example, Section V, Certification (1), of the Form). Extensions of temporary authority to remain silent and must be timely requested if station operations do not resume within the time given. Licensees must notify the Commission's Washington, D.C. office, by letter, once operations have resumed, giving the date that operations resumed. See 47 C.F.R. Sections 73.1740 and 73.1750. Question 4. This question should be completed by commercial TV applicants only. Programming directed to the educational and information needs of children is an identifiable unit of program material that is not a comical or promotional announcement, that is originally produced and broadcast for an audience of children 16 years of age and under, and that furthers, the positive development of the child in any respect, including, but not limited to, the child's cognitive/intellectual or emotional/social needs. Questions 4(b) and (c). Commercial television licensees must limit the amount of commercial matter in ``children's programming'', which is defined for this purpose as programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under. The children's programming commercial limitations are not more than 12 minutes of commercial mater per hour on weekdays and no more than 10.5 minutes of commercials on weekends. The commercial limits also apply pro rata to children's programs which are 5 minutes or more and which are not part of a longer block of children's programming. There are no restrictions on how commercial within the limits are configured within an hour's block of children's programming. i.e., it is not necessary to prorate the commercial limits for separate children's programs within the hour. Section IV_Question-by-Question Guidelines This section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for FM or TV translator or LPTV broadcast station. Question 1. An FM or TV translator or LPTV station is expected to provide continuous service except where cases beyond its control warrant interruption. Where causes beyond the control of the licensee make it impossible to continue operation, the station may discontinue operation for a period of 30 days without further authority from the FCC. However, notification if the discontinuance must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C. no later than 10 days after the discontinued operation. (See Section III, Question 3 of these Instructions for procedures for requesting temporary authority to remain silent if the licensee finds it necessary to cease training for more than 30 days.) Failure to operate for a period of 30 days of more, except for causes beyond the control of the licensee, shall be deemed evidence of discontinuation of operation and the license of the translator or LPTV station may be canceled at the discretion of the FCC. See 47 C.F.R. Sections 74.763 and 74.1263. Questions 2 and 3. Section 325(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits the rebroadcast of the programs of a broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. Where the renewal applicant is not the licensee of the originating station, written authority must be obtained prior to any rebroadcasting. Also, where the licensee has changed the station being rebroadcast, written notification must be made to the Commission in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Section 74.784 or 74.1251.
