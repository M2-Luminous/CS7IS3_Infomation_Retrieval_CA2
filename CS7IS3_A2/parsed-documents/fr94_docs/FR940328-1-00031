FR940328-1-00031 FR940328-1-00013 48 CFR Part 15 [FAR Case 92&hyph;33] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Price Competition Exemption AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing an amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to address unnecessarily requiring the submission of cost or pricing data and to clarify when adequate price competition exists. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, ATTN: Beverly Fayson, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;33 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;33. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The revisions to FAR 15.804&hyph;1 and 15.804&hyph;2 originated as part of the Defense Management Review. President Bush's memorandum on ``Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation'' tasked selected agencies and departments to review current regulations, to identify those that impose a substantial cost on the economy, and to make appropriate revisions. In response to this direction, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council solicited and received the views of various industry associations and the public. The revision to FAR 15.804&hyph;3 originated from an industry recommendation. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because it clarifies current policy. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . (FAR case 92&hyph;33), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq .

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 15 be amended as set forth below: PART 15_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 15 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. Section 15.804&hyph;1 is amended by redesignating paragraph (a) as (a)(1) and adding paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: §15.804&hyph;1 General. (a) *␣*␣* (2) Unnecessarily requiring the submission of cost or pricing data is not in the best interest of the Government because it leads to increased proposal preparation costs, extends acquisition lead-time, and wastes both contractor and Government resources. * * * * * 3. Section 15.804&hyph;2 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: §15.804&hyph;2 Requiring certified cost or pricing data. * * * * * (d) When there is a reasonable expectation that adequate price competition will result on a particular procurement, the contracting officer should rarely have a need to require the submission or certification of cost or pricing data, regardless of the contract type. 4. Section 15.804&hyph;3 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(2)(iii) to read as follows: §15.804&hyph;3 Exemptions from or waiver of submission of certified cost or pricing data. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (ii) Two or more responsible offerors that can satisfy the Government's requirements compete independently and submit priced offers responsive to the solicitation's expressed requirements; and (iii) Award will be made to a responsible offeror whose proposal is either_ (A) The lowest price; or (B) Offers the greatest value (see 15.605(c)) to the Government and price is a stated substantial factor in source selection. (2) *␣*␣* (ii) An offeror has such a decided advantage that it is practically immune from competition; or (iii) There is a finding supported by a statement of the facts and approved at a level above the contracting officer, that the price of the otherwise successful offeror is unreasonable. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6900 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M
