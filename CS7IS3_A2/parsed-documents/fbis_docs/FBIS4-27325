This time President Clinton has, in effect, unconditionally extended MFN for China by announcing that his administration would in future remove the link between the renewal of MFN and China's human rights record. Has the Clinton administration shifted from its conventional policy of emphasizing the need for China to improve its human rights record to a policy of emphasizing the attractive Chinese market, which continues to grow at a high rate? The policy shift is the result of a painful choice made by the Clinton administration, which had previously conducted a form of human rights diplomacy toward China. The original purpose of MFN for China was to provide it with trade and tariff privileges that are not disadvantageous compared to those granted to third nations. The United States has renewed MFN for China every year since it normalized relations. In the wake of the Tiananmen incident in 1989, U.S. Congress voted to renew MFN on condition China improved its human rights record, but President Bush vetoed the congressional decision. The Clinton administration, which came to office after criticizing the Bush administration's China policy, has set a seven-point condition for the annual renewal of MFN. It includes, among other things, 1) the promotion of exit permits for Chinese and Beijing's observance of an agreement not to export prison-labor products. The Clinton administration asserted that MFN would not be extended next time unless the seven conditions are met. In response, China has made a small concession to the U.S. demand by granting exit permits to a few democracy activists and allowing foreign human rights activists to visit Chinese prisons. China took democracy activists into custody in March when U.S. Secretary of State Christopher visited China. Attracted by China's bullish economy, however, European and Japanese corporations have rushed to the Chinese market and this has prompted China to keep taking a tough stand on human rights. In the face of this, the U.S. business community has felt an increasing sense of crisis, saying: "If the situation were to continue, the United States would fall behind every other nation." Some Americans maintain that if MFN is not extended, it will be impossible to foster the Chinese middle classes who it is hoped will take charge of promoting democracy in China. The Clinton administration had been sandwiched between human rights and trade. More important, China's cooperation is needed in dealing with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. The Clinton administration, therefore, has chosen to renew MFN in exchange for the "long-term improvement of human rights in China." It admits, though, that China's improvement in human rights is still inadequate. For a long time doubts have been raised about the way the United States has linked the annual renewal of MFN to an improvement in China's human rights and rashly pressed China to choose between them. If MFN is not renewed, though, it would hurt both the United States and China. It goes without saying that human rights are universal values and the direction the United States has taken deserves to be applauded. Human rights is closely related to culture and religion in certain nations and in certain regions. There is no other way but to be patient about improving human rights in Asia, and to try various policies. On many occasions recently the United States has conducted its foreign policy toward Asian nations without full regard to their situations and imposed its self-assertion on them. In so doing, it has incurred a backlash. To cite examples, the United States has been in dispute with Singapore over the caning of an American youth, and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have reacted to the U.S. policy of linking labor and trade issues. This criticism is voiced within the Clinton administration against its own Asia policy. The United States has switched its way of conducting human rights diplomacy to a realistic way. If it were now to begin making a sweeping review of its Asia policy, this would start to improve relations between the United States and Asian nations. On the other hand, China must not think that because the Clinton administration has decided to renew MFN, the human rights issue in China is now settled. Under the surface of economic hypergrowth, human rights in China are placed under severe restrictions. It is understandable that if living standards improve in China, the Chinese people will make political requests compatible with their improved living standards. To date, though, little headway has been made in political democratization. How will China improve its human rights, by the application of "external pressure" or by its own initiative? This question has everything to do with the future of China.
