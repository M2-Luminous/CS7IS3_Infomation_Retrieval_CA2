Korea Soda Industry Association, a local manufacturers' group, filed a complaint with the trade watchdog April 6, alleging the imported sodium hydroxide, a basic chemical used to make soap, rayon and paper, was undercutting locally-produced goods, and damaging the domestic industry. As to why the commission decided to launch the industrial probe, an official said that the complaint represented all local producers; the documents it submitted contained facts on dumping and industrial injuries; the commission could acknowledge some of the dumping margins and industrial injuries; and Korea Customs Administration and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy are also recognizing the need for investigations.
