He announced this at a news conference today in the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly. Sergey Yushenkov said he is surprised at the position of the Russian Federation's executive authority, "which is not trying to demonstrate the advantage of Russia joining the Partnership." The Russian Federation president, defense minister, and foreign minister should immediately declare their intention to join the program, in spite of the latest events in former Yugoslavia, Sergey Yushenkov asserted. At the same time, he stressed, those who "made the decision to carry out the bombing near Gorazde should admit their error." The Duma committee chairman noted that a new situation has come about in relations between the West and Russia following the bombing of Serb positions. The Russian foreign minister's refusal to sign the document was the result of this. "The air strikes," Sergey Yushenkov stressed, "mark the end of the `romantic' phase of our relationship. Further divergence of our views, even including a break-up, is now possible. Or else our relations can develop on a completely pragmatic basis, in which the real interests of the sides will be heeded." Speaking in favor of joining Partnership for Peace, the Duma committee chairman stressed that in his view this document does not contain a single initiative which has not already been proposed, in one form or another, by the leadership of the USSR and the Russian Federation. Referring to the main "trump card" held by Russian opponents of the Partnership -- the claim that the document does not reflect "the Russian Federation's special status as a great nuclear power" -- Sergey Yushenkov noted that only Russia itself, by taking part in the program, can determine this status. "If Russia really does want to maintain this status, it has more interest in signing this document than other countries," he stressed. Sergey Yushenkov believes that membership of the Partnership does not in any way mean that the Russian Federation will join NATO in due course. In his view, the program is "just one of the steps toward the building of a new system of universal security." The program itself, he noted, is "merely a protocol of intent -- the attitude which Russia does eventually take during possible involvement in Partnership-sponsored measures is another matter."
