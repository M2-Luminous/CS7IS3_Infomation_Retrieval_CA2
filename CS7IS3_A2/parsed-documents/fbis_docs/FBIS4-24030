The pan-African body supported the principle of a French proposal to send troops to Rwanda to staunch a 10-week bloodbath, but said that African UN peacekeepers would be better because Rwandan rebels opposed the French plan. "While the OAU fully understands and appreciates the concern of the international community, including France, over the carnage that continues to be perpetrated in Rwanda, it is at the same time concerned that given the expressed opposition by one of the parties to the conflict, there are fears of possible complications and indeed dangers of such an action," the organisation said in a statement. It said a number of African countries were willing to send 4,000 troops to reinforce the 495 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and blamed rich nations for failing "to provide the required logistical and financial support to enable the troops to be quickly deployed in Rwanda." "Any and all actions by an individual country or group of countries should consequently be undertaken within the scope of that international consensus, and of the framework of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR II)," the statement said. "Given Africa's expressed commitment to support the efforts of the world body (UN), it is the view of the OAU that the best way was to ensure the deployment of these (4,000 African) troops under UNAMIR II," the statement said.
