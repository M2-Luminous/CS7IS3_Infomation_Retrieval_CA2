Rich and Poor Countries Stand By Their Interests"] [Excerpts] The contours of the new world economic order have been outlined in the Moroccan city of Marrakech where a meeting has been held of trade, foreign, and agriculture ministers from 112 of the 125 countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and also countries with associate member status. Russia, which has lodged an application to join the agreement in June this year, participated in this meeting as an observer and carefully following the course of the sessions. In the opinion of foreign economic relations specialists, the Russian Federation's entry into GATT has enormous significance from the viewpoint of integrating the country into the world economy. Let us remind readers that approximately 90 percent of the total volume of world trade is handled by GATT member countries, whose collectively formulated decisions ensure greater predictability of trading volumes. It is no secret that Russia is encountering harsh protectionist measures from international markets designed to prevent its commodities being imported. This applies in particular to Europe, which receives the majority of our country's trade turnover. In order to uphold the interests of our domestic enterprises on the world market and negotiate with our trading partners on an equal basis (in accordance with procedures formulated by GATT over the decades), we need to participate in GATT, an organization which we intend to tie ourselves to -- following established practice -- not for weeks or months but for a much lengthier period of time. [passage omitted] For Russia, full GATT membership will mean that it will become impossible for us to arbitrarily set import tariffs designed, generally speaking, to protect our domestic producers' interests.
