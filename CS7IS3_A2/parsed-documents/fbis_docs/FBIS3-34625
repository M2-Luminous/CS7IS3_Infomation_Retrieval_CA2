They simply ask, "Is this man for real?" Washington- watchers in India are beginning to wonder whether the question isn't apt for the President of the United States himself. The worrisome aspect of the scandal-prone Mr. Clinton, whose policies abroad have been stumbling from one banana peel to another, is that he is no longer merely simulating India-bashing. It would be dangerously naive to ascribe his weird words and deeds on South Asian subjects to his fabled ignorance and immaturity in foreign affairs. The succession of provocative remarks on Kashmir by Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin Raphel and the President himself have never been retracted. The clarifications that have followed India's protests have only elaborated them further, confirming that the original assertions were fully intended. Take the latest calumny on Punjab for instance. Who accused Mr. Clinton of having supported the idea of Khalistan? He didn't say it, nor was he charged with saying it. Yet, Washington has vociferously denied that the U.S. President had provided tacit support to the cause of an independent Khalistan. A Freudian slip there? The U.S. clarification, however, makes it perfectly clear that the Clinton Administration will determinedly pursue the cause of "minority rights" in India. The "helpful" clarification patronisingly emphasises that minorities in India ought to have the same rights as the others. Mr. Clinton would probably be shell-shocked to learn that unlike the U.S., minorities in India not only have but also exercise with gusto the same rights as the majority. It was, therefore, in the fitness of things that India's most respected Sikh today, the Director-General of Punjab Police, Mr. K.P.S. Gill, who has made the greatest contribution to the return of normalcy in that State, was the first to ridicule the U.S. President's observation. Significantly, Mr. Gill's co-religionist, Youth Congress president Maninderjit Singh Bitta, is organising an all-Sikh demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to protest against Mr. Clinton's gratuitous observations. Such expressions of outrage by the Sikhs, who are the sword-arm of Indian civilisation, is the most appropriate response to Washington's mischief-making. According to sources in the Ministry of External Affairs, the Government, on the other hand, is not keen to react too vigorously to Mr. Clinton's latest missive. "We have to learn to live with the immaturity of the present U.S. Administration", said a senior MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] official in a resigned tone. Pointing out that Indo-U.S. relations have witnessed many ups and downs over the last four decades, the official underlined that it was during the Reagan and Bush tenure that New Delhi had reached a most satisfactory political understanding with Washington. "The irony is that today, India's relations with the U.S. in every other sphere, especially in the economic arena, are excellent. It is tragic that we seem to be on different wavelengths on political issues," he added. Indian officials believe that an ill- informed U.S. President is being guided in his South Asia policy almost solely by a very junior official, his Oxford-mate Ms. Robin Raphel, whose personal predilections have lent a definite tilt towards Pakistan. The stuffing of the State Department's South Asia Desk with several officers who have served in Pakistan is only enhancing the U.S. bias, New Delhi feels. South Block mandarins are also at pains to point out that contrary to the obtuse angularities of the Raphelites, the approach of senior U.S. officials like Mr. Peter Tarnoff has been very different. Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit established an excellent rapport with Mr. Tarnoff during his visits to Washington. But, sadly for India, it is Ms. Raphel who appears to have Mr. Clinton's ear. What amazes officials here is that the holder of the world's most powerful office has taken it upon himself to reply to letters from all and sundry. At the height of the Khalistan movement, several wealthy expatriate sponsors of terrorism used to write similar letters to Presidents Reagan and Bush. But they sent back only terse official acknowledgements, without bothering to pen elaborate, provocative replies like Mr. Clinton. One explanation being offered for the U.S. President's letter to Congressman Gary A. Condit on "Sikh rights" is that Mr. Clinton is in desperate need for Congressional support at the moment. The Whitewatergate scandal is showing no signs of abating and fresh revelations of Mr. Clinton's alleged sexual peccadillos during his tenure as Governor of Arkansas, have left him highly vulnerable. Demands for a Congressional inquiry into his alleged land deals and private life are snowballing. Recently, the inquiry demand has become bi-partisan and the President's own party, the Democrats, have joined the chorus. Some U.S. Congressmen are well-known lobbyists for various secessionist outfits and often champion all kinds of dubious causes for a consideration. Being on the payroll of organisations like the "Council of Khalistan" etc., these Congressmen are expected to canvass their patrons' interests. In his present beleaguered state, President Clinton can hardly afford to antagonise any Congressman, even if his "cause" is suspect. Thus, if a few words of encouragement give a Congressman some pecuniary benefits, Mr. Clinton probably feels it is worth it. The larger international ramifications evidently do not bother him. At any rate, since India's-bashing is now state policy, such replies do not go against the diplomatic philosophy of the U.S. Administration either. Keeping these exigencies in mind, India appears to have decided against rising to Mr. Clinton's bait, at least for the present. New Delhi has conveyed its strong feelings on the subject to Washington through its Ambassador, Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray, and does not intend to pursue the matter any more. But there is all-round dismay that President Clinton's and Ms. Raphel's ill-considered statements are periodically boosting the morale of terrorists in Kashmir and the handful still left in Punjab. Ironically, the very same Administration which frequently goes into a tizzy over the "terrorism" of Libya's Colonel Gaddafi and Somalia's General Aideed, is now directly responsible for fomenting terrorist depredations in democratic India. But then, neither consistency, nor even adherence to self- proclaimed lofty principles of freedom, democracy and human rights, have ever been hallmarks of U.S. foreign policy.
