At the last meeting of the Chamber for Information Disputes under the president of the RF, the second issue to come up had to do with delivery of newspapers and journals. A representative of the federal administration of postal communications stated that the postoffice as before intends to cover all its losses through an increase in prices for delivery of print media publications. Staff members of the anti-monopoly committee of the RF considered this a violation of the rights of consumers. The subscription price substantially exceeds the initial amount established by the editorial boards. As the chief specialist for the state committee for anti-monopoly policy and support for new economic structures Aleksandr Kartashev explained to a correspondent of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, the arbitrariness of postal prices can be stopped in two ways: by competition or by the state. For now, the postal department does not intend to share its authority with respect to subscriptions with any one. Consequently, almost every three months new tariffs are established, the basis of which it is impossible to check. This is because oblast postoffices have been removed from the control of financial and taxation organs and are answerable to no one except their own superiors. The situation can currently be changed only by the emergence of competition in the market of the distributors of print media publications. But the chief monopolist will be transformed into an ordinary participant in this market only after "delivery" enters the list of licensed services. A check of the tariffs of the ministry of communications is being conducted by assignment of the government. The anti-monopoly committee intends to find out "whether the postal workers are not running ahead of inflation." In the first instance, specialists are analyzing prices for telephone calls, delivery of periodical publications, and other communications services. The results of the findings of this economic expertise will be announced at one of the next meetings of the government's commission for operational questions. According to preliminary data, even in the absence of obvious violations in the actions of the ministry, the experts of the anti-monopoly committee intend to raise the question of a more precise specification of the organizational-legal structure of the postal department. And they also intend to press the question of whether post offices should be transformed into subordinate enterprises, which will compete on an equal footing with private firms in the delivery of print media publications. Only after this will delivery prices cease to rise.
