Herrera Cabral said that the Dominican Republic is complying with the UN sanctions and only sends "humanitarian aid" to Haiti. He added that the accusation has been made at a time when Haitian Catholic bishops are trying to obtain UN permission to transport fuel from Dominican territory to face the critical situation in Haiti. The Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace published a report in Port-au-Prince today saying Dominican and Haitian soldiers are involved in fuel trafficking to Haiti, which is facing a blockade since the ousting of Constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Herrera Cabral said the report is false and contradicts a request from Haitian bishops and civilian assistance organizations demanding permission for the entrance of more products to reduce the misery in Haiti, which has increased with the embargo. Herrera Cabral deplored that the "commission" should dedicate its efforts to supervising the border between the two countries to verify if the Dominican Government is complying or not with the embargo. He added that the commission should dedicate its efforts to plans that will make it possible to improve the calamitous situation afflicting the poor people of Haiti, who are living in misery. "They are wasting their time, because we (the Dominican Government) are complying with the sanctions and they should dedicate their time to fight poverty," Herrera Cabral told EFE. Herrera Cabral, however, did not rule out the possibility that "some gallons of fuel" could cross the border, but not with the government's permission. Herrera Cabral reminded the Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace that last week the Dominican Armed Forces Ministry punished an officer involved in fuel trafficking to Haiti and that vigilance at the border is constant and strict. He reiterated that he does not understand the reason for the "false reports at a time when Catholic bishops are requesting aid." Today, the Dominican Foreign Ministry announced that the UN Security Council and the UN Sanctions Committee authorized the country to send food, propane gas, agricultural products, and other staples to the Haitian people, within the concept of "humanitarian aid" permitted by that international organization. In announcing the UN authorization, Herrera Cabral explained that the Dominican Republic will continue implementing the embargo that seeks the return of democracy to Haiti. In its protest, the Haitian commission also accused the United Nations of permitting the violations and not supervising the Dominican Republic's compliance with the sanctions. Herrera Cabral said that the United Nations are aware that the Dominican Republic is complying with the embargo, and rejected a recommendation that the international organization should control the Dominican-Haitian border.
