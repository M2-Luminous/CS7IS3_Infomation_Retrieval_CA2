The sources said that the South Korean Embassy in Moscow is located in the prestigious quarters of the city in an excellent building, while the Russian diplomats have been provided with a building in a poor condition on the outskirts of the city. Additionally, the South Korean authorities have confiscated, without ample enough grounds, according to the Russian side, the territory previously occupied by the Russian Embassy. "This question has a very disappointing side," a high-ranking Russian diplomat said. After South Korea established diplomatic relations with China, the Russian officials recalled, China received the building of the former Taiwanese Embassy in the centre of Seoul without any problem. Vietnam was provided with the building previously occupied by South Vietnam and only Russia has been denied the right to the building which, officials said, had been its rightful property since the end of the 19th century.
