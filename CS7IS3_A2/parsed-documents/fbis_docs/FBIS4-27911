The reason is that the Bank of Japan [BOJ] has taken a clear-cut position of monetary easing with the objective of aiding in the recycling of capital to the United States in conjunction with monetary tightening in that country. Money is increasingly being traded for financial assets such as stocks and bonds, instead of being used for capital investments. A change has taken place in the short-term financial markets since the May holiday season. The noncollateralized next-day call rate fell to a historic low of just above 2 percent and the differential between it and the official discount rate (currently at 1.75 percent) which in the past had been maintained at a minimum of 0.5 percent dropped to the 0.2-percent range, providing for only a minimal differential. Bond and stock prices have reacted with sensitivity and the Nikkei average at one time set new highs for the year. According to a fund manager at a major investment trust company, a change in perspectives is emerging which says, "City banks are in a position where they have no choice but to allocate capital generated from call markets to investments in the stock market." It was none other than the BOJ that caused a "drop in short-term interest rates as seen on the eve before the cut in the official discount rate," according to an official at a city bank-affiliated major leasing firm. "What will be the next step taken by the people on the second floor," is a question that reflects the sole concern of BOJ watchers at city banks. The second floor is where the BOJ Operations Bureau is located. The reason was that the position of counselor for the Operations Bureau, whose incumbent is responsible for directing monetary adjustments, was vacated by Mr. Minoru Masubuchi and filled by Mr. Yoshiharu Obata formerly deputy director of the Planning Bureau during the regular personnel shuffle in May. It appears that the BOJ will maintain the low interest rate policy of the "Masuda period." Even on the 24th and 25th, the BOJ fed funds to the short-term markets at rates which exceeded the expectations of market sources and maintained noncollateralized next-day call interest rates at historically low levels. BOJ President Yasushi Mieno states, "The economy shows signs of bottoming and the climate in support of a recovery is stronger than last year." If signs of an economic recovery are visible, common sense in the past would dictate somewhat of a tightening of the monetary supply, but one wonders why the BOJ has resumed a policy of guiding interest rates to a lower level. A viewpoint quietly mentioned in the markets is based on the theory considering the value of the yen. Noboru Nagai, International Capital-Foreign Exchange Department chief of the Tokyo branch of the Netherlands Bank, presumes the BOJ's change in attitude as reflecting a situation in which, "The BOJ was asked to participate in policy coordination with the U.S. monetary authorities who wished to avoid a further drop in the declining dollar." Officially, the BOJ merely repeats itself when it says, "We do not manage interest policy for the purpose of controlling the value of the yen." The reason given by BOJ officials is, "There will be no limit if we were to drop interest rates in coordination with the value of the yen," in view of the fact that the official discount rate is at 1.75 percent, the lowest level among the advanced nations. However, notwithstanding, the BOJ has been forced to undertake strong market action to provide for low market interest rates. However, there is the viewpoint that, "A strong yen is merely an excuse for action to provide for the recent lowering of interest rates. A second ulterior motive is concealed in President Mieno's statement which says, "The balance sheets of financial institutions require further adjustments." Lower short-term interest rates directly lead to a reduction in banks' capital procurement costs. "Lower interest rates leading to higher stock prices" will enable banks to raise funds for amortizing bad loans based on profits from stock holdings. Soichi Hirabayashi, chief of the Funding Department of Fuji Bank, points out, "A bottoming of the economy does not necessarily signal a unilateral rise in market interest rates." This is a case where the BOJ is creating an abundant money supply. The BOJ is following the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) in terms of the latter's monetary policy after 1990. There is a precedent in which the FRB assumed an ultra-monetary-easing policy--in which it assumed a real short-term interest rate of zero after deducting the anticipated inflation rate from the nominal interest rate--for a period of 18 months in which it encouraged stock and bond prices to rise. The creation of financial values by policy officials and the bold disposition of bad loans despite the recording of losses enabled U.S. banks to stage a widespread recovery from their problems. However, complications from such an approach were also sizeable. Although it is said that the current turbulence in U.S. financial and stock markets are the result of monetary tightening since February, a major factor is a reaction to the easy money valuations. It can be said that the BOJ is in effect being forced to follow the footsteps of the FRB. If attention is focused only on adjustments necessary to cope with the collapse of the bubble, there is the definite risk that we will again invite a market reaction.
