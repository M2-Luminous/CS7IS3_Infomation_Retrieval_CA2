Leaders at all levels should correctly perceive the meaning of "price reform," Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said at the closing session of a national meeting on price monitoring. He emphasized that price reforms help establish a socialist market economy. He observed that some people think government will let producers and retailers set prices freely after price reforms are in place. "This is totally a misunderstanding of price reform," Zou said. China will establish a price system mainly based on market demand and supply, and a price readjustment mechanism supervised by the government. He conceded that price reforms have a long way to go, although control on prices of most commodities have been lifted. The vice-premier revealed that the government would continue to adjust the prices of some essential materials and utilities in line with market reforms. He did not elaborate. Zou blamed profiteering, marketing of shoddy and inferior goods and fraud for the current price rises adding that this problem must be solved through nationwide price inspection. Monitoring also is expected to control market price fluctuations and prevent unauthorized price hikes. "China's overall economy and local development will both benefit from this," Zou told the meeting. He called on local authorities to keep pace with the central government, to take uniform action to curb price hikes. "Governments at all levels must put price inspection on top of their working agendas," he said. He called for faster drafting of China's price laws and regulations, prohibiting profiteering and price cheating. The State Council at the end of March sent six price inspection teams to 14 provinces to promote efforts in curbing inflation. Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10 to May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations, involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price charges.
