For many years, the people of Cienfuegos have grown accustomed to this great project on the coast a few kilometers from the city. The Juragua nuclear power plant is the most ambitious symbol of industrial development in this province. The causes of the momentary interruption of this construction are well known, but Cuba has not given up. All efforts are now aimed at the preservation of the existing construction. Continuous contacts are under way with the Russians concerning technical aspects of the temporary paralysis of construciton on the nuclear power plant as well as the supplies that are essential for its preservation. At present, 2,000 workers are engaged in its maintenance. Several potential foreign investors are evaluating the possibility of investing in the Juragua project. A state committee was recently created to conduct these negotiations. The committee is also responsible for coordinating the aid that the national economy, despite its limitations, can give to this project. A number of organizations in Cuba have sufficient resources to meet the needs of the project at this stage and to guarantee the fulfillment of the maintenance program agreed upon in September [year indistinct] when the decision was made to halt construction on the plant. [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] I believe it can be fulfilled this year.

For all Cubans, the Juragua nuclear plant is the project of the century. Its construction continues, notwithstanding current difficulties.
