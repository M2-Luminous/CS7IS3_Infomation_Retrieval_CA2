"Taking into consideration the experience of other countries and the current political situation it is necessary to recognise the necessity of a federal structure of Georgia", the Tbilisi-based "TEMI" (Assembly) newspaper said. "Actually we are living today in a federative state without a federative constitution", it added. The daily offered Germany as an example for the independent federative Georgian state. It added that autonomous republics had been artificially created in the former Soviet Union and resulted in bloodshed after the Soviet collapse. Georgia has three autonomies--Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adzharia. Only the latter succeeded to avoid a conflict. Many Georgian politicians expressed similar ideas in interviews with TASS. However, every time they asked not to be named as the idea of federalism is assessed by the opposition as betrayal of national interests.
