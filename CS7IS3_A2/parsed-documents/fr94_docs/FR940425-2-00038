FR940425-2-00038 FR940425-2-00031 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [Case No. F&hyph;068] Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Bard Manufacturing Company AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Bard Manufacturing Company (Bard) from the existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's DCC and DCL series central furnaces. Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Bard. Bard's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Bard seeks to test using a blower delay time of 60 seconds for its DCC and DCL series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5 minute delay between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting the Petition for Waiver. DATES: DOE will accept comments, data, and information not later than May 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments and statements shall be sent to: Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Case No. F&hyph;068, Mail Stop EE&hyph;43m Room 5E&hyph;066, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7140. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cyrus H. Nassrei, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mail Station EE&hyph;431, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7140 Eugene Margolis, Esq., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel, Mail Station GC&hyph;72, Forrestal Building, 1000 Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9507 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart B. The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedures amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver.
