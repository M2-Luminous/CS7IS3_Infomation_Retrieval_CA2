They should be confident that they will receive the same treatment that their brothers are receiving in terms of rights and duties. It is better for them to be at the side of the people, unity, and constitutional legitimacy so that they will not be filled with regret after it is useless to be so. [Signed] Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the defense minister
