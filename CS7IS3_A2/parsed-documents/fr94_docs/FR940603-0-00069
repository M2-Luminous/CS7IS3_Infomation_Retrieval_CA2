FR940603-0-00069 FR940603-0-00025 Comment 21: One Federal agency outlined those protective measures that have been developed over the years through ESA section 7 consultations with NMFS and commended the efforts of NMFS, Southeast Regional Office, in initiating discussions with EPA, Region IV, to propose moving the Kings Bay ocean dredged material disposal site closer to the navigation channel. A closer disposal site would reduce the distance traveled by hopper dredges, thereby reducing the potential for collisions with right whales. The commenter did not anticipate additional restrictions on these activities because of the critical habitat designation. Response: NMFS will continue to work with all Federal agencies through the section 7 consultation process on all protected species issues to ensure the continued recovery and protection of endangered and threatened species. Classification It has been determined that this rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6 states that critical habitat designations under the ESA generally are categorically excluded from the requirements to prepare on EA or Environmental Impact Statement. However, in order to more clearly evaluate the minimal environmental and economic impacts of critical habitat designation versus the alternative of a no-critical habitat designation, NMFS has prepared an EA. Copies of the EA are available on request (see ADDRESSES ). List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 226 Endangered and threatened species. Dated: May 27, 1994.
