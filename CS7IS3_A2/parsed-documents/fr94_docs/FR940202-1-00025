FR940202-1-00025 FR940202-1-00011 Implementation of this regulation would allow States flexibility in managing their individual Medicaid programs and would be consistent with Congressional concern for a Medicaid program to operate in a cost-effective manner, while providing necessary medical care for the needy. Therefore, we propose to revise our rules to allow a State to request a waiver from any of the requirements specified in section 433.138(c), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4), which concern obtaining health insurance information, obtaining other information, exchange of data, and diagnosis and trauma code edits, and follow-up activities for certain exchanges. We also propose to revise section 433.139, which concerns payment of claims, to allow a State to request a waiver of the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) and (2) of this section. These paragraphs contain procedures concerning payment when probable liability is known at time of payment (cost avoidance), and a requirement to bill third parties within 60 days of the last day of the month the agency learns of the existence of TPL. However, new section 433.139(e)(4) requires that if a State requests a waiver of the requirement specifically concerning the 60-day limit, the State must submit documentation of written agreement between the State and the third party, including Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers, that extension of the billing requirement is agreeable to all parties. We would add a new section 433.138(l) and revise section 433.139(e) to permit the waivers. We would require the State to submit a written request for a waiver of the specified nonstatutory requirement(s) to the HCFA RO and submit adequate documentation to establish that the regulatory activity is not cost-effective. Where the agency wishes to substitute another action for the TPL activity in section 433.138 or section 433.139, it must document that the cost of the substitute activity does not exceed the cost of the activity to be waived. If HCFA approves the State's waiver request, these net rules would relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the requirements. These procedures would parallel those found in existing section 433.139(e) for States obtaining a waiver from using the cost-avoidance method. We would revise section 433.138(e), which already allows a waiver for specific trauma codes, to allow waivers for either the entire trauma code edit activity, or for waiver of editing specific codes, based on cost-effectiveness and duplication of effort. We would specify in section 433.138(j) an exception to the reporting requirement for data exchanges and trauma code edits (section 433.138) when waivers are granted. We would revise section 433.138(a) to exclude from the basic requirements those waived under paragraph (l). We also would delete the waiver provision in section 433.139(b)(2)(i), since it would be covered by the proposed revised section 433.139(e). In addition, we propose to make conforming changes to section 433.138(c), (d), (f), and (g) to reference the proposed waiver provisions. III. Regulatory Impact Analysis Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare and publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for proposed regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulations would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Under the RFA, a small entity is a small business, a nonprofit enterprise, or a government jurisdiction (such as a county or township) with a population of less than 50,000. These proposed regulations would affect only States and individuals, which are not considered small entities.
