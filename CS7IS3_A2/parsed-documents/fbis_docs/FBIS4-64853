This is necessary in order to keep the negative effects of national measures on other member states as small as possible, Kurt Schelter, state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, stated at a two-day informal meeting of the interior ministers of the European Union [EU] in Salonika on Friday [6 May]. In addition, it is, above all, necessary to develop a common attitude toward returning and integrating civil war refugees, the head of the German delegation said, according to a press release by the FRG Interior Ministry. The "priorities in this field were discussed in different ways at the conference," the press release adds. The creation of instruments for a more fair sharing of the burden in coping with refugee problems is urgently necessary within the European Union. Germany is willing to make constructive contributions to coming to terms with the pressure of immigration. The indispensable precondition for that is that the member states must first set down the conditions for the acceptance of legal immigrants. Stilianos Papathemelis, Greek minister of public order, stated that the external borders of the European Union must be better protected from illegal immigrants and stricter checks of refugees must be introduced in EU countries.
