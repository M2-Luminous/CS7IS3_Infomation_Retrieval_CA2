Who pushed the talks into a dead end? Who should be held responsible? This correspondent took part in covering the talks from beginning to end, which lasted more than seven months. From what I covered and from what I learned from various sources, we know there is only one answer to these questions: Britain stubbornly insisted on its erroneous position of "three violations"; from beginning to end Britain had not the slightest sincerity towards the talks; and in the absence of a Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong Governor Patten unilaterally took action, submitting part of the "constitutional reform package" to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion. These are the root causes which resulted in the breakdown of the talks. It is evident Patten himself established numerous obstacles in order to completely block the talks, yet recently he hypocritically called for "continuing the talks" as if the responsibility for their breakdown belonged to China. Such an outdated colonialist trick of the thief calling someone else a thief and putting all the blame on the victim cannot deceive the people in light of justified public opinion from the mainland, Hong Kong, and the world. As everyone knows, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks from 22 April to 27 November 1993. The major topic of the talks was the final elections to be held in Hong Kong while still under British rule -- that is, the arrangements for the 1994-1995 elections of the 19 district councils, the two urban councils (the New Territory Regional Council and the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Urban Council), and the Legislative Council. This deals with a string of specific problems on whether or not the four-year three-level framework resulting from the elections will continue after Hong Kong returns to China in 1997. In other words, it deals with Hong Kong's stable transition and the smooth handover of Hong Kong's political power in 1997. Before and during the talks, the outstanding focus of the dispute between the two sides had persistently revolved around whether the common understanding, understanding, and agreements [gong shi, liang tie, xie yi 0364 6224 6156 6043 0588 6231] reached between the two sides in the past should be abided by -- in other words, it is a problem of whether or not one should act in good faith. The Origin of Differences and the Proposal for Talks In fact, in the decade following 1982, both sides held protracted, consultative talks on the recovery of Hong Kong by China, its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong once again, and the development of the political system during Hong Kong's transition period. Their talks produced a series of results, including the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong signed by both sides, together with relevant agreements, understandings, and common understandings reached between the two countries. The signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration solved all the problems concerning Hong Kong's reversion and its smooth transition. In the process of formulating the "Basic Law" of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China incorporated a number of reasonable suggestions made by Britain, and the latter also repeatedly promised to converge with the "Basic Law." In seven letters containing nearly 10,000 characters corresponded between Chinese and British foreign ministers shortly before the promulgation of the "Basic Law," they exchanged views on Hong Kong elections to be held in 1995, the number of districts in which there would be direct elections of the Legislative Council, and other issues concerning the political development of Hong Kong, and reached an understanding and some agreements in principle. Therefore, if China and Britan could discuss the issue of Hong Kong's political system under comparatively cooperative circumstances during the decade following 1982, it should be an easy matter for both sides to conduct friendly consultations on election details when Hong Kong is approaching the elections, which are due to be held in 1994 and 1995. However, things went contrary to one's wishes. On 7 October 1992, without prior consultation with China, Britain suddenly presented a "constitutional package" through Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's policy address. It sent a serious message to China, namely, Britain was prepared to repudiate the basis on which it had maintained consultations and cooperation with China over the previous decade and to tear up the agreements both sides had reached. The method by which the package was put forward, and its substance, violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging with the "Basic Law," and the relevant agreements and understandings (called the three principles for short) reached between the Chinese and British Governments. The presentation of the package was such that Chris Patten's sudden attack directly deviated from the stipulation that the two countries conduct "discussions," "consultations," and "deliberations" on matters related to the smooth handover of Hong Kong's political power in 1997, which are contained in Annex II of the "Basic Law." Please take a look at a few events which occurred before the policy address was delivered: -- First of all, on 18 September 1992, the British FINANCIAL TIMES reported the news that Britain had made a major change to Hong Kong's existing political system. -- When British Foreign Secretary Hurd met Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in New York on 25 September 1992, he briefly mentioned Chris Patten's policy package. Foreign Minister Qian unequivocally set forth China's stand there and then. -- Britain sent a brief note to Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu on the policy package less than 10 days before it was made public. Immediately after receipt of the notice, Director Lu Ping sent a reply letter, reaffirming China's stand. However, ignoring China's persuasions and clinging obstinately to his course, Chris Patten unilaterally took action, thereby stirring up an open polemic between China and Britain which has lasted now for six months. The core of the "constitutional reform package" is to emphasize "change." The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that Hong Kong's existing political system, economic system, and way of life will remain unchanged and its laws will remain basically unchanged. However, Chris Patten has made great changes in the political development and in the electoral arrangements which will directly affect the systems after 1997. Several examples are as follows: -- Of the 441 members of district boards and two urban councils, 140 are appointed. Such a practice can complement direct elections, and help bring in people of ability with various specialities, and it conforms to the aspirations of the Hong Kong residents. However, Chris Patten has proposed that all the appointed seats be abolished. -- Dual membership of both the Executive Council and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong has always been permitted, and some Executive Council members are concurrently Legislative Council members. Such a practice is conducive to the operation and mutual restraint of the two councils. However, Chris Patten has called for a complete separation of the two councils, attempting to change "leading role of the administration to the leading role of the legislature" and wantonly raising the status of the Legislative Council. -- Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law" stipulate that Hong Kong's political development should be carried out in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. However, Chris Patten advocates immediate, drastic changes, such as expanding Hong Kong's basic constituency from fewer than 100,000 voters in 15 functional groups (organized among specialized people in business, economic and other sectors) in 1991 to 2.7 million, including all non-specialized personnel, by 1995. He attempts to create chaos and exclude genuine, specialized personnel on the pretext of "democracy." Chris Patten's package, therefore, is designed to completely negate the agreements reached between China and Britain in the past. Its only purpose is to prop up a pro-Britain, anti-China force in the Hong Kong Government, turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, and thus continue British rule over Hong Kong in a disguised form after 1997. Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" has been strongly criticized by people from all walks of life in Hong Kong. Early last year, Britain was compelled, under pressure of criticism, to express its desire to hold talks with China. Considering the overall interest of Sino-British cooperation, as well as the fundamental interest of the two countries, the Chinese side agreed to hold talks between government representatives of the two countries, hoping the British side would abandon its "three violations" and return to the track of Sino-British cooperation. So, the two sides conducted internal consultations from early February to 12 March. During the course of consultation, the Chinese side insisted on the "three principles" as the basis of talks. The British side agreed verbally, but deliberately complicated the issue and requested that Hong Kong Government officials participate in the talks as "official representatives." In order to hold the talks at an early date, the Chinese side assumed a flexible attitude and agreed to let Hong Kong Government officials assist British Government representatives as advisers and experts. When the two sides were about to reach an agreement on the talks, Chris Patten suddenly decided to publish the "constitutional reform bill" in the Hong Kong Government's Gazette for the purpose of submitting it to the Legislative Council for discussion. So, the British side unilaterally discontinued internal consultations between the two sides on 12 March 1993. In early April last year, the two sides resumed internal contacts and agreed to hold talks in accordance with the "three principles." To avoid external interference, the two sides promised to keep the contents of the talks secret. Set Up Obstacles and Talks Bog Down During the talks, Chinese Government representatives abided by the agreement reached between the two sides and, from beginning to end, did not disclose any substance of the talks to the press. However, before and after the talks, Chris Patten was always ready to air his unfavorable view of the talks by every possible means in an attempt to influence Hong Kong's public opinion, and even "jumped the gun" to obstruct the smooth progress of the talks. During interviews with reporters before every round of talks began, British representatives repeated that they adopted a "positive" and "constructive" attitude toward the talks and that they wanted to make efforts to enable the talks to "ascend a peak," but, on the other hand, they set up roadblocks from time to time to obstruct the "mountain climbing" of the talks. When China and Britain concluded their third round of talks and were about to begin the fourth, the British authorities in Hong Kong hastily adopted "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and Election Commission" on 26 May last year. A few days later, the Legislative Council's constitution drafting group on 31 May passed an agenda on holding discussions on a draft plan for elections once every two weeks [as received]. Thus, Britain unilaterally took action on issues that should have been solved by representatives of Chinese and British Governments through consultation in an attempt to force China to accept Chris Patten's "constitutional package" and to bring the talks into Patten's orbit by varying its tactics. China very quickly saw through the scheme. Despite the fact Britain made some alterations to Patten's package under pressure, it still has not given up its erroneous stand on the "three violations." During the talks, Britain kept setting new, unreasonable demands and even attempted to meddle in affairs under China's jurisdiction by virtue of its sovereignty. For instance, according to a stipulation of the "Basic Law," the "Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" to be established by the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1996 "shall be composed of mainland members and no fewer than 50 percent of Hong Kong members and its chairman and members shall be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee." But Britain proposed during the talks that Hong Kong members of the Preparatory Committee must be appointed by China and Britain through consultation. Britain also wanted China to guarantee that general elections will be held for the Hong Kong Legislative Council in 2007, and proposed that the 1995 election committee established through talks should become the pattern of the recommendation committee and election committee for the chief executive of the special region after 1997. The issue of the "express train" [zhi tong che 4160 6639 6508] was an important agenda item discussed by the two sides. Elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council are held once every four years. The Legislative Council elected in 1995 will remain in office until after 1997. It will be called the Hong Kong Legislative Council for the first two years and the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the last two. According to a stipulation in a relevant resolution adopted by the NPC, if the formation of the Legislative Council elected in 1995 complies with the resolution and with relevant regulations of the "Basic Law," if its members support the "Basic Law," and if they are willing to pledge loyalty to the government of the special region and meet the qualifications stipulated by the "Basic Law," they may make the direct transition to become members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Region in 1997 after they are approved by the Preparatory Committee of the Special Region. They are, therefore, described as being in the "express train." However, Britain proposed that members of the Legislative Council elected in 1995 become members of the first Legislative Council after merely swearing an oral oath. This disregards the basic condition for "boarding the express train" stipulated in the NPC resolution and attempts to strip the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of its power to approve Legislative Council members. Continuous obstructions on the part of Britain made it difficult for the talks to proceed; the talks kept pacing up and down at the crossroads. The Motive for Deliberately Complicating the Issue is All Too Clear In order to promote progress in the talks, the Chinese side in the early stages of the talks proposed that the election of district boards and the two urban councils and the 1995 Legislative Council election be separated in discussion. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated the proposal during his meeting with Foreign Secretary Hurd in New York in October 1993. The reason is that the district boards and two urban councils are not organs of a political power by nature, elections to them involve fewer questions, the questions are relatively easier to solve, and the elections to them will be held first. The Legislative Council elections involve such questions as the functional groups and electoral committees, and the questions are relatively more difficult to solve. For this reason, we might take care of elections to the district boards and two urban councils first, and the elections to the Legislative Council later. In other words, "easier things first." The British side at first rejected the proposal, though later expressed consent. However, it put forward three conditions -- lowering voting age, adopting the "single-seat, single-vote voting system," and abolishing appointed seats in the district boards and two urban councils. Although it insisted on honoring the agreements reached between the two sides in the past, the Chinese side assumed a very flexible and open attitude toward Britain's proposal and agreed to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. It also agreed to adopt the "single-seat, single-vote voting system" in elections to the district boards and two urban councils. On the question of appointed council members, however, the Chinese side maintains that to properly retain the appointed seats can complement direct elections in terms of ensuring sufficient number of specialized personnel among the council members. At the same time, the Chinese side holds that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself should decide the number of the appointed seats on the district boards and two urban councils after 1997, according to Article 98 of the "Basic Law." By adopting this position, the Chinese side is in fact giving telling the British side it need not set up more appointed seats before 30 June 1997. We could say that the Chinese side has made every compromise possible to deal with the three conditions set by the British side. While the two sides had almost reached an agreement in view over elections to the district boards and two urban councils, the British side insisted on simultaneous discussion on the voting method for the Legislative Council election. The Chinese side continued its restrained and patient attitude, and maintained that the voting method question could and should be discussed in later talks, together with the discussion of other matters concerning Legislative Council elections. The British side, however, completely ignoring our view, openly and unilaterally proposed to discontinue the talks on arranging the election of regional organizations. Such an act clearly showed that the British side did not have even the slightest bit of sincerity in the talks. In short, they were pretending to participate in the talks, but their true intention was to carry out Patten's package. While the two sides failed to reach agreement, Chris Patten recently wantonly submitted part of his reform bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council for discussion. Are his motives not all too clear? The aforesaid facts show that it goes without saying that the responsibility for the failure of the talks lies entirely on the British side. The failure is something which people in all walks of life on both the mainland and in Hong Kong do not want to see. The failure to reach an agreement on arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections also means that the question of the through train mentioned in the talks has become non-existent with the end of the talks. The three-level councils, as component parts of the present British Hong Kong government, will be disbanded with the end of the British rule in Hong Kong on 30 June 1997. People on the Chinese side fully believe that so long as the 6 million Hong Kong residents work hard together, the prosperity and stability created by them in Hong Kong can surely be maintained and enhanced. The Chinese side will, as always, continue to implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration, work strictly according to the "Basic Law," and earnestly practice the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong. We can anticipate that tomorrow's Hong Kong will certainly become even more prosperous.
