So-called land option trading, according to Mr. Zou, amounted to land speculation from the viewpoint of the actual situation in China. When taking into consideration the market concept, land option transactions should not be undertaken until a more complete market system has taken shape. Mr. Zou said he was convinced that it was necessary for the land market to be exploited for a period of time before land option trading was adopted in the country. The provisional regulations issued by the State Council in 1990 for the use with payment of state-owned land in urban and rural areas, Mr. Zou said, were aimed at keeping the land market under regulation and control. The regulations which govern the affairs in this sector are still operating. A draft law for administration of real estate in urban areas put forward by the Ministry of Construction, the State Land Administration and the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the State Council was recently approved at a routine meeting of the State Council and then submitted to the National People's Congress for final approval. The draft law covers the real estate market and will be the main law and rule for regulation and control as well as administration of the real estate market if endorsed. The land administration is now drafting regulations for land registration in a bid to greatly improve the land market in the country.
