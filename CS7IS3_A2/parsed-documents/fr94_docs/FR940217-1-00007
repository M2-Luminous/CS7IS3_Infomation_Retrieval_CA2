FR940217-1-00007 FR940217-1-00004 Discussions with operators that utilize these type airplanes under 14 CFR part 135 reveal that regular maintenance inspections require inspections in this area every 200 hours time-in-service (TIS), and that there have been no problems with the retractable MLG swivel pins. The inspection procedures in Piper's maintenance manual of the referenced airplanes calls for inspecting the MLG assembly every 100 hours TIS. The inspection procedures do not specifically address a teardown inspection of this assembly. At this time, the FAA has determined that there is no basis to establish a threshold or repetitive teardown inspection interval of this assembly based on the information obtained. In order to adequately make a determination as to what type of action to take (if any), the FAA is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to provide an opportunity for the general public to participate in the decision whether to initiate rulemaking. Interested persons are encouraged to provide information that describes what they consider the best action (if any) to be taken to correct the possible problem. In this regard, the FAA is especially interested in comments and viewpoints on the following: 1. How often do you have the retractable MLG swivel pins inspected and in what detail, i.e., visual, dye penetrant, etc.? 2. Does the checklist in the procedures you utilize during the MLG swivel pin inspections include removal of the swivel pins? 3. Have you ever replaced the swivel pin? a. If so, please list the hours TIS replaced and the reason why for each instance? b. If not, how many hours TIS have you accumulated on your airplane? 4. Do you feel that the current inspection requirements are adequate, i.e., 14 CFR part 43, your checklist, Piper's maintenance manual, etc.? Please list any specific recommendations that you may have concerning current or future inspection requirements. 5. Please include the model and serial number of your airplane, and the part number of the retractable MLG swivel pin with this correspondence. 6. Please provide any other information that you feel is pertinent in helping the FAA determine what type of action (if any) needs to be taken. The following figure (Figure 1) depicts the retractable MLG assembly, including the swivel pin.
