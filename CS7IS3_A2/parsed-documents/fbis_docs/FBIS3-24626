External exposure levels of these 22-50 year old men were reported not to have exceeded 25 cGy. The protocols involved questionnaires and, in the case of 125 of the men, laboratory examinations of semen samples. The findings indicated that one third of the men suffered from various degrees of impotence. In addition, 21% presented with chronic prostatovesiculitis, azoospermia, oligozoospermia, or asthenospermia. Thus, impotence and infertility should also be included on the list of medical complications that are being monitored in the the Chernobyl cleanup personnel. Tables 1; references: 2 (Russian).
