FBIS4-24904 "drchi107_h_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 West Europe London Stock Exchange Seeks Listings Business London Stock Exchange Seeks Listings Business HK0306063294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 3 June 94 p 1 HK0306063294 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) English BFN [By Sheel Kohli in London] [Text] The London Stock Exchange (LSE) and leading British securities house Smith New Court will be beefing up their programme to capture Chinese business when a high-level delegation from the Shenzhen stock exchange and senior company directors visit London next week. Both the LSE and Smith New Court are regarded as having suffered during the second batch of 22 Chinese state listings, because British securities houses have not been able to win much business. All secondary listings outside Hong Kong have been targeted for New York rather than London. Privately, British securities firms have been smarting from the bias that appears to have been shown to U.S. firms, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have done well out of the present tranche of H share listings. In the three-day trip high-ranking state officials, led by Shenzhen vice-mayor Zhang Hongyi, will meet LSE officials and Smith New Court's chairman Sir Michael Richardson and chief executive Michael Marks. Liu Xinhua, the deputy commissioner for the Shenzhen Securities and Exchange Commission, and Yu Guogang, the deputy chief executive of the Shenzhen stock exchange, will be part of the delegation. In addition, directors from some of Shenzhen's largest listed companies will also be attending, including Liu Fengyi, director and vice-president of the Shenzhen SEZ [Special Econmoic Zone] Real Estate group, and Chen Pingan, director and vice-president of China Bicycle Co Holdings. They will arrive on Sunday morning and will stay until Wednesday, when the U.S. stockbroker Merrill Lynch is flying the delegation to New York for a similar exercise. Henry Ingrouille, the London exchange's international relations analyst who will be helping to host the visiting delegation, said London was quickly learning from its mistakes in not encouraging Chinese companies to list earlier, and was now trying to rectify the situation. The LSE will be stressing the similarity between its listing requirements and that of Hong Kong, given that Hong Kong's system was based on London's. However, Mr Ingrouille admitted that the stock exchange had sometimes been the victim of circumstance beyond its control. "There is the political Hong Kong factor. We do get varied messages. Some times we are told that it has no bearing, and then we are told more informally that it does have an impact." He said that in recent months there had been much greater interest from Chinese companies regarding listing in London, although he admitted that the exchange would be too late to benefit from the present group of 22 state companies that had been lined up for flotation. Chinese companies are showing an increasing awareness of the capital raising ability of London. Presently there are three bonds fully listed on the exchange, issued by China, the People's Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank. Richard Margolis, head of Smith New Court in Hong Kong, said the delegation included seven Chinese companies, including China Bicycle and Shenzhen SEZ Real Estate, and they would be giving presentations at a meeting of the stockbroker's institutional clients. London's present efforts appear to have begun to pay off, and privately exchange officials expect to see secondary listings of Chinese companies in London within the next year. Nigel Atkinson, the exchange's head of listings, has just returned from a trip to China, having secured a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai stock exchange. Moves are presently afoot to set up a more wide-ranging arrangement with the Chinese Securities and Regulatory Commission.
