In it I stated that a large group of American medical personnel would soon be dispatched to Novosibirsk to help with their practical experience, drugs, and education. One of the initiators of this noble business was Doctor Bruce Sanderson from Arkansas, the birth state of President Clinton. After learning about him, the President wrote a personal letter to the trip organizers, emphasizing that direct cooperation between his fellow countrymen and Novosibirsk City Hospital No. 25 seemed to him to be a ``splendid project that can bring much good.'' The departure was planned for the middle of August. Unfortunately, today I must refute my own information. The journey has, at best, been delayed for a long time. Doctor Sanderson sent a letter to Aleksandr Bychkov, chief physician at hospital No. 25, in which he explains what happened in the most delicate tones. Assuring his colleague that it was not easy for the group members to reach such a decision and that the arrival of American ``first aid'' in Siberia is not being canceled but only put off into the future, Doctor Sanderson reports that the refusal of a number of specialists was dictated by the fact that in their opinion, the religious bans approved by Russia's Supreme Soviet are unacceptable. It may of course be said that the physicians do not necessarily need to react so strongly to the decision of another country's parliament and that denying humanitarian aid for this reason is not very logical. As is known, however, each monastery has its own rule. Not only the physicians, but many others in the United States as well, view the Supreme Soviet's recent decision regarding limiting the activity of representatives of foreign religious organizations as a return to the epoch of violating human rights. American legislators, colleagues of our deputies, have both in groups and individually approached president Yeltsin with the urgent request that he carefully weigh everything on the scales of justice before signing the draft legislation of 14 July. Included among them are such renowned politicians as senators Richard Lugar and Jessie Helms and house members Christopher Smith, Henry Hyde, and Frank Wolf. In a separate letter, Senator Phil Graham argues his negative reaction to the Russian draft legislation with the fact that for 200 years already, Americans have considered the right to profess one religion or another one of the fundamental human rights. And Samuel Eriksson, president of the association Lawyers International, noting that his organization consults the leaders of 200 million Christians, recalls the words of Professor Robert Jackson, chief prosecutor at the Nuremburg process, regarding the fact that many ``inconveniences'' must be put up with in the name of freedom of religion, speech, and the press. INFORMATION. The U.S. legislature does not specially regulate the religious and missionary activity of foreigners within its country's territory, but it does provided for specified visa control. Since 1 October 1991, the Immigration Service has issued a special category R visa to individuals desiring to come to the United States for religious activities. It applies to clergy professionally executing their activity at KOKFESSII of which they have been members for two preceding years (of course this also applies to representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church), as well as to individuals working professionally for religious organizations in the United States and individuals working in organizations or tax-exempt affiliates as professional clergy. Such a visa is valid for 5 years. The category R visa, like any other, strictly regulates what a person receiving it may and may not do. First, each person who applies for it must be a member of a religious community belonging to a corresponding American noncommercial religious organization (there are commercial ones as well). Second, holders of a category R visa are not permitted to perform nonprofessional work for their religious communities or work for other religious communities or any other employers in addition to or instead of working for their sponsoring religious community. The purpose of these restrictions is to prevent the entry of individuals who have no relation to religious activity but who simply wish to get into the United States for one reason or another.
