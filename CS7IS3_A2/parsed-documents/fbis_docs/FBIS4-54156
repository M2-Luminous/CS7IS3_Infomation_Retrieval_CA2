People who may traditionally have to cope with three month or so annual shortage face the prospect of no rice at all for six to eleven months until the next harvest in October or November. With no other income source than agriculture, they depend on the ever diminishing resources of their neighbours or relatives and the shrinking number of small animals, rodents, insects and tubers hunted and foraged in the forests. Many farmers have already been forced by hunger to consume the seeds set aside for the 1994 planting. For most families, sale of buffalo -- the main source of energy for ploughing -- would represent an act of desperation. There have not been widespread livestock sales thus far. In 1993, the Lao PDR's [People's Democratic Republic] production of rice, the staple food of the country, was 1.25 million tonnes, some 17 percent below the previous year's harvest. The provinces of Savannakhet, Saravane, Sayaboury, and Houa Phan were particularly hard hit. In Savannakhet Province, normally a premier rice producer, ten of thirteen districts produced a deficit. Some districts face, on average, an eleven month shortage and some people have had no reliable source of food since the last harvest. As the magnitude of the problem became known, the Government of Laos acted swiftly to seek assistance from the international community through the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP). A joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)/WFP assessment in February recommended food aid amounting to 43,000 tonnes of polished rice to supply the people of the worst affected districts in the four hardest hit provinces. Those enduring the most severe food shortage would each receive 72 kgs of rice to tide them over the final six months before the 1994 harvest. Ms. Ameerah Haq-Perera, United Nations Development Programme resident representative, explains that the situation is not comparable to a famine of the proportions experienced in Ethiopia or Somalia: "The effects are not of people starving to death but more of hunger and disease." The impact of the food shortage on the long-term development plans of the country is a concern: "It is difficult to switch from a subsistence economy when farmers are out foraging for food and their energies cannot he diverted to more productive ventures," says Ms. Haq-Perera. WFP's temporary office, which was opened in February 1992 to help the Lao government and people cope with the after-effects of the 1991 floods which devastated the rice-bowl provinces of the south, is now entering its third emergency operation. Last year 3,000 tonnes of WFP aid was distributed to drought-stricken northern provinces of Luang Namtha, Houa Phan, Xieng Khouang, and Phong Saly. In response to this year's emergency appeal, a total of around 19,000 tonnes of rice has so far been pledged by WFP, Canada, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, and the European Union. Non-Governmental Organisations [NGO], including World Concern, Care, and World Vision, are assisting with distributing the rice. The biggest task now facing those involved in the emergency operation is getting the rice to the villagers before the worst affected communities are cut off by the monsoonal rains. "Many areas will be cut off for months when the rains set in in a few weeks. The NGOs we work with in some areas fear the rains will leave them with stocks they cannot deliver or distribute," says WFP emergency coordinator Steve Keller. Donor assistance is now required for the administration, logistical support, and monitoring. The 1,000 or so inhabitants of Nasenoi village recently received delivery of 55 tonnes of WFP rice. World Concern efficiently supervised the distribution and district record-keepers took thumb prints as eligible people collected their correct allocation. However, the long-term solution to this chronic food shortage problem, explains Ms. Haq-Perera, is the Government's agricultural policy to bring more land into cultivation with small scale irrigation schemes and by encouraging crop diversification. This will ensure that the food supply situation is no longer so vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather.
