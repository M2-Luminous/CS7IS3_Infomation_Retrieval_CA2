No video is available. Moroz is asked about Ukraine's participation in the Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS countries. Moroz says he believes Ukraine should be part of this structure "because there are so many issues to be resolved today--first and foremost, economic issues in relations and within the CIS." Moroz then discusses the Crimean issue. He says: "We have just formed a commission of parliamentary deputies headed by Borys Oliynyk. They will leave for Crimea in the near future and will work with the relevant commission of the Crimean parliament. In my view, we should finally agree on a joint result that will consent to the abrogation of the decisions of the Crimean parliament on the introduction of the 1992 Constitution." Moroz says there is a need to avoid confrontation between the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. He adds: "I understand that, in a different situation, one could resort to more radical measures. Today, however, it is not in the interests of the world community, of Ukraine, or of many individual countries. They would not be happy if the Crimean situation became aggravated. Therefore, in my view, it is simply necessary to pursue a considered and restraining policy in order to keep the radicals in Crimea, as well as radicals in other places, within the Constitution." Speaking on a political union with Russia, Moroz said: "I think that we have a political union with Russia today on the basis of a treaty signed--if I am not mistaken--on 19 November 1991. If we need to clarify some articles of this treaty, and if there is such a need, then I think we will come to an agreement with the Russian leadership, and we will conclude a new treaty. A key aspect of this document, however, would undoubtedly be the full state sovereignty or state independence of Ukraine, as well as the state independence of Russia. This would be a treaty between great neighboring countries." On the subject of nuclear weapons, Moroz says that foreign leaders were constantly asking when Ukraine would become a non-nuclear state, but they never spoke about the conditions that their states had to fulfill if this happened. Answering a question on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet, Moroz says that it was indeed a very complex issue and that many mistakes had been made. He says he believes that the fleet should be an element of collective defense but that much time had already been wasted. He adds that the Black Sea was a zone of specific interest to both Ukraine and Russia and that the problems of the fleet should be resolved proceeding from this fact. Moroz says he would decline to speak in any more detail on the issue of the fleet because "there are many aspects that are very important in themselves. When we begin to take these aspects as a basis, then we can come up with a decision that is contrary to what was envisaged when this subject was included in the agreement or negotiations." He adds that "we should work toward creating both a Ukrainian fleet and a Russian fleet that will always have relations between themselves." Speaking on the subject of nuclear disarmament and the arms question in general, Moroz says that Ukraine's acquisition of a non-nuclear status creates certain advantages for the West. He says: "We gave them the possibility of earning additional profits. Take, for example, the trade in arms. In the last two years, the volume of the arms trade by the United States has increased by approximately 18 billion U.S. dollars, whereas we have nothing, even though we have enterprises, developed technology, and products that we could sell in foreign markets." Moroz adds that the objective interests of Ukraine's economy must be taken into account and says these interests involve Ukraine's manufacturing potential, which today is dependent on the military industrial complex and on those enterprises that manufacture nuclear weapons. On the subject of land privatization, Moroz says that land should not be bought and sold, but could be leased for a period of 90 years or for shorter periods and that this would not be a threat to foreign investment.
