Martic made the decision after receiving additional international guarantees that all issues relating to the Croatia-Krajina conflict would in future be resolved through talks on an equal footing and that the international community would not tolerate Croatia's policy of force, the RSK news agency ISKRA reports. Moreover, says ISKRA, Martic also received firm guarantees that a political settlement would not be prejudged in any stage of the talks and that it should be sought within the Geneva-based international conference on the former Yugoslavia. Martic's office also said that the RSK president had decided to agree to the talks after consultations with co-chairmen of the international conference Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg and U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi. The RSK was founded in late 1991 in the Serb ancestral lands in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and attempts to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. In March 1992, the RSK was placed under U.N. protection. Martic's talks with the international mediators in Geneva also tackled the implementation of the RSK-Croatia truce signed in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb last spring. The RSK president said that Croatia had not fully honoured the agreement and warned that this could seriuosly impede the peace process. Akashi personally guaranteed that he would insist with the Croatian side to immediately meet the obligations it undertook under the truce agreement.
