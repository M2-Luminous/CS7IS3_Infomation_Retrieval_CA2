Accepting it without seeking the causes of this impotence, in other words, the means of overcoming it, is a different matter. The causes, or rather, the cause is the persistent refusal to take account of the real situation. Thinking that, after the fall of communism, the East European theater would automatically be destined for peace and fraternity was a refusal to accept reality. Believing that Serbia would allow the other Yugoslav republics to declare their independence without reacting was also a refusal to accept reality. Finally, believing that the United Nations could solve the problem was also a refusal to accept reality, taking into account that its troops were locked into a humanitarian mission and limited to self-defense, and that they were in any case technically unable to intervene effectively because of the problems of the terrain and the extreme proximity of the different armed groups and their interweaving with civilians. For the future, taking account of the real situation would obviously mean taking note of the fact that the Serbs have already achieved virtually what they wanted on the ground. Belgrade is primarily now seeking the same thing as the international community: an honorable way out. And the only point on which this way out could be organized is the embargo. Although Serbia's isolation is not preventing the continuation of the war, it does jeopardize the viability of the new Yugoslav Federation and hence the power of Milosevic and his friends. As for the international community, in addition to the fact that this is the only argument it has in exchange for a definitive halt in the fighting, it cannot go on forever practicing selective humanitarian indignation, because, after all, in Belgrade and in Sarajevo, it is always the same people who suffer, the vast majority of "ordinary people," and not the thugs or fanatics of pan-Serbism or expansionist Islamic fundamentalism. Moreover, it is no accident that we have just learned that the United States is now prepared to discuss a gradual lifting of the embargo in exchange for an end to the Serbian military operations and Belgrade's return to the negotiating table. Of course, when the same proposal was made a few months ago by [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe and his German counterpart, it was met with widespread indifference. However, admitting that, rightly or wrongly, what happens in Washington and Moscow will always have more weight than what might be said in Paris and Bonn is also accepting the harsh law of reality.
