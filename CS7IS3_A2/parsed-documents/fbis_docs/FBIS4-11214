He said: "We must assess the effect that the new law on patents may have on prices, bearing in mind the market regulation mechanisms we have at our disposal." Health and Social Action Minister Alberto Mazza, by contrast, conceded that the price of patents "may affect overall health costs." He nonetheless made it clear that this "may also depend on technology." Mazza emphasized that a patents law "will encourage scientific development, and will permit Argentina's efficient incorporation into the world community." Sanchez and Mazza made these remarks during a public appearance in the Senate's lecture room. The meeting was sponsored by Industry Committee Chairman Jose Genoud of the Radical Civic Union. The executive branch submitted a pharmaceutical patents bill to the Senate in May of last year. Five different committees have been studying it since then. The officials' public appearance is part of a series of talks that are being organized by the Senate. In the next few weeks Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella will also participate in it. Provisional Senate President Eduardo Menem introduced the speakers, and then said that the issue of patents "was not shelved, as many people say. On the contrary, legislators are seriously analyzing it." Mazza denied that the new patents law will negatively affect the quality of medicines, adding that "in any case, quality will be guaranteed by the National Medicines, Food, and Technology Administration." Mazza stressed the organization's efficiency, and said that it "was created with the participation and technical advice of the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization." The health minister said: "This administration filled the vacuum left by state control organs, which did not operate properly because their work was not properly coordinated." The economy vice minister in turn said that Argentina's acceptance of the international law on patents "will not necessarily affect prices, and if it does, the state has instruments to regulate the operation of markets." "When we talk about patents we mean respect for intellectual property, not its effect on prices," the economy vice minister said. Asked if the patents law will imply the installation of monopolies in the medicines market, Sanchez said: "There is a national law on defense of competition and a National Commission for the Defense of Competition. This commission is responsible for strict control of the performance of various companies with monopolistic powers, and for determining whether they abuse their dominant position in the market." Sanchez said that the assumption that monopolies and high prices go hand in hand "is not necessarily correct, because we have the instruments to control that relation." "The patents law will not create monopolies. It will protect property rights on scientific development. In any case, the existence of monopolies depends on the characteristics of each market," Sanchez added. The vice minister said: "Some markets are necessarily monopolistic, as they cannot operate in any other way. But that does not mean that prices must increase. The computer business started with two monopolistic companies, and it is well known that prices did not increase. Instead, they dropped and are still dropping," Sanchez concluded.
