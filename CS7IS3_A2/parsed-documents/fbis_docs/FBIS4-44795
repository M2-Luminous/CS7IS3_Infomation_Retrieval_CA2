They will be incorporated into Sextant's Vendome plant for on-board instruments. The Mors group is heading for a second fiscal year in the red, with annual sales that plummeted from Fr650 million in 1992 to Fr522 million last year. Its new president, Claude Manceau, presented a recovery plan for the company last 18 February. The scheme calls for Mors to sell its aviation instrument business to Sextant, and part with its 50-percent capital interest in CEIS TM, its joint venture with Technicatome. The Cogifer group will purchase Mors's share of CEIS TM, which earns annual sales of about Fr130 million from the production of medium-power turbines for nuclear submarines and Argos and Cospas-Sarsat beacons. Though the sale of the joint venture to Cogifer has already been ratified, the Sextant Avionique deal must still be submitted for approval to the two groups' central worker-management committees sometime in the next two weeks. The selloff essentially involves on-board electromechanical equipment for airplane and helicopter engines, which currently generate Fr55 million a year in sales and employ a tiny staff of 100 in the Paris suburb of Blanc-Mesnil. Sextant expects to incorporate production of the equipment into its on-board instruments plant in Vendome. The acquisition will add approximately 300 new product numbers to the already vast catalog of Sextant's on-board equipment. For now, the exact details of the transaction with regard to the manufacture of certain computers are still fuzzy. The engine vibration control computers (installed on the Falcon 2000) and brake temperature monitoring computers that equip the entire Airbus line, the Boeing 747-400, and McDonnell Douglas's MD-11 will reportedly transfer to Sextant. The tire pressure indicator (TPIS) computers that Mors developed in collaboration with the English firm Westland are tied up in an unfair competition suit brought by the Labinal group. Once it is settled, the TPISs could also pass into Sextant's hands. Finally, Mors will hang on to business in two emerging fields: modular avionics, for which it is developing a HUMS (Health and Usage Monitoring System) computer to track the aging of helicopters in cooperation with Eurocopter; and aircraft mobile telephones (TFTS). It has been chosen as the supplier of Jetphone, a joint venture of France Telecom and British Telecom.
