ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the regulations on adjusting Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation rents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1989 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and have been assigned OMB control number 2577&hyph;0196. Public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in this rule is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Information on the estimated public reporting burden is provided under the Preamble heading, Other Matters. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for HUD, Washington, DC 20503. I. Applicability This rule is applicable to all projects which are under a Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract in the regular Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. The rule revises the current regulations in subpart D of 24 CFR Part 882 which govern the special procedures for adjusting contract rents of regular Moderate Rehabilitation projects during the term of the HAP Contract. II. Special Adjustments This rule implements Section 542 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, which amended Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. It provides for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to recommend, and HUD to approve, subject to the availability of appropriations, a special adjustment to reflect substantial general increases in security expenses, and operating, maintenance and capital repair costs primarily due to drug-related criminal activity. The Owner does not have a contractual or regulatory right to receive the special adjustment. HUD may approve a special adjustment, and the PHA may make a special adjustment to contract rents. A special adjustment must be determined in accordance with HUD procedures and be approved by HUD. III. Justification for Final Rule The Department has determined that the changes made by this rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring prior notice and comment. This rule only adds statutory language that expands, subject to appropriations, the number of special rent adjustments for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation rents. As such, notice and comment are unnecessary and the rule is exempt under 24 CFR Part 10 from notice and comment requirements. IV. Other Matters A. Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. B. Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under the Order. This rule adds a special rent adjustment for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation rents as permitted by statute and subject to appropriations. It will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationships with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government.
