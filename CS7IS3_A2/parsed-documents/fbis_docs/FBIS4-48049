The matter does not end here, however, as the job comes with rather difficult challenges. The first challenge is that, though he is the leader of a party that won a landslide victory, he must now be able to rise above partisanship and be the leader of the entire nation. We regard this as a challenge because, on many occasions in the past, close party aides have given him bad advice that has led him into error, when he on his own had rightly discerned the truth of the matter. The second challenge is to succeed in fostering reconciliation and encouraging a spirit of peace in the entire nation. He has identified this as a goal, and we with him success. We do not say this lightly, but in earnest, because we comprehend the difficulty of brokering peace between contending sides. The third challenge is to succeed in delivering on the promises made to the electorate by his party. There are many people who voted for the ANC because it promised them houses, work, and other such things. A great many people think that as soon as he is installed, they will have houses and jobs the very next day, but no, that is not how it will be. The greatest challenge, and we do not know how he will achieve it, is that of bringing about peace and reconciliation between himself, as Mandela the individual, and the Royal House of KwaZulu and the Zulu nation as a whole. Perhaps there are not too many breaches he himself can be held accountable for, but there was most certainly much harm done by zealots in his party, and their acts have not left Mandela untainted because -- as the saying goes in Zulu -- the master is responsible for what his dog does. We do, however, trust that if he is given the chance to be a leader with authority he will succeed, because to our knowledge he is a man with humanity and insight, who, if allowed to use his own judgment, and the attributes given him by God Almighty, will succeed in meeting all challenges.
