They accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge in operations against the Phnom Penh government because the Khmer Rouge was excluded from national administration. The latest accusation was heard when the Khmer Rouge forces retook the town of Pailin, which is in the northwest of Cambodia and less than 20 km from the Thai border. Pailin had been captured by government forces on 19 March, but remained under the Cambodian Government's control for only 30 days. This time the accusation was made by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who said Thailand "directly helped the Khmer Rouge," and that several hundreds crossed from the Thai side to reinforce the Khmer Rouge at Pailin. The Thai Government, through its spokesman, immediately denied the Cambodian allegation. It said the Thai Government was gravely concerned by the accusations made to the media by Cambodian leaders. It said, despite the fact that there was an agreement to settle problems through diplomatic channels, Cambodia never abided by the agreement. This caused Thailand to doubt whether the Cambodian Government was only finding a scapegoat to explain its defeat at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. From what happened, we think the Thai and Cambodian Governments are now resorting to emotions in dealing with one another. It is useless to adopt such a stand, and continue throwing charges against each other, since this would only make things worse. Before the Khmer Rouge lost Pailin to the Phnom Penh government, Thailand had adjusted its policy regarding issues at the border with Cambodia -- Cambodians would be denied shelter inside Thailand in order to prevent allegations that Thailand was helping the Khmer Rouge. However, Thailand was accused by the Cambodian Government of lacking humanitarian feelings when it pushed back fleeing Cambodian refugees. Now Cambodia has accused Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge -- which is very unlikely. Khmer Rouge elements can sneak into Thai territory without Thailand's knowledge because the Thai- Cambodian border is a long stretch. And it is not Thailand's fault if Khmer Rouge forces used Thai territory as a transport route without Thailand's knowledge. We think that, although both Thailand and Cambodia are in an angry mood, they should immediately seek to hold a high-level meeting to thrash out the mutual distrust. There is no use in Thailand helping the Khmer Rouge in their fight against the Phnom Penh government since Thailand, as a nation, would gain nothing from that. It is necessary for Thailand and Cambodia to hold discussions to reach mutual understanding in order to prevent further any deterioration in their relations. Remaining indifferent to the issue will be no good for any of the two parties since, as geographical neighbors, they cannot live far apart from one another.
