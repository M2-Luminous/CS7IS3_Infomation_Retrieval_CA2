In a statement today, the council noted the need to call on the Islamic nations and their political and party institutions, trade and professional unions, labor, youth, and student federations, and economic, trade, cultural, tourism centers to boycott the Yugoslav interests and companies in Islamic countries, to suspend all dealings with Yugoslavia, and not to offer services for its communications companies at ports and airports. The council stressed the need for an immediate response to the world intention to use military power to enforce international legitimacy, lift the blockade of Sarajevo disregarding impediments that some countries face in implementing this policy, and to adopt a political, military plan to lift the international embargo on arming the Bosnian people with all means to enable them to defend themselves. The statement explained the importance of setting up an international popular tribunal that should have access to information and be impartial and neutral to pursue and punish the Serb criminals in line with human (?principles), international laws, and human rights documents. The statement called on banks, economic institutions, and financiers and businessmen in the Islamic world to open funds to collect contributions to help the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, eliminate the effects of aggression, and urge Islamic organizations to increase their aid to the victims of the oppressive Serbian aggression. The council emphasized the importance of coordinating stands between the Islamic Conference Organization and the Arab League and similar official and public regional and international leagues to rally all sincere efforts in support of the principles of right, justice, and peace.
