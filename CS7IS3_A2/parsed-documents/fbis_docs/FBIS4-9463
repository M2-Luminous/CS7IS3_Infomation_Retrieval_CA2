We are expecting the prime minister to immediately lift the decision concerning the restructuring of the brown coal mining industry, Stasiak said. According to him, the responsibility for the further development of the situation now rests entirely on Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Stasiak added that since the industry minister's messages fail to propose any new solutions and only increase tension among the strikers "There is no need to further exchange correspondence with him".
