As citizens, we have our candidates, parties, and ideas. In our condition as citizens, we will, as is our duty, struggle for the triumph of the candidates chosen by our conscience. As servants of society it is our responsibility to guarantee the freedom of the voters and the transmission of power within a strict democratic order. [end recording] President Itamar Franco also pointed out the Armed Forces' cooperation with the government and its understanding in the face of difficult situations: [Begin Franco recording] When I step down from power I will remember from these difficult months the good relationship with the Armed Forces, in whom I have always found understanding for the sacrifice that the budget restrictions have imposed on us, as well as its limitless contribution to the success of this administration, which, despite the bad will of many people, cannot be denied. We managed to resume our economic development, we are eliminating the public deficit, and effective measures against inflation are being taken. Throughout this difficult process we have always counted on the Armed Forces' men as part of an institution and as high-ranking members of our administration. [end recording] President Franco also said that on 20 April he will send Congress a provisional measure establishing the rehiring of the public employees dismissed during the Collor administration. The president added that he believes there will be a quorum in Congress this week to vote on the URV [Real Value Unit] Provisional Measure. The president said he relies on the good sense of members of Congress. He considers the provisional measure a decisive step in the struggle against the inflation.
