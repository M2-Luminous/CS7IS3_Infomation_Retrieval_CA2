Present on the occasion were the head of the local branch office of the Japanese JIJI press, chief editors of the Osaka head offices of ASAHI SHIMBUN, MAINICHI SHIMBUN, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and SANKEI SHIMBUN and representatives of the NHK, the KYODO News Service and YOMIURI SHIMBUN. Speaking at the roundtable, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and chairman of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said the question of "suspected nuclear development" of the DPRK has been reported by Japanese media in a way contrary to facts, thereby hampering the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and, furthermore, the denuclearization of Northeast Asia. "The DPRK has neither intention nor capacity to develop nuclear weapons," he stressed. Calling attention to the unreasonable search of the Osaka organization of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, assaults on Korean students in Japan and rampant reports and tones inciting the consciousness of national chauvinism, he demanded an immediate halt to such acts.
