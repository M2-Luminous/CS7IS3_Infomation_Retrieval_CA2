A believer Yi Se-chun in Kyongsan, North Kyongsang Province, told his colleagues after a mass on the day of the founding of Taejonggyo: "Historians of the North, encouraged by the instructions of President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, proved that Tangun was not a legendary mythical being but a real person, the founder of Kojoson (ancient Korea). So, the desire of the believers of Taejonggyo has been realised and it has been demonstrated worldwide that our nation is a resourceful, homogeneous nation with a history spanning 5,000 years." Agreeing with him, a believer Choe Sun-kyo said: "We, believers of Taejonggyo, must revere them as the leaders of Tangun's Korea. Only when we hold them in high esteem, is it possible to glorify the history of our nation and guarantee a bright future of the reunified country and the restored nation." Pleased that the tomb of Tangun is now being reconstructed, a believer Yu Pae-sun said: "When the country is reunified, let us go to the North before anyone else to express thanks to President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, the leaders of the Korean nation peerless in the 5,000 year long history, and add lustre to Tangun's Korea, remaining faithful to them."
