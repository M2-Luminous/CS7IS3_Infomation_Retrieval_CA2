"His visit to the U.S. for a lecture meeting has been canceled, but I think he will eventually be able to make the trip," Kuriyama said at a press conference. Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was expected to travel to Washington next week ostensibly to deliver a speech at the National Press Club. He was also expected to act as a trouble-shooting envoy for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a bid to mend bilateral ties frayed by the breakdown of trade talks last month. Ozawa told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that it would be difficult to make the trip because he has not made any preparations. He said he would consider making the visit after the intense media speculation over the trip dies down. In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he would like to meet Ozawa if he receives such a request. Kantor reportedly told lawmakers that the U.S.-Japan economic relationship "is in serious disrepair," but on reports of an imminent trade war, said "this is not going to happen."
