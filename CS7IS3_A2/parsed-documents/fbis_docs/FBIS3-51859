Among the latest complaints are those filed by members of the board of directors of the Conasupo [National Company for Basic Commodities] Southeastern Distribution Company, Inc., who said that at 1130 on 20 January, on the Palenque-Benemerito de las Americas highway in Chiapas, near the 200-km marker, Messrs. Ube Tancheita, Fidel Mendoza Paredes and Roberto Sanchez Sanchez, drivers of three Conasupo vehicles, were attacked by a group of armed individuals who took their money. Likewise, employees of the National Immigration Institute announced that in that same area and on the same day Fernando Sandoval Flores, Marcos Espinoza Aguilar, and Martin Au Rivera were attacked by approximately 30 armed individuals who were dressed in gray tops and dark pants and had their faces covered. Their assailants robbed them of 850 new pesos. Meanwhile, Jose Transito Burguete Najera reported on 22 January that on 30 December he left 80 head of cattle at his El Jordan ranch in the municipality of Ocosingo and when he returned for them on 18 January he was attacked in La Nueva Estrella, a town in the same municipality, by 40 individuals who had rifles and were dressed in brown uniforms with large handkerchiefs around their necks. These men held Burguete Najera for 24 hours, demanding payment of 5,000 new pesos and four head of cattle. Since Burguete did not have the money they took four heads of cattle and a 3-ton pick-up. On that same day Armando Aguilar Castellanos, owner of the El Porvenir ranch in Ocosingo Municipality, reported that on 20 January approximately 40 armed transgressors appeared at his home and stole his pick-up. The perpetration of these types of crimes is becoming quite frequent; this has been confirmed by Mr. Antonio Robelo, a representative of the state cattle breeders' association, who disclosed that up until yesterday in Las Margaritas Municipality alone, over 1,500 head of cattle have been lost. Robelo also disclosed that the transgressors have [shot] several peasants in their backs for attempting to desert from the armed groups. The NDS has received a copy of communique No. 007/94 with today's date, addressed to the president of the republic, signed by the municipal president of Oxchuc, Chiapas and by the following municipal representatives: secretary general of the municipal committee of the National Peasant Confederation, president of the Community Property Commission, and municipal agents and education committees of the 48 communities that comprise Oxchuc Municipality. The document requests that the Mexican Army remain in Oxchuc to maintain its residents' peace of mind and it denies the accusations leveled against our Mexican Army, which has proven its loyalty by restoring social order.
