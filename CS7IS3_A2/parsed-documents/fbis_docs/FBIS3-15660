This approach is exceptionally important for Baku, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said in Beijing today. The visit, which has made it possible to establish good relations at the level of the two countries' top leadership, has opened up new prospects for the further development of ties between China and Azerbaijan, which is going through a difficult period in its history, he stressed at a news conference. "We attach great significance to this, bearing in mind the important place China occupies in the international economic system and in world politics," the president of Azerbaijan said. Geydar Aliyev said that the talks with PRC President Jiang Zemin and today's conversation with State Council Premier Li Peng enabled him to talk in detail about the situation in the republic and the region as a whole and, primarily, about the Armenian-Azerbaijani armed conflict. "Azerbaijan," the president stressed, "does not want a war, is striving for a cessation of hostilities, and wants a settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. However, the unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and the guarantee of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders are absolute conditions." He linked the possibility of reviewing the status of Nagorno-Karabakh with fulfillment of these conditions. Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Geydar Aliyev said: "Azerbaijani-Russian relations are normal, good, and friendly. Until recently, there were difficulties between the two countries, mainly because of the stance of the former leadership of Azerbaijan. Since the second half of last year relations have been improving. During my recent meeting in Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, we agreed on measures to remove obstacles to the development of ties." Touching on the role of the Russian Federation in halting the Karabakh conflict, he noted that Russia has been constantly participating in the settlement process but so far there have been no results. During the recent meeting between the defense ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow, an accord was reached on a cease-fire from 1 March and the withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the territory of Azerbaijan. However, because of the actions of the Armenian side, this has been breached, Geydar Aliyev said. Tomorrow the president of Azerbaijan flies to Shanghai.
