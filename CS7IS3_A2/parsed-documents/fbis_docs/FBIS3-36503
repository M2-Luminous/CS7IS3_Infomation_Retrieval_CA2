Addressing journalists in Moscow on Saturday, he said: To preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, as a condition for stability in the region, and ensure the status of autonomy for Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria, would answer to Russia's strategic interests. "In my view, the ideal model for Georgia would be federal system," Shakhray said. "There is no other way to preserve Georgia's territorial integrity and stop the civil war and ethnic conflicts there." According to him, there should have been a preliminary condition for signing the bilateral treaty: the understanding that Russia will act as the guarantor of the autonomous status of republics within Georgia, without interfering in Georgia's internal affairs. Since this has not been stipulated, the treaty may become a pretext for destabilizing the situation even before its ratification, Shakhray said.
