How will this improve the socioeconomic situation in the mountains? [Shpek] In my opinion, the Carpathian rayons should receive the status of mountainous rayons. But the situation will not improve without an effective state policy directed at the development of this particular region. What do we have there currently? To my regret, nothing serious. We should openly admit that due to the irrational economic policy and wrong activities, the economy of the region is generally socially unattractive, ecologically harmful, and economically ineffective. Economic contacts are disrupted; unemployment is climbing upward; the gap between the living standards of people who are living in valleys and mountains is increasing; the demographic situation is approaching a critical point; the unique nature of the region is in danger; the historic and cultural monuments have been neglected. Some of these negative tendencies are being intensified at the time of transition to market relations, when new economic mechanisms are being set up. A state program is only a way to halt these tendencies, to provide progressive economic changes, social development of the territory, and ecological protection. [Krasnodemskyy] As far as I remember, in late May of last year, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a decree to draft such a program. What has been done? [Shpek] We are just at the beginning but some quite useful work has been done. A group of researchers headed by Professor M. Dolishnyy from the Institute of Economy within the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Lvov studied proposals of local administrations, ministries, departments, research institutes, and high establishments, and drafted a concept for socioeconomic development of the Carpathians. The key principles of this concept were discussed at the international conference "The Carpathians Are a Ukrainian Bridge to Europe: Problems and Prospects" in September of last year, and in general they were praised by its participants. The state program for socioeconomic development of the Carpathians is being drafted on the basis of this concept. [Krasnodemskyy] Participants in an international conference called the "Carpathians a Ukrainian bridge to Europe." Obviously, this was not accidental. [Shpek] Really, this is an apt and a broad symbol. However, in the context of the Ukrainian foreign policy, the geopolitical location of the Carpathians always eased the entrance of Ukraine to various European economic, public, and political structures. By the way, we currently observe this in international developments, for example, in the process of setting up an association "Karpatskyy Euroregion" for international cooperation which officially began working in February 1993, after signing a Joint Declaration of Foreign Ministers of Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine, as well as constitutive documents of this association. [Krasnodemskyy] The negative cases and tendencies which are ever more pressing in the Carpathians are, no doubt, the heritage of the previous economic policy. However, many mistakes were made in the post-communist period, particularly, in the way the economic and structural reforms were implemented. In the opinion of scientists and politicians, lack of a rigid regional policy in Ukraine led to the current state of the Carpathian economy. [Shpek] The program of the regional socioeconomic development should unite the state and regional interests on these territories, and should provide for sensible compromises between them. Admittedly, regional interests demand that job opportunities and the employment for the local population be raised. At the same time, the state cannot do away with sulfur, timber, coal, and other mineral raw materials that the mountains are rich in. Can a compromise be found? Of course. But the two parties should gain profits. Therefore, a compromise between local and state interests should be based on fair and equal relations between the state and the region. The state regional policy should guarantee a competent regional policy in provinces. Only then a policy could be a success, if the rules of the game are not violated. A strategic goal of the prospective territorial development is based on the optimal use of all local resources to set up an efficient market economy that will grant material welfare to the population, and ecological security to the region. [Krasnodemskyy] What directions in the regional socioeconomic policy, in your opinion, are of primary importance? [Shpek] First of all, it is necessary to implement a socially oriented structural reconstruction of the economy by shifting the impact to the mountainous territory. Almost three quarters of the labor force there work in the production sphere which certifies the socially unfavorable character of the local economy. In the Carpathians, we have some 800 springs of medicinal mineral waters of virtually all balneology types, among them such rare waters like Truskavetska and Skidnitska "Naftusya," Morshyn brines, Transcarpathian carbonates, and others. We have considerable reserves of mud and ozokerite; around 34,000 hectares are occupied by health resorts where people improve their health. Eventually, in every season, the Carpathians could be a paradise for tourists. Thus, the entire region should become a big recreation and tourist center for our state with a corresponding infrastructure. In addition, it should become a basis for training Ukrainian sportsmen in various winter sports. By the way, only 10 percent of the present recreational potential of the region is being used. It is necessary to set up a highly developed market infrastructure and transform this region into a specific training ground for attracting foreign investments in the Ukrainian economy, for the development of mutually beneficial cooperation with European states. By the way, potential foreign investors will first of all be interested in setting up joint medical and tourist businesses. The cost of land plots for building and natural resources -- to be used during the process of exploitation of these sites -- could become the Ukrainian share, aside from its direct financing. The next important issue is that market reforms will start working efficiently only when a region becomes more independent in introducing the state economic levers in its economy. [Krasnodemskyy] Already two years ago, one third of all the unemployed registered in Ukraine lived in the Carpathians. The situation in the mountainous regions is very tense. How can the state assist us this time? [Shpek] It is necessary to change the investment policy: Capital investments should be planned beforehand. To be more exact, the network of small businesses that are flexible and able to invest in recreation sites in the time of transition to the market should be set up in agricultural regions and townlets Municipal services are an Achilles's heel of the region. In this area, we are lagging behind the industrially developed countries. For example, setting up a network of private shops, bars, hairdresser's, small hotels, and car repair shops will ensure jobs for thousands of the mountaineers. I mean the setting up of a network of traditional handicraft industries such as embroidery, weaving, carving, etc. It is necessary to develop and upgrade various forms of employment (the state, stock holding, cooperative, or custom production); and various organizational forms (part time jobs, work at home, etc.). [Krasnodemskyy] The Carpathians have always attracted tourists by Gutsul handicraft industries and fresh air. People, including schoolchildren and students, came to Kosov, Vorokhta, Yaremcha, Kryvorivnya to breathe fresh air. They are still coming today. However, my colleague-journalist returned from Yasinya and said regretfully: Mountain skiing bases are almost empty. [Shpek] It could be explained by climbing prices for rest there. In addition, the ecological situation in the Carpathian region leaves much to be desired. By all means, it is not as dangerous as in the Transdniester region or Donbass, but we have problems. According to the degree of the air pollution, our region ranks fourth in the state, but our soil is likely to be the most contaminated with pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Felling trees is harmful to our nature in general and recreation zones in particular. Mountains become bald and this leads to an increase in landslides, and floods in the mountainous rivers.... All this triggers changes in the microclimate. As a result, the health-giving properties of our recreation zone decrease. [Krasnodemskyy] Therefore, it is necessary to urgently formulate an ecological policy on a principally new basis. [Shpek] You are right, but we should be realistic. Our activities should be based on the objective estimation of our real chances. For example, the cardinal resolution of ecological problems could be achieved only on the basis of new technological and structural changes in the economy. This demands enormous assets and much time. We have neither the first, nor the second. Nonetheless, we should pay attention to some other factors. Only the resolution of specific problems could regulate the mechanisms and methods ensuring an efficient nature protecting policy. If done otherwise, the processes can go out of control, and we cannot allow this to happen. [Krasnodemskyy] What should be done in the nearest future to protect the natural resources of the Carpathians? [Shpek] We will shift from a policy of eliminating results of pollution to the preventive activities, and we will fight with reasons and not with consequences. We should check out the ecological safety of production sites, means of communication, etc. to minimize the chances of ecological accidents. We should eliminate conflicts between businesses and ecology and ensure their close cooperation. We should always remember that economic reforms should improve the ecological situation, not worsen it. [Krasnodemskyy] The region which we are speaking about has the densest network of historic and cultural monuments in Ukraine. It is just enough to recollect that around 7,000 places of interest -- that is 14 percent of all Ukrainian historic and cultural heritage -- are protected by the state. Here, in the Carpathians, the rich spiritual culture -- original customs and rites, local household chores, wooden churches and houses of Gutsuls, Boysks, Lemsks -- has been preserved. Is it not for these very reasons that Gnat Khodkevich, the founder of the Gutsul theater and the author of one of the most wonderful plays about the Gutsuls reminisced: "I opened my mouth in admiration when I came to the Gutsul region and continued living there with my mouth open for the next six years." [Shpek] People who come to the Carpathians are fascinated by its nature, colorful landscapes, and its spirit of freedom. Mountainous vicinities of Krinorivni where Ukrainian cultural leaders used to walk, the art of Kosov craftsmen, Kosmach poems and embroidery, where, according to epics, legendary Dovbush died -- all this should be properly kept, alive in our memory and soul, and be actively used for the development of our state. Until now, the Carpathians have been compared with our neighbors -- Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia -- as having an insufficient amount of museums. Therefore, at first, we should open a museum of specific trades which are characteristic to our region; a museum of local lore, history and economy; an ethnographic, art, and memorial museum. Castles, palaces, ancient buildings of an exquisite European style which are being irrationally used now, could house these museums. It is necessary to set up well-equipped restoration shops in oblast centers and their branches in other regional towns and rayons to restore historic and cultural heritage -- ancient palaces, cultural buildings, and old quarters of our cities. If, for example, this is done in Kosov and Kolomyya, it will increase the opportunities for restoration work several times over.
