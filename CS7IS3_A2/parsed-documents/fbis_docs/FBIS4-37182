FBIS4-37182 "drnes117_l_94001" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Netanyahu Reportedly Met With Hasan in May Netanyahu Reportedly Met With Hasan in May TA1606180194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 16 Jun 94 TA1606180194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 16 Jun 94 Hebrew BFN [Discussion between anchor Hayim Yavin and party affairs correspondent Menashe Raz in the Tel Aviv studio -- live] [Text] [Yavin] Several weeks ago, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu met with Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan in London. What were the circumstances of the meeting? Who initiated it? [Raz] In fact, the meeting was initiated by both sides. It took place following several meetings and discussions, which culminated in the idea of getting Likud Chairman Netanyahu and Prince Hasan together. [Yavin] Where was the meeting held? [Raz] It took place at a private residence in London in early May. Netanyahu left Israel and returned on the same day. The meeting lasted several hours. In the meeting, Netanyahu made it clear to Prince Hasan that the Likud supports the government's policy regarding a peace agreement with Jordan. The Likud has no problem with a peace arrangement between Israel and Jordan. After he returned to Israel, Netanyahu briefed Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the meeting. [Yavin] Has Netanyahu confirmed the report? [Raz] No. He refused to discuss the issue and, in fact, has neither denied nor confirmed the report. [Yavin] Nonetheless, by holding the meeting and making it public, Netanyahu is making a statement, is he not? [Raz] Yes. I would say that Netanyahu is seeking to somewhat improve his image. On the local political map, he is considered a hawkish rightist. He hopes to convey the message: If and when I become Israeli prime minister, I will work more along the central lines of the Israeli political map. Netanyahu is also trying to deliver a message on the domestic level. He wants to appear as if he is representing the state. To date, he has been an outspoken critic of the government's peace policy. Quite a few of his associates have told him that he should seek some way to somehow support some component of the peace process. At the time, they discussed possible Likud support for the agreement on Gaza; however, as will be recalled, after the Oslo agreement was signed, Netanyahu attacked the entire agreement. Therefore, I assume that one of the main motivations for this meeting was an attempt to show his domestic audience that he is acting like a statesman. [Yavin] You said that Netanyahu briefed the prime minister. Did he also brief the Likud members? [Raz] The only ones in the Likud who know of it are the very few who were involved in the contacts prior to the meeting, as well as several to whom he reported about it.
