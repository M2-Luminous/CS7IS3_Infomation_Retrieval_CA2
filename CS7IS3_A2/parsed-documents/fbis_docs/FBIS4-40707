The press center's statement in this connection stresses that the level of knowledge, demonstrated by the first group of the institute's officer graduates in the course of working for their diplomas, was high. Three of them were awarded both lieutenants' shoulder straps and golden medals, and another 29 received higher educational institution graduation diplomas with honors. Vice Admiral Mykola Klitnyy, state commission chairman and ex-chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, said that the quality of education at the institute has traditionally been high. In the two years that have passed since the reorganization of naval schools into the institute, the skills and professional knowledge of the professors and lecturers have not been lost. It is hard to add anything to Klitnyy's words. It is only possible to point out that the institute's Ukrainian status causes Black Sea Fleet officials to react in certain way, the press center's statement says. It is planned, incidentally, that 57 of the institute's graduates will serve in the Russian Navy.
