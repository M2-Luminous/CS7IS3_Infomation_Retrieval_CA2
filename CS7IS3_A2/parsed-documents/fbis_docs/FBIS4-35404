The letter expressed the House of Representatives' appreciation for the Security Council's positions and its concern about the protection of the independence and sovereignty of nations. It also expressed the hope that these stands will be further bolstered when the Security Council reviews the internal Yemeni developments that have to do with the essence of preserving its sovereignty, security, and independence in line with the Constitution and the laws in force. In its letter, the House of Representatives found it strange that the Security Council should address our internal issue by depending on wrong information and outside mediators, despite the fact that our country, an active UN member, has not filed a request with the council in this regard. The letter of the House of Representatives explained that Yemen -- land and man -- has experienced eternal unity in its history and culture. There are no ethnic or religious minorities in Yemen. Yemeni unity, achieved on 22 May 1990 and hailed by the Arabs and the world, is the unity of two political regimes, not two different peoples. The unity was achieved by peaceful and democratic means. The agreement on the proclamation of the Yemeni Republic and the Constitution of the unity states was signed by the two presidents of the two former regimes and endorsed by the two houses of parliaments in the former two parts. The letter notes that the first national consensus on unity was achieved when a public referendum was held on the Constitution of the unity state in 1990. International organizations attested to the integrity of this referendum. In the first unified parliamentary elections on 27 April 1993, more than 22 political parties and organizations, as well as independents, took part. The entire world attested to the integrity of the elections. All international organizations and commissions that care about human rights, primarily the United Nations and the five Security Council permanent member states, blessed these elections. Also, all political parties, including the Socialist Party, recognized the results of the elections. After the elections, Yemen moved from the legitimacy of merger through political agreement to the legitimacy of unity through the constitutional and legitimate institutions. Thus, regional representation was canceled when the first unified House of Representatives convened on 12 May 1993, in accordance with the Constitution that stipulates that the members of the House of Representatives represent the entire people and look after public interests, and not individuals. The letter of the House of Representatives to the UN secretary general and the president and members of the UN Security Council added: Following the elections, the Republic of Yemen entered a new experiment in government. A coalition government was formed, including the three major political parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the Socialist Party. This coalition adopted a document that was called the Document of Government Coalition. It asserted an adherence to national principles, including the preservation of unity as a question of sovereignty that is not to be infringed upon. The unity state adhered to democratic practice in accordance with political pluralism and freedom of expression. In this state, different views and programs were aired in the service of society in line with modern foundations, based on total respect for human rights. In its letter, the House of Representatives further explained the constitutional status of the formation of the unity state and its institutions. It then reviewed attempts to circumvent constitutional legitimacy and democracy in the country and undermine the unity state by a rebellious gang that defied law and order and chose violence by exploding the military situation to implement its scheme that aims at fragmenting unity and undermining the nation's determination. The letter noted that when this gang found that the outcome of the 27 April elections was not in its favor and did not advance its fortunes to occupy top posts in power, they started to contemplate a coup against constitutional legitimacy by creating crises and triggering explosions and assassinations and disrupting security. Then, they caused the political and economic situation to become tense and confused democracy by setting new conditions and demands with the aim of canceling constitutional legitimacy. The leader of the rebels, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, refused to submit to the Constitution and the laws and regulations of the country as a vice chairman of the unity state, so he did not complete the constitutional measures. This is in addition to hindering the work of the state institutions through their participation in power by staying in Aden, the commercial and economic capital, and their sabotage of these institutions. Despite all of the above, the legitimate authority of the country adhered to dialogue, with the participation of national forces and political parties and organizations. As a result of this dialogue, an accord document was signed in Amman. However, no sooner had the document been signed than the rebels exploded the military situation in Abyan. The chapters of the conspiracy reached the peak on 21 May 1994 when al-Bid declared secession in a serious, illegitimate precedent. Al-Bid wanted to form a state from a homeland that has a unified origin, culture, creed, history, and language. The letter added that the House deems this declaration null and illegitimate, based on Article 1 of the Constitution of the Yemeni Republic. Based on this Article, the House of Representatives deems any recognition of this secessionist declaration by any side, state, or organization as an attack on the Yemeni people's right of national unionist belonging. In its letter, the House of Representatives also asked the UN secretary general and the president and members of the Security Council to deal with what is happening in our country as an internal affair in line with Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter and to reject any request to discuss the Yemeni issue unless it is filed by the Government of the Yemeni Republic. The letter also asked the UN secretary general and the president and members of the Security Council to pressure the member states of the United Nations and the Security Council which seek to have a foothold regarding what is happening in Yemen so as not to interfere in our country's internal affairs because this would further complicate the situation and prolong the war.
