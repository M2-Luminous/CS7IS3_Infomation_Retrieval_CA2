The company signed a contract worth 600 million US dollars on June 7 for the supply of 18 MiG-29 fighter planes to Malaysia. Chumachenko said that the two countries would, "after a short breather," continue talks on a broad range of issues, which could include upgrading Malaysia's navy. He denied that Moscow had sold the fighters on the cheap. He said representatives from the Dementiyev Aviation and Industrial Association, which manufactures the aircraft, had been present at the talks and when the contract was signed and they would hardly have agreed to under-price their own products. The contract with Malaysia also provides for the supply of facilities to service the aircraft before the end of the year, training for staff, and spare parts both during and after the guarantee period runs out. Approximately 75 pct of the total cost of the contract will be paid off in hard currency, and the remainder in supplies of palm-oil for sale by Moscow to other countries. Rosvooruzhheniye, Russia's leading exporter and importer of arms and military hardware, was set up at the end of last year after a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
