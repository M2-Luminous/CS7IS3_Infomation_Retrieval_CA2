On the issue of sending Japanese personnel to participate in the work of the UN Protection Forces (UNPRO), which are currently conducting operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kakizawa said: "It will be difficult to do so at the moment, but we would like to study the issue over the medium-to-long-term." His comments indicated the government intends to consider plans to send Japanese personnel to participate in UN peacekeeping operations (PKO). In response, Akashi said: "We will continue to request deployment of Japanese personnel, but we would like the Japanese Government to avoid making hasty decisions and to study the issue from a broad perspective." Kakizawa then said Japan plans to send a delegation to participate in a meeting of the Council for the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Sarajevo to be held in Vienna on 24-25 May. He said Japan planned "to seriously consider whether it would be possible to offer wide-ranging cooperation." His remarks indicated that Japan also intends to actively support rehabilitation and reconstruction programs after peace has been restored in the region. Alluding to critical remarks made by some U.S. and European officials against Akashi, Kakizawa said: "I praise Mr. Akashi highly for preventing the situation from worsening and maintaining UN neutrality. I also support his way of doing things." Akashi said: "It is natural that there is criticism, so I do not mind that at all. I would like to continue securing UN neutrality."
