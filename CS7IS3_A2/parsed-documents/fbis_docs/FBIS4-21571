FBIS4-21571 "jptnd008___94046" JPRS-TND-94-008 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 1 April 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Report on Destruction of Chemical Weapons Arsenal Report on Destruction of Chemical Weapons Arsenal LD2403233194 LD2403233194 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carried a two-minute video report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's destruction of its chemical weapons. Peslyak began by recapping Russia's international commitment to destroy its chemical weapons and to discontinue their production. Archive footage was shown of the international convention on the destruction of chemical weapons. He then reported on the debate on this topic in the State Duma on 24 March. Peslyak said that the main problem was storage of the weapons until they could be destroyed. The video showed the Duma being addressed by Major General Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense troops of the Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand that we cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves. Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have. That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast." Peslyak said that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, identified by caption, who said: "The means of eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be decided upon. The sites where the destruction of the chemical weapons is to take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see from the hearing, the settling of these matters with local authorities and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running into considerable difficulties." Peslyak then pointed out that a factory in Chapayevsk equipped with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it could be used for destroying chemical weapons. Video showed the exterior and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped in plastic sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, he said. He also said that it was difficult to know just how much toxic material there was to be destroyed saying there could be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 tonnes." In addition to the factory, the video showed personnel in protective clothing working with munitions in the open, and rows of charred shells. An assortment of gas masks was also shown.
