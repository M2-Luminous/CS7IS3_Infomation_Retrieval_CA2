Noting that nuclear waste dumped into the East Sea of Korea by the atomic power stations of South Korea from 1986 to 1992 amounted to 11,000 trillion becquerels, or about 100,000 curies, the statement said: As a result, the East Sea of Korea has already turned into a "sea of death" and Ullung Island into the "second Bikini." Such anti-national criminal acts of the South Korean authorities have caused wholesale deaths of fishes and extermination of fishes, shellfishes and cultured sea products in the sea off Uljin, Wolsong and Kori where atomic power stations are situated. A diver's wife gave birth to a brain immature infant and many people are dying of incurable diseases of unknown origin after eating fishes caught in the sea. Our people are now eating radioactive materials and sleeping on the U.S. nuclear-powder keg which may explode at time, with their heads resting on pillows of nuclear waste from atomic power stations. The South Korean authorities have kept media from reporting about the release of radioactive materials from atomic power stations in a bid to cover up their crimes. Worse still, they unhesitatingly perpetrated such a treacherous act as concealing even the dumping of 900 tons of nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea by Russia with a hypocritical "investigation" in which they alleged "they could not find a sign of pollution." The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately make public the amount and kinds of nuclear waste dumpted into the sea and the dumping places, apologize to the whole nation and promptly stop such an act. If it continue dumping nuclear waste into the sea, it can by no means escape a stern judgement by the nation and mankind.
