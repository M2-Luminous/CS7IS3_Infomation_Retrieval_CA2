FR940523-2-00142 FR940523-2-00084 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 98␣/␣Monday, May 23, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Reimbursement for Costs of Remedial Action at Active Uranium and Thorium Processing Sites AGENCY: Office of Environmental Management, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of the acceptance of claims and the availability of funds for reimbursements in fiscal year 1994. SUMMARY: This Notice announces the Department of Energy's acceptance of initial claims and the availability of approximately $40.6 million in funds in fiscal year 1994 for reimbursements of certain costs of remedial action at eligible active uranium and thorium processing sites pursuant to Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Department of Energy anticipates that claims submitted by licensees in fiscal year 1994 will substantially exceed $40.6 million and would therefore be subject to prorated payment. DATES: The closing date for the submission of claims for reimbursement in fiscal year 1994 is July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Claims may be mailed to the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, 2155 Louisiana NE., suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM 87110. All claims should be addressed to the attention of Steven Hamp and sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Hamp, Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, (505) 845&hyph;4628. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy is issuing a final rule under 10 CFR Part 765 published elsewhere in this issue to implement the requirements of Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (sections 1001&hyph;1004 of Public Law 102&hyph;486, 42 U.S.C. 2296 et seq .) and to establish the procedures for eligible licensees to submit claims for reimbursement. Title X requires the Department of Energy to reimburse eligible uranium and thorium licensees for certain costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action incurred by licensees at active uranium and thorium processing sites to remediate byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States Government. To be reimbursable, costs of remedial action must be for work which is necessary to comply with applicable requirements of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 or, where appropriate, with requirements established by a state pursuant to a discontinuance agreement under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021). Claims for reimbursement of costs of remedial action must be supported by reasonable documentation as determined by the Department of Energy in accordance with 10 CFR part 765. Section 1001(b)(2) of the Act limits the amount of reimbursement to any one licensee of an active uranium mill tailings site to an amount not to exceed $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of dry short tons of byproduct material located at the site on October 24, 1992, and generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Total reimbursement, in the aggregate, for work performed at the active uranium sites shall not exceed $270 million, as adjusted for inflation. Total reimbursement for work performed at the active thorium processing site shall not exceed $40 million, as adjusted for inflation, and is limited to costs incurred for offsite disposal. Funds for the reimbursements will be provided from the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund established at the United States Department of Treasury pursuant to section 1801 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2297g). Payment or obligation of funds shall be subject to the requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341). Authority: Section 1001&hyph;1004 of Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776 (42 U.S.C. 2296a et seq. ) Issued in Washington, DC, on this 10th day of May, 1994. Thomas P. Grumbly, Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management.
