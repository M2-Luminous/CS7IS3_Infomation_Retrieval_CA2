FR940617-0-00002 FR940617-0-00001 MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD 5 CFR Part 1201 Practices and Procedures AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending its practices and procedures by extending the regulatory time limits for filing initial appeals, class action appeals, motions for attorney fees, initial appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination, and requests to review final decision under negotiated grievance procedures. The time limit for filing appeals with the Federal courts, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is currently greater than that of the Board. This change brings the Board's practices and procedures more in line with those entities and will also have the effect of making the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees. DATES: Effective June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board, (202) 653&hyph;7200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This change in the Board's practices and procedures came about as a result of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, requiring agencies to ensure that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. The Board's review found that changing the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent with the legal and regulatory time limits for filing with the Federal Courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both of which can potentially review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed change will help to eliminate possible confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board. The Board announced this change as a proposed rule at 59 FR 18764, April 20, 1994, and asked for comments. The Board received 29 comments from agency and union representatives. Twenty-two were in favor of or not opposed to the proposed amendments. There was significantly more support for the proposed amendments than opposition. While some commenters suggested alternatives to the proposed regulations, the Board has considered these suggestions and determined not to adopt them. The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1201 Administrative practice and procedure, Civil Rights, Government employees.
