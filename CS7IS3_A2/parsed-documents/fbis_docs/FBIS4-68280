I would remind you that initially the primarily working visit by Guntis Ulmanis was planned for 22 April. It was planned during the visit for the presidents of the two states to ratify a treaty and three agreements previously reached on the withdrawal of the troops and social protection for military pensioners. A 5 September order from the President of the Russian Federation on the establishment of Russian military bases within the CIS countries and the Republic of Latvia, however, (for "technical" errors for which Latvia apologized), provided the excuse for national radicals in the Latvian Sejm to postpone the visit by Ulmanis to Moscow and to remove from the package of accords the agreements on social protection for military pensioners. And the visit by the leader of the Baltic republic did not become a reality until 30 April, following coordination of a protocol on a previously initialed agreement on social protection for Russian military pensioners residing in Latvia. The protocol defines the obligations of the sides to establish social conditions which would promote the voluntary resettlement of military pensioners and their families from Latvia. The main document signed by the presidents of the two countries in the Kremlin is a treaty on the terms, the schedule and the procedure for withdrawing the armed forces of the Russian Federation from the territory of Latvia and their legal status during the period of withdrawal, an inseparable part of which are the Agreement on the Legal Status of the Skrunda Radar Station During the Period of Its Temporary Operation and Dismantling, an agreement between the governments on social protection for military personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, the Border Troops and their families temporarily residing within the territory of Latvia and their complete withdrawal, as well as an Agreement on Protection for Military Pensioners of the Russian Federation and Their Families Residing on the territory of the Republic of Latvia. The treaty setting the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia for 31 August 1994, which includes 15 articles, underscores the fact that "the complete withdrawal of the armed forces of the Russian Federation embraces all persons belonging to the armed forces of the Russian Federation, their families and real property." The document states that "the withdrawal of individual subunits of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the vacation and transfer of facilities are being conducted on schedule." The treaty is subject to ratification by the parliaments of both states. Its interim application will begin the day the ratification certifications are exchanged. Boris Yeltsin has called the visit by Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic of Latvia, "historic." He announced following the signing ceremony for the Russian-Latvian documents that "they were worked out with the complete agreement of the two sides." In the talks the Russian head of state directed special attention to the accord reached by the presidents of the two countries and the fact that "Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will make a visit to Riga," during which Russian-Latvian economic cooperation will be expanded considerably. Assessing the package of documents signed during the talks, Guntis Ulmanis noted that he regards them "as an integral whole, as a sad necessity bequeathed to us by history."
