At an aktiv meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the president introduced Yuriy Lavrinenko, the new head of the oblast administration. Subsequently the president arrived in Semipalatinsk where he also introduced to the aktiv the newly appointed head of the oblast administration, Galymzhan Zhakiyanov. Speaking at these meetings, Nursultan Nazarbayev discussed the current economic situation in the republic. As is known, it is complex and, as the head of state stressed, in order to overcome the situation sooner we should tighten procedures for the allocation of credit to enterprises and proceed solely from the real financial potential in resolving all issues. Incidentally, the ways to overcome the crisis were outlined to the fullest in the president's presentation at a session of the Supreme Council and his message to members of parliament. All residents of Kazakhstan should know the essence of these ways, as well as the position of the republic leadership with regard to solving domestic problems in order to avoid idle talk of which there is frequently no dearth precisely because the citizens are poorly informed. Nursultan Nazarbayev gave the following example. Disabled front-line veterans received preferences under 19 provisions. Their combined monetary equivalent came to 300 tenge. In view of this, the decision was made to replace numerous preferences that by then were hard to figure out with the raising of retirement benefits of this particular category of the population by 330 tenge in order to provide it with targeted social protection. After all, not only veterans but also members of their families took advantage of the preferences. Was this fair? Revisiting economic problems, the president noted that unprofitable enterprises are a heavy burden for the economy to shoulder. All of them will soon be declared bankrupt. It is more advantageous for the state to pay unemployment benefits upon the closure of such production facilities than to subsidize them. Getting rid of the continuously unprofitable enterprises will make it possible to stop the growth of inflation and invigorate foreign investment in the economy of the republic. The head of state recalled that on 1 May the residents of Ust-Kamenogorsk held a rally at which demands to return to life as it used to be were aired. However, there is no return to such life, and this is an objective fact. We must proceed more rapidly toward market relations, stressed Nursultan Nazarbayev, and grant to the people the freedom to labor for their own benefit wherever and however they see fit. However, the state will not reduce its care for retirees, handicapped, and the employees of budget-financed institutions. Others should make a living themselves. Nobody will sustain parasitism and laziness. This is the main law of a market economy. We are now traveling along the path that the entire civilized world has covered, and we will only be able to achieve prosperity and welfare if we do not turn off this path. The president paid special attention to ensuring stability in our society in the absence of which favorable changes are impossible. To maintain stability, it is necessary to ensure the equality of all citizens and a balanced cadre policy proceeding from the peculiarities of regions. It is important not to give in to provocations that are capable of causing internal strife and to strictly proceed from the law on pressing criminal charges against individuals fueling interethnic discord. Nursultan Nazarbayev also noted that there are those who indiscriminately pick on the activities of Kazakhstan's leadership. However, this is populism pure and simple. Let them propose alternative ways to overcome the existing situation. It is as easy as can be to exploit existing difficulties. The president answered frankly numerous questions from participants in the oblast aktiv meetings, including the most sharply worded questions.
