Janet was installed in the early 1980s, currently serves about 50,000 terminals and offers access to electronic mail services around the world. This system is now being improved by means of the most modern optical waveguide technology so that in addition to its existing function as a news transmission medium it will also function as a future-oriented communications structure for the academic community. The new improved network by the name of Super-Janet is needed to support certain teaching and research activities. In addition to language transmission, they also require rapid data, image and video transmission. Super-Janet will not replace the existing network but expand it. Powerful Overlay Network The new network will not radically change the type and way in which scientists access decentralized data bases and routinely communicate by E-mail with their colleagues all over the world. But it will create a significantly more powerful overlay network, to which gradually more and more facilities all over the country will be connected. After the development of similar networks in other countries, new perspectives will open up on this level as well. Dr. Robert Cooper, who heads the project for the Science and Engineering Research Council/Universities Funding Council Joint Network Team, regards Super-Janet as "singular in Europe." In explaining the pioneering role of the new network, he adds that it involves a test system for the demanding academic community. The British Universities Funding Council (UFC) awarded the contract, worth 18 million pounds over a period of four years, to British Telecom (BT). In the first phase data centers at the Universities of Cambridge and Manchester, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, University College London (UCL), at Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh will be interconnected. In the course of 1993/94 about 50 locations will be connected to the network. Additional ones will follow, according to the availability of the necessary funds. The network concept will be realized by means of the latest broadband technology. Most communications opportunities are based on the Switched Multimegambit Data Service Definition (SMDS) by BT. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is to be used as a central network technology, which together with new broadband transmission methods (Distributed Queue Dual Bus, DQDB, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode, ATM) will offer a maximum of transmission opportunities. Dr. Alan Rudge, head of BT's research and procurement division, who is responsible for all the company's technical research work, stresses that the broadband transmission platform used to interconnect the locations is just as important for the industry as for government offices and academics: "The Super-Janet order enables BT, together with the universities, to develop new applications which sooner or later will bring the companies a competitive advantage." Dr. Rudge further refers to the necessity of promoting the image of "broadband as the standard." According to his information, BT is proposing to the industry that it should participate in joint projects with the suppliers in order to offer these facilities. A critical mass is needed in order to stimulate confidence. BT therefore expects that the availability of the network will have a decisive "trigger function." Broad Application Range Transmission of visual output data from extensive, fluid-dynamic calculations executed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near London on a Cray YMP supercomputer to Imperial College in London is one potential technical application. Since the enormous amounts of data produced can only be processed by the user if they are present in image form--often with color and animation--Super-Janet offers the advantage that the researchers no longer personally have to go to the Rutherford laboratory. The Cyclotron Unit of the MRC (Medical Research Council) at Hammersmith Hospital in London also have several facilities for producing pictures of the brain, which are of interest to researchers in other places. In the pilot project these pictures are transmitted for analysis from Hammersmith Hospital to the psychiatric departments of the University of Edinburgh and the University College London as well as for processing by the supercomputer center at the University of Edinburgh. University College London has the equipment for teaching surgery by means of interactive video. For that reason a proposal was made to carry out a series of surgical demonstrations between the UCL and the other centers which are able to support interactive activities. These can be for example surgical demonstrations from the operating room, clinical demonstrations in the lecture room, discussions between surgical specialists, joint preparation of video-teaching material and investigation of possibilities to use existing teaching materials for self-study in a decentralized teaching environment. Among the applications in the field of information services are preparation of archival documents and a test project for an electronic magazine, as well as a series of applications which require rapid transfer of voluminous data from one place to another. The former application is to demonstrate inquiry for and preparation of documents with the network. At least seven universities will participate in order ultimately to establish a regular service between the locations. This method is more economical than the existing slow and personnel-intensive borrowing agreements between the libraries. Super-Janet will enable a multitude of projects--in the most varied disciplines--which are being postponed at this time for lack of a suitable fast network. Furthermore, with every successful application the advantages of Super-Janet are becoming noticed by an increasingly larger circle of users.
