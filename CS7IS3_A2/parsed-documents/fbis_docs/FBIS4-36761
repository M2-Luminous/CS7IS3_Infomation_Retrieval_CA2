[Rabin] Even before the visit, I knew that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] deployment is designed to implement the commitments we made in the agreement and to create the tools for cooperation, to the extent possible, with the Palestinian elements in Jericho. My impression -- and this is an impression based on a visit of several hours -- is that the deployment and the tools for cooperation are working, but they are still in their very initial stages. Things become apparent as we go along. So far, the parties are showing goodwill in order to find solutions to some of the problems. Time will tell and will test the other side's ability to implement everything it undertook in the framework of the Gaza and Jericho First agreement. [Raz] Are they keeping the agreement? [Rabin] Yes, as far as joint patrols and coordination of activity is concerned. There are certainly things that still need improvement here and there, and I will not go into detail. [IDF Radio's Golan Yokhpaz] Is it clear when PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the region? [Rabin] I do not know. According to the Cairo agreement, he is entitled to come here. Here, in Jericho, is where the seat of the Palestinian Authority -- or part of it, with some other part in Gaza --, will be. Naturally, if he wishes to stay here, it is his prerogative. [Israel Television New Channel 2's Rina Matzliah] Is an open and public meeting between yourself and Jordanian King Husayn to be expected any time soon? [Rabin] I do not know of any such meeting in the future. [Matzliah] Is there news regarding the contacts with Syria? [Rabin] Currently, there are no contacts with Syria. Regrettably, the contacts with Syria -- past, present, and future -- are conducted only through the United States. I do not know for certain whether or when the U.S. secretary of state will arrive in Israel. [Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Have you received any request from the PLO chairman for financial aid for the autonomy, and how will you respond to such a request? [Rabin] Regarding financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, last week the donor countries met and decided to unfreeze over $40 million for the June-August period. This money was provided to allow the Authority to function in terms of paying salaries and the like. This comes in addition to the $5 million the United States gave them to pay the salaries of the Palestinians in uniform -- the police, with all its formations and uniforms -- for this month. [YEDI'OT AHARONOT's Roni Shaqed] Mr. Prime Minister, the issue of the collaborators has not yet been settled. The Palestinians are still arresting collaborators and have announced that they will impose death sentences on those found guilty of murdering collaborators [as heard]. Is this not a violation of the agreement? [Rabin] Regarding the second part of your question, it is their decision to make. Regarding the pursuit of collaborators, it does not correspond with the agreement. From this, we will draw conclusions pertaining to the issue of the Palestinian prisoners. [Israel Television Channel 1 in Arabic's Yoni Ben-Menahem] Mr. Prime Minister, the Palestinians claim that you have not yet decided about the fate of the 200 prisoners who were released here last Friday. Will they be allowed to return to their homes in Judaea and Samaria? Have you made a decision on this? On the same note, how do you view the fact that many fugitives have found refuge in Jericho and are hiding in the autonomous district? [Rabin] As for the first part, we agreed that some of the prisoners who have not yet completed serving their sentences will be moved here. It is their duty to make the effort to keep them here, in Jericho. We will do all we can, provided we have the necessary means, to prevent them from reaching their homes. It is true that several fugitives from Judaea and Samaria have apparently arrived in Jericho. We will deal with this, and we will see what the results are. [Ben-Menahem] Does the agreement commit them to turn the fugitives over to us? [Rabin] I do not remember the exact details. [Unidentified correspondent] If the PLO leader comes, will he be allowed to pray in Jerusalem? [Rabin] At the moment, I do not know when his arrival in Jericho, which has been agreed on, will take place. I will answer hypothetical questions on what would happen should someone ask to do this, that, or the other when they are no longer hypothetical. [Matzliah] Sir, you have just met with the residents of the settlement of Na'ama, who have been demonstrating since last night at the border fence. Did you promise them that you will deal with their economic distress? [Rabin] I met with representatives of the settlers here. Several problems were raised, the main part of which involves agricultural issues. Last winter was warm. This had an impact on farming not only in the Jordan Rift Valley but also in many parts of the State of Israel, such as the northern apple and peach orchards. The Agriculture Ministry is dealing with this issue on a nationwide scope. A more acute problem arose here, compared with the economic distress of the other settlers in the valley. Na'ama representatives claim their situation is more serious. They raised several demands, and I promised them an answer within two days.
