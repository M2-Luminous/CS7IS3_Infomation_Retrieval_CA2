A note of protest was handed to him in connection with the illegitimate actions of the Russian survey vessel Cheleken in the vicinity of Odessa. On the night of 8-9 April, in gross violation of international law, it resorted to violence with the threat of arms and illegally seized hydrographic and navigational equipment belonging to Ukraine. The fact that people's lives were endangered is grounds to qualify these actions of the command of the Russian vessel as an international terrorist act. It was only due to the balanced stand of the Ukrainian guard that bloodshed was prevented. The irony of this bandit action deserves special attention. It was carried out on the eve of the celebrations in connection with the 50th anniversary of Odessa's liberation from the German fascist invaders. The Ukrainian side demands that the seized property of Ukraine be returned immediately and those guilty be severely punished.
