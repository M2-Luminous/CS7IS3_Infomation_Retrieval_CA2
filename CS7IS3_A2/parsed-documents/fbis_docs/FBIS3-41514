This science, which is only about a decade old, involves research into natural resources, and changes of climate and environment, and forecasting and prevention of geological disasters. China's key laboratory for gas geochemistry was set up at the Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province in 1985. It was opened to foreign scientists in 1991. Since then, Chinese scientists have made great progress in research into the storage and transformation of oil and gas, changes of global climate and environment, and seismic activities. Since 1991 the laboratory has completed 792 major research projects designated by the state, related state ministries and Gansu Province. Chinese scientists at the lab have put forward a new theory of ``multi-sources and continuous formation in different stages'' for the formation of natural gas. Meanwhile, they have made new progress in the study of geological structure, volcanoes and earthquakes by using helium isotopes. They have also developed a series of new technologies and methods for the exploration of oil and gas, which have made great contributions to the development of the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. At a state project appraisal meeting, some well-known scholars described the lab as a showcase of China's study of gas geochemistry, calling it an international center of the science. The lab has academic exchanges and cooperation with many countries and regions, including Germany, the United States, Sweden, Russia, Japan and Italy.
