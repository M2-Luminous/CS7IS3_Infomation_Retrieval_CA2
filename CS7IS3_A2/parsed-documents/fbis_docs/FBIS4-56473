According to several sources, this was the first general strike in the country in 36 years. The three labor federations, CNT [National Workers Federation], CUT [United Workers Trade Union Federation], and CPT [Paraguayan Confederation of Workers], said the strike was "a total success," adding that the measure was respected by 80 to 85 percent of unionized workers and employees. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta, and Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales said the strike was a "total failure." Workers started mobilizing on the night of 1 May. Demonstrations became more serious during the morning when unionized workers occupied strategic points of access to the capital, Ciudad del Este, and Hernandarias, among other crossroads. According to spokesmen for public transport companies, bus drivers halted most of the bus service in the capital and Ciudad del Este around midmorning because demonstrators were attacking buses. The Army moved tanks from their base in Cerrito to the 1st Corp barracks. An armored helicopter overflew highways entering the capital and over Calle Ultima, alarming the population for a couple of hours. Student Sebastian Larrosa was shot in the head and died instantly during the blockade and march on Highway 3, near Tacuara, some 200 km north of Asuncion, yesterday morning. ABC COLOR journalist Mariano Godoy was wounded in the back by another shot during the same demonstration. Police Superintendent Pablo Villar, Public Relations Director, confirmed the death of the student following a clash with security forces. He also reported that six policemen were wounded during the clash. Peasants were dispersed with tear gas. Interior Minister Carlos Podesta emphasized that the peasant demonstrators used guns against the police first. NOTICIAS reporter Celso Aguilera witnessed the incident and told radio stations that two peasant demonstrators were wounded in the forehead and the right arm, respectively. Aguilera said: "An ABC COLOR colleague and I mingled with the peasants to take pictures but I withdrew from the area when I saw the police were going to use force to repress the demonstration. I saw the police turning their weapons on the peasants." Police Superintendent Villar said four policemen were wounded in the capital. In Ciudad del Este, striking workers demonstrated through the city center and blockaded streets until they were repressed by the police. ABC COLOR, NOTICIAS, and ULTIMA HORA reporters and photographers were hit and bruised during the repression. Some 500 strikers gathered in Pedro Juan Caballero. Liberal Party Mayor Filemon Valdez criticized them for their lack of numbers. In Encarnacion, the strike was 60 percent effective but there was no violence. Transport Vice Minister Juan Wenninger said some 200 buses were damaged by stones thrown by demonstrators, adding that passengers were injured by flying glass. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, speaking in Uberaba, Brazil, where he is participating in a cattle fair, said: "The strike was a failure." According to the Federation For Production, Industry, and Trade (Feprinco) the strike was 50 percent effective. Early on 2 May, students who joined the strike burned tires on Eusebio Ayala Avenue, outside the Asuncion National University university campus. Army Communications Director Colonel Carlos Medina issued a message around noon yesterday saying that the Armed Forces were ready to support the police if they were overpowered by demonstrators. The police fired into the air and used water cannons against demonstrators who tried to prevent the movement of vehicles in various points of access to the capital. Buses practically stopped operating after the initial confrontations. CUT President Alan Flores asked workers demonstrating on Calle Ultima to move to the Fetraban [Bank Workers Federation] headquarters for an afternoon rally once the news of the peasant's death and the wounded in Tacuara became known. Flores characterize Wasmosy's government as "fascist" after witnessing what he thought was excessive police violence. "Only the totalitarian minds of people who understand state terrorism can accept the shooting of a fellow worker for the simple act of demonstrating," Flores said. Secretary General Eduardo Ojeda said he regretted the incidents, adding that the protest was organized "to dignify the working class." Paraguayan Industrial Union President Arturo Jara Avelli blamed the violence on strikers and characterized their leaders as "union terrorists." Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone reported that commercial activities dropped to 60 percent of usual levels. He added, however, that 90 percent of shops and industries opened their doors. Most parents in the capital and the interior of the country preferred not to send their children to school to avoid the risk of violence or for lack of transportation.
