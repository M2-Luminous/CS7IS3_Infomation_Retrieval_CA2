FR941220-0-00084 FR941220-0-00014 The Department proposed that employers be required to identify (on the LCA) the prevailing wage rate and the source utilized to obtain the wage information. This would impose no additional burden on an employer acting in compliance with the program's requirements and would provide additional impetus for compliance by those employers who might not properly determine the prevailing wage prior to filing the LCA. ETA would continue to certify an LCA where all items on the LCA have been completed and information submitted on the form is not obviously inaccurate. However, an LCA which fails to contain this additional information or which indicates a prevailing wage date source not consistent with regulatory requirements would be rejected. Forty-four commenters specifically addressed this issue: 31 opposing the proposal and 13 supporting it. Generally, opposition was based on the commenters' concern that ETA would reject LCA's more frequently and/or would refer the LCA to ESA which would initiate an investigation. Eighteen representatives of educational institutions, the most frequent commenters on this issue, advocated a check-off system whereby the employer merely would check whether its prevailing wage source was a SESA determination, independent authoritative source, or another legitimate source of information. The Department has considered fully the views of the commenters and has reviewed the experience and information obtained through the program. The Department is modifying the proposed form to incorporate the suggestions of commenters to some extent. The form will provide that if the employer obtains a prevailing wage rate from a SESA, the employer may check the box for SESA and enter the prevailing wage rate obtained. When the prevailing wage rate is obtained from any other source, the employer must enter the identity of the source and the wage rate. Some commenters have expressed concern regarding this change in apprehension that there will be a greater rejection rate of LCAs on the part of ETA. ETA will continue to follow the guidance of the statute and the regulation and will not reject an LCA unless there are obvious omissions or errors. Of course if the employer fails to enter the identity of the source of a prevailing wage rate, or enters a source that is obviously not an acceptable source, ETA will reject the LCA. d. LCA Validity Period (See ยง XXXX .750(a).) Pursuant to section 214(g)(4) of the Act, the period of authorized admission as an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant may not exceed 6 years. Section XXXX .750 of the interim final H&hyph;1B regulations published at 57 FR 1316 (January 13, 1992) provides that a certified labor condition application shall be valid for the period of employment indicated on Form ETA 9035; in no event can the validity period of a labor condition application (LCA) exceed 6 years. However, the INS's regulations, at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(B) ( 1 ) and ( 3 ), limit the validity of a certified petition to 3 years or the expiration of the validity period of the labor condition application, whichever comes sooner. The Department proposed to bring the validity period of LCA's into conformity with INS's regulations by reducing the validity period of a labor condition application from 6 years to 3 years. The validity period would begin with the starting date entered by the employer in the ``Period of Employment'' section of Item 7 on the LCA or the date ETA certifies the LCA, whichever is later. Any LCA previously filed with and certified by ETA, however, would remain valid for up to six years or the ending date of employment as certified. Thirty commenters addressed this issue_16 opposing the proposal (primarily businesses and attorneys) and 14 advocating the proposal (primarily educational institutions and State governments). Trade associations were divided_4 pro and 4 con. Those opposing the proposal generally expressed concerns that there would be too much paperwork, that the proposal was burdensome, and that the proposal would hamper valid users. Several of those supporting the proposal expressed the view that the LCA should not be valid for more than 1 year. While the Department is mindful of the concerns expressed by commenters opposed to the proposal, the need for uniformity in the DOL and INS administration of the program and avoidance of confusion among H&hyph;1B employers and nonimmigrants outweigh any potential burdens. Therefore, the Department is promulgating this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM. This proposal, in conjunction with the deletion of the prevailing wage update provision, should reduce the burden on employers by providing a consistent timetable for DOL and INS filing requirements. e. Strike-Lockout (See ยง XXXX .733(a)(1).) Section 212(n)(1)(B) of the INA requires that an employer seeking to hire H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants shall file an application with the Secretary stating that ``[t]here is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place of employment.'' The Department's interim final H&hyph;1B regulations at ยง XXXX .730(g) provide that: [A]n employer seeking to employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants shall state on Form ETA 9035 that there is not at that time a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place of employment. A strike or lockout which occurs after the labor condition application is filed by the employer with DOL is covered by INS regulations at new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17). The Department became aware that this regulatory provision did not address the potentially abusive situation in which an employer with a certified labor condition application could petition for additional H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in the event of a labor dispute subsequent to the filing and certification of the application, and thus use H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to break a strike or to weaken the bargaining position of U.S. workers. Such use of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to weaken U.S. workers' bargaining position contrary to the clear intent of the law could be achieved by employers hiring H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants directly or obtaining such workers from job contractors. Therefore, to prevent this potential abuse, the Department proposed to amend the regulations to prohibit an employer from using a certified labor condition application to file visa petitions with INS for an occupation in which a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute occurs at the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's worksite.
