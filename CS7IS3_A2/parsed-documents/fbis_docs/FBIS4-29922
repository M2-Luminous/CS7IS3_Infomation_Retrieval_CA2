Each time an important task was raised in socialist economic construction, he indicated the path to victory by laying down an outstanding economic strategy and policy and an appropriate slogan. Under his distinguished leadership, our people have successfully fulfilled a series of long-range plans and increased still further the might of the independent national economy of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work in the teeth of economic blockade and continued military provocations of the allied forces of imperialism. Under his tested guidance, the line of socialist cultural construction has been implemented successfully and a great heyday of literature and art has come to this land. The dear leader has wisely guided the building of the revolutionary Armed Forces as a whole, thereby strengthening the People' Army into a cadre, modern steel-like army each one of which is a match for a hundred foes and turning our country into a powerful country self-reliant in defence where all people are armed and the whole territory is fortified. The dear leader with his outstanding wisdom and wise guidance has courageously led the struggle for national reunification, putting the enemy on the defensive, and strengthened militant solidarity with the revolutionary parties and peoples of the world under the banner of independence, peace and friendship, making an immortal contribution to mankind's cause of anti-imperialist independence, the cause of socialism, paying deep attention to the cause of rebuilding and developing the socialist movement on a new basis. The reporter called on the whole party and the entire people to resolutely defend and brilliantly accomplish the cause of socialism, bearing deep in mind the great national fortune of having the illustrious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head of the party and the revolution.
