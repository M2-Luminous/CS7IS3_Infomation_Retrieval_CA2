Enriquez added: "I have never asked for a definitive cease-fire in all areas where there is a guerrilla presence. I have spoken exclusively of the areas between Ixcan and Xabal Rivers, Quiche Department, where the refugees are returning and where the CPR [Communities of Resistant People] are displaced. " "If they (URNG) defend these people and want those who complain the Army has them surrounded to live in peace, they will, hopefully, show their political resolve with a cease-fire in all of the Ixcan area, because this would help the people join civilian life," Enriquez said.
