The last of these warnings was made just a few hours before the air strike. In response, the Russian embassy in Belgrade received firm promises that there would be no aggravation of the situation. But literally a few hours later Serb detachments mounted an offensive on Gorazde and occupied its southern part. As a result, the airplanes were forced to intervene after the lives of UN observers came under threat. [passage omitted] After Russian diplomacy averted the bombing of Serb positions in Sarajevo, a dangerous confidence in their own impunity manifested itself among the Bosnian Serb leaders, generals, and soldiers. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was presented by local propaganda as a Serb victory, and the fact that NATO did not mount air strikes was seen as a sign of weakness and hesitation. But now the Rubicon has been crossed. A fundamentally new situation has arisen, in which the Russian president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin will have to use all his influence and skill to continue his peace-brokering mission and the talks. He has now begun a meeting with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic, during which Moscow's views on what happened in eastern Bosnia will probably be set forth.
