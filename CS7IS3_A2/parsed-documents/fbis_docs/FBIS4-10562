The transfer will take place during a ceremony at which Minister of Defense Patricio Rojas and Air Force General Ramon Vega, commander in chief of the Chilean Air Force, will preside. These aircraft were purchased in accordance with a general agreement signed between this service branch and Aeronautic Constructions, S.A. (CASA), a Spanish aircraft factory, following the construction in Chile of the CASA 101 jet reactor aircraft that Group No. 1 currently has in service. Thanks to its special STOL [short takeoff and landing] characteristics, its usefulness on unprepared terrain, and the rear ramp designed for the handling of large cargo volume, these planes are an excellent tool for providing transport and aid when catastrophes occur in our country. These planes are destined for use by the Third Air Brigade based in Puerto Montt as replacements for the old Twin Otters. They will provide support services to the isolated localities in continental Chiloe and Regions XI and XII, as well as for the missions to the Antarctic. The CASA 212 aircraft have excellent navigation equipment and computers, a flight range of 2,000 kilometers, a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and a capacity of three tons of cargo, 26 passengers, or 12 patients on litters. Pedro Bermejo Marin, the Spanish ambassador to Chile, as well as representatives of the CASA enterprise, will attend the acceptance ceremony as special guests. As to the possible purchase of airplanes of the Mirage line announced by Minister of Defense Patricio Rojas, they are expected to be entirely operational by the end of this year, or at the beginning of next year at the latest. These planes would be Belgian Mirage 5 BR's, which the air force in that country is now replacing with U.S.-manufactured F-16's. These fighter-bombers were modified in accordance with the special Mirage System Improvement Program (MIRSIP), and have been equipped with new electronic and weapons systems. The SABCA [Belgian Company for Aircraft Manufacturing], an affiliate of Dassault, participated in this reequipment process. The MIRSIP Mirage 5 is equipped with modern electronic detection and attack systems. It has an Atar engine manufactured by the SNECMA [National Aircraft Engine Research and Manufacturing Company], which enables it to exceed double the speed of sound. It can transport up to four tons of bombs and air-to-air missiles. [passage omitted]
