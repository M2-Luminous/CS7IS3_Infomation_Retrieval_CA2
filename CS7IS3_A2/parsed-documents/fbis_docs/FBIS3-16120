A subsidiary of Imatran Voima, IVO International, signed a general agreement worth almost 1 billion Finnish Markkas, which includes the modernization of several power plants in Russia, especially in the area of St. Petersburg. The main emphasis of the agreement is on modernizing the power plants, protecting the environment, and saving energy. Some of the projects will be financed by selling the saved energy to Finland. The Russian natural gas company Gazprom will, for its part, become a partner with a 25 percent share in a natural gas company, which will remain a subsidiary of the Neste concern. In addition, a new 20 year-old agreement on supplying natural gas was signed. This agreement will increase the imports of natural gas from the current 2.9 billion cubic meters to more than 4 billion cubic meters by the end of the decade. The increase in the imports of natural gas will make the extension of the natural gas network in Finland possible. Neste reports that industry especially and the producers of heating in heavily populated areas are interested in increasing the use of natural gas. At the end of his official visit to Finland, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will have a 24-hour holiday in Lapland. Chernomyrdin and his small retinue will fly to Kittilae [north western Lapland] by special flight. The hosts of Prime Minister and Madame Chernomyrdin's day in Lapland are Prime Minister Esko Aho and Madame Kirsti Aho. Chernomyrdin will fly directly from Kittilae to Moscow tomorrow afternoon.
