It will be a fight between the South African Communist Party [SACP] and anticommunists, a battle to influence the ANC on its future direction. This was said by a member of the SACP's politburo, Mr. Jeremy Cronin. Mr. Cronin, widely regarded as the party's chief ideologist, commented in an interview with RAPPORT on the SACP's aims and the accusation that the SACP controls the ANC. It is not true that the SACP manipulates the ANC, according to Mr. Cronin. I can truthfully say that a struggle is looming "for the heart and soul" of the ANC after the election. The SACP aims to persuade the ANC to broadly accept and carry out the principles of communism so that a unique form of communism can be applied in South Africa. "The best features of the systems adopted in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Red China should be included. The ANC and the SACP do not differ over short term issues, but we obviously have a long-term socialist perspective not shared by everyone in the ANC. We are unashamedly in favor of communism in South Africa as a medium and long-term solution. The best chance of applying socialism is to persuade the ANC on the issue. Some of our opponents, however, have a different agenda. They want to transform the ANC into a sort of social-democratic party. This means that it would be difficult to distinguish between the NP [National Party] and the ANC's policies, the free market system will remain, and the main parties will take turns governing." But the SACP is fighting tooth and nail so that the process of "democratization" does not to come to a halt, and for the ANC not to just accept some form of neoliberalism -- for this reason the struggle will be waged for the heart and soul of the ANC, according to Mr. Cronin. "We are standing on the eve of a very long and complicated struggle on the direction of change in South Africa. A time could arise when the alliance with the ANC could cost us more than it is worth and then we could take an independent course. There is nothing in the ANC's policy that the SACP wants to change, but there are worrying tendencies within the ANC against which we wage an open battle." On calls for the ANC to distance itself from the SACP, Mr. Cronin says: "The alliance has frightened off some people, but it has attracted far more. The SACP has given the ANC legitimacy in its struggle, in convincing some of its supporters that it is not selling out to government, and in this way it has been able to maintain unity within the ANC." Mr. Cronin emphasizes that no one should suspect the SACP of plotting to establish an undemocratic government in the country. The party is committed to a multiparty system, a human rights charter, an independent judiciary, free press -- all the characteristics of true democratic government. "We will raise the Red flag, but in a constitutional way." Change in Stance "The SACP has indeed changed its stance on many issues long associated with communism and should get the credit it deserves. Social and economic problems, however, should be addressed through a process of democratization." This democratization means greater powers to workers in, among other sectors, industry and agriculture. It does not necessarily mean the nationalization of industry and the expropriation of farms, but could include this. He has no problem with private ownership rights "on a small scale" but is nevertheless in favor of collective farming, according to Mr. Cronin. Through, for example, labor legislation and pressure on financial institutions, farmers can also be forced to grant more concessions to their workers. The South African Communist Party is not ashamed of the history of communism, even though it has "significantly" failed in the Eastern Bloc, and though huge faults were made under the banner of communism, says Mr. Cronin. "We believe that we are interpreting Marx more correctly that the former Soviet leaders. Besides, did Christians reject the Sermon on the Mount, for example, because apartheid was applied in the name of Christianity?"
