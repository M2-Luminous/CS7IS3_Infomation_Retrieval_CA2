FR940302-0-00010 FR940302-0-00005 The commentor advocates use of post hoc statistical verification measures for every type of certifiable action. Such a regime is impractical. For example, in the case of a relocation, it is impossible to collect statistical data from the new office location until the old office has been relocated there, and the office relocation can not legally occur until a relocation certification has been approved; yet the certification would be dependent on the statistical data. As contemplated by NWSEO, such a regime would impose extensive delays and costs on the modernization and clearly would be unreasonable. Statistical data must be collected over a long period of time after the restructuring actively has taken place to be statistically valid. The minimum time period that would be acceptable would be 1 year after the certifiable event. Comment 2 _The NWSEO contends that any relocation also constitutes a closure and, therefore, the criteria should be the same. Response _Congress specifically listed four separate types of actions that are to be certified and clearly stated that one, closures, could not take place until 1996. This scheme is clearly understandable. The proposed interpretation of NWSEO would effectively eliminate a ``relocation'' as a separate category of certifiable action. Relocation of an office is distinctly different from closure of an office. In the case of relocation, the same office continues to exist, albeit in a different location. The office continues to provide the same products and services to the same users in the same service area. In the case of a closure, the office ceases to exist as an entity; the responsibility for providing products and services and the service area is reassigned to another office, or split up among several other offices. Also, as the commentor notes, this interpretation would preclude the NWS from relocating any office until 1996. The legislative history of Public Laws 100&hyph;685 and 102&hyph;567 make it clear that one of Congress' overriding concerns was with the closure of offices as the NWS field office structure shrinks from 250 to 116. Before the new Weather Forecast Office (WFO) takes on full responsibility for its new larger area, statistical verification is appropriate. In the case of a relocation, no such considerations are present. Comment 3 _NWSEO comment states that the evidence from previous office moves is not an appropriate basis for certifying that relocating the Redwood City office will not lead to any degradation of service. Response _In essence, this comment repeats the arguments discussed above_the NWS cannot relocate this office until it has statistical verification and not until at least 1996 after AWIPS is installed. The NWS disagrees for the reasons stated.
