FR940802-0-00077 FR940802-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 204 and 641 [Docket No. 940536&hyph;4202; I.D. 041994B] RIN 0648&hyph;AG28 Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule and notice of OMB control number. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). Amendment 9 extends the current reef fish permit moratorium from its scheduled expiration on May 8, 1995, through as late as December 31, 1995. For the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery, Amendment 9 authorizes the collection of commercial landings data for the years 1990 through 1992 and the collection of information to identify certain participants. It also extends the red snapper endorsement system and its associated trip and landing limits from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995. The intended effects of this rule are to collect information needed to evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, to identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime, and to continue interim management measures until the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has an opportunity to implement longer-term measures. This rule also informs the public of the approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of two new collection-of-information requirements contained in this rule and publishes the OMB control number for those collections. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994, except that the amendment to §204.1(b) and §§641.7(ee) and 641.10 are effective July 27, 1994, through October 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Sadler, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP, which was prepared by the Council, and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The rationale for the measures in Amendment 9 and for the additional changes to the regulations proposed by NMFS was included in the proposed rule (59 FR 27258, May 26, 1994) and is not repeated here.
