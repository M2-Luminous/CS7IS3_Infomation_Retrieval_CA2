"A common way forward with a certain section of the Left." The enemy? "This government." [National Alliance leader] Fini? "A street-peddler of the new Right." Buontempo? "A new reference point, perhaps." What about immigrants? "They should be educated and sent back home." To this must be added the naziskins, the possible formation of a new fascist right-wing party, the articles appearing in FRIGIDAIRE, and the unbearable odor of anti-Semitism. This is Maurizio Boccacci, the 37-year-old leader of "Political Movement," which was outlawed through the law against fascism. When he is speaking away from the TV cameras he dispenses with his declamatory and militant demeanor, and adopts the more subdued tones of a self-made theoretician. Strikingly -- and disturbingly -- intelligent, he is riding the wave of nihilistic discontent currently sweeping through Rome's suburban slums. Solidarity with the five thugs who were arrested for beating up an immigrant and three Italians on the Ostia-Rome railway line has been the response of this "recooked capital," to use one of [film director] Pasolini's phrases. Boccacci is cashing in on a consensus which does not seem to be merely coincidental. [Chianura] As on other occasions, you have expressed your solidarity with the aggressors, rather than with the victims. This is not surprising. Still, the question is: Why do people now show solidarity with those who are violent? [Boccacci] You will never understand this until you know how young people live in a slum like this. [Chianura] You tell us. [Boccacci] A vacuum. Can you imagine absolute vacuum? The despair of living in slums with no future. The wish to emerge from this vacuum and this despair. [Chianura] O.K., but it is not only young people who are attacking blacks. Their parents are involved too. Are they all sympathizers of yours? [Boccacci] Whether our ideas are close, I cannot say. Certainly we share the same needs. This is why official politics has no say in these sections of town. [Chianura] Whereas you in the "Political Movement" do have a say. However, your group has been outlawed. [Boccacci] The movement has been disbanded, but not the area. [Chianura] How do you strive to fulfill these "shared needs?" [Boccacci] To begin with, our action against drugs is very strong. Apart from that, we have set up cultural and sports centers in the slums where nothing of the sort existed before. Furthermore, we aim to safeguard the rights of the people who live in those areas. [Chianura] Safeguard in what sense? [Boccacci] In the sense that first come Italians, and secondly immigrants, who will be tolerated if there are not too many of them. [Chianura] How many is "too many?" [Boccacci] When their numbers exceed the resources that local government can use for their integration. [Chianura] After which, you will proceed to some "cleansing?" [Boccacci] We do not do any cleansing. However, exasperation reaches unbearable levels. We want immigrants to become integrated. They must either become integrated -- among other things, through social welfare provision -- or go back home after studying here. In this way, they will be able to contribute to development in their own countries. [Chianura] What happened after you were disbanded? [Boccacci] I may seem presumptuous, but we grew. We are now 500. [Chianura] Where do you meet, given that your branch offices have been closed down. [Boccacci] They thought that by pulling down a shutter they could shut us up too. But all we need is a square or a bar to meet. They made a crass mistake. They turned us into a myth. And now people like us even more. [Chianura] Do you persist in your attacks on the Jewish world? [Boccacci] I have the honor of having started the tendency to historical revisionism in Italy. We have shattered a taboo. But we are not anti-Jewish, we are anti-Zionist. Even the far Left, although they do not agree with us 100 percent, are beginning to say: They are not altogether wrong. [Chianura] What sort of far Left are you speaking of? [Boccacci] If you read the May issue of the monthly FRIGIDAIRE you will find an article, written by an independent commentator, dealing with economic globalism and racism, and in which self-determination is considered a fundamental issue. (In fact, the article in question is rather far removed from the Political Movement's positions -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) [Chianura] Who is your worst enemy at the moment? [Boccacci] Undoubtedly the present government. It is a liberal-capitalist government, which is exactly the opposite of fascism. It is easier to establish a rapport with serious-minded forces within the far Left than with such a system. [Chianura] However, Gianfranco Fini is part of this government. [Boccacci] Look here, we and him are on opposite sides. I have known him for some time and I can assure you that he has never been a fascist. He speaks of the good things that were done until 1938, but true fascists have fond memories of the march on Rome and the Social Republic [of Salo], more so than of the Twenty Years [of fascist rule] understood as the exercise of power. Fini is more a right-wing conservative leader, representing the bourgeoisie, the Christian Democrats. He has nothing to do with the revolutionary Right. [Chianura] Fini will send you a telegram to thank you. However, now that National Alliance [AN] exists, what will you do? Will you try to take over the MSI [Italian Social Movement]? [Boccacci] The MSI must remain faithful to its origins. [Chianura] Otherwise? [Boccacci] Otherwise we will build a movement capable of recovering this heritage. [Chianura] Another party? Possibly with Buontempo in it? [Boccacci] He may become a point of reference for this new formation.
