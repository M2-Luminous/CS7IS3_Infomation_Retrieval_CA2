ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard published, under this docket number, a notice of meeting and of availability of a study on the safety of towing vessels. Now the Coast Guard has added topics to the agenda of that meeting: (1) Radar-observer training for operators of uninspected towing vessels; (2) Coast Guard inspection of towing vessels; (3) manning of towing vessels; (4) pilotage requirement for operators of towing vessels; (5) and evaluation of regulations on retesting mariners. The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on the new topics as well as on the original agenda. DATES: (1) The meeting will still take place on Monday, April 4, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (2) Public comments on the agenda as enlarged will still be accepted until May 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: (1) The meeting will be held at the Coast Guard Headquarters Building, room 2415, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC. (2) Two copies of public comments should be forwarded to: Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council, CGD 94&hyph;014, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (G&hyph;LRA. 3406), 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Stewart Walker, Project Manager, G&hyph;MVP&hyph;5, (202) 267&hyph;2705, Division of Merchant Vessel Personnel, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, U.S. Coast Guard. Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994, to consider the study, ``Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels'' conducted by the Coast Guard, and will seek public comment on the recommendations identified in the study. The Coast Guard may use the study, along with public comment, to develop rules. Of particular interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are measures that could provide the necessary means to, and improve the navigational ability of, the operator; these measures include requiring the carriage of charts, publications, and radar, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer. The Coast Guard recognizes that there are insufficient facilities for radar-observer training immediately available to accommodate all currently licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTVs). Therefore, the Coast Guard is contemplating for these OUTVs: (a) An interim, short-term, training program, required soon, followed by (b) a more extensive program leading to an endorsement as radar observer, required on or before the scheduled license renewal. The Coast Guard is contemplating for new applicants, only the more extensive program. Comments on the practicality and utility of these requirements, their costs, the content of both interim and extensive courses, the length of time appropriate for implementation, and the administrative burden would be especially helpful. Four of the topics that the Coast Guard has added_inspection, manning, pilotage of towing vessels, and evaluation of retesting regulations_it added because of Congressional interest. This arose during the Secretary of Transportation's testimony before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation, House of Representatives, on March 3, 1994. The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should provide two copies, include their names and addresses, identify the study by docket number CGD 94&hyph;014, and give the reason for each comment. Each person wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. Dated: March 10, 1994. J.F. McGowan, Captain, U.S. Coast Guard, Acting Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection.
