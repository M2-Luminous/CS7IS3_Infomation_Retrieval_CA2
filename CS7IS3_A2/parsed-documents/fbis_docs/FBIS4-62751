Moscow time today. The personnel of over 90 per cent of civil aviation enterprises from all over Russia, beginning from Kaliningrad in the extreme west of Russia to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in the Far East, have confirmed their intention to participate in the strike, ITAR-TASS learned from the strike headquarters. The protest action began on Tuesday when Moscow pilots staged pickets outside the building of the State Duma. The strikers hope to make the government meet their demands which were formulated in a package of documents which had been submitted to the government for consideration in February. President of the trade union of Russian Pilots, Alfred Malinovsky, told ITAR-TASS that they suggest lifting unjustified tariffs for transportation imposed on civil aviation and introducing an efficient system of non-cash payments. He pointed out that it is important to create an employment fund for the aviation personnel to promote that experienced pilots remain on staff of civil aviation enterprises, at present, around 7,000-8,000 experienced pilots aged from 27 to 37 are facing redundancies, Malinovsky said. Among other demands pilots propose to introduce a new aviation code to meet international rules, ensure the safety of flights, normal pensions for pilots and their social insurance. "All these problems are quite solvable and part of them might be resolved within a few months. However, the problem of pensions should be settled until May 18. Since it requires no particular modifications in the legislature or additional funds. But despite all our efforts, the authorities declined to open a dialogue with us to discuss our demands," Malinovsky said. Pilots engaged in sanitary aviation, air search teams and some other kinds of civil aviation are not taking part in the strike.
