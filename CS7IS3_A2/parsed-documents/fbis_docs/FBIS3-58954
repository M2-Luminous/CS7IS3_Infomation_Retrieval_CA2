Mancino offered to quit saying that Rome prosecutors had gathered documents which could lead to his being investigated in connection with the Sisde (intelligence service) affair involving corruption in the funding of the secret services. The documents in question had been sent to the three investigating judges who could launch legal proceedings against him, officials said. But Ciampi said in a statement that he had "full confidence" in Mancino, adding that the transfer of documents for consideration by the judges "is an obligatory measure, which does not constitute a formal charge." Mancino was implicated in the Sisde affair along with three former interior ministers, including current Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, by former members of the secret services.
