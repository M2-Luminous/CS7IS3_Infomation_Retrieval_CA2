This was what Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and secretary of the CPC Central Committee Committee of Politics and Law, repeatedly stressed during his inspection tour of Jiangsu. From 8 to 16 June, Comrade Ren Jianxin inspected Jiangsu and chaired the national conference on comprehensive management of public security in rural areas. Accompanied by Li Peiyou, president of the Jiangsu Higher People's Court, Ren Jianxin inspected Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Nanjing during and after the conference [hui hou 2585 0683]. He also had meetings with local party and government leaders and comrades of law enforcement departments, heard briefings, had informal meetings with the local police, and gave important speeches. In his speeches, Ren Jianxin urged law enforcement departments to continue to uphold the "crackdown" principle and by no means waver or slacken their efforts. He said: Proceeding from the actual state of public security, we must constantly sum up our experience, intensify our crackdown measures, increase the crackdown intensity, and, according to law, harshly and promptly crack down on crimes which jeopardize public security. He added: We must earnestly follow through with the guidelines laid down by the recent national conference on comprehensive management of public security in rural areas. He said: Comprehensive management of public security is a great innovative undertaking China has launched to maintain social stability. Law enforcement departments must create a good social environment through cracking down on crime and comprehensive management of public security. Ren Jianxin pointed out: We must proceed with the fight against serious economic crimes. During the second half of the year, law enforcement departments must work in close coordination with various other departments in cracking down on major economic crimes, especially corruption, bribery, financial fraud, and smuggling. To deepen the anticorruption struggle, we must publicize those major cases as soon as they have been prosecuted and verdicts on them have been announced. Wherever his inspection tour took him, Ren Jianxin stressed: "We must enforce the law seriously, handle all cases impartially, and firmly combat local protectionism." He said: During my current inspection tour, I have been informed by various quarters in all places that local protectionism is serious. We must attach great importance to this problem. He added: If we cannot enforce law impartially and if we tolerate local protectionism, not only will we fail to protect local economic interests, but we will also infringe the interests of the state, and even impair our own image in international economic relations and trade. Ren Jianxin pointed out: While we want to open wider to the outside world and bring in more foreign capital, we must have a stable social environment, good technology, and a good infrastructure; moreover, we must also have an effective legal system. We must impartially handle economic disputes at home as well as those disputes involving foreign concerns, and we must protect the legitimate rights and interests of various parties concerned on an equal footing according to law. "Managing the police strictly and building stronger police force contingents" is another priority which Ren Jianxin underscored during his inspection tour in Jiangsu. He said: We must firmly combat the unethical conduct of a small number of law enforcement personnel. Law enforcers who have violated law and discipline must be firmly dealt with. Effective measures must be devised to increase the fighting power of law enforcement personnel so that they will become the bulwark on which the party and the people can depend and which can maintain social stability.
