This gives Jordan the green light to reopen the branches of its banks in the occupied territories under joint supervision of the Central Bank of Jordan and the Palestinian Economic Council. The two sides have also agreed to use the Jordanian dinar as the main currency, along with other Arab and international currencies, and to establish banks for development in the fields of housing, industry, agriculture, and investment. The two sides committed themselves to holding meetings, as soon as possible, of the six joint committees, which have been frozen for some time. This agreement was reached following three days of continuous meetings, during which journalists heard arguments and discussion. The Jordanians insisted on obtaining a serious PLO commitment to coordinating stands in all fields, particularly the economic field. The results of these meetings have come as a compromise solution in light of the PLO's refusal to sign a joint economic agreement, which has been ready for more than two months. The two sides have simply committed themselves to the broadlines of future policies, leaving to the joint committees the task of drafting the details of agreements in the near future.
