Andrey Kozyrev has personally invited Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to come to Moscow. In the West his name has become a synonym for "Serb aggression" and he is considered "the number one defendant" in the future international trial of Yugoslavia war criminals. He will arrive in Moscow at the beginning of next week. This sensational piece of news was reported to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent Sergey Tsekhmistrenko in an exclusive interview by the president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, the main "culprit" for the Balkan triumph. The conversation took place immediately after yesterday's session of the Federation Council, where Mr. Churkin made a statement during the debate on sending an additional Russian troop contingent to Bosnia. In his opinion, Russia, having blocked the execution of NATO's ultimatum, saved not only Sarajevo but the North Atlantic bloc itself from an inevitable ground war in the Balkans. [passage omitted] What lies ahead? According to Mr. Churkin, Russia intends to exploit the success. In this context he welcomes the Federation Council's decision to send an additional 300-strong contingent to the conflict zone which will be deployed not only to Sarajevo but also other hot spots (the results of the discussion, in the diplomat's opinion, point to the first indications of a democratic consensus on foreign policy emerging). The dialogue with the Serbs will also be raised to a basically new level, and in this sense Karadzic's upcoming visit can be seen as only a first sign that could be followed by Moscow's de facto recognition of Slobodan Milosevic (up to now his relations with Yeltsin have been rather cool). Mr. Churkin said preparations are under way for a summit meeting of "great power" leaders (on Yeltsin's initiative). In his words, the West has supported this idea while the debate at present is centered around the "format of the meeting:" whether it will be attended by five (as Yeltsin proposed) or more leaders. At this point KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator differs with the deputy minister, believing that there is far from universal support for Yeltsin's idea in the West while considerable efforts are yet to be undertaken to make sure that Vitaliy Churkin's hopes are translated into life. And his own efforts will also be essential here. May God help him!
