In an interview with Interfax, he said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was also involved in discussion about delays in adopting this year's budget. Rybkin said although the budget bill should have been discussed by the Duma in January, the government would table it only next week. "This means the Duma will be unable to approve a budget for the second quarter of this year", he said. Rybkin said that three possible options of adopting the budget were discussed. One is a special law. Next, the suspension of some articles of the law on emergency measures. And finally, to go on as usual, in which case, he said "we will need at least two or three months to approve the budget which means a repeat of the situation of 1992-1993 when Russia had to survive without a budget". However, Rybkin declined to say which of the three options was best. "Sometimes it seems that a short cut is the best solution. I do not know if that is true. The issue will come under discussion by the Duma Council today", he said.
