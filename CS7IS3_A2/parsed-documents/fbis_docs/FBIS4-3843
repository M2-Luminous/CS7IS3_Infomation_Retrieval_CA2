Akashi told reporters that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from Gorazde and allow UN peacekeeping troops to deploy in the area after more than nine hours of talks. The truce was to take effect at midday local time (1000 GMT). "Dr Karadzic has expressed his agreement for this ceasefire to take effect at 12 O' Clock tomorrow", Akashi said. In the NATO ultimatum statement issued earlier today, NATO warned Serbs to stop offensive and withdraw their forces three kilomiters from the center of Gorazde by 001 GMT on Sunday or face allied air raids to protect the UN designated "safe haven." Serb political leader Karadzic said to reporters that relations had been repaired with the Unprofor after nearly collapsing following NATO air raids against Serb positions near Gorazde on April 10 and 11. "This agreement has put our relationship with Unprofor fully back on track," Karadzic said. Although making no specific reference to the NATO ultimatum, Karadzic said the model used to bring a ceasefire to Sarajevo in February had been applied to Gorazde. Akashi had brokered a ceaseifre agreement for Gorazde earlier in the week but Serb shelling attacks continued unabated.
