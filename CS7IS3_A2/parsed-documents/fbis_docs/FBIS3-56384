At a news conference in Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow Friday [14 January], Kravchuk recognized that the deputy to the State Duma Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been legitimately elected by Russian people, but he called him a dangerous phenomenon from the point of view of the concept he declares. The Ukrainian President said that the difference should be seen between the declarations of ideas and their implementation. He called on the Russian and Ukrainian Democrats to unite to nip in the bud the political movement led by Zhirinovskiy, even though the movement is already represented in parliament. This movement is dangerous for everybody, not solely for Ukraine, said Kravchuk. There is no need to think that only Ukraine will be the victim of nationalism if it wins in Russia, he said.
