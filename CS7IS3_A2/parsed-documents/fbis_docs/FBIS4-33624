The PRD's measures range from holding new elections, in which all political parties will participate, to holding elections at the most conflicting voting tables. PRD leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez requested an honest count of void and contested (embargoed) votes and an explanation of the evident inclusion of voters from the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which is affiliated with the "Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance. These voters allegedly voted with only their personal identification and electoral numbers. He also recommended determining the difference between the number of voters included on the voting lists delivered to the political parties and the number of voters included on those lists delivered to the electoral tables by the JCE and to investigate the alleged exclusion of voters. Pena suggested that independent, national, and foreign technicians advise the JCE on computer operations and that civilian society and Catholic Church personalities help in the count. The PRD leader urged Electoral Tribunal judges "to reestablish the original resolve of the Dominican people." The leader of the PRD and "Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance maintained that other ways to respect the people's resolve "while reestablishing the only truth that emerged from the 16 May elections" could include holding new elections with the participation of all political parties. Pena said complementary elections could be held where it is proven a large number of voters could not cast their votes. He added, however, "the PRSC personal identification card factory will have to be closed" in order to meet this goal. He accentuated his allegation of fraud during the 16 May elections, thereby noting the country is facing an "electoral coup d'etat" to curtail the Dominican people's right to freely elect their rulers. The Dominican Republic has immersed itself in endless arguments and accusations of fraud, which are keeping the country bogged in economic uncertainty and a suspension of such productive activities as tourism and free zones.
