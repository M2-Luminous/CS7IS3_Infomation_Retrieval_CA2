The 9 June issue of the Ljubljana independent daily DELO reported that the day after his return from Zagreb, Kucan told reporters at a Ljubljana news conference that his visit had been "useful" and that he had achieved his "goal" -- to give impetus to Slovene-Croatian negotiations on unresolved bilateral issues, which range from border disputes to stagnating economic relations. Although the presidents did not try to find "concrete" solutions to the specific problems, Kucan mentioned as particularly aggravating issues the Piran Bay dispute and deteriorating trade relations. He said that the best solution would be to compromise or, absent an agreement, accept the status quo. The worst possible option, in his opinion, would be "to ignore the problems" or "force unilateral solutions." He remarked that he was not "completely convinced" that the Slovene Government was aware of the importance of Slovenia's relations with its neighbor or that it had formulated a strategy for dealing with the unresolved issues. Kucan stressed the importance of Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic's scheduled July visit to Ljubljana, during which he and his Slovene counterpart Janez Drnovsek will probably tackle the major problems: the border in the Piran Bay, the construction of the Phyrn highway, the Ljubljanska Banka's debt to Croatian depositors, numerous property claims by nationals of both countries, the Krsko nuclear power plant, and the trade decline. In Kucan's view, the upcoming Slovene-Croatian talks should be guided by the following principles: to seek "just" and "mutually satisfying" solutions and to respect the "equality" of the two partners. Kucan expressed willingness to take part in formulating the Slovene positions in preparation for the July meeting, DELO reported. In the same issue of DELO, commentator Veso Stojanov assessed Kucan's meeting with Tudjman as "above all, a useful exchange of opinions" on how to get Slovene-Croatian relations out of their dead-end street. While he agreed with the official statements that the normalization of relations is "of vital interest to both countries," Stojanov suspected that "threats from Rome" against both countries also played a part in the talks, since it is important for Slovenia and Croatia to formulate a joint strategy toward Italy. Stojanov noted that the approach of the tourist season makes it especially urgent for Croatia that tensions be removed. At the same time, he criticized the Slovene Government, especially the Foreign Ministry, for lacking a foreign policy strategy, reflected in "complete indifference" toward solving the problems with Croatia. In an earlier commentary published in the 8 June DELO, Stojanov questioned whether Kucan's unofficial visit to Croatia would contribute to better cooperation, while agreeing with Tudjman's and Kucan's statements that the present relations between Slovenia and Croatia "do not suit the interests of either state." Stojanov pointed out that the short history of Slovene-Croatian relations "is full of meetings and negotiations at different levels -- disputed issues, however, remain unresolved." Stojanov blamed the impasse mostly on a "lack of interest by the neighbors or their nonobservance of agreements and promises." In his opinion, the talks can be judged successful only when "Zagreb, in fact, shows a readiness to normalize relations with Ljubljana." A commentary in the 8 June issue of the Maribor (Slovenia) daily VECER stated that President Kucan had to show "firmness" in his talks with President Tudjman because Slovene foreign policy toward Croatia had been "by and large unsuccessful," resulting in quarrels and finger-pointing on the Slovene domestic political scene. An important new development pointed out by the commentator is the fact that, from now on, Slovenia will not "stand by idly" if Croatia attempts to "further complicate already serious problems," as Kucan, according to VECER, told Tudjman, who has the final say in Croatia. The 9 June issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK noted the good will of both sides toward solving Slovene-Croatia problems, "if not out of great love," then out of common political and economic interests, among which VJESNIK listed the wish of both countries to be integrated into the European Union and a perceived common threat from Italy regarding Istria. The announced visit to Slovenia by Prime Minister Valentic was viewed by VJESNIK as a step toward improving Croat-Slovene relations. The independent Rijeka daily NOVI LIST, in its 9 June issue, was critical of both sides, for extolling their own virtues and arguing over a "dry river bed," forgetting that they both live in the shadow of Italy, "an unpredictable neighbor." The 8 June issue of the Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA predicted that the "two presidents will not find any concrete solutions," not only because the Slovene president has less authority to negotiate than his Croatian counterpart but also because Slovene-Croatian relations have been neglected and stalled by both sides for a long time. The paper said it would consider the meeting a success if both sides expressed a willingness "to resolve the problems," such as the border and property issues, and "to create a good atmosphere," which would then lead to meetings of expert groups and meetings between Valentic and his Slovene counterpart, Janez Drnovsek.
