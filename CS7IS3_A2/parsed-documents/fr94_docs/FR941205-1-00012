FR941205-1-00012 FR941205-1-00003 The Prompt Corrective Action statute and the OTS's implementing PCA Rule prohibit savings associations from declaring any dividend or making any other capital distribution if, following the distribution, the institution would fall within any of the three undercapitalized categories. A limited exception to this prohibition permits the OTS to approve the repurchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of shares or ownership interests by an undercapitalized institution in connection with the issuance of additional shares in at least an equivalent amount if that distribution will reduce the institution's financial obligations or otherwise improve the institution's financial condition. The OTS proposes to incorporate this limited exception into its capital distribution rule and to add the requirement that the distribution be consistent with an institution's capital restoration plan. Thus, with respect to a savings association that is, or post-distribution would be, undercapitalized, the OTS will approve an application to make a capital distribution only if the distribution meets the criteria for the limited statutory and regulatory exception described above and is consistent with the association's capital restoration plan. When considered in the context of the capital restoration plan, the proposed distribution must be consistent with safe and sound operation and must not hinder the association from achieving any increased levels of capital required to meet the OTS's capital standards as certain statutory ``phase-in'' schedules take effect. 7 The OTS notes that, since enactment of the PCA statute, it has authorized use of the limited exception principally to provide incentives to private investors in recapitalization transactions where, at the conclusion of the entire transaction, the institution was adequately capitalized or better. 7 The statutory authority for certain savings associations to include ``qualifying supervisory goodwill'' in core capital expires on December 31, 1994. 12 U.S.C. 1464(t)(3)(A). After June 30, 1996, savings associations will not be permitted to include in capital any portion of their investments in and extensions of credit to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank. Id . at 1464(t)(5)(D). The OTS will use the same application procedure and will apply the same approval standards with respect to savings associations in ``troubled condition.'' ``Troubled condition'' would be defined in the rule to mean the condition of any savings association that: (1) has a composite rating of 4 or 5 under the OTS's examination rating system; (2) is subject to a capital directive, a cease and desist order, a consent order, a formal written agreement, or a PCA directive relating to the safety and soundness or financial viability of the association, unless otherwise informed in writing by the OTS; or (3) is informed in writing by the OTS that it has been designated in ``troubled condition'' based on its current financial statements, report of examination, or limited scope review.
