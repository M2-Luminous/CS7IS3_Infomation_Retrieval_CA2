Suddenly, however, by what may be deducted from the attitude of -- paradoxically -- the country that most struggled for the approval of the Uruguay Round -- that is, the United States -- we can see that the danger has not been averted. The Democrat U.S. Government, under the pretext of liquidating protectionist practices of other countries, refuses to solve its conflicts within the World Trade Organization [Organizacao Mundial de Comercio -- OMC] which in April will replace the GATT by will of its members who want to upgrade the authority of this international organization. We knew that a Democrat administration would strengthen U.S. protectionism. Lacking the force of Reagan, President Bush could not withstand the Democrats in Congress and ended by imposing trade retaliations on countries like Japan, India, and Brazil. Until now the so-called Super 301 has never been used, but Washington will now apply it against Japan, which refuses to remove some of its subtle barriers against the entrance of foreign products. The U.S. reaction follows President Clinton's decision not to open further to international trade, especially in the field of services. The determining factor, however, was the publication of trade statistics by regions in 1993. In 1993 the United States, whose exports increased 3.7 percent and whose imports increased 8.9 percent, registered a trade balance deficit of $115.777 billion -- some 37 percent up on the previous year. It must be pointed out that this was not the biggest negative trade balance ever registered in the United States -- it reached $152 billion in 1987, a year when Washington needed support from its allies against the USSR and when it was attempting to avoid a trade war that could weaken the unity of the anti-Communist bloc. The most serious issue is that with $59.3182 billion, Japan was responsible in 1993 for 51.2 percent of the total international trade deficit of the United States. It is interesting to point out that after Japan comes the People's Republic of China, the future "big" trader of Asia, with whom the U.S. has a trade deficit of $22.7677 billion. Washington wants the government in Tokyo to give up a type of protectionism that goes against international law. We recently observed an example of Japanese behavior when the Japanese Government opened the borders to foreign rice. No one in the country bought the imported rice even though it was cheaper, thus demonstrating the Japanese people's great solidarity with its farmers. This does not mean, however, that arguments about what can be considered abuses (which certainly exist) within Japanese protectionism, should be avoided at the OMC. By attempting to assume a bilateral trade policy, the United States is -- without recognizing that an international organization and not its president should decide if a trade partner is violating the GATT norms or its spirit -- encouraging a conflict. This kind of isolation on Washington's behalf is a kind of imperialism which may not be very well received by other countries. It must also be pointed out that the United States has been arrogant toward Japan, which is experiencing a difficult moment both in the economic and political field. The best results cannot be attained through bilateral negotiations based on power positions, especially regarding Japan which is now becoming aware of its political force... We must add that not all U.S. citizens support the application of sanctions against Japan which, after Canada, is the second biggest client of the United States -- buying from it $47 billion worth of goods and which is also its second supplier -- by which it has been of service to the United Sates by forcing it to increase productivity. It must be pointed out that the sanctions announced will not produce an immediate effect: The first list of products that will be object of sanctions will be published by the end of September. Only then will the Tokyo government react by imposing restrictions on U.S. products -- probably agricultural products, which will harm the U.S. primary production sector, which has great political influence. The issue is that taking into consideration the sanctions that will be effective as of October, the White House decision causes an immediate effect: It has brought down the prices of some agricultural products, among them soybean. It is possible that in the long term Brazil may gain from a trade war between these two large world powers, but we will be affected by the drop in some prices. We will then be able to see that only an international trade peace will be good for everyone in the long run.
