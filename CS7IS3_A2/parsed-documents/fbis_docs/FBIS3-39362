It must not be weakened under any circumstances." These were the words of the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, General Naumann, talking to officers of the Moscow General Staff Academy yesterday. He was trying to make his Russian audience appreciate that for the Europeans, the alliance is an opportunity to develop a "European security and defense identity." The Partnership for Peace program initiated by NATO should offer all states outside NATO an opportunity for cooperation, including Russia. In unmistakably clear words, Naumann said: "It is the NATO of 16 that decides on admitting new members." In his opinion, Russia cannot join. Talking to Russian Chief of Staff Kolesnikov, Naumann got the impression that the "the NATO Partnership for Peace program is viewed increasingly positive." In Naumann's view, the fact that the Russian military leadership seems to be taking the West's warnings to heart and is thinking of publishing the full text of the military doctrine adopted last autumn is almost sensational. During the German-Russian General Staff talks scheduled to be held in Bonn mid- March, the German side wants to show its appreciation for the Russians' openness by affording them unrestricted access to the Bundeswehr's secrete defense concept.
