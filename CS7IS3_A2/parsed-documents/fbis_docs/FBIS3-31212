The alternative, established on Thursday [10 February] within the government coalition major partner, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), proposes to form a government of a broader coalition without top politicians and with the participation of independent experts which would operate until early elections. Roman Kovac has joined the alternative, along with ten HZDS deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, also an HZDS member. Kovac said he expected the broad coalition government to draw inspiration from the political programs of the individual parties and to try to stabilize the economy and other vitally important spheres of society. He called cruel and unjust the statement made by Prime Minister and HZDS leader Vladimir Meciar that the new coalition's common denominator would be only "plundering." Although he is attracted by the ideas embedded in the HZDS statutes, he has the right to his own opinion and to defend it, Kovac said. He underlined he saw that realization of the appeal of the alternative was an acceptable way of deblocking the operation of the parliament. He does not find it either undemocratic or immoral, he added. "On the contrary, everybody bound to shoulder social and political responsibility, should fulfill it according to his (her) best conscience," Kovac says in the statement.
